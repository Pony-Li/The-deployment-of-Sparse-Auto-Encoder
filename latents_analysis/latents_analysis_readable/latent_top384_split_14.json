There are two theories of origin concerning “fetus in fetu”.\n\nOne theory is that the mass begins as a normal fetus but becomes enveloped inside its twin. The other theory is that the mass is a highly developed teratoma. The condition is estimated to occur in 1 in 500,000 live births.\n\nA fetus in fetu can be considered alive, but only in the sense that its component tissues have not yet died or been eliminated.\n\nThus, the life of a fetus in fetu is akin to that of a tumor in that its cells remain viable by way of normal metabolic activity.\n\nHowever, without the gestational conditions in utero with the amnion and placenta, a fetus in fetu can develop into, at best, an especially well differentiated teratoma; or, at worst, a high-grade metastatic teratocarcinoma.\n\nIn terms of physical maturation, its organs have a working blood supply from the host, but all cases of fetus in fetu present critical defects, such as no functional brain, heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, or urinary tract.\n\nAccordingly, while a fetus in fetu can share select morphological features with a normal fetus, it has no prospect of any life outside of the host twin.\n\nMoreover, it poses clear threats to the life of the host twin on whom its own life depends.\n\nParents of the boy appeal for help as they stated that their child who is having difficulty in walking and breathing needs to undergo immediate surgery to improve his condition.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nApril 14, 2016, 1:51 PM GMT / Updated April 14, 2016, 1:51 PM GMT By Chiara A Sottile\n\nBehind miles of chain link fence on the Texas State University campus in San Marcos, the remnants of the Aquarena Springs Resort sits crumbling. The old turnstiles that used to admit hundreds of thousands of people annually are still visible beneath years of overgrown weeds, but the gondola trams and observation tower are long gone.\n\nIn its heyday in the 1960s, '70s, and '80s, Aquarena Springs was one of the most popular tourist destinations in the state of Texas. People came from all over the world to see underwater mermaid performances and a swimming pig named \"Ralph.\"\n\n\"It's a piece of history. That whole era is gone,\" said longtime San Marcos resident and photographer Andy Heatwole, peering into the remains of the park.\n\n\"Not only will this not come back, but you're not going to have anything like it,\" he said, aiming his camera at what is left of a replica Spanish mission.\n\nAquarena Springs also offered a resort hotel — built in 1929 — and a submarine theater. But today, one attraction remains: the glass-bottom boat tours that skim the clear water of Spring Lake every half hour.\n\n\"There's a whole lot of action going on under this water,\" said Jerilyn Dutton, who brought her family from Westminster, Colorado for a boat ride.\n\n\"Look at that fish!\" said her daughter Addison, pointing through the glass pane into the blue deep.\n\n\"The glass bottom boats are one of the most significant educational tools we have,\" said Andrew Sansom, the Executive Director of the Meadows Center of Water and the Environment at Texas State University. He has overseen Aquarena's most recent transition into a nature center.\n\nEven without the pigs or mermaids, Sansom says the Meadows Center is still a \"globally significant site.\" The San Marcos springs are home to eight federally listed or endangered species.\n\nAs modern theme parks came into their own, kitschy Aquarena struggled to compete with their speedy roller coasters and high-tech animal performances.\n\n\"In today's terms, it was kind of like a mom-and-pop carnival. I mean, it was funky!\" said Sansom. \"But it was wonderful. I mean it was a family-oriented deal and you could get in a submarine and go to the bottom of the lake and watch a show.\"\n\nBut for those who visited the park at its peak, it will never be the same.\n\n\"I photograph it because it's a piece of my history,\" said Heatwole, who came as a kid. \"It was a really neat place, it just couldn't compete.\"\n\nJason Hunter, a photojournalist with WISN in Milwaukee, contributed to this report.

  "latent_212": "Adolescenti, alcol e droga (Afp)\n\nFino a un anno fa a Santa Severina, paese di 2mila anime in provincia di Crotone, i giovani liceali trascorrevano i loro pomeriggi a girovagare da un bar a un altro. Oggi recitano a teatro commedie e tragedie greche, si dedicano allo sport e ad altre attività culturali, e Santa Severina è diventata una piccola Islanda. Il riferimento non è casuale: il comune ha deciso infatti di partecipare al progetto islandese Youth in Europe, ramo di “Youth in Iceland”, con il quale il Paese dei ghiacci è riuscito in 20 anni a sradicare alcol e droga tra gli adolescenti trasformandoli in salutisti.\n\nIl lungo cammino di Santa Severina per diventare Reykjavik\n\nCon il giusto mix di divieti, un coinvolgimento totale nelle attività sportive e creative, uno stretto rapporto tra genitori e scuola e perfino un coprifuoco, la percentuale di giovani islandesi abituati alle sbronze è passata dal 48% del 1998 al 5% del 2016. Oggi l’Islanda fa scuola e offre a Paesi, città e municipalità, la possibilità di affidarsi ai propri consulenti e adottare il modello islandese.\n\nIn Italia, per ora, l’invito lo ha accolto solo Santa Severina. “Il comune ha deciso di candidarsi al progetto islandese nel 2015”, ha raccontato a Repubblica Roberta Caputo, responsabile del programma del piccolo borgo . Quando siamo stati scelti per partecipare, gli esperti sono venuti in paese per spiegarci come adottare il loro modello di prevenzione. Nell’ottobre 2015 abbiamo sottoposto il loro questionario a 50 alunni tra i 15 e i 16 anni del liceo classico Diodato Borrelli, l’unica scuola superiore di Santa Severina. E abbiamo inviato le risposte in Islanda”.\n\nNe è venuto fuori che i ragazzi non partecipavano ad attività sportive extrascolastiche e “impiegavano il tempo libero girovagando da una casa all’altra e da un bar all’altro. E così avevano una certa facilità di venire a contatto con l’alcol, sostanza che non viene avvertita come un problema né dai ragazzi né dai loro genitori”, racconta Caputo.\n\nPer gli esperti, la cura è semplice: “moltiplicare le attività gratuite per i ragazzi, dai tornei sportivi ai corsi teatrali, pur con i limiti di essere i una delle province più povere d’Italia”. A un anno di distanza “i ragazzi non girano più nei bar del borgo. Ma se bevono o meno lo scopriremo al prossimo questionario”, conclude la responsabile.\n\nIn Italia il record europeo di adolescenti fumatori\n\nIn Italia il fenomeno è allarmante: secondo l’ultimo rapporto del Centro europeo per il monitoraggio della dipendenza dalle droghe, è il Paese dell’Ue dove più ragazzi di età compresa tra i 15 e i 16 anni fumano. Il dato si aggira attorno al 37% contro il 21% della media europea, mentre il 21% degli adolescenti consuma alcol in modo eccessivo.\n\nDa una tesi di laurea, la rivoluzione anti-droga\n\nCome riporta uno studio pubblicato da Mosaic Science, in Islanda la rivoluzione anti-droga che oggi iniziò ufficialmente nel 1992 ma le basi erano state gettate molto prima e molto lontano, a New York da una tesi di dottorato di Harvey Milkman, professore di psicologia americano che oggi insegna all’università di Reykjavik. Lo studio di Milkman concluse che le persone consumano eroina o anfetamine a seconda della loro predisposizione nella gestione dello stress. Chi usa l’eroina vuole ottenere un effetto di stordimento, chi assume anfetamine cerca un effetto contrario. Mentre l’alcol è sedativo. Dopo la pubblicazione della tesi, Milkman fu inserito nel team di ricercatori ‘arruolati’dall’Istituto Nazionale statunitense per l’abuso di droghe. L’idea di fondo della ricerca era questa: “Perché non ottenere lo stesso effetto di ‘sballamento’ attraverso attività che incidono chimicamente sul cervello senza gli effetti deleteri delle droghe?”\n\nIl metodo Milkman conquista l'Islanda\n\nNel 1991 Milkman fu invitato per la prima volta in Islanda per parlare dei suoi studi. Un anno dopo, i ragazzi di età compresa tra i 15 e i 16 anni di tutte le scuole furono sottoposti a un questionario. L’esperimento fu ripetuto nel 1995 e nel 1997. Questi alcuni quesiti:\n\nHai mai bevuto alcolici?\n\nSe si, quando è stata l’ultima volta?\n\nTi sei mai ubriacato?\n\nHai mai fumato?\n\nSe si, quante sigarette fumi in un giorno?\n\nQuanto tempo trascorri con i tuoi genitori?\n\nChe tipo di attività svolgi?\n\nI risultati furono allarmanti: il 25% dei giovani islandesi fumava ogni giorno, mentre il 40% si era ubriacato l’ultima volta appena un mese prima. Non solo. Lo studio aveva portato a galla un aspetto fondamentale: coloro che praticavano sport, frequentavano corsi, avevano un ottimo rapporto con i genitori erano meno inclini ad assumere alcol e droghe.\n\nDal coprifuoco allo sport, la ricetta di ‘Youth in Iceland’\n\nSulla base dei risultati dello studio di Milkman e del sondaggio, il governo islandese avviò un programma nazionale di recupero - il Youth in Iceland – che coinvolse anche i genitori e la scuola per quella che divenne una vera e propria rivoluzione culturale. Spendere molto tempo di qualità a casa, fu uno dei pilastri del programma. Ma anche le leggi furono modificate: via le pubblicità di bevande alcoliche e fumo, e divieto di acquisto di sigarette per i minori di 18 anni e di alcol per i minori di 20 anni. Agli adolescenti di età compresa tra i 13 e i 16 anni fu imposto, inoltre, il coprifuoco alle 10 di sera in inverno e a mezzanotte d’estate.\n\nMa, soprattutto, furono introdotte moltissime attività sportive e artistiche per permettere ai ragazzi di ‘fare gruppo’ e di ottenere quel senso di benessere psico-fisico che può dare una sostanza stupefacente. Tutti gli adolescenti furono inclusi nel programma, e per i meno facoltosi furono previsti degli incentivi statali.\n\nIslanda, caso unico in Europa\n\nTra il 1997 e il 2012 raddoppiò il numero degli adolescenti che praticava sport quattro volte a settimana e che trascorreva più tempo con i genitori. Di pari passo crollò la percentuale di ragazzi che assumevano alcol e droghe. Non solo in Islanda, in realtà, ma tra i Paesi europei è stato l'unico con un dato così marcato. E nessuna altra nazione ha saputo sostituire alcol e sigarette con lo sport. Nel Regno Unito, ad esempio, sembra che i giovani siano meno schiavi delle dipendenze perché chiusi in casa a fare in conti con la realtà virtuale.",
  "latent_232": "Mike: Hey Vitalik, thanks for coming on our show. Why don’t you start by telling us a bit about yourself?\n\nVitalik: I basically don’t really have a history of my own before I first joined the scene when I discovered Bitcoin, back in 2011. I was still in high school at the time and, at some point, I was browsing the internet. Actually, the first time, my dad told me about Bitcoin at some point early in March 2011. I thought, “Okay, it’s a currency. It has no intrinsic value, there’s no way it’s ever going to take off. A few weeks later, I heard about it again and I realized, “Hey, if I hear about something from two completely different sources, it’s at least worth investigating.”\n\nI did. I started browsing the Bitcoin forums. Came upon a guy who was paying people $5 an hour to go out to write articles for his Bitcoin blog. I started doing that. I sent him a message saying, “Hey, I’d like to write an article for you on microtransactions.” I did and a week later he sent me 5 BDC, which, back then, was $3.75. A good wage for three hours work. Continued for a while. Eventually, he ran out of money, so I invented this cool business model by which that particular Bitcoin blog would stay running. The way it works is that I would write two articles a week. We would release only the first paragraph of each one and we would say, “Okay, these articles are for ransom. We are only releasing them if people crowdfund 2.5 BDC into this Bitcoin address.”\n\nThat actually worked. That was my first interaction both with that particular decentralized currency and with the general idea that these kinds of platforms are cool for doing this kind of really rapid social and economic innovation. I was in university studying computer science full-time. At some point, I realized that I was doing cryptocurrency related things for basically over 30 hours a week, so dropped out, went into doing that full-time. Spent about six months traveling around the world, talking and visiting various different… Back then were Bitcoin communities because, back then, it was still very predominantly Bitcoin and there wasn’t this consciousness that crypto and blockchains are an interesting thing in and of themselves.\n\nI spent two months in this weird abandoned factory in Spain. Travelled around Europe, visited Israel. Eventually came upon a group of people that were actually trying to use blockchain technology for a much more broad set of applications. They were looking at escrows, very specific kinds of financial contracts. There’s this protocol called Mastercoin, which is trying to do a lot of those thing. I actually briefly joined the Mastercoin team as an informal consultant, came up with two new features for the protocol. Eventually, what I realized was that it really doesn’t make sense for the protocol to be coming up with these features, because people are just going to keep on coming up with new use cases every month.\n\nIt would be simpler to just have a programming language, so people can basically write whatever features they want. That was the core idea behind Ethereum. At one point, when I was in San Francisco, the thought came to me. I took a long three hour walk, formalized a lot of what were the basic concepts back then. Wrote a white paper, emailed it to a bunch of people. Some people came back saying, “Hey, this is a really cool idea, I’d like to join and maybe help out in the end, start actually developing the software for this.” The team coalesced over a couple of months. I’ve been basically doing that full-time ever since.\n\nEuvie: Can you tell our listeners in plain language what Ethereum does?\n\nVitalik: I’ve actually been changing the explanation every few months, I guess as we’ve been changing the emphasis on what Ethereum is about. Originally it was just meant to be a decentralized platform for financial contracts. Lately, I think we’ve been expanding in the thing that we’re trying to be is something closer to… Actually, one of our communications people, Vinay Gupta, describes it as being the world computer. The idea is that there exists this magic computer in the cloud and anyone can send programs to it, anyone can run programs on it. Those programs can talk to each other and, particularly importantly, you can trust that this computer will run the programs in the exact way that you specified them to run.\n\nVery simple, not even all that significant use case of this. Suppose that you want to be reminded of something in five years. You would create a program which, after five years, would be programmed to automatically release some kind of notification. Take this program, put it on the world computer, pay some kind of transaction fee. It’s guaranteed that five years later, it’s actually going to send you the notification. That’s guaranteed to happen and that’s even going to happen if any particular entity shuts down. It’s not the cast that, if Google shuts down, then the whole thing is going to break.\n\nThere is nothing that any particular entity can maliciously try to corrupt the execution in some fashion. It’s also completely transparent. Everyone can see everything that’s going on in the system. Just specific kinds of use cases for something like this. Currency is just a simple one, because it was the original blockchain use case. What is a currency? Basically, it’s just a program that maintains a balance sheet. The balance sheet might say something like, “I have $100 and you have $50.” If I want to send $20 to you, the I send a transaction and the program interprets the transaction, which is my balance to $80 and yours to $70. If, instead, I try sending $300, then, of course, the program’s going to reply, “Nope, you don’t have enough money, fail.”\n\nYou can take this kind of program, you can upload it to the world computer, and everyone who sees the program can be guaranteed that the program will continue working in some particular way. It’s like a very general and abstract metaphor for a very large number of categories for decentralization.\n\nEuvie: Do you want to explain why decentralization is really important? Obviously, a lot of people talk about it, but what are the actual benefits of decentralization versus a centralized system?\n\nVitalik: Sure. I think it’s a very important question, because now that we, all of a sudden, have the opportunity to decentralize a whole bunch of things, with blockchains you can decentralize the running of any kind of application. There is a bunch of other technologies, like torrent networks, that do the same thing for file sharing. People have been getting excited about things like the sharing economy, which is, “Anyone can be their own taxi company or be their own hotel in their spare time,” almost. First of all, there’s two kinds of decentralization that people need to think about. The first kind is what I call architectural decentralization, which basically means that the whole system isn’t technologically reliant on any single component. The way that the system runs is actually shared among a whole bunch of different technological parts. The second kind is political decentralization, which actually means that the system isn’t just controlled by a whole bunch of different pieces, but those pieces are actually under the administration under the local rule of a whole bunch of different people.\n\nArchitectural decentralization without political decentralization. One example is torrent networks. For example, the original torrent networks, things like BitTorrent and Kazaa, they’ve been around since about 2003. They’re really good for sharing files. Things like BitTorrent and Kazaa, they’re both architecturally decentralized, because the files are spread among a whole bunch of computers and this makes the network extremely robust. It actually makes it more efficient. It’s also politically decentralized because there’s no single thing that you can attack in order to shut it down. The interesting thing is that torrent networks as a technology, it turns out that they’re just so efficient for certain use cases that they’re sometimes even used in a completely centralized context.\n\nAs one example, there’s a whole bunch of online games like World of Warcraft, for example, where World of Warcraft periodically send patches – which are basically just big software updates to all of its users. Each patch might contain several gigabytes, because there’s often a whole bunch of new content. The question is, how do these patches get distributed? One option is everyone just downloads it from Blizzard servers. The problem is that would be really expensive for Blizzard. What Blizzard does is it uses the torrent network. Of course, it’s completely centralized, Blizzard decides what content gets distributed from a political standpoint.\n\nFrom an architectural standpoint, every single peer, every single computer in the system is helping in both the downloading and the uploading. That actually means that you’re taking advantage of all of the network’s resources. That actually allows the whole thing to happen much more efficiently. Blockchains are basically politically decentralized and architecturally decentralized. I guess the important difference is that, unlike torrent networks, blockchains don’t’ become more efficient by decentralizing them. You can’t actually get a higher transaction throughput, at least right now.\n\nThe big difference here is all of the other advantages of decentralizing – things like reliability and things like transparency and, what I call, political benefits that there’s no one particular group that you need to rely on for the whole thing to continue to work, those are the ones that take centre stage.\n\nMike: I think this is really cool that it takes the middle man out of a lot of different types of transactions and interactions. I’m curious as to how it could benefit certain types of middle men that actually need to be there that make the system better. I can’t exactly think of many examples, maybe you can. Can you think of examples where the middle man is actually important and how it could benefit them?\n\nVitalik: Practical example: Uber. It’s one of those social network services. The difference between Uber and taxi companies is that with Uber anyone can be a driver, anyone can be a consumer. It’s highly open on both sides. The middle man still exists. To some extent, the middle man is a bit of a greedy monopolist that’s taking far too large a fee for its own good. To some extent, also, it’s providing a very legitimate service. In this case, the specific service is basically that it’s being a reputation system. It’s providing a filtering service where it makes sure that customers are only interacting with drivers that are reliable, that have good ratings, that are not likely to be criminals and so forth.\n\nThat’s a service that people need. You can design a decentralized version of Uber. There is at least one project called La’Zooz that tries to do that. The thing is that in that kind of a system, you still need to have a way of actually performing that middle man functionality. You still need to have some kind of reputation mechanism, or some kind of quality assurance, or filtering, or whatever you want to call it, in order to buy a system to reward customers to being able to interact with drivers. Another more purely technical example. If you consider Skype. Originally, it was a fully peer to peer system. More recently, however, soon after Microsoft acquired Skype, Microsoft moved to this architecture where they had a bunch of super nodes. These super nodes are politically controlled by Microsoft.\n\nArchitecturally, of course, they already are decentralized and spread around the world. Depending on some degree of what your political ideology is, there’s two ways of looking at these super nodes. One way is that this is just Microsoft being corrupt and inserting themselves at the centre in order to be able to spy on everyone’s data more easily. The other is that, as it turns out, extremely decentralized networks actually aren’t all that efficient, because you need to send messages through a whole bunch of hubs. Having these really powerful hubs be involved in the process speeds things up. If the second viewpoint turns out to be closer to correct, then in a good decentralized replacement for Skype, you’d still need to have some concept of super nodes.\n\nWhat really excites me about this field of blockchain technology, and what I’ve been starting to call crypto economics, is the idea that what we’re actually doing is we’re combining a decentralized architecture with an economic system. The advantage of an economic system is now… Originally, 10 years ago, decentralization basically meant the only people participating in a system are amateurs. To some degree, even things like Wikipedia, which you can think of as being partially decentralized, have this ethos behind them that a really large collection of amateurs, the wisdom of the crowds and so forth, can do almost everything that a slightly controlled small group of experts can.\n\nSometimes that’s more true, sometimes that’s less true. The nice thing about crypto economics is that, in some circumstances, you actually have the ability to use economic incentive. People actually do have the ability to basically run some equivalent of a super node as a business. Inside of something like a decentralized Skype replacement, you could potentially architecturally set it up in such a way that anyone can run one of these super nodes and they’d collect some very tiny micropayments in exchange for running it. The system would, architecturally, look exactly the same way that Skype looks now, but from a political standpoint it would still have the benefits of being completely open source, being a completely open standard, and an open network, and not having the risk that one particular company is going to end up changing the protocol from under everyone’s nose after the fact at some point.\n\nSomething like Uber, it’s in some ways similar. You recognize that this desire for some kind of filtering system is a legitimate thing and you come up with ways of actually getting that information more efficiently from I guess decentralized sources. The most common idea behind a reputation systems is that if I trust person A and person A really trusts person B, then even though I might never have heard of person B I still actually have some proxy evidence that person B is reliable. There’s been this entire field of reputation systems for about 10 years, that tries to figure out how to most efficiently and unexploitably take advantage of that kind of data.\n\nEuvie: Yeah. Actually, in one of your other talks that I saw you talked about this, having some sort of a blanket reputation system that could apply to different tools and different platforms within Ethereum. Right now, for example, you have one reputation system that’s your credit rating, another one that’s your Uber rating, another one that’s your Air BnB rating, another one that’s your number of Twitter followers.\n\nVitalik: Exactly. The problem, of course, is if at some point you want to switch over from uber to Lyft, because Lyft might have lower fees or whatever else then, guess what, you lose your Uber reputation. These kinds of really high switching costs are potentially one of the problems and actually why I’m interested in this whole specific idea of trying to decouple reputation from everything else.\n\nEuvie: Yeah. I think also this platform specific reputation like we have with current systems is actually helping those systems monopolize people’s attention and their money, because the cost of switching can sometimes be very high, so people stay with a system that’s increasingly inefficient or charges high fees every year.\n\nVitalik: Yeah, completely.\n\nMike: Are you trying to create systems to transition people from these current monopolized systems into Ethereum, or is that something you’re just hoping that people will figure out on their own?\n\nVitalik: It’s interesting. We ourselves, as ethereum.org, can’t do everything, but we are involved as gardeners of parts of the system in a very weak sense. Things like the core for the Ethereum protocol for Mist, that’s something that we’ve been developing ourselves and that we’re going to continue to develop ourselves. Things that are built on top, things like reputation systems, some of these different decentralized applications, we personally know a lot of the people that are building them. A lot of them are building on Ethereum, a lot of them are sitting back and trying to be as generic and multi-platform as possible until they see what they should throw more weight behind.\n\nIn some of the cases, we’ve been supporting some specific efforts. In some cases, we just as individuals working inside the Ethereum project are interested in these areas and we help out on a lot of them. It’s a multi-stage thing I would say. Right now, the large part of our focus is on just building a platform and making sure that it’s good and that it’s easy to develop on. Once people see on top of this thing you can actually build your own Kickstarter clone in 20 minutes, then that’s when we see a lot more developer interest. As far as transitioning goes, to some degree we’re facing the same network effect problem that just about everyone else is facing.\n\nThere was a Facebook alternative called Diaspora that started appearing around 2010. For a brief period of time, there were people who were posting stuff on it and, for a brief period of time, it worked decently well. Eventually, it fizzled. Part of the reason was that they just didn’t have the ability to overcome the network effect. There’s multiple ways of dealing\n\nwith that problem. One of the ways is that, because we have Ethereum and we have this decentralized platform that’s trying to, to some degree, facilitate everything at once, it stands a much stronger chance than any particular isolated effort of having all these network effects reinforce each other and take over at the same time.\n\nThat’s one of the hopes that we’re putting our weight behind. In other cases, there’s all of the same ideas that just about every other case of network effect [inaudible , which basically involves making it easier for people to interoperate, making it easier for people to generally use multiple services at the same time, even providing some kind of transition paths. I would actually say that one of the benefits of decentralized technology generally is that when we actually start talking about how do you even move between one decentralized platform and another, because eventually people are going to start building continually better and better and better ones. Then, just because these platforms are so open, it’s very easy to make the connections and the links between them, and transition people over fairly easily.\n\nEuvie: Yeah. I think that’s really cool that you guys are inviting a lot of developers to come and build projects, so it’s not just one program that’s running, it’s a whole bunch of people doing all these different things. Which kind of makes it more resilient to change. I think people are more likely to stick around if they can improve on things as they get dated.\n\nVitalik: Yeah, I agree. One of the comments that I sometimes make about Ethereum is that, if you look at Bitcoin, the Bitcoin wallet, and the Bitcoin client, they’re synonyms. They refer to the exact same thing. In Ethereum, the Ethereum wallet is just one of the many applications that runs inside of the Ethereum client. The vision here is something much more abstract. We also have a lot of components other than just this world computer. A long-term vision is actually to build out something much closer to a full-scale decentralized application platform, and that would include things like the blockchain, it would include different kinds of decentralized data storage, decentralized messaging. The idea is to present all of these in a cohesive, combined package that makes it really easy to work with all of them at the same time.\n\nMike: I was looking up Ethereum the other day and found that you guys were, I think, the number three most funded crowdsourced campaign that has ever existed before. Can you tell me a bit about how you guys got your funding and how you posed it to the community?\n\nVitalik: Actually, when we first finished that campaign, we were number two. I think the Pebble Watch just beat us only last month. What we basically did – that actually we didn’t pioneer ourselves, it was originally the Mastercoin, the project I’d been working on before. What they did was they said, “Okay, we’re launching a new protocol and inside this new protocol there is a currency.” They basically said, “We are going to be issuing these initial master tokens by just selling them. You can buy 100 Mastercoin for a Bitcoin.” A few people had the ability to do that. There was a month-long sale during which they did. That’s how the entire currency got issued. Unlike Bitcoin, which issued everything to miners, Mastercoin actually lived on top of Bitcoin, so it didn’t need any miners.\n\nYou just had to distribute it somehow. For them, it raised $500,000 and then, because Bitcoin went up in value, it quickly grew to five million dollars. It works really well for them. We basically decided to apply the model for ourselves. In our case, back then, even still now, we’re using mining as a consensus algorithm. The idea here is that you have a whole bunch of computers everywhere in the world that are solving very hard – useless but very hard – mathematical problems. The sole point of these problems is to deliberately make it computationally very hard to add a block to the history of the system. The idea is that there exists this chain of blocks and each block represents the current state of the world computer and if you want to participate in updating it then you have the ability to just produce a block by spending a large about of time computing.\n\nIt’s the same model that Bitcoin used. Lately, we’ve actually been thinking of moving away from that model to something which is much more energy efficient, but that’s an upgrade that’s probably going to happen in maybe at the end of this year. We had mining but, even still, we decided that, “Hey, it’s a good idea to get money for this kind of project by selling the coins.” We basically said, “Anyone can buy Ether at the rate of 2,000 Ether per Bitcoin. There’s no limit.” We originally intended to start the sale in February, 2014. We ran into a bunch of legal issues, making sure it doesn’t fall to foul of things like banking and securities laws. It took us a while to do the legal work to make sure that we’re okay there.\n\nWe were thinking the sale would be in two weeks for a really long time. Eventually, it was actually in two weeks and the sale started at some point in the middle of July. People got the opportunity, they had the ability to go to our site, download our wallet, which is basically just the file containing the cryptographic key that you would use to later access your Ether. You could purchase Ether into your wallet and we would provide a Bitcoin address, you would send your Bitcoin to it. You wouldn’t get your Ether immediately, because Ether wouldn’t exist, but you would get a record in the blockchain and later we would run a script that would compile all the records in the blockchain to figure out how much Ether everyone has.\n\nPeople piled in. In the first day, I think we got a few thousand Bitcoins. By the end of the first two weeks, we got up to a total of somewhere around 12.5 million dollars. This, back then, actually made up the second largest crowdfunding campaign ever by a small margin. Eventually, it lasted for another four weeks. We received around 18 million dollars. Because the Bitcoin price was falling at the time, we never really had anything more than about 15 million dollars in our Bitcoin accounts. We had the money, we started using it immediately to pay salaries, pay developers, massively expand the team and working on getting Ethereum 1.0 out the door as soon as we can.\n\nEuvie: Very cool. Actually, one thing that you said got me thinking of a question. With Bitcoin, the way that I understand, the transaction is near instant. I wonder if, with this system, is it possible to have a delayed transaction? Why I’m asking that is because is debt possible in this kind of system, or is it intrinsically debt free?\n\nVitalik: You can definitely have a delayed transaction. I guess one really nice use case of that is recurring payments, if you want to pay someone $10 a month. In Bitcoin, the only way to do that is basically by using centralized services. Those things are like Coinbase that basically build recurring payments on top of Bitcoin. The way to do that is you send your money to Coinbase and Coinbase just shuffles it on for you. In Ethereum you could just write a script and your script would automatically send $10 every month. As far as debt goes, the problem with debt is that the system is fundamentally anonymous, anyone can create and account. If you were to create and account and your account had 1,000 Ether in it and you were to make a delayed transaction that would send 1,000 Ether later on, then there’s basically only two options.\n\nOne option is the 1,000 Ether is actually locked in that contract until you send it and the other option is that you have the ability to take your Ether out during the meantime but then, if you do, then once it comes time to send the 1,000 Ether then there wouldn’t be enough Ether and it would fail. If you have a debt to someone then, unless you have some identity outside the system that you can use in order to promise to repay, then fundamentally there’s nothing to stop you from just running away and starting a new identity.\n\nEuvie: How would you deal with this kind of problem?\n\nVitalik: There’s a bunch of groups that are trying to loans on the blockchain. Most of the time, they actually do involve things like reputation systems. Trying to use measurements that are… You can think of them as being like decentralized credit scores… Use these measurements to figure out which loan recipients are trustworthy and which ones are likely to pay you back.\n\nEuvie: On that note, I wanted to ask what other kinds of problems you envision happening in this sort of system, like fraud, for example, or companies trying to control large portions of the nodes. I don’t fully understand it, but like the 51 percent problem.\n\nVitalik: Yes. Yeah, as far as the bottom level consensus goes, the centralization issue is a huge issue. People are very concerned. In Bitcoin there’s about five or six of what are called mining pools, which are basically online entities that automatically produce blocks for you and basically tell you what block to mine. The reason why people subscribe to mining pools is, in part, because they provide more constant payouts. Instead of getting a very, very tiny chance of getting a really huge 25 BTC reward if you manage to mine a block, if you mine into a mining pool then you just get a very constant stream of payouts. There’s a few of them that control over half of the network.\n\nIt’s a risk but it’s a smaller risk because if those mining pools end up doing anything bad, then people can just switch to other ones. The larger risk is the fact that, now that Bitcoin mining is basically controlled by specialized hardware, there are these devices called ASICs, application specific integrated circuits, that can mine in Bitcoin 10,000 times faster than any normal computer can. Just about every miner that wants to be profitable is basically running one of these [00:29:30] specialized devices. Problem is there’s an incentive for these ASICs to [inaudible 0:29:35] in data centres because, if they’re in data centres, then the owner only needs to hire a couple of full-time employees to manage all of them.\n\nThose particular employees could become much more efficient at their job, because they’re doing it all day, so it’s much more cost effective than just having a whole bunch of people run each one separately. The pressure for the system to be very efficient only increases, because the price of Bitcoin right now is dropping, so a lot of miners are unprofitable. Right now, I think my estimate is that there’s somewhere between 10 to 30 data centres that control over half of the network. Theoretically, the number could continue to decrease. There’s the data centres then there’s also the manufacturing companies. I think the manufacturing companies are even more centralized because just the sheer amount of existing factory and infrastructure that you need in order to actually build on these ASICs just costs huge amounts of money.\n\nThere’s a bunch of factories in China where a lot of the activity happens. Last year in May I visited a factory which, at the time, was producing a quarter of all the new Bitcoin miners that were coming into circulation at the time. There’s a couple of issues. One of the issues is that these companies might eventually decide to collude and start doing things like censoring transactions and even double spending. Double spending is basically this attack where, if you have more computing power than the rest of the world combined, then you can go back to some previous point in history and you can start mining. Eventually, your history will have more computing weight behind it than the original history.\n\nPeople will basically switch to yours and, that way, you have the ability to go back in time back to whatever point in time you want. One risk is that companies will just collude to do it. One reason they might collude is to try to reverse their own transactions. One option is that you take 10 million dollars, send the 10 million dollars to a Bitcoin exchange, buy 10 million dollars’ worth of Litecoin. Then you go back in time and you cancel the transaction where you sent your 10 million dollars, and now we have your 10 million dollars’ worth of Bitcoin back and your 10 million dollars’ worth of Litecoin. Second option is that you could short Bitcoin on an exchange. There’s exchanges that let you basically bet against the Bitcoin price.\n\nIf an attack succeeds, then you can basically earn a huge amount of profit from this. There’s those possibilities. The other possibilities are that just some guy hacks into a lot of these farms at the same time. Third possibility, theoretically, the Chinese government might be able to just do a 51 percent attack by giving all the data centres within China a warrant to basically tell them, “Hey, cooperate with us or else.” It’s a lot less decentralized than it seems. The bigger problem is that we can’t really quantify even how decentralized it is, because mining is completely not transparent. It’s very hard to try to even trace where all the miners are located, where they’re coming from and so forth. Which, to some extent, makes it harder to collude but, to another extent, means that we just can’t know how bad the problem is without extremely serious analysis.\n\nEuvie: Do you see Ethereum having these problems too, or are you taking measures to prevent that?\n\nVitalik: We are taking a lot of measures. One of our initial ideas is basically coming up with an algorithm which is much harder to make more efficient with specialized hardware. The theory is that people would be much more able to run the software on normal computers. It could end up being high powered gaming rigs but, at least, there’s hundreds of thousands of people around the world that have gaming rigs. It’s going to be much harder to collude. The strategy that we’ve been moving to lately is this idea of proof of stake, which basically means that instead of the consensus being who has the most computing power, it’s a process where the people that hold the coins inside of the system collaborate on making the next block. Instead of using computer power as a proxy for what your vote is, you would just have the amount of Ether that you have the thing that decides how much you get to participate.\n\nEuvie: Do you think that might encourage monopoly though?\n\nVitalik: Yeah, it’s a common criticism. I would say that if we compare it to Bitcoin back in 2010, it’s an extremely legitimate point. If we compare it to Bitcoin in 2014 then the problem is that the current system encourages monopoly even more. There’s this economic concept of economy as a scale where, in the current system, if you’re 10 times richer than someone else then, first of all, you can produce 10 times more but then, on top of that, you have the ability to make more efficient capital investments. You might even be even more than 10 times more effective. Whereas, in this system, it’s fairly simple. If you’re 10 times bigger, you do 10 times more.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of this more hyper specialized mining industry that we see right now, it’s probably an improvement. Against Bitcoin as it was ideally meant to be, it’s not but, unfortunately, we can’t guarantee that it’s always going to be this idyllic thing where everyone just contributes a bit on their own laptop.\n\nEuvie: Let’s backtrack a little bit. Talk about some of the everyday applications of this kind of system if it becomes ubiquitous. You guys did a Reddit AMA and there was one response that I particularly liked where you described a guy from the time that he wakes up to the time that he gets to work, all of the different things that happened within Ethereum. Do you remember that one?\n\nVitalik: Yes, I do.\n\nEuvie: Could you explain it to our listeners?\n\nVitalik: The idea was that a guy wakes up and whatever amount that he’s supposed to pay for rent everyday automatically gets deducted from his balance. Whatever amount from that that’s supposed to go for property taxes is automatically deducted from the government. You could use the blockchain in order to trace where the government tax money goes, you could even see exactly what programs it ends up supporting. Then get into your car. While you’re in your car, first of all, we have a decentralized self-driving car Uber scenario where… What just about every car company is doing is they’re building cars and then they’re just releasing the cars into the wild.\n\nEach individual car would just be pretty much autonomously running around looking for people that need to get from point A to point B. It’s using some standard computer science search algorithms to try to figure out exactly how that particular car can get the most revenue. The person would go onto some kind of decentralized market place and he would say, “Okay, I want to go from where I am right now, here’s my work location. Please post bids on how much it would cost to send me over.” A bunch of these autonomous cars would post bids and the guy would pick the lowest one and the car would start driving him over.\n\nAt that point, you’d have the option of either taking a road that has heavy traffic on it but where there would be some kind of dynamically adjusted toll, so the road would be more expensive. Or, taking a road that nobody else is using right now and that would be cheaper. Eventually, the guy gets to work. Chances are, he might end up working for even some kind of decentralized organization that would rate his contributions and pay him for his contributions automatically and so forth. The idea behind the vision is that, first of all, with these different kinds of decentralized market places you have the ability to really reduce the barriers to entry to different kinds of industries. Right now, if I wanted to start a taxi company, I don’t just have to start it up, I also have to go around and market it and try to get it adopted.\n\nI’ll run into network affect issues because I’m only in one place and so forth. Whereas here, there’s one platform and it’s a completely decentralized platform and anyone can participate on it on either side. Theoretically, it would interact with things like roads. Roads would be enabled in order to incentivize people to, for example, drive less during peak hours and drive more when no one else is driving in order to minimize traffic. You’d have a whole bunch of these different systems for just about every aspect of work, city planning, architecture and so forth. Once the guy gets to his company and starts working… The other really interesting question is to what degree can you actually decentralize the way that entire companies are governed?\n\nUltimately, what some of these decentralized platforms do is they basically replace companies, to some degree, and they just completely swap out their functionality for the system where anyone can come in, anyone can participate. Trying to figure out to what extent you can do that. The line is that the existing kind of automation that we’ve seen tends to be the kind that automates the way the people at the edges – people like factory workers, different kinds of manual labourers and so forth. This is kind of a different kind of automation that maybe paves the way for automating away certain kinds of managers.\n\nMike: In recent times, it seems like the focus for a lot of entrepreneurs is to create platforms and launch these platforms with the idea that they’ll be the middle man or they’ll create the system, then people will participate, not unlike Uber. If this kind of system is going to change it, where do you recommend entrepreneurs focus in the future if everyone’s using this type of platform?\n\nVitalik: First of all, I think that one of the answers will just unfortunately have to be there is less need for that particular kind of labour. The effort of trying to push a platform out, trying really hard to market and monopolize the industry and so forth, there’s just going to be less need for entrepreneurs in this particular space. Just because all these decentralized blockchain technologies just make it so much easier to build platforms. On the one hand, the profit opportunities are going to be lower but, on the other hand, it’s also going to be much easier. It’s this interesting dichotomy in that it reduces both at the same time. The best analogy might even be to something like the internet, where it, to some degree, just let a lot of people enjoy themselves without spending that much money at all.\n\nIt probably ended up killing a whole bunch of business opportunities. On the other hand, it helps people save a lot of money. Particularly, it massively reduces barriers to entry for people to create new kinds of businesses. In terms of the kinds of businesses that will continue to exist, in the 20th century the paradigm was, “How do I provide a whole bunch of things for a really large mass of people?” What I would describe as a transition phase. It seems as though it’s switching to, “How do I provide a platform for a whole bunch of people to help each other?” To some degree, it is that but, to some degree, it is still centralized. Platforms like Uber, they’re still providing the interface, they’re still providing particularly reputation systems and so forth.\n\nI think the future opportunities are going to have to do pretty much entirely with various different kinds of data aggregation. The thing is that all of these intermediaries that we have right now are basically informational to some degree. There might even be opportunities to earn a profit by somehow just being an entity that provides a whole bunch of data for specific people that they need. I also think that the move to this digital realm, it doesn’t even have to do specifically with decentralization itself. It’s been happening for 20 years. It’s also creating all of these different concepts of virtual property. People sometimes think that Bitcoin is the first really peer digital asset. That’s not really true. The first peer digital asset is Domain Names. It’s a completely emergent form of digital property that just somehow emerged out of nowhere.\n\nAs it turns out, it’s a multibillion-dollar industry. Advertising is a thing that the beginning of this particular century invented. The challenge would be trying to figure out what exactly the next decade’s equivalent of things like advertising and maybe some form of virtual property that just somehow emerges out of this particular industry is going to be. I’m not completely sure about exactly what that’s going to be. If I was, I’d already have a billion dollars of venture capital investment. Right now, I don’t. To some degree, it will probably just see a continued shift in industries that will it end up looking more like finance industry. If you look at the finance industry, generally, financial firms they don’t really serve customers, so to speak, directly in a lot of cases.\n\nAll they do is they buy things and they sell things. What they’re doing in the process is they kind of are being informational intermediaries to some degree. They’re trying to quickly analyse a whole bunch of data about the world and they’re trying to quickly figure out, “Okay, is this data going to lead to this particular thing being more expensive or this particular thing being more cheaper?” If they find an opportunity, they seize on it. It’s this service that they end up providing on this extremely abstract level, without really interacting directly. I could easily see other industries in the reputation space moving toward that kind of model. Altogether, it’s hard to say.\n\nEuvie: On the opposite side of that spectrum, there’s a DAPP that I read about called Crypto [inaudible . It’s built on Ethereum and it would allow content creators to get paid for really great content and for talent scouts or trend hunters to be able to get rewarded for discovering this great content early on.\n\nVitalik: Right. It’s an interesting project. I’m personally a bit sceptical of the whole, “Hey, let’s tip people for the content they provide,” thing, because, in practice, there are platforms that let people do that. The tips generally end up being on the order of five cents. First of all, my one point that I was making is that the opportunity to make massive profits by being an intermediary or being a company, will go down. But if you provide something valuable, there probably will be more opportunities to make money from it just as some kind of an individual. In a while, I think that the idea of, “I’m going to create some great thing and people are just going to donate enough thousand dollars to me every month, in order to let me survive,” is a bit overoptimistic.\n\nWe are going to see, I think, more instances of, “Hey, can you do this particular thing for me and get some small amount of money off from that?” That’s a trend that even exists outside of the decentralization industry. There’s a whole bunch of companies that are jumping on this whole idea of quickly pay someone some number of dollars to do some particular kind of thing.\n\nEuvie: Like microservices.\n\nVitalik: Exactly, microservices. The potential that decentralization has to expand opportunities for people who are performing microservices is specifically this idea that you can jump between platforms and you can carry your reputation across them.\n\nEuvie: What do you think about the near zero cost economy? Do you think that a platform like Ethereum would be conducive to that? Because if a lot of thing are decentralized, if they’re not really managed by people or managed by people to a very, very small degree – maybe just for troubleshooting – would that make a lot of different services cost close to zero?\n\nVitalik: Yeah, I think so. I think there’s a bunch of things that will just continue going down in price. There’s a lot of intermediaries that just end up charging 20 or 30 percent. If the concept of decentralization takes off and does well, then those are probably going to also decline to near zero. Anything that has to do with various kinds of informational arbitrage will go down. It’s almost a matter of asking what kinds of things aren’t going to be zero cost anymore. That’s, to some degree, a hard question, because you have to figure out what is something that is going to continue to be valuable and that can’t be provided for free in some sense.\n\nThere’s a couple of ways to answer that question. The first one is that I was mentioning, that I think that a lot of these new digital platforms, they reduce the extent to which people care about physical property but they also increase the role of various new kinds of digital property that they create. The idea of domain names selling for millions of dollars is just one of them. I think that, in general, there just are things in human society that are zero sum, they are a status competition to some degree. Those are just things that aren’t going to disappear. If old ones disappear, then new ones are just going to keep popping up. People seem to like competing for status, all just for its own sake, in a whole bunch of different areas.\n\nThere’s always going to be things that have a price. If you can figure out that kind of thing, then I guess there’s an opportunity to be selling it. In terms of everything else, at least things that can be digitized are just going to continue to become cheaper. The things that aren’t going to go zero quickly are things that basically things that can’t be digitized. Food. Okay, food is going to be cheaper. Eventually, we’ll figure out how to do this whole automated food thing and produce extremely high-quality stuff at lower rates. But it’s still not going to be zero. Health gear, not going to be zero any time soon. It seems likely that I guess things that you would categorize as being essentials would also remain non-zero for some period of time.\n\nTo some degree, the digital economy can’t magically make them much, much better all by itself. There are gains, you can make it more efficient, but there’s always limits. Those kinds of things all continue having a price. Information is the one thing that’s much harder to have a price and have that price be defensible. Things that aren’t informational in any way, they’ll probably remain non-zero for some time, at least until the whole concept of a post-scarcity economy hits and we have robots and so forth, but then who knows what’s going to happen.\n\nMike: Do you think this platform has the potential to create a vibrant artist economy?\n\nVitalik: Possibly. One point that I’ll have to make is that, once again, I’m a sceptic of the whole tipping concept, but that’s a side point that I think people don’t even realize the extent to which that’s only one particular way that you can tip artists. If I’m an artist, then I have a bunch of things I can do. First of all, you can make personalized art for some specific person and for some specific group. The demand for that could very easily increase. These kinds of platforms actually make it easier to do things like that. That’s one path.\n\nThe other path that I’m interested in is that, going back to the whole status symbol concept, at least back in the physical world people seem to have an interest in buying things that express their support for a particular artist. That would be things like t-shirts, things like CDs, even just going to see them at a concert and so forth. The specific property that those kinds of things have is that they’re very public. It’s not just something that you’re just buying as private donation, it’s something that you’re buying specifically to express the degree to which you’re interested in a particular artist to other people.\n\nThere’s opportunities to do something in the digital equivalent of that. Come up with some kind of badge that would exist in the context of a whole bunch of digital platforms that would somehow get attached to your profile and that could be used to represent your support in a digital realm. Maybe that’ll end up as being a source of income for artists. Doing something like that would probably be a very significant behavioural economics and psychological challenge, but it could easily be done.\n\nEuvie: In closing, I just wanted to offer one hilarious bit to our listeners. It’s this thing called Inthereum. It’s a parody of Ethereum. You’ve seen this Vitalik, right?\n\nVitalik: Yes, I have.\n\nMike: Are you worried about the Bobchain becoming a major competitor for Ethereum?\n\nVitalik: Bobchain is never going to scale but Bobchain 2.0 seems a bit dangerous.\n\nMike: How do you guys need help? How do you hope the community will help you guys to achieve what you’re trying to do?\n\nVitalik: Right now, I think there is a lot of people that have ideas and a lot of them are really cool ideas. There’s a lot of people that are interested in developing. I think there also might be a lot of people that might be attracted by the whole concept, by the whole idea of developing in this decentralized application style. To some degree, it’s just a matter of reaching out to them and trying to make sure that people actually find out about what we’re doing and, ideally, start building something.",

Jair Bolsonaro se consolida na segunda posição. Nota-se, também, elevado percentual de rejeição individual para todos os pré-candidatos avaliados, inclusive para João Doria, que passa a ser percebido como um político comum. O potencial de rejeição de todos os pré-candidatos ultrapassa 50%.\n\nHá percepção de que o país se encontra em crise e fora de rumo do ponto de vista político. Em relação ao emprego, as melhoras na economia são percebidas de forma tímida pela população. Os brasileiros continuam acompanhando as ações da operação Lava Jato, aprovando suas ações e acreditando, em sua maioria, que ela está beneficiando o Brasil.\n\nO meio de comunicação mais utilizado para se obter informações continua sendo a televisão, seguida pela internet.\n\nNa avaliação da CNT, a pesquisa demonstra que a eleição está aberta para um nome de alta respeitabilidade não ligado ao meio político, podendo ser da área judiciária, médica ou empresarial.\n\nClique aqui para acessar os resultados completos.",

It’s been great hanging out with you in the lobby, seeing your feedback on Discord , the Echo Arena subreddit , and the Oculus forums, and getting our butts whooped by you in the arena!\n\nMonday, July 17th! To add to the awesome news announced earlier today ( Oculus Rift + Touch sale and our recently revealed Lone Echo launch trailer ), we’re also happy to share our decision to extend the final Echo Arena Open Beta until\n\nAs many of you know, our goal for this open beta was to further test some major network updates we made, our skill-based matchmaking, and our first iteration of the Echo Arena Party system. We definitely got the backend service testing we needed (still recovering from being hugged a little too hard), however during that time our devs were re-routed to debug and resolve those errors, which put the Party system on hold.\n\nThis extended open beta period will give the Echo Arena dev team time to further improve our backend services, and players to test out and provide feedback on the Party system. Additionally, you’ll get more time in Echo Arena to prep for launch day and hone your skills for the VR Challenger series, which we’ll be sharing more info about before too much longer.\n\nThank you again for all the support you’ve given us! We can’t wait to dive back into the arena with you over the next week, and again at launch on July 20th.\n\n- Ready At Dawn",
  "latent_633": "0 SHARES Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Pinterest Print Mail Flipboard\n\nIn a page right out of Nazi Jew-baiter Julius Streicher’s playbook, conservative shill Michael Savage called Bernie Sanders a “liberal weasel Jew” who hates America and Christians.\n\nHe allowed last week on “Savage Nation” that Bernie Sanders “sets off comedic shockwaves” but that the Vermont senator also makes him “sick.”\n\nTake a listen courtesy of Right Wing Watch:\n\n“I really need Catholics who are listening to this show who are educated, analytical, and who can think for themselves” – which pretty much excludes conservative Catholics – “to understand the danger his pope is putting us in. By coming here and watching the atheists genuflect before him, you will see one of the great charades of the century.\n\n“Bernie Sanders for example. Bernie is a particular case. Jewish atheist, Jewish atheist, everything about him sets off comedic shockwaves in me. Bernie Sanders, I know the type. They were on the margins of my life. They hated America, they hated Christians. I know the type. I ran from them. They made me sick.\n\n“They’re the antithesis of my existence, that type of Jewish atheist: the liberal weasel Jew. That’s what I call Bernie Sanders, and look how popular he is with other anti-American weasels who love him. I said yesterday – make no mistake about it – wouldn’t be where he is was it not for the Hillary camp, who may as well be running him.\n\nAnd he may as well be a running dog of the Hillary camp because by espousing the stupidity that he espouses, it makes her look like a centrist even though she’s a leftist. So he may as well be just a front man for her, a warm up act.”\n\nWe’ve seen Republicans claim Donald Trump, whom they created, is a Democratic plant to destroy their party, which they’ve destroyed themselves, but come on. Cognitive dissonance much?\n\nThere is nothing like a little anti-Semitism from conservatives, is there, except anti-Islam, anti-black, anti-immigrant, anti-women, anti-gay…\n\nWe see it from Ann Coulter and others, this deep-seated animosity toward actual Jews that has never quite left American cultural life. Conservatives claim they love Israel, but they hate Jews. They hate that Jews overwhelmingly vote Democrat.\n\nAnd obviously, from their perspective, a Jew cannot love Israel if he is a liberal, because only Republicans love Israel, even though what they really love is not Israel, but having an Israel in place to fulfill their end-time fantasies and maybe start a war or two for them.\n\nI wrote this morning about white or ethnic nationalism. Never has there been a more perfect example of how the Republican Party really feels, than this. It’s not just blacks, it’s not just Latino immigrants, it’s not just Muslims. It’s Jews and everyone else who isn’t on board with the Republican Party’s authoritarian plans for America.\n\nIf you’re ready to read more from the unbossed and unbought Politicus team, sign up for our newsletter here!

  "latent_752": "KOMAKI, Japan — It's springtime in Japan and that means one thing.\n\nActually, two things. Penis festivals and vagina festivals.\n\nIt may sound like a sophomoric gag. But these are folk rites going back at least 1,500 years, into Japan's agricultural past. They're held to ensure a good harvest and promote baby-making.\n\nMaybe they should hold more such festivals. Japan has one of the world's lowest birthrates (1.37 children per woman), which experts blame on stagnant incomes and changing gender relations.\n\nThe center-left government that came to power last year hopes to make child-rearing more affordable with a $280 monthly stipend per kid.\n\nMeanwhile, the festivals provide an economic shot in the arm for host cities, a party for foreign tourists and expats, and a chance for locals to let loose, too.\n\nOne of the best-known penis festivals is at Komaki City's Tagata shrine, about 45 minutes outside Nagoya, every March 15. In a neighboring village, a vagina festival is held the Sunday before that. This year, that was the 14th — meaning rare, back-to-back genital worship days.\n\nAt the Hime-no-miya grand vagina festival, parents dress up their kids, pray for healthy babies, and celebrate with sake, beer and snacks galore.\n\nIn the morning, children carry a small vagina to the Ogata shrine. Later, some 40 grown men strain under the weight of a massive vagina while carrying it to the shrine in the main parade. They're followed by two smaller vagina litters.\n\nAt the end of the day pink and white mochi (glutinous rice ball treats) are hurled into the crowd.\n\nThe penis festival the following day drew far more foreign and Japanese tourists — some 100,000, according to a festival brochure. Festival foreplay included much posing with wooden and candy penises. The main event is the parading of a two-foot by six-and-a-half foot long phallus carved from Japanese cypress.\n\nTeams of men strain under the weight, stopping to spin the penis around a few times amid yelling, cheering and jostling. The work is so hard that teams rotate during the one-and-a-half hour procession.\n\nThis phallus parade is rooted, says the brochure, in \"an ancient Japanese belief that for the growth and development of all things, the mother, earth, has to be impregnated by the father, heaven.\"\n\n\"People come here when they want to have a baby,\" said festival volunteer and Komaki resident Katsuragawa Noboru. \"If it works, they have to come back the next year to thank the gods.\"\n\nIt worked for Katsuragawa, twice: He has a son and a daughter now, he said with a laugh.\n\nLucy Glasspool, who researches gender and pop culture as a visiting scholar in Nagoya, was helping out at the information booth. It was her first penis festival.\n\n\"I heard about this a long time ago and I'm not sure I believed it,\" she said. \"But now I'm here and it's everything I thought it would be. I highly recommend the penis-shaped candy.\"\n\nShe gave English-language updates on the penis' progress through a microphone, and passed out detailed information in English on the history and significance of the rite. But most Western tourists seemed happy enough just to drink beer and make endless penis jokes.\n\nVendors sell penis- and vagina-shaped candies and chocolate-covered bananas, wood penis sculptures and penis earrings, adding to the mirth. Eavesdropping was a riot.\n\nSaid one American woman into a cell phone, in a southern twang: \"We just found an ashtray that's in the shape of a vagina that you need to buy.\"\n\n\"It's smaller than last year's,\" one jaded female expat loudly complained, as the phallus approached.\n\nOne American woman, reviewing a photo of her friends posing with penis-candy-sucking Japanese, said, \"Oh my God. This one is so going on Facebook.\"",
  "latent_967": "Microsoft will let loose a new operating system, Windows Cloud, at the company’s annual developer conference later this month.\n\nBoss Steve Ballmer announced Redmond’s plans at a Software plus Services partner event in London this lunchtime.\n\nHe playfully gave the OS the temporary name of Windows Cloud. Apparently, we’ll learn more from Microsoft about the platform at the Professional Developers Conference in Los Angeles, which takes place at the end of October.\n\n“We need a new operating system designed for the cloud and we will introduce one in about four weeks, we’ll even have a name to give you by then. But let’s just call it for the purposes of today ‘Windows Cloud’,” said Ballmer.\n\n“Just like Windows Server looked a lot like Windows but with new properties, new characteristics and new features, so will Windows Cloud look a lot like Windows Server.”\n\nBallmer also hinted at what would be built into the new OS, including geo replication, how to design apps intended to commingle [we think he means appeasing regulators by providing more interoperability], management modelling and an SOA model, to effectively create a new platform.\n\n“We’re not driving an agenda towards being service providers but we’ve gotta build a service that is Windows in the cloud,” admitted Ballmer.\n\nHe also hit out at internet kingpin and pesky rival Google.\n\n“If you talk to Google they’ll say it's thin client computing but then they’ll issue a new browser that’s basically a big fat operating system designed to compete with Windows but running on top of it,” he said.\n\n“Steve Ballmer observation,\" machine gunned the fragrant CEO.\n\nBallmer also acknowledged that Midori - which many have speculated will be a post-Windows operating system from MS - lives, at least in incubation form, that is.\n\nThe firm has no plans to bring Midori to market - yet. It's merely a research project, he added.\n\n\"Our big problem is there’s just no secret that gets kept in Microsoft. The guy in the office next door to somebody working on Midori is not supposed to know about Midori,\" he said. \"The last thing we want is for somebody else to obsolete us, if we’re gonna get obseleted [sic] we better do it to ourselves.\" ®",
  "latent_1276": "Former child prodigy Freddy Adu admits he has been a victim of his own hype but is determined to get his career back on track after training with Blackpool.\n\nThe forward, now 24, shot to prominence 10 years ago when he became the youngest ever player to appear in a United States professional sport for DC United in Major League Soccer after being selected with the number one overall pick in that year's draft.\n\nA trial with Manchester United followed for the teenager once dubbed \"the next Pele\" but Adu failed to reach the lofty expectations set for him by the American media.\n\nAfter disappointing spells in Portugal, France, Turkey and Brazil, Adu has been training in England with Championship club Blackpool.\n\n\"I'm really not in a rush to get anything done right this second but I need to make the right decision for my career,\" Adu said in an interview with Tangerines TV.\n\n\"I haven't always made the right decisions as far as choices of teams I've gone to in the past. That's why when I heard of this opportunity I wanted to come here check it out, see if it fits, see how it is.\"\n\nAdu, who has collected 17 caps for his country, is thankful he is still young enough to potentially have a fruitful career in the game despite squandering previous opportunities.\n\nHe added: \"I'm only 24 now and it's actually 10 years in March when I made my debut (for DC United). So, yes, man it's been a long time!\n\n\"I've learned a lot through that journey, there's been good times and there's been bad times. I'm glad that I experienced that at such a young age that, being 24 now, I'm still young enough to correct a lot of the mistakes I made.\n\n\"It was a lot of pressure, it really was. As a 14, 15, 16-year-old you're young, you're immature, you kind of get caught up in that a little bit. Thankfully I had my family and my friends and I had the right people around me to steer me in the right direction because there was a point when I did get caught up in it.\n\n\"Maybe I wasn't training as hard as I should have. It hurt me, it hurt my development.\n\n\"What most people don't know is that I decided to go professional because my family was real poor. At that point my mum, she was a single mother working two jobs, three jobs and what am I going to do? Say no to millions of dollars at that age while my family struggles? No.\"\n\nBlackpool, still without a permanent manager since Paul Ince was sacked in January, raised lots of eyebrows when it emerged Adu was training with them in late January.\n\nExplaining how it came about, the player added: \"I've loved it. The guys have been great, the coaches have been great, they've all welcomed me.\n\n\"I'm happy here. I'm learning a lot, the training here is very intense. It's different to what I'm used to and I absolutely love it because that's what I need as a player.\n\n\"It was just an opportunity that came by. The staff here had a mutual friend with my agent. To get a chance to come here and train in England is something that I won't pass up.\n\n\"It'll be a dream come true to play here some day. I don't know when that'll be but I'll do whatever it takes to make that happen.\"\n\nFor now, though, Adu's name is perhaps more synonymous with many fans for his brilliance in the virtual gaming world.\n\n\"I get a lot of tweets calling me a 'Football Manager legend',\" he said of the popular game.\n\n\"I'm like, man, I wish it was like that in real life! That's cool. I personally never played that but I've got a lot of friends who did and they tell me about that.\"",

  "latent_1550": "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\nLately I have been working during my free time in a rogue-like game prototype and one key aspect of such games is the procedural generation of the different gameplay elements, such as monsters, chests, vendors, traps and so on. So I came across a relatively innocent-looking challenge and I after spending some minutes thinking about it I decided to get deeper into this topic and help other people facing the same issues. I will be analyzing how to semi randomly position the doors of my procedurally generated rooms in a way that they look original, realistic, fun and still make sense. The following methods can also be applied to a wide range of gameplay areas: looting, monsters, leveling, dynamic difficulty, luck attribute influences, random events based on game status, etc..\n\nHere is the starting point: every room is shaped as a 2d rect and has a variable width and height. The top wall will have a variable number of doors and every tile will be one unit wide. The possible tiles for the top wall are: wall or door. Now we should decide for each tile whether it is going to be a wall or a door.\n\nOk, so what options do we have?\n\nA. Premade configurations + random picking\n\nOne option would be creating per hand the different combinations and then get a random number between 0 and the number of combinations – 1. Then we get the prefab using that random index and use it for our top wall.\n\nThe main advantage of it is that it is straightforward to implement; in Unity it would barely take three lines of code to get it done. Also, you make sure that it will look well, since you’ve made them beforehand.\n\nBetween their disadvantages we could especially point out that the amount of manual work setting up the scenarios will skyrocket if the number of variables increases (number of doors, possible wall widths, etc.). Maintaining them is also tedious and it may be hard to combine this technique with continuous (non-discreet) variables that have an infinite amount of values or those which are not known in compile time.\n\nInstantiate(ScenePrefabs[UnityEngine.Random.Range(0, ScenePrefabs.Length)]);\n\nB. Pure random positioning\n\nThe second option is to take a random number between 0 and the number of tiles and position the door there. If you have more than one door, then repeat that procedure until all doors have been placed.\n\nStill, you have to be careful not to overwrite doors in the same position. If you are unlucky, you may get the same random number a few times. You can easily make a workaround and throw a dice until you get a number that has not been picked yet. Another problem of this approach: if you are even unluckier, that process might take a while since you might be getting the same random numbers the whole time. It is not likely to happen, but it might, since this process is not guaranteed to end.\n\nAs I do not like to depend on luck, here is another option: you may also create an array with all possible tile numbers and then you get a random number so you choose the tile to put the door in. Afterwards, you take that tile out of the array and keep moving. That will also fix the problem of infinite randoms loop.\n\nHowever, there are more issues here: you might need to adjust the process so it looks well in your game (padding between doors? no clustered areas of doors? no doors in the corners?).\n\nconst int NumberOfDoors = 3; var tiles = new GameObject[]{WallPrefab, WallPrefab, WallPrefab, WallPrefab, WallPrefab}; for (int i = 0; i < NumberOfDoors; ++i) { int tile = Random.Range(0, tiles.Length); if (tiles[tile] == WallPrefab) { tiles[tile] = DoorPrefab; } else { i--; // Repeat. } } for (int tile = 0; tile < tiles.Length; ++tile) { Instantiate(tiles[tile]).transform.position = new Vector3(tile, 0, 0); }\n\nYou may expect such results:\n\nRandom placement strategy\n\nC. Random positioning based on statistics\n\nI wasn’t totally happy with the previous solutions, especially since I didn’t have any way of influencing the process of selecting tiles for our doors. I could just throw a dice a few times and wait for a result. Now, as a game designer, you would normally like to be able to influence the mechanics a bit.\n\nFor instance, I would prefer my doors not to spawn on the corners but rather around a certain range on the center. If we translate that word, prefer, into the mathematical language, we get to relate it to probabilities. We would like the probability of spawning a door in a corner to be much lesser than in the middle.\n\nNow, statistics is a complex topic to start with for people having no prior experience with it, so let’s try to keep it simple. We can use an example to make clear what we want to achieve. If we are to build 100 rooms with a fixed number of tiles, we can represent in the following grid the number of doors of a specific type that will be spawned in every tile for the experiment:\n\n5 10 20 30 20 10 5\n\nAs we see, we want most of the doors to spawn around the center. Following the definition of probability, in this case the probability of spawning a door just in the center will be 30%. Here is the same data in a chart:\n\nSpawn probabilities per tile\n\nWhat is so powerful about this? Well, we may change those probabilities in runtime depending on the game design. Also, after spawning a door in one place, we can set the probability of that tile (and maybe neighbor tiles, if we want to leave some space between them) to zero and rescale our model so the sum of all probabilities is 1. Let’s say we want to spawn two doors and the first one was spawned in the tile number 5; how would the new chart look like after taking that element out? We first sum the remaining probabilities and we get 0.90; that means, we have to scale every element by 1/0.90 like this:\n\nModified spawn probabilities per tile after removing one\n\nOk ok, whatever, how do I implement this? The functions we saw are called Probability Density Functions (PDF). They are pretty straight-forward if we are working with discrete variables. The trick is to convert the PDF to a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), which is also straight-forward with discrete variables; the probability of every item is the sum of all probabilities from the start until that item included. For the original chart we would get this one:\n\nCumulative distribution function\n\nNow getting the tile where the door is to be spawned is also easy. We just get a random number between 0 and 1 and then find the first tile whose probability is larger than that number, starting from left to right. For instance, if the number we got is 0.2, then we will choose tile 2; if the number is 0.70, we select tile 4.\n\nusing UnityEngine; using System.Collections; using System.Linq; public class WallSpawner : MonoBehaviour { public GameObject DoorPrefab; public GameObject WallPrefab; void Start () { SpawnWall(); } void SpawnWall () { const int NumberOfDoors = 3; var tiles = new GameObject[]{WallPrefab, WallPrefab, WallPrefab, WallPrefab, WallPrefab, WallPrefab, WallPrefab}; var densityFunction = new float[]{ 0.05f, 0.10f, 0.20f, 0.30f, 0.20f, 0.10f, 0.05f }; for (int i = 0; i < NumberOfDoors; ++i) { var cumulativeFunction = GetCumulativeFunction(densityFunction); float randomValue = Random.value; int tile = GetTile(cumulativeFunction, randomValue); tiles[tile] = DoorPrefab; densityFunction[tile] = 0.0f; // This tile can't be chosen anymore. densityFunction = NormalizeDensityFunction(densityFunction); } for (int tile = 0; tile < tiles.Length; ++tile) { Instantiate(tiles[tile]).transform.position = new Vector3(tile, 0, 0); } } float[] GetCumulativeFunction(float[] densityFunction) { var cumulativeFunction = new float[densityFunction.Length]; float accumulator = 0.0f; for (int i = 0; i < densityFunction.Length; ++i) { cumulativeFunction[i] = densityFunction[i] + accumulator; accumulator = cumulativeFunction[i]; } return cumulativeFunction; } int GetTile(float[] cumulativeFunction, float randomValue) { for (int i = 0; i < cumulativeFunction.Length; ++i) { if (cumulativeFunction[i] >= randomValue) { return i; } } return cumulativeFunction.Length - 1; } float[] NormalizeDensityFunction(float[] densityFunction) { float total = densityFunction.Sum(); return densityFunction.Select(p => p / total).ToArray(); } }\n\nBy using simple statistics we remain flexible enough that we can adapt our gameplay eitherdynamically by certain game events (difficulty, achievements) or statically through the further updates on the game design document. And at the same time we achieve a well-looking environment that doesn’t look 100% randomly placed.\n\nWith this strategy it is more likely that you will see this kind of placement:\n\nStatistically based placement\n\nNow, if you want to go with continuous variables, the cumulative distribution function has to be calculated through an integral and, as far as I know, it is hard to create probability density functions that match your gameplay preferences in a way that their CDF sum 1. Normally you have to use well known PDFs; if you know other way, please message me.\n\nWe can apply this principle to many areas of our game. For every monster we kill, we could decide which items are to be looted (by modifying base probabilities through modifiers/scores depending on the monster level, area, faction, etc.), or maybe tweak the dices in a turn-based game in order to help the player if they is not doing really well in that level. Which monster to spawn could also be modeled with statistics depending on player level or characteristics (at low levels we normally want only to spawn low level monsters, but exceptions can maybe occur). Timings can also be adjusted with statistics, but there you are looking more into continuous variables (check Poisson distribution for instance).\n\nIf you want to spawn monsters in a 2d room, you can make a grid out of it with every cell having the same probability (so that all together sum 1). After spawning a NPC in a cell, you may alter that cell and also the eight neighbor cells so you reduce the probability of creating clusters of enemies. You can consider the X and Y variables as independent random variables. If you are in a 3d world, Z is usually set at the ground level.\n\nSo, do you know a better approach for such processes? If so, let me know, I’m really looking forward to improve the system!",

Expect profiles of cooks, makers, and bartenders, plus recipes showcasing the classics (and twists on those classics) you love.\n\nView photos\n\nSouthern-style latkes at Domenica in New Orleans, Louisiana. Photo credit: Domenica\n\nOf the approximately 5.3 million Jews living in the United States today, fewer than five percent reside in the American South. My father used to be one of them: He grew up in Cordele, Georgia and later Chattanooga, Tennessee, where denizens worship at the altars of barbecue and MoonPie. But for Jews like my Dad, the Southern Jewish experience is about negotiating a balance of heritage with local culture—an equation that has resulted in one of the country’s least-discussed fusion cuisines.\n\nDr. Marcie Cohen Ferris, an associate professor in the Department of American Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, hails from a corner of northeastern Arkansas and is the author of Matzoh Ball Gumbo: Culinary Tales of the Jewish South. \"I think food is one of the strongest and most powerful ways [people] hold on to ethnic identity,\" Ferris told me. \"In looking at papers and sisterhood records and party invitations, you just see how what [Southern Jews] ate either made them more Southern… or did not.”\n\nIn my family, Southern tweaks to traditional Jewish dishes were the norm. During Passover, the nuts-and-apple dish called “charoset\" was made not with walnuts, as is traditional in Eastern European iterations, but pecans. Noodle kugels for the Sabbath came flecked with stewed peaches.\n\nBut there came a point where tiny “tweaks” to traditional Jewish food became… a moot point. My great-grandmother—who for several years arranged for kosher meat to be trucked the 150-some miles from Atlanta to Cordele, a journey on which it would often spoil—finally caved and fried up pork steaks for my great grandfather. (She never did eat them herself.)\n\nAll of these foods reflect some element of wanting to fit in. Despite the best efforts of his grandmother, my father heartily embraced bacon fat–laced collard greens and pork ribs. So did Ferris, who reasoned: “This is my right as an Arkansas person, this is the foodway of my place.” But there was also an instinct to blend the two heritages, to preserve the essence of traditional Jewish dishes while making effective use of local ingredients.\n\nView photos",

  "latent_1808": "(Reuters photo: Regis Duvignau)\n\nRather than censor or regulate tech giants, enlist their help to counter propaganda.\n\nThe old adage says, “Fool me once, shame on you — fool me twice, shame on me.” That advice would serve as well when we decide what to do about Russia’s disinformation efforts in the U.S. — what is now called “fake news.”\n\nMany people who are worried about Russian interference in our 2016 elections are looking for scapegoats. The Trump campaign, the news media, and social-media goliaths such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter top the list. Obviously, a lot of the complaints have more to do with political posturing than actual solutions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecently, a parade of U.S. senators used a hearing to roast business leaders from Facebook, Google, and Twitter for their blasé attitude toward Russian “active measures,” for failing to flag Russian agents who paid for online political ads in rubles, and for the outsize influence the senators thought the three companies had. Senator John Kennedy (R., La.) asked Facebook’s general counsel, “Do you have a profile on me?” Then he ironically posted on his Facebook page a clip of him asking the question. Senator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) expressed shock that over a two-year period an estimated 126 million people, not the 10 million that Facebook had reported earlier, saw election-related disinformation from Russian operatives.\n\nBut before the hyperventilating makes the senators faint, let’s remember what that number is in context. Over the same two years, the average American came across 33 trillion pieces of content in their Facebook newsfeed. The average American saw Russian trolls in 0.004 percent of their content in Facebook’s newsfeed. That amounts to one of every 23,000 pieces of content. As columnist Peter Roff points out in U.S. News & World Report, “the idea that Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms are somehow to blame for the use they are put to by the Russians — or by trolls in another country working on their behalf — is akin to blaming the auto manufacturers for the fatalities that come as a result of drunk driving.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking forward, the real question is, How does the U.S. learn from its vulnerability and best take measures to limit future disinformation efforts? The tech companies, of course, should be encouraged to do much more on their own. Facebook, for example, is taking steps to weed out foreign propaganda on its platform. It also agreed to cooperate with the U.S. government on cybersecurity and is adding new safeguards against abuse of its advertising division.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we should also learn from what government and the media did during the Cold War to thwart Soviet efforts to undermine the Western alliance. Such efforts were an enormous part of the Soviet playbook. The BBC reports that by 1980 Moscow was spending $3 billion a year to destabilize America’s political system. It spread propaganda claiming that AIDS was the creation of a secret U.S. government program and that elements of the U.S. “deep state” intelligence agencies had ordered the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\nFormer KGB general Oleg Kalugin admitted that U.S. countermeasures were often effective in blunting the believability of Soviet propaganda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Soviets gained some traction for their efforts by taking genuine documents their spies had stolen from the West and adding false information to them. “We preferred to work on genuine documents with some additions and changes,” former KGB general Oleg Kalugin, a Soviet defector, told the BBC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder Ronald Regan’s administration, the U.S. fought such measure by setting up an “active measures working group,” with experts from many government agencies. Key officials worked directly with media outlets to identify that era’s versions of “fake news” and find ways to counter them. Ultimately, the Soviet efforts lost steam; Kalugin admitted that U.S. countermeasures were often effective in blunting the believability of the Soviet propaganda.\n\nToday we need to remember the lessons from the ’80s. The U.S. government never censored or regulated news reports that were based on KGB-tainted documents. Instead, it monitored the KGB’s activities and worked with media companies to combat falsified content.\n\nThat should also be the approach to today’s new challenges from Moscow. Rather than regulating the big technology companies in what would probably be a ham-handed, backward-looking way, the government should harness the nimble creativity of Silicon Valley and work with its innovators to once again successfully discredit Moscow’s efforts at subversion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nDid Russia’s Facebook Ad Buys Really Influence the Election?\n\nThe Difference Between the Trump and Clinton Investigations\n\nThe Democrats Role in the ‘Russian Dossier’",
  "latent_1952": "CAIRO, Egypt — Just days after the departure of former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak on Feb. 11, the nation’s new, self-appointed military leaders pledged, within six months, a swift transition to civilian rule.\n\nCrowds of the same protesters that demanded Mubarak’s ouster cheered as their army said it would steer the nation toward a “free, democratic system.” Seven months later, however, many Egyptians are finding that little has changed.\n\nAs the so-called Supreme Council of the Armed Forces increasingly cements, and in some cases flaunts, its firm grip on power, the revolution that inspired a region is beginning to look more like an old-fashioned military coup.\n\nMilitary trials of Egyptian civilians persist and the military leadership has expanded and extended the 30-year-old, widely criticized Emergency Law once used by Mubarak to justify his authoritarian tactics.\n\nMore: Egypt's continued state of emergency\n\nEgypt’s police chief even announced this month that security would use live ammunition on protesters thought to be illegally entering certain government buildings.\n\nAlthough the military leadership finally announced a date for the delayed parliamentary elections — Nov. 21 — few are optimistic that the vote will be either fair or help bring stability and security.\n\n\"It does not look like the army wants to transfer their power to a civilian government,” said Joshua Stacher, an Egypt expert and professor at Kent State University. “Just like any incumbent, they want to stay in office to preserve their interests.”\n\nThose interests include a sprawling business empire cultivated over the decades by the coutry's leaders, all of whom have been drawn from the Army's top brass. As the former commander of Egypt’s air force, Mubarak oversaw the sprawling military complex that owned — and still owns — countless private businesses.\n\nThe military runs “an economic empire within Egypt’s economy,” said Samir Soliman, a professor of political science at the American University in Cairo. For decades, Egypt’s army has profited from money invested in everything from bottled water factories to hospitals, to seaside resort hotels and clubs.\n\nNo one knows exactly how much of Egypt’s economy is controlled by the army, but most estimates place it in the “billions” of dollars range. The problem, said some analysts, is that the military likely wants to prevent the complete transition to civilian leadership to ensure its hold on these assets.\n\n“The military will never allow a civilian president to have oversight of their budget,” Stacher said. “And the Mubarak-style tactics to control dissent on the streets is one way for the military to consolidate its rule.”\n\nEgypt’s military-led caretaker government announced this week that the Emergency Law, which allows police the right to arrest without cause or warrant, will not be repealed until 2012.\n\nMore: In Egypt, things still done the Mubarak way\n\nThe military said the sweeping powers granted in the law were necessary to prevent the type of chaos that erupted on Sept. 9, when a mob of hundreds of Egyptians stormed the Israeli embassy in Cairo.\n\nActivists and opposition politicians responded by criticizing the military’s use of “scare tactics.” They argue that the state of emergency also gives security forces unfettered authority to intimidate workers on strike and forcibly quell peaceful protests.\n\nWael Ghonim, a former Google executive who became a visible youth activist during the uprising against Mubarak, recently pleaded with the military to quickly transfer power to an elected civilian authority.\n\n\"After weeks and months, the mode of governance in our nation has not fundamentally changed and the excuse has been 'stability,' and it did not matter if the result was stability at the bottom of the pit,\" wrote Ghonim in a Sept.16 open letter to the army posted on his Facebook account.\n\nSome experts believe that Egypt’s military advisors simply may not know anything other than the exertion of power through brute force. The current leaders running the country, after all, also ruled during Mubarak's three decades in office.\n\nMohamed Tantawi, the de facto head of state, was Mubarak's former minister of defense and a close ally.\n\n\"The poor transitional leadership is definitely the result of self interest by a military led by former regime members,” Soliman said. “But it is also sheer ignorance on their part. The role of the army has always been to fight, not to govern.\"\n\nWhether for nefarious reasons or because of downright ineptitude, the military government appears to be setting a political course that closely resembles the country’s autocratic past, experts said.\n\nMiddle East: Arab magazine breaks taboo with bikini cover photo\n\nHuman rights groups in Egypt have described recent crackdowns on the independent press as evidence that the “Mubarak regime persists” to this day.\n\nSeveral satellite channels — including one run by Al Jazeera — had their licenses revoked earlier this month for operating without the proper permits, according to Egypt’s information minister. Similar steps were taken in the months before the country’s last widely disputed parliamentary elections in 2010.\n\n“It should be noted that in the run-up to the 2010 elections, the most infamous in Egypt’s history, the Mubarak regime launched an all-out attack on various forms of media … impeding their ability to monitor the elections and expose irregularities,” the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies said in a press release on Sept. 19.\n\nMeanwhile, Egypt’s revolutionaries have become increasingly fatigued by months of small-scale demonstrations and strikes that seem unable to foster swifter political reform.\n\nA recent protest against the expansion of Egypt’s emergency law drew only a few hundred activists outside the parliament building in downtown Cairo. Still, the diehard activists that led the charge during the January uprising say they will not quit.\n\n“This is normal for us to have ups and downs,” said human rights lawyer Ragia Omran at the demonstration outside Egypt’s parliament. “Our revolution is definitely not over. It’s still a work in progress.”\n\nThis story is presented by The GroundTruth Project.",
  "latent_2058": "Sign-up for the Urban Milwaukee daily email\n\nThe last six months have been a roller coaster for Wisconsin’s open records law. After the Legislature’s failed attack on the law over the Independence Day holiday, August brought a new threat.\n\nA little-known state board expanded the definition of “transitory records,” which can be immediately destroyed. Once this action was revealed, there was an impressive outcry from the public and that change was dialed back last month. But there is still cause for concern.\n\nThe state Public Records Board sets retention schedules for state and local government records. Retention is important—if records aren’t retained, they can’t be requested and obtained by the public. State law makes retention the rule, and records can be disposed of only if the Public Records Board grants permission. The board’s mandate is to “safeguard the legal, financial and historical interests of the state in public records.”\n\nBut in 2010, the board made the questionable decision to allow immediate deletion of some correspondence. Such “transitory records” were deemed of such temporary value as to not require any retention. State agency employees could simply delete these records after they were created, without any further oversight.\n\nOn August 24, 2015, the board held a meeting and expanded the transitory records category. Now it included not just correspondence, but other documents such as “interim files” and “recordings used for training purposes.”\n\nThe board’s meeting notice and minutes contained no indication of this change, later prompting the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council to file an Open Meetings complaint with the district attorney. The day after the new definition was passed, the Walker administration notified the Wisconsin State Journal that records it previously requested had already been destroyed as “transitory.”\n\nNews outlets then reported the Public Record Board’s actions, and the reaction was swift. Critics said the change undermined the records law and the public’s right to know, inviting abuse. They pointed out that records the board defined as “transitory” were actually of significant public interest. There were also concerns that whole categories of electronic communications would be deleted as “transitory.” The Public Records Board was flooded with nearly 1,900 emails.\n\nFortunately, the board listened. At a meeting in January, it rescinded its August decision to expand the definition of “transitory records.”\n\nBut the danger has not passed. The old, 2010 definition of “transitory records” is still in place. Records custodians can still immediately delete some correspondence. Comments from board members in January suggested they are resistant to eliminating this category, despite state law suggesting that no records can be instantly deleted.

  "latent_2361": "Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nTwo Gazan women were caught on Wednesday smuggling explosives from Gaza into Israel for Hamas. The sisters hid the weapons in medical supplies they had been given in Israel, after one had been treated here for cancer.\n\nLast month, Deputy Defense Minister Eli Ben-Dahan revealed that Hamas was using Gazan cancer victims as mules to smuggle money and gold into Israel to finance terrorist operations.\n\nEveryone remembers Wafa Samir Ibrahim al-Biss, the 21-year-old Palestinian woman from Gaza who in 2005 was caught wearing 10 kilo of explosives in her underwear, en route to blowup Soroka-University Medical Center in Beersheba where she was being treated for burns.She admitted to being recruited by Fatah’s Aksa Martyrs Brigade, and added that she had wanted to kill as many Israeli children in the hospital as possible.Despite the security risk, Israel annually allows tens of thousands of Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip for medical treatment in Israel (and in the West Bank and Jordan).I know this firsthand. For a decade I served as a public affairs and development officer at Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer, the largest hospital in the Middle East. At any given time, one-quarter of all patients in that institution’s Edmond and Lily Safra Children’s Hospital are Arabs from Gaza.Treating these children from enemy Hamastan is a complex humanitarian commitment that stems from compassion that is ingrained in Jewish history and tradition.The doctors and administrators at Sheba (and other Israeli hospitals that offer similar care to Palestinians from the West Bank, to Syrian refugees, and quietly, to Arabs from across the Mideast) are proud of their efforts.But it hurts when wicked forces exploit this professionalism and goodwill for nefarious purposes; when they abuse our humanitarian generosity to commit terrorism.I was eyewitness to the following sordid tale.Several years ago, there was an eight-year-old Palestinian boy ill with a rare form of cancer. He was clearly going to die without a bone marrow transplant, and was brought to Sheba.Sheba worked hard to obtain permission to enter Gaza and test the child’s relatives, until doctors found an 18-year-old brother who was an almost perfect bone marrow match. The problem was that Israeli authorities didn’t want to grant this brother entry to Israel for the operation, because he was a hard-core Hamas activist with ties to known terrorist operatives.Nevertheless, a number of doctors at the hospital successfully petitioned the Defense Ministry to grant special dispensation and allow the older brother into Israel, in order to save his little brother’s life.The older brother arrived late Friday afternoon.The doctors began the delicate procedure.Within a 24-hour window, the plan was to suppress the patient’s immune system, harvest the bone marrow from the donor brother, and carry out the transplant.But Friday night at midnight, when it was time for the donor brother to do his part, he was gone.Disappeared! The doctors went crazy. One nurse said: I saw two Shin Bet agents come and take him away. This was a death sentence for the sick eight-year-old Palestinian child.What do you do in the middle of the night? The hospital director called the Prime Minister’s Office (which oversees the security services).Where is my bone-marrow donor, he demanded to know! Within two hours, a very senior security official was on the line admitting that, yes, the Shin Bet took him away. You see, the Shin Bet had been taking precautions. It had been eavesdropping on the 18-year-old’s cellphone conversations.And from within the Israeli hospital to which he had been specially brought in order to save the life of his younger brother, this youthful Palestinian terrorist had been giving instructions on the phone to his Hamas handlers in Gaza on how to get past security at Sheba Medical Center and blow the place up.(The end of the story is that, despite this outrage, the director of the hospital asked that the young terrorist be returned to the hospital for a few hours in order to save the life of the eightyear- old. The Shin Bet brought him back at 4 a.m. in leg irons to donate bone marrow, and the doctors indeed managed to save his baby brother’s life. Then the 18-year-old terrorist was whisked away again.) Needless to say, this story makes the blood boil. It stings to be taken advantage of by radical Palestinians; to act with humanity and compassion, while our enemies act with inhumanity and cruelty.The story exacerbates our sense of isolation and demonization, when in fact, the demons are those would blow up an Israeli hospital that is going out of its way to treat Palestinians, and even Hamas family members. The story breeds Israeli indignation, rightfully and righteously so.It also adds to our chagrin about being unappreciated by the world. Let’s say I had told this story to a senior foreign journalist (something that wasn’t possible at the time) like The New York Times correspondent in Israel. Do you think the paper would have run the story? Do you think the paper would have made such a story – sympathetic to Israel and severely unflattering to Palestinians – a front-page feature? Unlikely. I can tell you from years as a professional spokesman for Israeli medical, academic, defense and diplomatic institutions just how difficult it is to get a story placed that doesn’t fit the conventional, politically correct line about Israel being the victimizer and the Palestinians the victims.A direct line runs between this bias and the suave op-ed article by Palestinian “leader and parliamentarian” Marwan Barghouti published in the Times this week.That paper never would have run an op-ed by convicted Taliban or al-Qaida terrorist sitting in Guantanamo Bay, and certainly not without correctly labeling him as a convicted mass murderer.So why didn’t the Times brand Barghouti in this way? Because doing so would be unflattering to the Palestinian national movement, and by inference too sympathetic to Israel.www.davidmweinberg.com\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_2507": "Greece is experiencing a dramatic rise in the number of refugees and migrants entering the country, exacerbating already deplorable living conditions on island camps.\n\n'Europe's dirty secret': officials on Chios scramble to cope with rising tensions Read more\n\nThe number of people arriving, across land and sea borders, has more than doubled since the beginning of the summer. Authorities estimate arrivals are now at their highest level since March 2016, with over 200 men, women and children being registered every day.\n\n“It is dramatic and it is the most vulnerable of the vulnerable coming in,” said Elias Pavlopoulos, who heads Médecins sans Frontières in Greece. “There are whole families fleeing war zones in Syria and Iraq. In the last few months our clinics have seen more people who have suffered violence, who are victims of rape, who have been tortured, than ever before.”\n\nDespite a pledge by EU member states in September 2015 to relocate 160,000 asylum seekers – including 106,000 from Greece and Italy – a mere 29,000 have been moved to other European countries so far. With the 28-nation bloc failing to meet the deadline set out in its own plan, mass demonstrations are expected in capitals across Europe this weekend.\n\nRefugees and migrants have been arriving in Greece not only on rickety boats from Turkey but by foot across the frontier between the two countries. On Wednesday, police announced 37 refugees – including 19 children - from Iraq, Syria, Eritrea and Afghanistan, had been dumped by smugglers on the national highway outside Thessaloniki.\n\nHuman rights groups are increasingly likening the situation to 2015, when, at the height of the migrant crisis that engulfed Europe, Greece saw close to a million people enter the country on onward journeys that often took them to Germany.\n\n“We’re living the days of 2015,” said Pantelis Dimitriou from Iliaktida, a local NGO on Lesbos operating accommodation and support centres for the newly arrived. “The flows have become huge. From around 50 to 60 in early July they are now at more than 200 every day. Maybe it is the German elections, maybe it is about Turkey’s [worsening] relations with the EU, or maybe this is the last push before winter, but something is going on.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Moria refugee camp on the eastern Greek island of Lesbos. Photograph: Petros Tsakmakis/AP\n\nMore worrying is the number of minors making the often treacherous journey to get to Greece. In a statement this week, Save the Children said around 40% of the new arrivals were under the age of 18. Over 1,500 unaccompanied minors are currently on waiting lists in Greece to be housed in child shelters.\n\nVisiting Athens for the screening of Sea Sorrow, a 73-minute documentary depicting the plight of refugees, directed by the British actor Vanessa Redgrave, the Labour peer Alf Dubs voiced his dismay. As the architect of a scheme announced last year to bring up to 3,000 child refugees to the UK, the increasingly febrile situation was deeply troubling, he said. Despite 40 children being eligible for transfer, none has taken place in 2017.\n\n“I am convinced the Greeks need far more help than they are getting from the international community,” he told the Guardian. “There simply aren’t the facilities or resources here to accommodate new arrivals. The least we should do in the UK is speed up the process of accepting children with families in Britain.” Some unaccompanied minors were “in utter despair, their lives on hold, waiting desperately for news”, he said.\n\nAbandoned and abused: the forgotten Syrian refugee children in a Greek island detention camp Read more\n\nRefugee flows dropped dramatically when a landmark accord aimed at stopping the influx was reached between the EU and Turkey in March 2016. In return for €6bn (£5.26bn) in aid – around €2bn every year – Ankara agreed to beef up patrols along its Aegean coast and, where necessary, turn back smuggler boats.\n\nThe latest surge is placing growing strain on Greece’s eastern Aegean islands where reception centres in Lesbos, Chios, Kos, Leros and Samos are vastly overstretched.\n\nMore than 60,000 people are marooned in Greece. Some 13,352 men, women and children, unable to move since the EU-Turkey deal was signed, are currently stranded on the islands, according to figures released by the Greek interior ministry on Thursday. Riots and violent outbursts in camps are common.\n\nIn Lesbos, the island on the frontline of the human drama in 2015, the main camp at Moria is currently at twice its holding capacity with 4,825 people registered. The centre is equipped to house no more than 1,800 according to the United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR. “In November last year we had reached a point where in Moria there were no more people living in tents,” said Dimitriou. “That was when we had a cycle of arrivals and departures, some coming but others also being transferred to the mainland.”\n\nConditions were made worse by the “bottleneck” that appeared as a result of refugee reunifications and relocations slowing down dramatically. “It’s like a perfect storm,” he said.\n\nFrustration has mounted amid donor fatigue and growing difficulty accessing funds to meet the increasing need for humanitarian aid on frontline islands.\n\nWith the state of emergency imposed at the height of the crisis officially rescinded, the Greek government assumed responsibility for services provided to asylum seekers in August, spurring NGOs to leave altogether. Authorities say around 99% of those who make it to Greece request asylum. “The Greek state moves very, very slowly,” said Dimitriou. “It’s impossible to address needs as they should be addressed.”",

(Tife Owolabi/European Pressphoto Agency)\n\nMortuaries on Sunday overflowed with the bodies of the at least 160 people killed in the collapse of a southern Nigeria church building whose construction, worshipers said, had been rushed.\n\nHundreds were inside Reigners Bible Church International in the city of Uyo on Saturday for the episcopal ordination of founder Akan Weeks when the metal girders fell and the corrugated iron roof caved in.\n\nScreaming survivors streamed out amid cries from the injured inside.\n\n“There were trapped bodies, parts of bodies, blood all over the place, and people’s handbags and shoes scattered,” said computer analyst Ukeme Eyibio.\n\nAmong the survivors were Weeks and Udom Emmanuel, the governor of Akwa Ibom state, which contains Uyo.\n\nEyibio had parked his car outside the complex to make a phone call when he heard a deafening crash and saw the church had disappeared.\n\nHe and three others dragged 10 injured people from an overflow area for worshipers just outside the collapsed church. They did not enter the main structure because a construction worker warned that it was not safe.\n\nThe worker called his boss at a nearby construction company, which sent a crane to lift debris off bodies.\n\nWhile waiting for the crane, Eyibio helped a man whose legs were trapped under a girder.\n\n“I rushed to my car, got out the tire jack and used that to get the beam off his legs,” the 27-year-old said.\n\nMany of the dead were taken to private mortuaries scattered across the city, youth leader Edikan Peters said. Some people took the bodies of relatives to their homes because of the overcrowding.\n\nPeters said he counted 90 bodies removed from the church before he was told to stop his tally Saturday night. Journalists also said church officials sought to prevent them from documenting the tragedy, trying to seize cameras and forcing some to leave the area.\n\nThe church was still under construction and workers had been rushing to finish it in time for Saturday’s ceremony, congregants said. The governor’s spokesman, Ekerete Udoh, said the state government will investigate whether any building standards were compromised.\n\nBuildings collapse often in Nigeria because of endemic corruption that allows contractors to use substandard materials and bribe inspectors to ignore shoddy work or a lack of permits.\n\nIn 2014, 116 people died when a multistory guesthouse of the Synagogue Church of All Nations collapsed in Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city.

  "latent_2604": "Dukhtar captures both the creative triumphs and failings of this exciting and evolving stage of Pakistani cinema.\n\nI recently met someone who had become a parent again, after a very long period. They joked that it felt as if their excuse for having a child after so long was because “perhaps we had forgotten how to make one for all these years in between.”\n\nIt was a thought I returned to when thinking about Pakistani cinema for this piece. The much-abused term for describing the current stream of local films – “revival” – is still an accurate one. It makes reference to the fact that a generation or two ago, the cinema was a very integral medium of ideas in our society. Films shaped how we saw the world and how we saw ourselves, but then we seemed to forget how to make them for a while.\n\nDukhtar is a film from a time when this revival is still figuring itself out – not just in terms of ideas, but also in terms of infrastructure, finances, resources, logistics and much more. In most cinematic cultures, Dukhtar would be called an ‘independent’ film, or an example of ‘parallel cinema’. Yet in Pakistan’s context, the labels don’t make sense in the way they are meant because these are essentially describing the economics and financing of a film’s production. The history of alternative or new-wave cinematic movements is almost always a response to the commercial driven approach of studios. But with the film industry yet to be even established, one can’t begin to talk about a commercial approach, let alone reacting to one.\n\nDukhtar captures both the creative triumphs and failings of this exciting and evolving stage of Pakistani cinema. It is a film that defies the obvious and takes risks with its narrative, yet it is also one that gets stuck in its pacing and abrupt in its plot turns. It is a film with three very different acting performances and some of the most eloquent cinematography seen in recent films. It is often referred to as a film about child marriages but really it is a film about a road trip.\n\nThe road-trip involves Allah Rakhi (Samiya Mumtaz), her daughter Zainab (Saleha Aref) and a truck driver named Sohail (Mohib Mirza). The mother and daughter have run away from home to escape Zainab’s marriage to a much older man, and Sohail is the person who reluctantly agrees to help them on their way. Throughout their journey, they are being chased by a variety of murderous men looking to reclaim the lost honour.\n\nThe plot of the film has a gentle, drifting narrative to it – particularly in the opening half – and its triumph is its refusal to be weighed down with platitudes or over-wrought messages. The plot is also deft with various symbols, with the suspense and chase of the mountainous part of the journey giving way towards a suggested, wistful romance as the road opens out into the plains. Yet the dialogues rarely do justice to the implicit ideas, often saying them out rather than suggesting them. Similarly, the plot’s pacing is often quite abrupt – this is used to brilliant effect in the scene when the escape takes place but later on in the film the approach struggles to segue from one set of ideas to the next.\n\nIn terms of the acting, the star performance is by young Saleha, whose role for Zainab was both written well and performed with a sincere naivety. Her precocious-ness was also the most ideal statement on the terrible nature of child marriages, and in that sense her performance made so much of the film’s ideas come to life. Samiya Mumtaz and Mohib Mirza are both in roles that are set up well to work as contrasts. Allah Rakhi’s simple yet fierce determination is her only protection from being extremely vulnerable, while Sohail’s magnanimity is the only example of a trustworthy male in the script. Samiya’s consider-able experience in television and theater leads to a performance delivered through implication, while Mohib’s versatile background shows in his extroverted acting. Yet somehow the tenor for both these roles and their performances never seems to reach a perfect pitch, and that is one of the film’s biggest flaws. Beyond the three leads, both Ajab Gul and Adnan Shah deliver a couple of very enjoyable cameos as the henchmen who form the chasing party.\n\nThe film’s greatest triumph is the cinematography, and it is one that deserves to be seen on the silver screen. Despite being shot on limited digital cameras and in very quick time, the film’s shots are regularly breathtaking. The journey in a gorgeous bejeweled truck through the mountains and plains into the dusty, colourful streets of Lahore is a delight throughout. The opening half is also notable for how often the shots are working to tell most of the story. The use of light, colour and space is repeatedly apparent and speaks of a maturity that one wouldn’t expect just yet.\n\nWhile the soundtrack itself has some good songs, its use in the film was another sore point, since it often lacked the subtlety with which the frame had been composed and shot. Too often the songs seemed to flit in and out rather than make an impression. On the other hand though, what was very pleasing to see was that the dialogues and sound design were all recorded quite well. The glaring lack of facilities and personnel had meant that uneven, choppy or just poorly conceived sound was a regular feature of almost all the Pakistani films released last year.\n\nPerhaps the most refreshing feature of this film was that unwittingly or not, it proved that there are still no set templates or identifiable rules for how to make a film in Pakistan. There are just so many stories, which haven’t had a chance to be heard in so long, and this is finally a chance for some of them to come out. Dukhtar is a film with several important flaws but they do not drown out the film’s simple and plentiful achievements.\n\nDirector: Afia Nathaniel\n\nRating: 3/5",
  "latent_2614": "U.S. President Barack Obama is trailed by Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, right, as he arrives to speak in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Friday, July 18, 2014. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\nWhen NBC News White House reporter Chuck Todd conducts background interviews with government officials these days, he and his source usually aren’t the only ones in the room or on the call. Typically, there’s a third party: A representative of the White House’s press staff monitors the conversation.\n\nSometimes, the press monitor interjects to clarify a point the official makes. Other times, he or she remains silent. Each time, however, “it feels like having a third wheel on a date,” Todd says. “It’s like having a chaperon.” He adds, “There’s so much precaution now in the way people in power interact with the press.”\n\nThe press-minder phenomenon isn’t limited to the White House. Reporters who cover other parts of official Washington, such as Capitol Hill, can usually count on encountering an official escort, turning a one-on-one interview into a one-on-two. The same thing happens irregularly to journalists who interview sports, entertainment and business figures.\n\nBut the White House — perhaps the single most intensely covered institution in the United States — may be the most diligent user of the chaperoned interview. Almost every officially sanctioned exchange between reporters and the proverbial “senior administration officials” is conducted in the presence of a press staffer, even when the interview is “on background,” meaning the source will not be identified by name. Even lesser officials are subject to the policy; one reporter says a press attendant sat in when she interviewed Sam Kass, the chef who advises first lady Michelle Obama on her “Let’s Move!” health and nutrition program.\n\nThis week, White House press secretary Josh Earnest complained that The Washington Post had relied too heavily on anonymous sources in a story about how officials had ignored warnings of a budding immigration crisis.\n\nImplicit in Earnest’s comment: If every interview was attended by a White House press monitor, there would be no anonymous sources.\n\nJournalists tend to view minders with suspicion, if not outright alarm. A third party can alter any interaction in unforeseen ways. One White House reporter notes with irritation that minders have sometimes cut off contentious questioning or otherwise interrupted the flow of conversation.\n\nMore broadly, journalists see it as part of a larger official effort to shape their coverage, similar to demands to approve quotes before they’re published or to keep even the most mundane information off the record.\n\n“If you have a minder there, it sits in [a source’s] brain that they’re supposed to stay on message,” said Peter Baker, who covers the White House for the New York Times. “They’re less likely to share something other than the talking points.” Having minders around, Baker says, “is obviously intended to control the message. Let’s put it this way: It’s not intended to increase candor.”\n\nVeteran reporters such as Baker recall a time when the middlemen stayed out of the picture. During the Clinton administration, Baker says, he would call Gene Sperling, then a young economic adviser, and chat freely with him. But as director of the National Economic Council under President Obama, Sperling referred Baker’s calls to the press office, following protocols discouraging unauthorized contacts with the news media. “He [was] operating within the system,” Baker says. “He doesn’t want to violate it.”\n\nBaker acknowledges that there isn’t much journalists can do about it. With dozens of reporters clamoring for interviews each day, the White House can dictate its terms of engagement. And often the terms include a minder.\n\nOne reporter says she beats the minder system by calling officials at home or on their cellphones on weekends. After doing so, she’ll cover her tracks and her source’s by requesting an “official” interview with the person she’s already interviewed. If her request is approved, she and her source will pretend that they haven’t spoken previously.\n\nOther reporters say officials are often happy to have a minder present because it gives them cover in the event they are suspected of leaking information to the news media.\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz declined repeated requests for an interview to discuss the administration’s policies about interviews. Instead, he e-mailed a statement:\n\n“As does almost every enterprise, we do this sometimes, particularly when the [interview subject] does not have a lot of experience dealing with reporters on a day-to-day basis. This can help for two reasons: First, press staff handling the story can hear the interview, be aware of exchanges, any remaining questions, etc. If reporters are conducting multiple interviews, it would make sense that staff are aware of all of the information going to the journalist. Second, this helps make sure previously-agreed upon ground-rules are observed, and that someone who doesn’t have experience dealing with reporters is not put in the position of trying to negotiate press mechanics,” such as the distinctions among on the record, off the record and “on background.”\n\nIn fact, minding isn’t necessarily about the interview itself but about its aftermath.\n\n“It’s Media Relations 101,” says Michael Feldman, the founder and managing director of the Glover Park Group, a Washington-based communications firm. Feldman was a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. “Having an extra set of eyes and ears on the interaction between a journalist and a subject is helpful. . . . It’s more to stay ahead of the game by being aware of what’s happening in the interview. If my client says something particularly newsworthy, I want to know it as it’s happening because I want to be prepared” to respond after the information becomes public.\n\nIn corporate settings, there’s no uniform policy on minders, says Ben Feller, a managing director of Mercury, a New York-based media-strategy company. Some public-relations firms urge their clients to take along an adviser for interviews, he said. But others don’t feel it is necessary.\n\n“If a consultant is in the room,” he says, “it should be in a secondary role, to help with follow-up requests that might come up in discussions, or to establish a sense of introduction that could help the conversation go even better for the client and reporter. Often my counsel is that we should not have a consultant in the room.”\n\nFeller has been both minder and the minded. As chief White House correspondent for the Associated Press until early last year, he was part of a reporting team that interviewed President George W. Bush in the Oval Office; he also interviewed President Obama twice. Each president was accompanied in the interview by the White House press secretary, but Feller didn’t feel put off by the minder’s presence. He also had many interviews with lesser White House officials, both accompanied and not.\n\n“Professional reporters are still going to ask whatever they want,” Feller said, “and presidents are certainly going to answer however they want. What matters is what happens between the reporter and the interviewee. And if you’re operating at that level as a reporter, you better not be worried about who is sitting in the room. In the private sector, I think the issue is not whether a consultant is in the room but what that person does in the room.”\n\nFeller says that an interview subject who is well informed and ready for an interview doesn’t really need the hand-holding a minder might provide. “The most important factor is what happens before the interview,” he says. “The preparation is what’s essential. . . . You think through the most important points. You ensure reporters have facts in advance, particularly baseline dates or data that could bog an interview down. You demystify the interview process and prepare clients well for it. And then you let it happen, unfettered, as it should be.”\n\nNBC’s Todd says he can understand some of the “paranoia” an interview subject may feel about talking to a reporter and why a subject might want an ally in the room. In the age of social media, he notes, an inflammatory or erroneous comment can go viral quickly, damaging or even destroying the speaker’s career. In such an environment, having a third party to keep the record straight or to reinforce the ground rules might be a good idea.\n\nTodd knows the drill. He’s been interviewed by journalists, too. And on many occasions, a press representative from NBC minded his conversation.",

The state gains a new U.S. House seat and more clout overall in Washington, D.C.\n\nFOR Washingtonians who revel in the idea of the state gaining clout on the national stage, and for politicians clamoring for high-profile positions, Santa Claus arrived a few days early at the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nWashington's population grew by 14 percent during the past decade, above the national average of 9.7 percent, and enough to give the state a 10th congressional district seat. It's a bona fide big deal for Washington and other states in the South and West, such as Texas, Florida, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, South Carolina and Utah, which have seen their influence in Congress increase in recent years.\n\nPoliticians from the East, who used to stick their noses up at our seemingly dinky state in the far Northwest corner of the country, need to show a little respect — and pay more attention to our issues. Washington also gains an Electoral College vote and a slightly larger slice of the federal grant pie, which is apportioned on the basis of population.\n\nPublic officials who look for places to move up and see most positions frozen or spoken for surely are cheering this mini bonanza.\n\nAfter all, in the U.S. Senate, Democrat Patty Murray is solid for the next six years; and no name Republican has emerged in early chatter to challenge Democrat Maria Cantwell in 2012.\n\nYes, there will be mobility in the governor's office, but many seats in Congress and elsewhere are taken by incumbents who, after a few cycles, become very difficult to beat.\n\nSo the 10th seat, expected to be in the populous Puget Sound region, maybe including Olympia, will stir excitement. The 3rd District of Southwest Washington and the 8th District of eastern King and Pierce counties are overpopulated and likely to be part of the coming change.\n\nMaybe TVW co-founder Denny Heck, who ran for Congress in the 3rd and was one of the best candidates The Times editorial board interviewed this past election season, will make another run for Congress, along with others.\n\nThe next step is the arduous process of redistricting under the auspices of the Washington State Redistricting Commission. House and Senate caucus leaders each pick a delegate and those four select a fifth nonvoting chair.\n\nBefore the seat was announced, Senate Majority Leader Lisa Brown appointed former Seattle deputy mayor Tim Ceis. House Speaker Frank Chopp tapped Dean Foster, former chief clerk of the House and former chief of staff to Gov. Booth Gardner, to the panel. Republicans get two picks but have not announced yet.\n\nAll 50 states are assured at least one House seat among the 435 members of Congress. The remaining seats are apportioned by population.

  "latent_2847": "REPORT: DNC IT Aide Imran Awan Bragged He Could Have People Tortured\n\nWith each passing day, we learn more and more about the dark and murky past of Pakistani IT staffer Imran Awan. The former employee of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz is accused of stealing hardware from ranking Democrats and sending sensitive intel to foreign groups like the Muslim Brotherhood. A new reports says Awan was “sending money and gifts to government officials in Pakistan and received protection from the Pakistani police, multiple relatives claim.”\n\nDaily Caller reports:\n\nA now-indicted IT aide to various House Democrats was sending money and gifts to government officials in Pakistan and received protection from the Pakistani police, multiple relatives claim. A Democratic aide also said Imran Awan personally bragged to him that he could have people tortured in Pakistan. Awan’s lawyer acknowledged that he was sending money to a member of the Faisalabad police department, but said there was a good explanation. The relatives said Awan and his brothers were also sending IT equipment, such as iPhones, to the country during the same period in which fraudulent purchase orders for that equipment were allegedly placed in the House, and in which congressional equipment apparently went missing.\n\nAnother report by the Daily Caller’s Luke Rosiak reveals Imran Awan, former IT aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, abused multiple women. Under Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act, Rosiak obtained police records detailing the harrowing experiences of abuse at the hands of Awan.\n\nDaily Caller reports:\n\nMultiple women in relationships with Imran Awan, the indicted former IT aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, have recently called Virginia law enforcement and alleged being abused by him, police reports obtained under Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act show. Officers found one of the women bloodied and she told them she “just wanted to leave,” while the second said she felt like a “slave,” according to Fairfax County Police reports obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group. A third woman claimed she was being kept “in captivity.” The third woman is Awan’s stepmother, Samina Gilani, who said in court documents that Awan invoked his authority as a congressional employee to intimidate immigrant women, in part by telling them he had the power to have people kidnapped.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/lukerosiak/status/910682363792969728?ref_src=twsrc% 5Etfw&ref_url=http% 3A% 2F% 2Fwww.thegatewaypundit.com% 2F2017% 2F09% 2Ffelt-like-slave-police-records-reveal-imran-awan-abused-multiple-women% 2F\n\nAs TGP previously reported, we are now hearing rumblings that the Awans could receive immunity in exchange for dirt on Wasserman Schultz, according to Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ).\n\nHere is the video from Lou Dobbs Tonight:\n\nZerohedge reports:\n\nBut, at least according to Congressman Trent Franks (R-AZ) who appeared on Fox News recently, there may be more to Alvi’s return than meets the eye as he predicts that the Awans could be working on a broader immunity deal with prosecutors in return for a “significant” and “pretty disturbing” story about Debbie Wasserman Schultz. “I don’t want to talk out of school here but I think you’re going to see some revelations that are going to be pretty profound. The fact that this wife is coming back from Pakistan and is willing to face charges, as it were, I think there is a good chance she is going to reach some type of immunity to tell a larger story here that is going to be pretty disturbing to the American people.” “I would just predict that this is going to be a very significant story and people should fasten their seat belts on this one.”",
  "latent_2889": "'War on Terror' poll for BBC World Service [2MB] Most computers will open this document automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here US-led efforts to tackle the al-Qaeda group are not regarded as successful, an opinion poll carried out for the BBC World Service suggests. Some 29% of people said the \"war on terror\" launched by President George W Bush in 2001 had had no effect on the Islamist militant network. According to 30% of those surveyed, US policies have strengthened al-Qaeda. The most commonly held view of al-Qaeda in the 23 nations polled was a negative one - except in Egypt and Pakistan. Terror stalemate Asked who is winning \"the conflict between al-Qaeda and the US\", 49% said neither side while 22% believed the US had gained the upper hand. Just 10% said al-Qaeda was winning. The US made al-Qaeda a prime target in its \"war on terror\" BBC defence analyst Rob Watson said the overall verdict across the world appeared to be that the war on terror had produced something of a stalemate. The next question the pollsters asked was: \"Do you think what US leaders refer to as the 'war on terror' has made al-Qaeda stronger, weaker or has had no effect either way?\" Just 22% said US action had made the organisation weaker - that figure rising to 34% in the US itself. Losing hearts and minds? Our correspondent says there is plenty in this survey to worry the governments of Egypt and Pakistan. When asked \"overall would you say your feelings about al-Qaeda are positive, negative or mixed\", some 60% of Egyptians said they had either a positive or mixed view. Analysts say the group continues to have many Egyptians among its leaders. Meanwhile in Pakistan, where much of the battle against al-Qaeda is being fought, just 19% said they had a negative view of Osama Bin Laden's organisation. Doug Miller, from polling agency Globescan, said the findings from Egypt and Pakistan were \"yet another indicator that the US 'war on terror' is not winning hearts and minds\". Some 24,000 adults across 23 countries were polled for the BBC World Service between 8 July and 12 September.\n\nE-mail this to a friend Printable version Bookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?",
  "latent_2908": "Pre-strike activity\n\nTarget\n\nThe Operation\n\nIsraeli official statements\n\nSyrian reaction\n\nInternational reactions\n\nRelease of intelligence\n\nOn 10 October 2007, The New York Times reported that the Israelis had shared the Syrian strike dossier with Turkey. In turn, the Turks traveled to Damascus and confronted the Syrians with the dossier, alleging a nuclear program. Syria denied this with vigor, saying that the target was a storage depot for strategic missiles.[80] On 25 October 2007, The New York Times reported that two commercial satellite photos taken before and after the raid showed that a square building no longer exists at the suspected site.[81] On 27 October 2007, The New York Times reported that the imaging company Geoeye released an image of the building from 16 September 2003, and from this security analyst John Pike estimated that construction began in 2001. \"A senior intelligence official\" also told The New York Times that the U.S. has observed the site for years by spy satellite.[82] Subsequent searches of satellite imagery discovered that an astronaut aboard the International Space Station had taken a picture of the area on 5 September 2002. The image, though of low resolution, is good enough to show that the building existed as of that date. A screenshot of a CIA computer model of the Syrian nuclear reactor at Al Kibar. On 11 January 2008, DigitalGlobe released a satellite photo showing that a building similar to the suspected target of the attack had been rebuilt in the same location.[83] However, an outside expert said that it was unlikely to be a reactor and could be cover for excavation of the old site.[84] On 1 April 2008, Asahi Shimbun reported that Ehud Olmert told Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda during a meeting on 27 February that the target of the strike was \"nuclear-related facility that was under construction with know-how and assistance from North Korean technicians dispatched by Pyongyang.\"[85] On 24 April 2008, the CIA released a video[86] and background briefing,[87] which it claims shows similarities between the North Korean nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and the one in Syria which was bombed by Israel.[88] According to a U.S. official, there did not appear to be any uranium at the reactor, and although it was almost completed, it could not have been declared operational without significant testing.[89] A statement from the White House Press Secretary on 24 April 2008, followed the briefing given to some Congressional committees that week. According to the statement, the administration believed that Syria had been building a covert reactor with North Korean assistance that was capable of producing plutonium, and that the purpose was non-peaceful. It was also stated that the IAEA was being briefed with the intelligence.[90] The IAEA confirmed receipt of the information, and planned to investigate. It was critical of not being informed earlier, and described the unilateral use of force as \"undermining the due process of verification\".[91] Syrian officials, however, denied any North Korean involvement in their country. According to the BBC, Syria's ambassador to the UK, Sami Khiyami, dismissed the allegations as ridiculous. \"We are used to such allegations now, since the day the United States has invaded Iraq – you remember all the theatrical presentations concerning the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\" Mr Khiyami said the facility was a deserted military building that had \"nothing to do with a reactor\".[92] On 21 March 2018, Israel formally acknowledged the operation and released newly declassified materials including photographs and cockpit video of the airstrike.[16]\n\nInitial skepticism about the US and Israeli claims\n\nDespite the release of intelligence information from the American and Israeli sources, the attack on the Syrian site was initially controversial. Some commentators had argued that at the time of the attack the site had no obvious barbed wire or air defenses that would normally ring a sensitive military facility.[93] Mohammed ElBaradei had previously stated that Syria's ability to construct and run a complex nuclear process was doubtful—speaking ahead of the IAEA inspection of the alleged Syrian nuclear site, which has been demolished, he said: \"It is doubtful we will find anything there now, assuming there was anything in the first place.\"[94] The New York Times reported that after the publishing of US intelligence data on 24 April, \"two senior intelligence officials acknowledged that the evidence had left them with no more than \"low confidence\" that Syria was preparing to build a nuclear weapon. However, while they said that there was no sign that Syria had built an operation to convert the spent fuel from the plant into weapons-grade plutonium, they had told President Bush last year that they could think of no other explanation for the reactor.\"[95] BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Jonathan Marcus commented on the release of the CIA video that \"Briefings about alleged weapons of mass destruction programmes have a lot to live down in the wake of the US experience in Iraq\".[96]\n\nAftermath\n\nIAEA investigation On 19 November 2008, IAEA released a report[97] which said the Syrian complex bore features resembling those of an undeclared nuclear reactor and UN inspectors found \"significant\" traces of uranium at the site. The report said the findings gleaned from inspectors' visit to the site in June were not enough to conclude a reactor was once there. It said further investigation and greater Syrian transparency were needed. The confidential nuclear safeguards report said Syria would be asked to show to inspectors debris and equipment whisked away from the site after the September 2007 Israeli air raid.[98] On 19 February 2009, the IAEA reported that samples taken from the site revealed new traces of processed uranium. A senior UN official said additional analysis of the June find had found 40 more uranium particles, for a total of 80 particles, and described it as significant. He added that experts were analyzing minute traces of graphite and stainless steel found at and near the site, but said that it was too early to relate them to nuclear activity. The report noted Syria's refusal to allow agency inspectors to make follow-up visits to sites suspected of harboring a secret nuclear program despite repeated requests from top agency officials.[99] Syria disputed these claims. According to Syria's IAEA representative Othman, there would have been a large amount of graphite had the building been a nuclear reactor. Othman continued, \"They found 80 particles in half a million tonnes of soil. I don't know how you can use that figure to accuse somebody of building such a facility.\"[15] In a November 2009 report, the IAEA stated that its investigation had been stymied due to Syria's failure to cooperate.[14] The following February, under the new leadership of Yukiya Amano, the IAEA stated that \"The presence of such [uranium] particles points to the possibility of nuclear-related activities at the site and adds to questions concerning the nature of the destroyed building. ... Syria has yet to provide a satisfactory explanation for the origin and presence of these particles\".[100] Syria disputed these allegations, saying that there is not a military nuclear program in the country and that it has the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, especially in the field of nuclear medicine. Syria's foreign minister said, \"We are committed to the non-proliferation agreement between the agency and Syria and we (only) allow inspectors to come according to this agreement. ... We will not allow anything beyond the agreement because Syria does not have a military nuclear program. Syria is not obliged to open its other sites to inspectors.\"[101] Syria maintains that the natural uranium found at the site came from Israeli missiles.[102] On 28 April 2010, the head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano declared for the first time that the target was indeed the covert site of a future nuclear reactor, countering Syrian assertions.[103] The site during Syrian Civil War During the civil war in Syria, the reactor site fell to the Islamic State group in 2015, which had controlled it for nearly two years. Currently the site is located inside the territory controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces since 2017.[104] Claiming responsibility On 22 March 2018, The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) took responsibility for destroying a nuclear reactor built in the northeastern Syrian province of Deir al-Zor in 2007 after a decade of ambiguity.[105]\n\nSee also\n\nReferences",
  "latent_3003": "Value-added estimates of teacher effectiveness vary depending on the controls and statistical regressions chosen, points out a report released yesterday that uses the Los Angeles Times' controversial teacher-rating project as a case study.\n\nUsing the same data set as the newspaper, the report from the National Education Policy Center re-runs the data using a different value-added model, and reaches quite different conclusions about which teachers are effective. According to its analysis of the data, 46.5 percent of teachers in reading stayed in the same quintile of effectiveness under the NEPC model as in L.A. Times' model, while 60.5 percent teachers in math stayed in the same quintile.\n\nThe group says that the differences are due to the L.A. Times' method, which it contends didn't account for potentially important factors, like teacher \"peer effects,\" a longer history of student achievement, and additional school factors. The NEPC, which has generally been critical of value-added measures of teacher effectiveness, claims that this analysis undermines the L.A. Times' project.\n\nIt also finds evidence that the value-added method couldn't account for the non-random assignment of students to teachers, a problem researchers like Jesse Rothstein of Berkeley have also highlighted.\n\nBut L.A. Times officials said that the NEPC review didn't acknowledge that the newspaper excluded some 5,000 teachers from its analysis for some of the reasons indicated in the NEPC study.\n\nNEPC receives funding from a National Education Association-funded think tank, the Great Lakes Center. The L.A. Times reporter covering the NEPC report is the same one who spearheaded the paper's series using value-added data. I'll leave you all to start the requisite finger pointing.\n\nThere is clearly an awful lot of he-said-she-said going on here, so for another view, check Nick Anderson's write-up in The Washington Post. He quotes several statisticians who note that there's no research consensus about which value-added regressions, methods, and controls make for the \"best\" or most reliable, precise, and accurate form of teacher measurement.\n\nThe NEPC study makes this point, too: \"Our sensitivity analysis indicates that the effects\n\nestimated for LAUSD teachers can be quite sensitive to choices concerning the underlying statistical model.\"\n\nThat's a different issue from whether they should be used at all and to what extent, which has gotten most of the ink. But it's an important thing to think about as more and more states and districts begin this work.\n\nI've made this observation before, but it bears repeating: If value-added is to be a part of teacher evaluations—and not end up in the courts—then all parties involved, like school leaders, unions, teachers, and principals, are probably going to have to sort through all the various options and formally agree on the formulas to be used.",
  "latent_3087": "Allison Jones, The Canadian Press\n\nTORONTO -- The union for jail guards and probation officers will meet with the Ontario government Friday in a last-ditch attempt at reaching a contract deal ahead of a looming strike date.\n\nSmokey Thomas, the president of the Ontario Public Service Employees Union, said the two sides have agreed to meet with a mediator ahead of Sunday at 12:01 a.m., when the workers are in legal strike position.\n\nThe government, meanwhile, has been making contingency plans in the event of a strike to have managers from other areas of the public service help keep the jails and probation offices running.\n\nMost direct contact with inmates \"will be handled and overseen by experienced corrections managers,\" said a spokeswoman, but Thomas is worried that the government will be woefully unprepared to run the jails and monitor offenders on parole and probation.\n\n\"I think they think they can handle it, but I truly fear they're going to be horribly mistaken and I just pray it's not with tragic results,\" Thomas said.\n\nThe last time Ontario's jail guards were on strike was in 2002, during a 54-day strike by civil servants. Disturbances broke out across the province's jails, ranging from outright riots to inmates breaking windows and setting fires. Managers desperately tried to keep inmates, on lockdown, in line with pizza and porn, the union charged.\n\nNurses, maintenance workers and kitchen staff who work in jails are covered by the general public service contract, not the separate corrections bargaining unit, so they will be expected to report for duty. But Thomas said he is instructing them not to go in until they are satisfied the managers running the jails during a strike can ensure their safety.\n\nStrike preparations have long been in the works, as the correctional and probation workers have been without a contract since December 2014, with the government spending $8.5 million on training and renovating spaces in the jails.\n\nThe government refused to give specifics of how that $8.5 million was spent, but the union said they have put in living quarters for the managers to run the jails on a 24-hour basis, placed trailers on some jail grounds and trucked in refrigerated containers of frozen food.\n\nThe \"infrastructure improvements\" were designed to be repurposed following a possible strike for such uses as new programming space for inmates, said Annie Donolo, a spokeswoman for Treasury Board President Deb Matthews.\n\nThe OPSEU correctional workers rejected an earlier tentative settlement that would have seen no wage increase for the first year of the deal -- the year that just concluded -- a lump sum this year and a 1.4 per cent raise next year.\n\nThomas said one of the members' main sticking points is that they want to be declared an essential service. That would mean they lose the right to strike, but their contracts would go to binding arbitration and their pay would move toward parity with police officers and firefighters.\n\nThe workers also want language in the contract to address overcrowding and understaffing in jails, Thomas said.\n\nJennifer French, the NDP's corrections critic, has been visiting jails and probation offices over the past few weeks and said that she has seen double-, triple- and even quadruple-bunking. In the event of a strike she said she worries not just about safety in jails, but in the community, where violent and sex offenders on probation are monitored.\n\n\"The premier and the minister are playing chicken with community safety,\" she said.",

The team will be led by US soccer legend John Harkes, who is making his debut as the head coach of a professional club. Harkes has assembled a roster replete with experience in the USL and NASL. Having skilled players with a knowledge of the league should get FC Cincinnati started on a forward foot in its inaugural season.\n\nFC Cincinnati has not been on the wrong side of the score line in five preseason matches. The club returned from the IMG Suncoast Pro Classic in Bradenton, Florida with a championship trophy, having vanquished NYCFC and Danish club HB Køge. Since returning north, the club has drawn Indy Eleven and defeated Xavier University. Preseason results have no direct bearing on the regular season, but FC Cincinnati has gained invaluable experience while building chemistry, confidence, and momentum.\n\nWhy you should watch FC Cincinnati in 2016: Exerted efforts at marketing and a bevy of sponsors have led outspoken critics to label FC Cincinnati as plastic. The naysayers need only to pay attention as the season progresses to find out that club has substance. Too much talent has been assembled for the club to flop, and Harkes has so far demonstrated the flexibility to get that talent on the field in creative ways. A groundswell of support, evidenced by strong season ticket sales, will help to provide an enjoyable gameday experience at Nippert Stadium.\n\n3 Players to watch\n\nPat McMahon: The left back comes to Cincinnati after being a stalwart on the back line for the best defense in the history of the league, the 2015 USL Champion Rochester Rhinos. If the rest of the Cincinnati defense plays on par with McMahon, it will be a frustrating season for the opposition.\n\nCorben Bone: After two seasons of relatively lackluster statistical output for Wilmington Hammerheads FC, a change of scenery may have been what the midfielder required. Bone has performed well in preseason, providing the link in the FC Cincinnati attack and scoring on a spectacular volley. He has also demonstrated a modicum of versatility by lying deep in the formation and playing defensively.\n\nMitch Hildebrandt: The man guarding the goal could be the biggest wild-card for FC Cincinnati this season. Hildebrandt has three years of professional experience with Minnesota United, but he only made 15 appearances for the NASL side. His ability to steer his outfield mates into position and the ball out of the net will be imperative.\n\nThe 2016 season will be a success if... FC Cincinnati finishes near the top of the USL Eastern Conference table and completely outpaces the rest of the conference at the gate. The club's operating budget is matched only by its lofty aspirations, which include the desire to be invited to join a future MLS expansion class. The only hope of transforming fantasy into reality is by approximating the success that Sacramento Republic FC achieved on and off the pitch in its USL debut in 2014.",

About 6 percent of 737 stationary production platforms remained evacuated.\n\nThe Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement is inspecting offshore facilities and monitoring efforts to restart production operations. It has not yet received any damage reports.\n\n1:00 p.m. Church holds benefit for Saldivar family\n\nBy the time the flood waters receded and the white van reappeared, Virginia Saldivar was already expecting the worst.\n\nBut Saldivar, the grandmother of the four children who drowned in Greens Bayou and daughter in law of the the elderly couple in the van, will cherish her memories of the children as their short lives drew to a tragic end.\n\nBelia and Manuel Saldivar, ages 81 and 84, were found in the front seats. The bodies of their four great-grandchildren -- ages 16, 14, 8 and 6 -- were found in the rear of the van.\n\n\"They were our life,\" Saldivar said. \"That's what we're remembering — how wonderful they were.\"\n\nA benefit was held Saturday at the Iglesia Cristiana Principe de Paz for the family of the six victims who were trapped in flood waters on Greens River Road.\n\nThe community room of the church filled with friends, extended family and members of the community coming together to show support for a family devastated by the flood that's taken over 50 lives.\n\n\"We want everyone to know that we're very thankful for all the love and support,\" Saldivar said. \"It's really and truly been overwhelming.\"\n\n12:50: Humble ISD announces back-to-school date\n\nHumble ISD will reopen for the first day of school Sept. 7.\n\nKingwood High School and Summer Creek High School will reopen Sept. 11 because of the damage they sustained after the storm.\n\nStaff members are required to report to work Sept. 5.\n\n12:35 p.m. Last cruise stuck at sea due to Harvey makes port\n\nFor the more than 3,000 passengers aboard the Carnival Breeze, an extra week at sea due to Harvey's wrath ended on a steamy Saturday morning in Galveston.\n\nThe Breeze was the last of four ships to dock in the Port of Galveston's cruise terminal after being turned away last week as Harvey strengthened from a tropical storm to a hurricane. The cruise was originally supposed to end Sunday, and was given clearance to dock early Saturday.\n\nOur Marialuisa Rincon has the full story here.\n\n12:20 p.m. HISD offers more details on damages and displacement\n\nHouston ISD officials said they've surveyed 245 schools as of early Saturday, with plans to reach the roughly 35 remaining campuses. About 200 schools had standing water, with 53 suffering \"major\" damage and 22 receiving \"extensive\" damage, which is more severe, Chief Operating Officer Brian Busby said.\n\nSome schools may never be inhabitable again, Superintendent Richard Carranza said, but it's too early to make that judgment.\n\nCarranza said a decision about relocating students to other campuses will be made no earlier than Tuesday. He's exploring the possibility of \"double shifts\" at some campuses, with students from one school attending classes in the morning to early afternoon, and students from another school coming into the same building for classes from early afternoon to evening.\n\nOur Jacob Carpenter has the full story here.\n\n12:15 p.m. President Trump arrives at NRG Center\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Texas Governor Greg Abbott arrived at NRG Center Saturday to visit with those affected by the storm.\n\nRead more here.\n\n12:10 p.m. Cy-Fair ISD delays start of school to Sept. 11\n\nCypress-Fairbanks ISD has delayed the start of school from Sept. 6 to Sept. 11 because several campuses face sewage issues, Superintendent Mark Henry said in an announcement.\n\n'This is a dynamic situation,\" he said. \"It is difficult to predict other issues we may face in the coming weeks.\"\n\nStaff will report to work Sept. 7.\n\nThe district we have extended its free meal program at Holbrook and Owens elementary schools and Cypress Lakes High School through Sept. 10.\n\n12:05 p.m. Brazoria County issues mandatory evacuations\n\nBrazoria County has issued a mandatory evacuation order for areas where that action had been voluntary. The order includes most areas west of State Highway 288.\n\nNoon: Parents arrive to Carrillo Elementary School to feed their children\n\nDeimin Ramirez, 28, tapped the wooden cafeteria table.\n\n\"Eat the pear too,\" she ordered her 7 and 5-year-old.\n\nRamirez was the first mother at Carrillo Elementary School Saturday morning receiving a free hot lunch for herself and her three daughters as part of a new HISD effort that launched Saturday to aid Harvey victims.\n\nThe brisket sandwiches, mashed potatoes and diced pears were a welcomed reprieve from the few beans and rice the Ramirez family subsisted on for days.\n\nThe remaining food stamps in her possession were barely enough for Ramirez to shop at the nearby Fiesta Mart, which itself had been running low on supplies for the storm's duration.\n\n\"They were hungry,\" Ramirez said of her daughters, as she uncapped a water bottle for her 2-year-old.\n\nWater seeped into their one bedroom apartment a few blocks away from the school, but the only damage sustained was a soaked living room carpet that has already been torn out.\n\nStructural damage to their house during Hurricane Ike forced the family to move into an apartment with a more manageable rent. Last year they moved again, this time into the apartments surrounding Fiesta and the school.\n\nSchool officials put out calls to neighboring families in both English and Spanish announcing the free breakfast, lunch, and dinner available this weekend. Concerned some may have lost power and therefore missed the phone call, staff members printed out flyers on Saturday to deliver door-to-door.\n\nAs her girls wiped gravy off their mouths with the back of their hands, Ramirez called up a couple of her neighbors letting them know the school had food.\n\nShe packed up the leftovers--mostly pears--as she headed out to search for any milk at Fiesta.\n\n\"They're used to milk in the morning,\" Ramirez said. \"We didn't have any since Saturday.\"\n\n11:45 a.m. H-E-B resumes normal business hours at many Houston stores\n\nFifty-one H-E-B stores resumed normal hours Saturday as the company worked to restock its chain with essentials.\n\nAbout 30 stores, including the Gulfgate, Bay City, Grand Parkway, Dairy Ashford, Friendswood and Lake Jackson locations, will keep modified hours through Sunday.

  "latent_3796": "Meal & exercise timing in the contexts of “damage control” and nutrient partitioning are frequent topics on this blog. I generally opt for a pre-workout meal, but nutrient timing hasn’t panned out very well in the literature. That’s probably why I’m open to the idea of resistance exercise in the fasted state. A lot of pseudoscientific arguments can be made for both fed and fasted exercise, and since a few blog posts have already been dedicated to the former, this one will focus on the latter.\n\nThe pseudoscience explanation is something like this: since fatty acids are elevated when fasting, exercise in this condition will burn more fat; and chronically doing so will increase mitochondria #. The lack of dietary carbs might enhance exercise-induced glycogen depletion, which itself would bias more post-workout calories toward glycogen synthesis / supercompensation. Much of this is actually true, but has really only been validated for endurance training (eg, Stannard 2010, Van Proeyen 2011, & Trabelsi 2012; but not here Paoli 2011)… and the few times it’s been studied in the context of resistance exercise, no effect (eg, Moore 2007 & Trabelsi 2013). However, there are some pretty interesting tidbits (beyond the pseudoscience) which suggest how/why it might work, in the right context.\n\nExercising fasted or fed for fat loss? Influence of food intake on RER and EPOC after a bout of endurance training (Paoli et al., 2011)\n\nJohn Kiefer, an advocate of resistance exercise in the fasted state, mentioned: “the sympathetic nervous system responds quicker to fasted-exercise. You release adrenaline faster. Your body is more sensitive particularly to the fat burning properties of adrenaline and you get bigger rushes of adrenaline.”\n\nMuch of this is spot on. That is, ketogenic dieting and glycogen depletion increase exercise-induced sympathetic activation and fat oxidation (eg, Jansson 1982, Langfort 1996, & Weltan 1998).\n\nThe question is: can this improve nutrient partitioning and physical performance? Magic 8-Ball says: “Signs point to yes.” I concur.\n\nContrary to popular beliefs, glycogen depletion per se doesn’t harm many aspects of physical performance. A lot of fuel systems are at play; you don’t need a full tank of glycogen.\n\nEffect of low-carbohydrate-ketogenic diet on metabolic and hormonal responses to graded exercise in men (Langfort et al., 1996)\n\nHigh-intensity exercise performance is not impaired by low intramuscular glycogen (Symons & Jacobs, 1989)\n\nIncreased fat oxidation compensates for reduced glycogen at lower exercise intensities (eg, Zderic 2004), and ketoadaptation may do the same at higher intensities.\n\nKiefer further states “empty* glycogen stores also seem to have no bearing on resistance training’s ability to stimulate muscle growth, and might be advantageous for accelerated fat loss.”\n\n*I take “empty” to mean “low” or “not full,” because there is no “empty” in vivo.\n\nInfluence of preexercise muscle glycogen content on transcriptional activity of metabolic and myogenic genes in well-trained humans (Churchley et al., 2007)\n\n“…any differences in basal transcription are completely abolished after a single bout of heavy resistance training. We conclude that commencing resistance exercise with low muscle glycogen does not enhance the activity of genes implicated in promoting hypertrophy.”\n\nIndeed, heavy resistance training is a robust stimulus.\n\nFat adaptation in well-trained athletes: effects on cell metabolism (Yeo et al., 2011)\n\nThis review article supports increased 24-hour fat oxidation induced by glycogen depletion and fat adaptation, but in the context of endurance training (low intensity; ie, not conducive to muscle hypertrophy)… the authors even speculate a negative impact on high intensity performance, although this would be less relevant in the context of ketoadaptation (which isn’t mentioned).\n\nInfluence of pre-exercise muscle glycogen content on exercise-induced transcriptional regulation of metabolic genes (Pilegaard et al., 2002)\n\n“These data indicate that low muscle glycogen content enhances the transcriptional activation of some metabolic genes in response to exercise, raising the possibility that signalling mechanisms sensitive to glycogen content and/or FFA availability may be linked to the transcriptional control of exercise-responsive genes.”\n\nThus, he concludes [rightfully, imo]: “glycogen depletion won’t hold us back during low-carb training.” And furthermore, “a combination of enhancements to the CNS and sympathetic nervous system create [this effect]; enhancements that may be more of a result of the absence of carbs rather than the addition of added fat and protein for fuel.”\n\n…I don’t disagree with this particular effect – yes, it seems specific to glycogen depletion – however, when it comes to body composition, nutrient partitioning, and physical performance, dietary protein shouldn’t be discounted.\n\nRelative effects of glycogen depletion and previous exercise on muscle force and endurance capacity (Grisdale et al., 1990)\n\n“glycogen depletion… does not influence the shift in the EMG frequency distribution [during exercise].” In this context, EMG reflects the rate of ATP hydrolysis and electrical activation in muscle, and is proportional to force production. This suggests that any theoretical decrease in muscular force production induced by glycogen depletion may be adequately compensated by increased sympathetic activation.\n\nMoving on: “Whenever you train, your body releases catecholamines, which increases fatty acid release, energy production, and strength. The response of your muscular system depends on how much adrenaline is present, how fast it’s released and how sensitive cells are to adrenaline. Going low-carb does something to intensify each of these components.” Truth.\n\nThe effect of a low-carbohydrate diet on performance, hormonal, and metabolic responses to a 30-s bout of supramaximal exercise (Langfort et al., 1997)\n\n“The main conclusions of this study are: (1) a low carb diet is detrimental to anaerobic work capacity, possibly because of a reduced muscle glycogen store and decreased rate of glycolysis; (2) reduced carb intake for 3 days enhances activity of the sympathoadrenal system at rest and after exercise.”\n\nMax power output wasn’t affected, but mean power output was lower. This is likely due to the fact that the intervention only lasted 3 days – not nearly long enough for ketoadaptation… more likely, they weren’t able to match the energetic demands due to inadequate mitochondrial proliferation.\n\nDiet induced changes in sympatho-adrenal activity during submaximal exercise in relation to substrate utilization in man (Jansson et al., 1982)\n\n“Exercise-induced increases in noradrenaline were more pronounced after the carbohydrate poor than after the carbohydrate rich diet.”\n\nThis has been well-established, and is likely due to glycogen depletion (not necessarily exercising in the fasted state per se).\n\nThe effect of low-carbohydrate diet on the pattern of hormonal changes during incremental, graded exercise in young men (Langfort et al., 2001)\n\n“It is concluded that restriction of carb intake does not affect the pattern of changes in plasma adrenaline, growth hormone, and testosterone during graded exercise but lowers norepinephrine threshold, indicating increased sensitivity of the sympathetic nervous system to exercise stimulus.”\n\nShort-term low-carbohydrate diet dissociates lactate and ammonia thresholds in men (Langfort et al., 2004)\n\n3 days of carb-restriction increased the lactate threshold, possibly due reduced muscle glycogen and increased reliance on fat-derived fuels, although it also lowered the ammonia threshold. This might not bode well because one potential source of increased ammonia is skeletal muscle proteolysis, which would suggest increased amino acid oxidation. This is also one of the reasons I advocate a pre-workout, protein-rich meal… to prevent the loss of lean mass.\n\nEffect of low-carbohydrate-ketogenic diet on metabolic and hormonal responses to graded exercise in men (Langfort et al., 1996)\n\n“Stimulation of the sympatho-adrenal system, and cortisol secretion with reduced plasma insulin concentration seem to be of importance for preservation of working capacity.”\n\nComparison of sympatho-adrenal activity during endurance exercise performed under high- and low-carbohydrate diet conditions (Sasaki et al., 1991)\n\n“In conclusion, sympathetic activity to endurance exercise during which blood sugar was kept over a preexercise level was elevated more in the low than in the high carb diet. It was suggested that the more elevated sympathetic nervous activity would have resulted from glycogen depletion in the working muscle due to the low carb diet and would have increased FFA mobilization from the adipose tissue.”\n\nIncreased p70s6k phosphorylation during intake of a protein-carbohydrate drink following resistance exercise in the fasted state (Deldicque et al., 2010)\n\n“Our results indicate that prior fasting may stimulate the intramyocellular anabolic response to ingestion of a carbohydrate/protein/leucine mixture following a heavy resistance training session.”\n\nNo one is arguing against peri-workout nutrition (I bet even most anti-nutrient timing gym bro’s slam a post-workout protein shake). There seems to be separate benefits of pre-workout nutrition, but also pre-workout fasting with post-workout nutrition.. compromise? or must we choose a side. YMMV\n\nMy take\n\n1) a lot of the theoretical benefits of resistance exercise in the fasted state seem to be due to glycogen depletion, which would be similar on a low carb diet sans carb-loading.\n\n2) another aspect of this, as it pertains to morning exercise, is dinner. CBL proper promotes a high glycemic dinner, which enhances the insulinemic response to any breakfast. This is likely true (eg, Wolever 1998 & Nilsson 2008), and is why CBL also promotes skipping breakfast. Damage control.\n\nDamage control =/= optimal.\n\nSave that insulin hypersecretion until after the morning exercise session, when tendency to store fat is blunted (by exercise). More damage control… but this wouldn’t be an issue if you didn’t carb-load the night before.\n\nMy thoughts on this: a high glycemic dinner in the absence of PM exercise isn’t one of CBL’s strongest or more sensical points; and if a post-workout insulin spike is really critical here, I’d rather see it accomplished with something like protein , leucine , or even a baked potato (ie, not pizza and ice cream). Also, the frequent carb-loading aspect of CBL contradicts the enhanced sympathetic nervous system activation induced by exercising in the glycogen-depleted state (regardless of exercise timing). One alternative to this is less frequent carb-loads (as in Kiefer’s Carb Nite Solution ); ymmv, and probably depends on training frequency and intensity…\n\nI’m convinced there are benefits to exercising in the fasted state [in the context of a low carb diet], which appear to be at least partially due to glycogen depletion… and many of these same benefits might be negated by carb-loading. Theoretically, however, they can still be had by following a relatively low carb template and resistance exercise in the fasted state sans carb-loading.\n\nInstead of enhancing post-workout insulinemia with a high glycemic index carb load, a mixed meal higher in protein may work just as well or even better, in some contexts… and I see little benefit to PM carb-loading prior to an AM exercise session, fasted or otherwise (John Kiefer begs to differ). If you must combine carb-loading with fasted-exercise, then probably best to do them close together, chronologically (ie, damage control). It’s still up for debate whether doing this in the morning or evening is superior, but as mentioned previously, the circadian regulation of adipose and skeletal muscle biology predicts morning may be optimal (despite being inconvenient). Also, as Jack Kruse mentions in Epi-paleo Rx , going to the gym at night, with loud music blaring and bright lights blazing, doesn’t bode well for sleep quality and circadian rhythms.

  "latent_3832": "The son of a former Mexican governor fears that U.S. authorities will arrest him when he is expected to travel to a San Antonio, Texas, courthouse for a hearing in connection with an asset forfeiture case.\n\nThe fears were recently revealed in a motion filed by the attorneys for Luis Armando Reynoso Lopez, in preparation for an upcoming hearing tied to the asset forfeiture of various properties in San Antonio. Court documents revealed that Reynoso and his father, former Aguascalientes Governor Luis Armando Reynoso Femat, are fighting to keep a series of properties in San Antonio while U.S. prosecutors claim they were bought with illicit funds\n\nReynoso Femat served as the mayor of the Mexican city of Aguascalientes from 1999 to 2001 and governor of the state from 2004 to 2010. The politician is a member of Mexico’s National Action Party (PAN). Currently, Reynoso Femat is fighting a legal battle to appeal two separate prison sentences to avoid jail on various embezzlement and corruption charges brought by state authorities. The former politician has publicly claimed the charges are political attacks. The charges in Mexico deal with price-fixing the sale of government properties.\n\nAccording to U.S. prosecutors, Reynoso Femat’s salary as a Mexican governor was $142,000. His son, Luis Armando Reynoso Lopez, does not have “a significant work history or earnings” aside to working for his father. In addition to having been a politician, Reynoso Femat started various property development companies in Mexico. Court documents reveal that beginning in 2008, Reynoso Lopez and his father worked with other individuals to funnel funds embezzled from the government of Aguascalientes through Mexican banks into U.S. accounts. One of the documents shows that through personal accounts, the pair reportedly embezzled at least $5.5 million. Once those funds were in U.S. accounts, Reynoso Lopez would allegedly purchase various properties in the U.S. on behalf of his father.\n\nLuis Armando Reynoso Docs by ildefonso ortiz on Scribd\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

The set includes a serum and a roller.\n\nVitamin C serums are quite popular nowadays because they help to restore aging skin, improve skin tone, and eliminate wrinkles. This particular serum nourishes skin well. I have tried it on my face, and I like the way my skin feels after I apply it. I know that this Vitamin C serum will help me to look younger. My skin will thank me for using it.\n\nIt is great to also be able to use a special roller to reduce some scar tissue on my skin. The roller is equipped with fairly sharp needles, that lightly penetrate the skin, and strengthen the skin they are touching.\n\nI am not sure that I would use this roller on myself. I am a little squirmish of needles, so using a whole roller of needles would be kind of an odd thing for me to do. It would be considered to be an alternative type treatment, and I usually prefer treatments that are tried and true by generations of use. This needle roller is not necessarily something that I can fully review, as I wouldn’t want to use it myself.\n\nI think this technology is worth considering though. Needle therapy (acupuncture) is very popular, and is often used for management of many conditions. It is not necessarily what the doctor prescribed, but it is an alternative non-medicated way of treating certain conditions.\n\nI certainly think that this roller would be a great product for someone who is struggling with stretch marks, various skin marks and scars. Whenever someone offers me a simple, non-surgical, non prescription medication way of eliminating my discomfort, I am always interested.

  "latent_4196": "During the first hearing for the case, retired police officer Lt. Col. Dmitry Pavlyuchenkov appeared as a witness for state prosecutors. Now, however, he has become a suspect. Investigators believe he may have accepted payment from \"a person whose identity is still unknown\" for organizing the murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya, Investigative Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin told Russian news agencies on Tuesday.\n\nThe suspect is also believed to have arranged for the alleged murderer Rustam Makhmudov to receive money, a pistol and a silencer to complete the act in 2006. Arrested in late May of this year in Chechnya, Makhmudov stands accused of having shot Politkovskaya in the elevator of her apartment building some 5 years ago.\n\nBut police remain uncertain who might have commissioned Pavlyuchenkov to arrange the killing, the spokesman said, adding that he appears to be just one link in a chain of those involved.\n\nTurning Point\n\nStill, the lawyer for Politkovskaya's children, Anna Stavitzkaya, called the arrest a turning point in the investigation. \"This is a very important stage in explaining the event,\" she told SPIEGEL ONLINE on Wednesday.\n\nAnother former police officer and two of Makhmudov's brothers, accused of acting as lookout and getaway driver in the killing, were aquitted on lack of evidence in a 2009 trial. The Supreme Court rejected the aquittal, returning the case to prosecutors.\n\n\"He (Dmitry Pavlyuchenkov) was the main witness in the case, and if the accused had been convicted then, he would have walked away scot-free,\" Stavitzkaya added. \"But along with the (newspaper) Novaya Gaseta we conducted our own research, collecting evidence that pointed more to the conclusion that he was himself involved in the crime and not just a witness.\"\n\nPolitkovskaya's case has become symbolic of what many see as the persecution of journalists critical of the government in Russia. The 48-year-old was an outspoken and internationally recognized critic of both the Kremlin and its alleged corruption in Chechnya, and there is a widely held suspicion that the government may have been involved in the brutal attack.\n\nWith reporting by Benjamin Bidder in Moscow",
  "latent_4337": "Middle ear infections, which affect more than 85 percent of children under the age of 3, can be triggered by a viral infection in the nose rather than solely by a bacterial infection, according to researchers at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center.\n\nBy simultaneously infecting the nose with a flu virus and a bacterium that is one of the leading causes of ear infections in children, the researchers found that the flu virus inflamed the nasal tissue and significantly increased both the number of bacteria and their propensity to travel through the Eustachian tube and infect the middle ear. The study is published in the current online issue of the American Society for Microbiology's journal Infection and Immunity.\n\n\"Every individual has bacteria in the nose that most of the time doesn't cause problems,\" said the study's lead author, W. Edward Swords, Ph.D., professor of microbiology and immunology at Wake Forest Baptist. \"However, under certain conditions those bacteria can migrate to the middle ear and cause an ear infection, and now we have a better understanding of how and why that happens.\"\n\nThe bacterium used in the animal study, Streptococcus pneumoniae, is known to exist in the noses of children in two phases, one relatively invasive and the other relatively benign. The more invasive phase is more frequently found in the infected ears of children. However, the study indicated that the flu virus promoted bacterial growth and ear infection regardless of which phase of the bacterium was present in the nose.\n\n\"These findings suggest that a flu infection modifies the response of the immune system to this particular bacterium, enabling even the type that has previously been considered benign to infect the middle ear,\" Swords said.",
  "latent_4417": "The Falcons will enter free agency and the 2017 NFL Draft with no ‘major holes’ on their roster, according to general manager Thomas Dimitroff.\n\nWith that being said, Atlanta’s primary focus is to add depth across the board. Several draft experts believe the Falcons will use their first-round pick to bolster their pass-rush and select a defensive end.\n\nAnd with the 2017 NFL Combine less than a week away, here’s a look at ESPN draft analyst Todd McShay’s top-10 defensive ends.\n\nMyles Garrett, Texas A&M\n\nAnalysis: “Elite edge rusher who possesses rare explosiveness and the fluid-movement skills and agility of an NBA shooting guard. Good size, but he's never likely going to be a hold-your-ground run defender, and might be best suited as an outside linebacker. However, his ability to explode into the backfield through a gap or around the edge gives him disruptive potential on every snap. Garrett still needs to fine-tune his pass-rush strategy and could stand to give more consistent effort from the start of the snap until the whistle. But his pass-rush production and athletic traits point toward an All-Pro career.” -- Lance Zierlein of NFL.com\n\nSolomon Thomas, Stanford\n\nAnalysis: “Thomas has a very lean, muscular frame with the potential to add another 10-15 pounds. This is a fun player to study. He lines up inside and outside and he's extremely explosive. As a run defender, he can easily stack and hold the point of attack vs. single blocks but he will get washed down the line of scrimmage when double teamed. “ Daniel Jeremiah of NFL.com\n\nTaco Charlton, Michigan\n\nAnalysis: “Charlton is an ascending prospect with the size, length, athleticism and pass-rushing potential that NFL general managers dream of. What you see today might not be what you get. While his production coming out of college will be modest, he could become a substantially better player as a pro if he's committed to the weight room and willing to absorb coaching. High-impact defensive end with all-pro potential is his ceiling. His floor is solid starter.” – Lance Zierlein of NFL.com\n\nDerek Barnett, Tennessee\n\nAnalysis: “Strong edge presence with NFL-caliber hand usage and play strength. Barnett is one of the most productive defensive linemen to come out of the SEC in quite some time despite lacking the length and twitch that teams usually look for off the edge. His awareness and play traits should keep him near the action and he has the talent to step into a starting base end spot right away. There could be coordinators who view him as an early down, outside backer in a 3-4 with the ability to put his hand in the ground on sub packages.” – Lance Zierlein of NFL.com\n\nCharles Harris, Missouri\n\nAnalysis: \"High-cut pass rusher with good athleticism but concerns regarding his ability to drop anchor against the run. Ironically, Harris might be best suited as a penetrator which is something he fought against this season. His hands can be improved as pass rush weapons, but he has agility and footwork that can't be taught. Harris can play on the edge in a 4-3 or 3-4 front and should be the next in a line of early contributing defensive ends coming out of Missouri.\" – Lance Zierlein of NFL.com\n\nDeMarcus Walker, Florida State\n\nAnalysis: “Walker became a starter midway through his freshman season at FSU. He has a thick, square build for the position. He was probably carrying about 10 extra pounds last fall. He lines up at defensive end primarily but he will slide inside as well. As a pass rusher, he lacks explosiveness but he's very polished and productive.” – Daniel Jeremiah of NFL.com\n\nCarl Lawson, Auburn\n\nAnalysis: “Linear player with natural power and aggressiveness, but a lack of flexibility could hamper his potential as an NFL rusher. Lawson's twitch shows up in short, controlled bursts, but he struggles to finish if the play isn't right in front of him.” – Lance Zierlein of NFL.com\n\nDawaune Smoot, Illinois\n\nAnalysis: “Duck-footed, face-up rusher able to generate some power in his rush, Smoot failed to put together the breakout season many predicted after a strong junior showing.” – Lance Zierlein of NFL.com\n\nDeatrich Wise Jr., Arkansas\n\nAnalysis: “Slow-twitch power player with rare physical attributes but a lack of functional athleticism to chalk up a stat sheet. Might have been miscast as a 4-3 defensive end considering his lack of quickness and rush talent.” – Lance Zierlein of NFL.com\n\nKeionta Davis, Chattanooga",
  "latent_4453": "Almost immediately after logging onto Facebook and posting that she had converted to Islam, April Fuller was bombarded with messages, from both her close friends and acquaintances.\n\n“Why did I expect anything less,” Fuller’s former youth pastor wrote. “I am an infidel according to your cult so therefore I am your enemy. Such a shame you have chosen to turn your back on a loving God and serve a false prophet who preaches hate for anyone not of said cult.”\n\nBut an old childhood friend offered congratulations. “I know a lot of people and ‘friends’ are giving you hell about this. It’s your decision. I hope it works out for you sweetie.”\n\nFuller’s uncle was a pastor in a Southern Baptist church, the largest religion in the state, in the 1,500-person town of Raleigh. Although her family has long been strict adherents, Fuller was drawn to Islam because, for her, it was the first time religion made sense.\n\n“I always grew up believing in something, so I knew there was a god,” Fuller, a sophomore English major, said. “I was just trying to figure out what I wanted to be, but I knew Baptist wasn’t for me.”\n\nThe second semester of her freshman year, Fuller was introduced to another student, a practicing Muslim, through a mutual friend. They quickly became friends, and he began to teach her about Islam.\n\n“I started talking to my friend, and he was telling more about it, and I thought this kinda makes sense,” Fuller said. “In Islam, you use logic; in Christianity you have to go on blind faith. A lot of times, when I tried to question Christian beliefs, I was shut down. With Islam, they welcome doubts and attempt to dispel them.”\n\nAccording to the Council on American-Islamic relations, “Muslims believe in One, Unique, and Incomparable God. They believe in the Day of Judgement and individual accountability for actions.” There are about 7 million Muslims in America, and according to the Foreign Policy Group, Islam is the second largest and fastest growing religion in the world. According to the Association of Religion Data Archives, there are about 4,000 Muslims in Mississippi.\n\nFuller said she knew her conversion would receive some mixed opinions, but she did not expect the amount of backlash she received on Facebook. While most of her college friends took the change in stride, the older generation had a problem with it.\n\n“My heart is sad for the teenage girl I admired so much in church,” a member of Fuller’s former church posted on her wall. “You were such an inspiration to all the teenagers who saw you stand up for what you believed and not ashamed to be a Christian. Don’t be a stumbling block April to all these young souls.”\n\nAlthough many of April’s friends at school have largely congratulated her, her grandfather was not nearly as accepting.\n\n“A few days after I came out as Muslim, he called me to ask if I was going to be blowing up any buildings soon,” Fuller said.\n\nWhile her dad’s side of the family has yet to come around, her mom’s side has openly embraced the change.\n\n“My mom has always encouraged me to follow my heart, and this is no different,” Fuller said. “She educates herself on what I believe, can eat and all that so that she can understand what I’m going through and how she can best help me.”\n\nAny friends that Fuller may have lost, she has more than made up. She joined the Muslim Student Association (where she is also the director of women affairs) at Ole Miss, which, according to Fuller, provides a place where she can be herself. The organization, made up mostly of full-time undergraduate and graduate students, has offered Fuller a new home.\n\n“I love all my friends, don’t get me wrong,” Fuller said. “But since I joined the Muslim Student Association, I have a close group that I can talk about Islam with, as well as a group that won’t pressure me to do anything that goes against Islam.”\n\nSince converting, Fuller has defied the Ole Miss student stereotype. She does not drink, keeping her away from the Square and frat parties, and did not visit the Grove for a single football game last season. Her hijab, a piece of clothing that covers the hair and neck, keeps her in more modest clothing choices (such as not showing ankles, hair, etc.) and not the oversized t-shirts and Nike shorts that Ole Miss girls are known for. As there is no mosque in Oxford, she travels to Memphis with a group every Sunday for worship, while still performing the mandatory five daily prayers.\n\nAfter everything is said and done, Fuller says she would still make the decision to convert again.\n\n“I finally have a peace I didn’t have in Christianity, I know what I believe, who I am, and how I want my life to reflect on this. For the first time, I actually feel like I know what I’m doing. It’s strange; I found peace in a religion where many only see hate.”\n\nSource: http://thedmonline.com",
  "latent_4490": "Paul Daniel \"Ace\" Frehley (; born April 27, 1951)[1][self-published source][2] is an American musician and songwriter best known as the original lead guitarist and co-founding member of the rock band Kiss. He invented the persona of The Spaceman (a.k.a. Space Ace) and played with the group from its inception in 1973 until his departure in 1982. After leaving Kiss, Frehley embarked on a solo career, which was put on hold when he rejoined Kiss in 1996 for a highly successful reunion tour.\n\nFrehley's second tenure with Kiss lasted until 2002, when he left at the conclusion of what was originally purported to be the band's Farewell Tour. His most recent solo album, Spaceman, was released on October 19, 2018. Guitar World magazine ranked him as the 14th Greatest Metal Guitarist of All Time. Outside Kiss, Frehley had commercial success, with his first solo album going platinum. His first album with his \"Frehley's Comet\" band was also a big seller. Frehley is also known for the use of many \"special effects\" guitars, including a Gibson Les Paul guitar that emits smoke from the neck humbucker pickup and produces spinning pyrotechnics, and a custom Les Paul that emits light based on song tempo.\n\nBiography [ edit ]\n\nEarly years [ edit ]\n\nPaul Daniel Frehley was born and raised in The Bronx of New York City, the youngest of three children of Esther Anna (Hecht) and Carl Daniel Frehley.[3] His father, from Pennsylvania, was the son of Dutch immigrants, and his mother is originally from North Carolina.[4] He has a sister Nancy and a brother Charles, a classical guitarist. The Frehleys were a musical family, and when Frehley received an electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964, he immersed himself in learning the instrument. \"I never went to music school; I never took a guitar lesson, but everybody in my family plays an instrument. My mother and father both played piano, his father was the church organist, and my brother and sister both played piano and acoustic guitar.\" Frehley was always surrounded by music. Frehley started playing guitar at age 13. He lists Jimi Hendrix, Albert Lee, Buddy Guy, Jeff Beck, B.B. King, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, and The Who as his main influences.[5]\n\nGrowing up on the corner of Marion Avenue and 201st Street, off Bedford Park Boulevard (also known as 200th Street) and Webster Avenue in the Bedford Park section of the Bronx,[9] Frehley graduated from Grace Lutheran School at age 13. Two of the high schools he attended were DeWitt Clinton High School on Mosholu Parkway and Theodore Roosevelt High School on Fordham Road. He got the nickname \"Ace\" in high school from friends who said he was \"a real ace\" for his ability to get dates. Also in his high school years, a guidance counselor encouraged him to get into graphic arts. He later credited guitar playing for \"saving his life\" as a member of Kiss.[citation needed]\n\nFrehley's earliest bands included The Outrage, The Four Roses, King Kong, Honey and The Magic People. When Frehley's later band, Cathedral, began getting paying gigs, he dropped out of high school. At the insistence of his family and girlfriend, Frehley eventually returned and earned a diploma. After graduation, Frehley held a string of short-term jobs—mail carrier, furniture deliverer, messenger, and liquor store delivery person.[10]\n\nKiss [ edit ]\n\nFrehley spent the early 1970s in a series of local bands including one called Molimo who recorded half an album for RCA Records in 1971.[11] In late 1972, his friend, Chris Cassone, spotted an advertisement for a lead guitarist in The Village Voice and showed the ad to Frehley.[12] Frehley went to 10 East 23rd Street above the Live Bait Bar. Frehley auditioned for Paul Stanley (rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (bass guitar) and Peter Criss (drums) for the band. Frehley, who showed up with best friend Chris Cassone,[13] wearing one red and one orange sneaker, was less than impressive visually, but the band liked what they heard from his playing. About three weeks later, the band named Frehley as their lead guitarist. By January 1973, the band came up with the name Kiss. Frehley designed the band's double-lightning-bolt logo, which was polished up by Paul Stanley. The band quickly decided to paint their faces for live performances, and Frehley decided to start painting silver stars on his eyes. When the group eventually decided to adopt stage personas to match their makeup and costumes, Frehley became Space Ace. Later his stage persona was also known as The Spaceman.[citation needed]\n\nThe Spaceman\n\nWhile Kiss spent their early days rehearsing and playing in empty clubs, Frehley worked as a part-time cab driver to pay bills. In September 1973, Kiss members began to receive a $50 a week salary from new manager Bill Aucoin, and Frehley quit his cabbie job.[citation needed]\n\nKiss released their debut album, Kiss, in February 1974 – Frehley was credited for writing two songs, \"Love Theme from KISS\" (the only song co-written by the four original members) and a fan classic, \"Cold Gin\". Due to Frehley's lack of confidence in his own singing voice, however, Simmons performed the vocals. Frehley wrote or co-wrote several of the band's songs over the next few years but did not record vocals on a song until \"Shock Me\" (inspired by his near-electrocution during a concert in Lakeland, Florida), which appeared on 1977's Love Gun.[10]\n\nAs lead guitarist, Frehley was known for his frenetic, atmospheric playing, becoming one of the most popular guitarists in the 1970s and spawning a generation of new players. Frehley stated in the book Kiss: Behind the Mask that many guitarists have told him his playing on 1975's hit Alive! prompted them to pick up the instrument. Frehley is well-recognized for using Gibson Les Paul guitars, including his trademarked model conversion Les Paul Custom (that he modified himself), which filled the stage full of smoke during his live guitar solo.[citation needed]\n\nAlong with the three other Kiss members, Frehley released an eponymous solo album in 1978. His was the best-selling of the four, and the album's lone single—the Russ Ballard-written \"New York Groove\", originally recorded by Hello—reached the Top 20 in the United States.[14]\n\nFrehley's songwriting presence within the group increased in 1979. He contributed three songs for 1979's Dynasty and three for 1980's Unmasked. While this was not the most commercially successful time for Kiss in the United States, the band was beginning to take off in other countries (mostly in Australia, where Dynasty and Unmasked are their biggest-selling albums). Even as his songwriting role within Kiss was increasing, Frehley found himself increasingly at odds with the musical direction of the band. After Peter Criss left Kiss in 1980, Frehley was often outvoted 2-1 in band decisions, as replacement drummer Eric Carr was not a partner in Kiss and had no vote. Frehley's participation in the recording of 1981's Music from \"The Elder\" was far more limited than with previous albums. This was in large part due to his unhappiness with the band's decision to create a concept album rather than a straightforward rock album, and also, by Frehley's own admission, his \"not relating all that well\" to producer Bob Ezrin, who cut many of Frehley's solos from the recorded tracks.[citation needed]\n\nAlthough Frehley appeared on the covers for 1982's greatest hits album Killers and studio album Creatures of the Night, he had no involvement with Killers, and minimal (no musical) input on Creatures of the Night. Frehley's last appearances with the band were the video for \"I Love It Loud\", a series of European promotional appearances in November 1982 and a band interview with MTV in early 1983 promoting their world tour.[citation needed]\n\nSolo career/Frehley's Comet [ edit ]\n\nIn December 1982, Kiss began the Creatures of the Night tour without Frehley: he was replaced by Vinnie Vincent. Frehley retained a one-quarter share in the Kiss partnership until 1985, however. He received one-quarter of the profits for both Lick It Up and Animalize although he had no involvement with either record.[1]\n\nIn 1984, Frehley started his post-Kiss solo career by assembling a band that included, among others, drummer Anton Fig (who had performed on Frehley's 1978 solo album and on two Kiss albums). Bassist John Regan (who had worked with Peter Frampton), whom Frehley met in 1980, was also an original member of the band as was vocalist/guitarist Richie Scarlet and keyboardist Arthur Stead.[1] The group, whose name alternated between 'Ace Frehley' and Frehley's Comet, recorded a series of demos throughout 1984 and 1985.[15] The band performed their first ever live show at S.I.R. Studios in New York City on November 30, 1984, and played a handful of shows in the Northeast United States in March 1985.[citation needed]\n\nAfter a few unsuccessful attempts at securing a recording contract, the group eventually signed to Megaforce Records and released their first album, Frehley's Comet, on July 7, 1987. The album was co-produced by Eddie Kramer, who had produced not only a number of Kiss albums, but Frehley's 1978 album and some of his 1984–85 demos. Fig, now being the in-studio drummer for David Letterman's late-night television show, performed on the album but was unable to maintain a permanent commitment to touring. He played on the 1987 tour in the United States when Frehley's band played a double bill with Y&T, and White Lion opening the shows. By the time the band began recording this album, Scarlet had left the group to pursue other projects and was replaced by Tod Howarth. In addition, at some point between the initial Frehley's Comet shows in 1984–85 and their signing to Megaforce, the band had become a four-piece, with Stead no longer playing with the group.[citation needed]\n\nFrehley's Comet, a mixture of hard rock and pop metal, was a successful return to the music scene for Frehley. The album peaked at No. 43 on the Billboard 200 (selling nearly 500,000 copies[1]), and the single, a Russ Ballard cover \"Into the Night\", reached No. 27 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.[16] \"Rock Soldiers\" was an autobiographic song, written partially about Frehley's April 1982 police chase in White Plains, NY while driving in DeLorean with his friend. The video for \"Rock Soldiers\" received moderate airplay on MTV, particularly on Headbangers Ball.[citation needed]\n\nDespite the positive reviews and healthy album sales of Frehley's Comet, Frehley was unable to maintain much commercial momentum. Two 1988 Frehley's Comet albums—the live EP Live+1 and second studio album Second Sighting peaked at No. 84 and No. 81, respectively. A pair of tours in support of Alice Cooper and Iron Maiden ended prematurely, with the band claiming lack of payment in both cases.[17]\n\nIn order to reverse his band's declining commercial fortunes, Frehley dropped the Frehley's Comet moniker and issued 1989's Trouble Walkin' under his own name. Tod Howarth and Jamie Oldaker also decided to leave before recording started on the album, and were replaced by Scarlet and Sandy Slavin. Despite the return to a more traditional hard rock style, Trouble Walkin' continued the pattern of declining sales, and peaked at #102.[citation needed]\n\nOne notable aspect of Trouble Walkin' was the guest appearance of Peter Criss, who provided backing vocals on several tracks, along with Sebastian Bach and other members of Skid Row. It was the first time Criss and Frehley had performed together on an album since Kiss' 1979 album, Dynasty, although Criss had shown up briefly at a Frehley's Comet show in Los Angeles in 1987, playing drums on a final encore of \"Deuce\". Frehley would return the favor by playing solos on Peter Criss' Cat #1 album on TNT Records, released in 1994. In contrast to the somewhat adversarial relationship Frehley had with Kiss (particularly Gene Simmons) throughout the 1980s, he and Criss had maintained good ties during the decade. In June 1995, Frehley's and Criss' bands embarked on the \"Bad Boys Tour\" with Scarlet on guitar, marking the end of Frehley's solo band for several years as Kiss shortly thereafter reunited and began touring together again.[18]\n\nReunion with Kiss [ edit ]\n\nIn 1996, Frehley rejoined Kiss for a successful reunion tour, on which all four original members of the band performed live for the first time since original drummer Peter Criss' departure in 1980. After the tour, they announced that the original lineup would return to the studio to record a new album. The resulting record, Psycho Circus, was promoted with a successful world tour, but it was revealed a couple of years later that Frehley's and Criss's involvement on it was minimal. \"Into the Void\", which was Frehley's lone contribution to the record, including vocals and lead guitar duties, is believed to be the only track that all four original members performed on. After completing the \"Farewell Tour\" with Kiss in late 2001, Frehley left the band and resumed his solo career. [19] In October 2018, he reunited with Kiss on the Kiss Kruise. This is the first time Frehley and the band had performed since 2002.[citation needed]\n\nAutobiography [ edit ]\n\nAce Frehley released his autobiography, No Regrets - A Rock 'N' Roll Memoir, on November 1, 2011. The autobiography was authored by Frehley, Joe Layden and John Ostrosky, and published through Gallery Books, a subdivision of Simon & Schuster.[20] The book entered The New York Times Best Seller list in the hardcover non-fiction category at #10.[21]\n\nTechnique [ edit ]\n\nIn a 2009 interview with Rock N Roll Experience Magazine, Frehley stated, \"I'm an anomaly, I'm an un-schooled musician, I don't know how to read music, but I'm one of the most famous guitar players in the world, so go figure.\"[22]\n\n\"I play guitar in such an unorthodox way,\" he told Guitar World in 1996. \"I've never taken a guitar lesson. One of our assistants brought it to my attention a few months ago that, sometimes, when I play chords, my thumb is on the fretted side of the neck. I have no idea why or how I do it, but I do.\" \"I remember a time early on when Ace and I would play,\" added Paul Stanley, \"and I would do vibrato with my hand, and Ace would get vibrato by shaking his whole arm against the neck of the guitar [laughs].\"[23]\n\nSignature Les Paul Guitars [ edit ]\n\nFrehley currently has three Gibson and two Epiphone Signature Les Paul Guitars. His first model, released in 1997 included a signature headstock, lightning bolt inlays, and (allegedly) three DiMarzio Super Distortion pickups. His second signature guitar, the \"Budokan\" Les Paul replicates his heritage cherry sunburst guitar he used in 1976. His most recent model replicates his 1959 Lemon Burst Les Paul Standard, this one was only made by Gibson. Both Gibson and Epiphone produced the first two guitars.[citation needed]\n\nFrehley in 1977 performing his signature smoke effect during the Love Gun Tour\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nSolo albums [ edit ]\n\nLive albums [ edit ]\n\nCompilation albums [ edit ]\n\nStudio Albums With Kiss [ edit ]\n\nSolo singles [ edit ]\n\nGuest appearances [ edit ]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nInterviews [ edit ]\n\nBehind the Player:Ace Frehley DVD (2010)\n\n(2010) A Conversation with Ace Frehley on The Pods & Sods Network [1]\n\nReferences [ edit ]",

  "latent_4535": "Congratulations! Today Kotlin 1.1 has reached Beta, and this means that\n\nit’s time to try it out,\n\nthere’s still time to give us your feedback (and we really need it!),\n\nthe release is coming fairly soon.\n\nWe’ve seen a lot of interest in Kotlin over the past year, and would like to thank all our users, contributors and supporters. Special thanks to early adopters of new features for their bravery and feedback to our EAP builds!\n\nAn overview of what is coming in Kotlin 1.1\n\nThe biggest news of Kotlin 1.1 are\n\nfull support of compilation to JavaScript , and\n\n, and Coroutines on the JVM, Android and JavaScript.\n\nWe’ll give some more details about these below, but they are not the only exciting news of 1.1. Many more language improvements and new features are coming (more details are available on our What’s new page):\n\nDeprecation\n\nWe deprecate the unfortunate name mod that we used for the % operator, and replace it with rem , which is semantically correct and agrees with existing libraries such as java.math.BigInteger . Deprecation warnings and the tooling will guide you through the migration process.\n\nJavaScript\n\nIt’s simple: the full Kotlin language can be now compiled to JavaScript. It doesn’t mean that we have ported all of the JDK into the browser: the language and its Standard Library are not coupled with JDK, but you can use Kotlin strings, collections, sequences, arrays and other core APIs on JS as well as JVM/Android.\n\nNumerous popular JS libraries will be available through typed headers (converted from DefinitelyTyped). We support all popular runtime module systems for JavaScript as well as webpack and other important tools.\n\nWe’ll dedicate a lot of effort in Kotlin 1.2 and beyond to making the JavaScript tooling smooth and helpful. Our goal is to enable pleasant full-stack development with Kotlin.\n\nCoroutines\n\nHonestly, it’s hard to over-emphasize coroutines. The future has come, and we are stuck with it: we need non-blocking asynchronous APIs to keep up with the loads of data we are processing. We’ve been through callback hell and conquered it, but we deserve better. We want to simply write the code following its natural sequential logic, and let the compiler figure the asynchrony out for us. This is what coroutines are about: async/await, generate/yield, non-blocking IO, Rx and much more brought under the single unified paradigm of a suspending function. Such a function (or lambda) represents a computation that can be suspended (without blocking any threads) and resumed later.\n\nfuture { val original = asyncLoadImage(\"...original...\") // creates a Future val overlay = asyncLoadImage(\"...overlay...\") // creates a Future ... // suspend while awaiting the loading of the images // then run `applyOverlay(...)` when they are both loaded return applyOverlay(original.await(), overlay.await()) } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 future { val original = asyncLoadImage ( \"...original...\" ) // creates a Future val overlay = asyncLoadImage ( \"...overlay...\" ) // creates a Future . . . // suspend while awaiting the loading of the images // then run `applyOverlay(...)` when they are both loaded return applyOverlay ( original . await ( ) , overlay . await ( ) ) }\n\nThe main benefit of coroutines is their flexibility:\n\nThe language part is minimal\n\nEverything can be written as a library\n\nLibraries are in total control of all aspects of suspending and resuming computations: threads, exceptions and other aspects of computation are entirely customizable.\n\nWe have written a set of libraries for interesting common use cases: kotlinx.coroutines\n\nRead more about coroutines here.\n\nAn important note. With all the benefits that they bring, Kotlin coroutines are a fairly new design that needs extensive battle-testing before we can be sure it’s 100% right and complete. This is why we will release it under an “experimental” opt-in flag. We do not expect the language rules to change, but APIs may require some adjustments in Kotlin 1.2.\n\nCommand line: -Xcoroutines=enabled\n\nGradle: kotlin.coroutines=enable in gradle.properties or local.properties\n\nin or Maven: <configuration> <args> <arg>-Xcoroutines=enable</arg> </args> </configuration>\n\nIDE: Use a quick-fix (Alt+Enter) or modify the facet options (Project Structure -> Modules -> Your Module -> Compiler -> Coroutines (experimental))\n\nStandard Library, Tooling and Frameworks\n\nKotlin’s Standard Library is getting updated with many useful utilities and extensions including those specific for JDK 7 and 8.\n\nOur collaboration with Gradle has resulted in gradle-script-kotlin which means that you can now write type-safe build scripts for Gradle, using Kotlin scripting.\n\nWe now support JSR 223, which is utilized by the Spring Framework along with type-safe DSLs and other things.\n\nHow to Try It\n\nAs with other pre-release versions, we give no backward compatibility guarantees for Kotlin 1.1‑Beta. Moreover, when we reach final RC, all binaries produced by pre-release versions will be outlawed by the compiler: you’ll be required to recompile everything that was compiled by 1.1‑M0x and Beta (all the code from 1.0.x is perfectly fine without recompilation).\n\nIn Maven/Gradle: Add http://dl.bintray.com/kotlin/kotlin-eap-1.1 as a repository for the build script and your projects; use 1.1.0-beta-17 as the version number for the compiler and the standard library.\n\nIn IntelliJ IDEA: Go to Tools → Kotlin → Configure Kotlin Plugin Updates, then select “Early Access Preview 1.1” in the Update channel drop-down list, then press Check for updates.\n\nThe command-line compiler can be downloaded from the Github release page.\n\nOn try.kotlinlang.org. Use the drop-down list at the bottom-right corner to change the compiler version to 1.1‑Beta.\n\nLet’s Kotlin!",
  "latent_4549": "Coming into Sunday's game in Detroit, the Washington Wizards had lost two straight and 9 of 13, a month-long stretch of almost uniformly horrendous basketball in which they've fallen from second to fifth in the East. After the 38-point beating they took from the Cavs at home this past Friday, even that fifth-place standing seemed tenuous.\n\nAnd if, for one eight-minute stretch of the second quarter, those struggles might have seemed to explain the urgency and intensity with which the Wizards turned a three-point deficit into an 11-point lead, they do a pretty good job of making sense of what came after that stretch, too. The Wizards imploded; the Pistons pounced; that 11-point lead turned into a deeply embarrassing 17-point loss. The Wizards are desperate and hungry and all that, sure—but also, they're just not very good, and that's more important.\n\nBlaming this collapse on head coach Randy Wittman probably isn't totally fair. A lot of very fluid stuff makes a basketball team successful or not, and plenty of it isn't under the coach's control. But, on a nightly basis, one of the opponents the Wizards compete against—in addition to, y'know, those guys with the other-colored shirts—is the observable and abundantly well-documented fact that offensive efficiency on a basketball court is a thing that exists. That's a battle Wittman has them fighting, on purpose, by design, and on top of their normal work duties. If Wittman is Ahab, reality is his white whale. How talented would the Wizards have to be to kill it?\n\nDepending on your rooting interest, watching the Wizards play offense is either maddening and inexplicable, or hilarious, or both. A perfectly typical Wizards possession begins with John Wall bringing the ball up to the wing on one side of the floor, passing it to another player at the top of the arc, and then fighting his way through a forest of elbows in a long looping run along the baseline, to emerge beyond the arc on the opposite wing and catch a pass leading him away from the basket, whereupon the offense resets. It isn't done with the tempo crucial to making a ball-reversal work, and it doesn't lead into any subsequent action; other than burning off eight or so seconds of shot-clock that could have been spent on an actual effort to warp the defense or create a shot, and making Wall tired, it accomplishes nothing that could not be done simply by having Wall bring the ball up on the opposite side of the floor.\n\nAnd this isn't even the dumbest way the Wizards routinely and deliberately work against themselves! That honor goes to the set in which Bradley Beal passes the ball to a big along the arc, then darts back and forth across the big's face, trying to shake his defender off so he can receive a handoff ... five feet from where he was standing when he made the initial pass, with both a defender and his teammate crowding him and his momentum stringing him out along the arc instead of carrying him toward the lane. Even in the rare instances in which this inexplicable, Sisyphean act of scripted nowhere-getting does not result in a frantic, fumbled handoff to a young shooting guard whose ballhandling is his most glaring weakness, it gets the Wizards nothing they couldn't get by having Beal just dribble to the wing his damn self and call for a screen. In either case, it wastes time another team might reasonably spend on trying to score some points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's a version of that one.\n\nBeal doesn't make the pass to Nene, here, but look at where he is when he takes the handoff, relative to where he was when he started the dumb back-and-forth action required to get it. He's moved four feet! And, look at where the ball goes next! To John Wall, two feet from where he was when he initiated the play. Nothing has changed except the time. It's like Dadaist basketball!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen these and other similarly pointless scripted actions don't work—they don't work—the Wizards reset to a rushed high screen-and-roll, or dump the ball on poor Nene in the post, against a firmly entrenched defense, and watch him pump up a jumper. Sometimes they do that without even trying anything else first.\n\nOkay, so, you guys make a few aimless passes back and forth to each other, then dump it down to Nene so he can take an 18-footer with 14 seconds left on the shot-clock. The funniest part of this play is John Wall actually calling it at the beginning of the video. This is a play you call? With a hand-signal and everything? It's like scripting a flat tire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpposing teams long ago caught up to Wittman's one novel offensive idea—designing pick-and-roll sets that took advantage of Wall's unique ability to whip sniper-accurate passes to the opposite corner while driving hard toward the hoop—and, turns out, there just aren't any other tricks in his bag. The dreary go-nowhere sets described above bear fleeting resemblance to things the Spurs (those looping baseline runs to flip the offense from one side of the floor to the other) and Bulls (the handoff sets where the big acts as passer and screener at the same time) do, but damn, some data sure seems to have been lost in the import.\n\nThe whole thing proceeds effortfully—a testament both to Wittman's apparent motivational skill and to his players' professionalism—but with no evident purpose; one action proceeds from another in a manner superficially suggestive of basketball tactics, but what the sequence is meant to produce, or how, mechanically, it is meant to produce that thing, is never clear. It's like the performance of a deeply unnecessary magical rite whose practitioners do not understand it: I don't know how or why pouring tincture of frog spleen on a lock of burning virgin's hair is supposed to make Dana from accounting meet me at the restaurant next Friday evening for a romantic dinner, but I've been told this is how it works. Meanwhile, the Hawks are over here just, y'know, asking Dana from accounting to go out on a date.\n\nYou might forgive these byzantine means if they either produced, or were designed to produce, worthy and difficult-to-attain ends for the Wizards. They don't! By Wittman's own admission, reiterated in several crotchety defenses of his reasoning, he wants his players taking the shots the defense gives them, no matter which shots they are. By design, the shots most freely handed out by defenses are the worst ones, so you won't be surprised to learn that the Wizards attempt the third-most midrange shots in the NBA, the fourth-fewest three-pointers, and the tenth-fewest shots inside the restricted area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo you've got grinding, pointless, time-wasting actions, designed to create shots the Wizards could get just by asking, out loud, \"Hey, can I get a 19-footer?\" and watching the defense part itself voluntarily. It's like a Rube Goldberg device designed to drop an egg on the floor. These are the Wizards: a talented team pursuing a stupid strategy via even stupider tactics, on purpose.\n\nIronically, much of this can be traced to the exact approach that helped the Wizards improve so immediately when Wittman took over as interim coach after the firing of Flip Saunders in January of 2012. The team he inherited was a catastrophic, uncoached mess, and Wall, the face of the franchise, had stagnated into the bad habit of hurling himself into the thick of compressed defenses on every trip up the floor, as though if he tried hard enough he could overcome a 15-point deficit with one heroic play. Wittman, to his enormous credit, convinced Wall and the team to focus on defense, and on offense to calm down, trust the plays, and have faith they could make the shots those plays created. For Wall, it was the basketball equivalent of closing up your batting stance on an 0-2 count and slapping an outside pitch the opposite way, rather than insisting on trying to pull it to the next zip code. To extend the analogy: their hitting improved almost immediately.\n\nThis is what a good interim coach does. He or she walks into a bad situation pushing pared-down ambitions—let's play like professionals, for chrissakes—and a mechanical, effort-focused version of the sport, geared toward improving the performance of the team's best or most important player. It works because it allows a group of embarrassed, shell-shocked players, who just got their previous coach fired and likely aren't feeling so great about themselves or each other, to switch their scrambled minds off and just do, just play. Go through the motions, but do it hard, like you mean it. And it demonstrated something admirable about Wittman, too. Here was a coach who wasn't trying to prove his own genius, just trying to make basketball make sense to some bummed-out players who were tired of being humiliated all the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem, here, is that the traits that make for a good interim coach are not precisely the same as those of a good permanent head coach. A good interim coach thrives on how well his simplified, no-brainer basketball suits and refreshes a confused, lousy, psychically exhausted team; in most cases, he won't be around long enough to have to figure out any other moves. A good permanent coach, by contrast, can't improve a team just by getting the players to follow a plan; at some point, it has to be a good plan, or there's only so much they can do with it.\n\nA secret the interim coach may never get a chance to figure out is that, Kendrick Perkins aside, most NBA players are really, really, really good at basketball. And not just good at it, but smart as hell about it! They've been playing it forever, they know it inside-out, and they're capable of doing it intelligently with only a little more conscious deliberation than you or I devote to flinching away from a sudden loud noise. Knowing this, and taking advantage of it, is what good, permanent coaches do. The brilliance of, say, Mike Budenholzer isn't his ability to dream up revolutionary complexity in basketball play design; nor is it some magical insight that told him friggin' DeMarre Carroll, for example, is some special basketball savant. It's that he trusts his smart basketball players to be smart basketball players: to understand what kinds of shots are good shots to take, and why; to do quick, elegant stuff—like, for example, a screen, right at the beginning of the possession, just to get the ball moving toward the basket and a defender taking a step away from somebody else to contain it—to put themselves in advantageous position with as much time as possible to take advantage of it; and to keep themselves and the ball moving, not until the defense gives them a shot, but until it gives them the shot they want.\n\nNot so with Wittman, who's been a stopover coach in so many bad situations that maybe the interim outlook is all he knows. There's scarcely room anywhere in all his scripted time-wasting for the actual Wizards players to be smart; to react quickly and make decisions; to start the opposing defense scrambling and ping passes around to each other, one step ahead of the rotations and closeouts, until somebody finds himself with both the ball and a good look at an efficient shot. There's neither time nor freedom for it. They run their wasteful, elliptical scripted actions, the ball going nowhere in particular and moving the defense not at all, and those don't work, and then somebody obeys the mandate to crank up the first open 19-footer, and that's it. As though nothing good possibly could come from the players using the extra time to work for a shot worth taking. The passive 19-footer either goes in or it doesn't. It's a system with distrust of its practitioners hard-wired into it.\n\nOne of the more annoying prescriptions coaches haul out when asked how their slumping teams can get better is the one that goes, \"We've just gotta make shots.\" As if a struggling player might hear that and go, \"Wow, I hadn't considered that making shots might be better than missing them,\" and go out and giving shot-making a try. But, in the Wizards' case, they're only as good as their ability to make an above-average percentage of the dumb, passive shots their coach wants them taking. When they make a lot of those bad shots, it's usually enough to supplement Wall's superhuman individual play; when they don't, they lose—and that's the extent of Randy Wittman's insight into it. Whatever the problem, play defense, try hard, and execute is his answer, because it's the only thing that ever worked for him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, precise and effortful execution can only raise a bad plan to mediocrity, the mean to which the talented and once-promising Wizards are regressing at damn near supersonic speed. And Randy Wittman is still coaching for the interim; his native soil is the interim. Probably the Wizards will be better off when the interim is over.\n\nPhoto via Getty",
  "latent_4558": "A casual game known for its ubiquitous presence in bars and pubs (even coining the name pool hall), billiards is a catchall term for the tabletop game played that requires pool sticks (or cues) to hit hard balls into one of six pockets. The game can be played casually, as an amateur and even on the professional level. Each round of billiards, whatever game type one chooses to play, is uniquely presented and requires players to be mentally agile and physically adept.\n\nHere are the Top 10 from Health Fitness Revolution and author of the book ReSYNC Your Life Samir Becic:\n\nSlows aging in men – Beer and billiards have become a staple for socializing among men and with good reason! According to a recent study from the University of Copenhagen, drinking beer while playing a game of pool with friends can help keep older men active due to the exchange between active activity and passive activity during a round of pool. This can help combat the aging process by providing the elderly a casual activity that still utilizes the use of their muscles.\n\nBeer and billiards have become a staple for socializing among men and with good reason!

Helps build focus – Playing pool requires a great amount of focus and concentration. Your ability to focus on a given objective is essential in achieving happiness and attaining goals. In billiards, players must focus on their targets (the cue ball and the target ball), the angle of their own cue, the angle the cue ball will move in once it is hit and if the cue ball will strike the target ball.\n\nPlaying pool requires a great amount of focus and concentration.

Burns calories – There is a surprising amount of beneficial walking involved in a round of pool: a typical 2-hour 8-ball or 9-ball session often provides 100 trips\n\naround the table’s perimeter, which is about equal to walking nearly three-quarters of a mile.

Playing multiple games of pool will stack up these distances and burn even more calories! Enables stretching and balance – Playing requires a lot more stretching than a person would not normally do. Having to bend across the table top to reach the cue ball at a desired angle requires a player to be moderately flexible, especially with complex shots. Pool also enhances balance as the game requires you to stand on one foot at certain time, promoting stability.\n\nPlaying requires a lot more stretching than a person would not normally do.

Sharpens the mind – Those who frequently play billiards and pool often have sharper minds. Pool requires performing mental mathematical estimates and calculations, such as basic geometry and physics. These skills are necessary to calculate precise angles and trajectories and to determine how much force to apply during a strike so as not to under or overshoot a target. Having a sharp mind enables one to think on their feet faster and pick up on little details.\n\nThose who frequently play billiards and pool often have sharper minds.

The child who stole a bottle of wine is seen behind them returning with a bottle of Coke\n\nFree for all: Hooded youths spill out of the damaged store in Manchester after filling their pockets with cigarettes and bottles of alcohol\n\n'Whatever resources the police need they will get. What ever tactics they feel they need they will have legal backing to do so.'\n\nMr Cameron said that the police would be checking offenders 'picture by picture' and they would not let 'phoney human rights' stand in the way of bringing rioters to justice.\n\nHe said that something was 'seriously wrong' with society 'when you see children as young as 12 or 13 looting and laughing'.\n\nMr Cameron insisted the 'fightback' by police was succeeding today after a fourth night of rioting across the country. He said a 'more robust approach' by Scotland Yard last night had prevented a repeat of the worst trouble.\n\nThe PM said it was 'simply not acceptable' that violence was taking place and had spread to Manchester, Birmingham and Nottingham overnight.\n\n'We will not put up with this in our country. We will not allow a culture of fear to exist on our streets.\n\n'There are pockets of our society that are not only broken, but frankly sick...It is a complete lack of responsibility in parts of our society, people allowed to feel that the world owes them something.'\n\nLater, the Prime Minister also described the apparent hit-and-run killing of three men in Birmingham who were trying to protect shops from looters as a 'truly dreadful incident' and offered his condolences to their families.\n\nLabour leader Ed Miliband was quickly mobbed by members of the public and a large group surrounded and followed him as he made his way slowly around Market Street in Manchester.\n\nOne man, mistaking the Labour leader for his older brother, shouted: 'All platitudes, Dave, as usual. You are all the same.'\n\nStanding outside the burnt-out Miss Selfridge store, Mr Miliband told members of the public the first thing that had to be done was to 'restore public order'.\n\nMeeting: The Prime Minister discusses tactics with senior officers from the police, fire and ambulance services at the Wolverhampton Civic Centre\n\nRiot crackdown: Prime Minister David Cameron outside Downing Street today makes a speech on the riots in which he revealed that police will be given the green light to use water cannons similar to those used when protesters clashed with the Irish police in Dublin, Republic of Ireland in 2004, pictured right Walkabout: Labour leader Ed Miliband is heckled and called 'Dave' as he stands outside a burnt-out Miss Selfridge shop on Market Street in Manchester after rioting in the city\n\nHe said: 'Then we have got to look into the causes, why people are going around doing this. And I think there are a complex number of causes.' He said he thought it was 'partly about parental responsibility, partly about gangs and some of that culture'. Amid chaotic scenes, Mr Miliband thanked a nine-year-old girl called Jess Reid, from Denton, who had volunteered to help clean up the city centre and the crowd responded by giving her a round of applause.\n\nWATER CANNONS : A POWERFUL FORM OF RIOT CONTROL\n\nWater cannons shoot a high-pressure stream of water and have been used against rioters in Northern Ireland but never on the British mainland. They are also used in Europe today by countries such as France and Germany but have a history of being used repressively. They were deployed during the US civil rights movement in the 1960s and protesters in the former Soviet bloc. The devices were originally built to be used on boats to help put out fires and were first used for riot control in Germany at the start of the 1930s. More modern devices can be controlled remotely by joystick, meaning the operator is not put at risk.\n\nThey can carry 2,000 gallons (8,000 litres) of water and have a delivery rate of 250 gallons per minute (15 litres per second). But critics argue they are limited because they use up so much water they need constantly refilling and also have restricted mobility. The huge amount of water involved, initials costs and maintenance also mean they are extremely costly.\n\nThere are other problems because they are so indiscriminate and can cause serious injury.\n\nHe then met a group of other volunteers who had rallied to the cause after Jeremy Myers, 34, started the Twitter group @cleanupmanc.\n\nMr Miliband said: 'Good to see you. Thank you for coming out. I really appreciate it. This is the real spirit of Manchester, isn't it, rather than the yobs and what they do.'\n\nThis evening in the city, 800 police officers are patrolling the city centre, with their numbers bolstered by officers from the Lancashire and Cumbrian forces.\n\nIn another development, police in Croydon named the man who was found shot dead in his car during Monday's disturbances.\n\nHe was named by Scotland Yard as 26-year-old Trevor Ellis, who was from Brixton Hill.\n\nMr Ellis, died from the head injury, a post mortem examination showed today.\n\nA Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Initial inquiries indicate the victim had travelled to the Croydon area earlier on Monday August 8 in the company of a group of friends.\n\n'It is believed the group became involved in an altercation with a group of approximately nine individuals.\n\n'This altercation culminated in a vehicle pursuit involving three vehicles which commenced in Scarbrook Road, Croydon, passing along the A232 flyover into Duppas Hill Road where the victim was shot.'\n\nLast night disorder and looting rocked parts of Manchester particularly, but there was also trouble in Wolverhampton, West Bromwich, Nottingham, Leicester and Liverpool - although police appeared to containing the unrest.\n\nBut in what was by far the most serious incident of the night three men, two of them brothers aged 30 and 31, died in Birmingham after they were hit by a car.\n\nToday, the shocked father of the 21-year-old who was also killed told how he tried to save his son’s life as he lay in the street after the hit and run.\n\nTariq Jahan wept as he described how his hands and face were ‘covered in blood’ from his son Haroon, who died along with brothers Abdul Nasir, 31, and Shazad Ali, 30.\n\nPleading for an end to the violence he told BBC Radio 5 Live: ‘I miss him dearly but two days from now the whole world will forget.’\n\nWest Midlands Police is also currently investigating reports that shots were fired at a police officer just outside Birmingham city centre, thought to be in the Aston area, according to Sky.\n\nNone of the violence has escalated in the same way as it did in London the previous night. The capital remained relatively calm last night.\n\nSo far, 109 people have been arrested in the West Midlands, 110 in Manchester and Salford, and 44 in and around Liverpool. In Bristol there were 19 arrests for offences, including having a balaclava in your possession.\n\nThere was also a large blaze at a derelict art college in Gloucester, with several smaller fires, while police also dealt with small groups who attacked them. In Birmingham mobs rampaged through the city centre but unlike Saturday night, when shops were looted, the gangs mainly wreaked destruction, setting fire to cars and attempting to provoke police. Rioters continually regrouped and dispersed, forcing police to chase them. Crowds of around 500 assembled in the city centre and the atmosphere quickly turned menacing. During the disturbances the three men - the brothers and a friend - were involved in a hit-and-run incident in the Winson Green area as they were protecting their car wash business after the previous night's violence. They were taken to hospital but all subsequently died. A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'The incident occurred just after 1am in Dudley Road. West Midlands Police have launched a murder inquiry, arrested one man in connection with the incident and recovered a vehicle from near the scene which will be examined by forensics experts.'\n\nPolice appealed for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.\n\nA relative of one of the dead men victims told Sky News this morning: 'They were not in the way or blocking the road. The car swerved towards them.'\n\nHe said that the three had been on the street protecting their business - a car wash - after violence the previous night, when two cars swerved on to the pavement and struck them.\n\nThe three were taken to Birmingham City Hospital, where a large crowd gathered this morning at around 5.45am and police in riot gear stood guard at the main entrance, according to the BBC.\n\nElsewhere in the city, youths stormed Tesco, the post office, Marks & Spencer and House of Fraser and smoke poured from a flaming car blocking views of the city’s iconic Selfridges building.\n\nAs tens of thousands of pounds of goods are predicted to have been stolen, internet retail giants eBay and Gumtree have both said they will help the police to identify and remove any stolen items linked to crime after a fourth night of looting.\n\nReinforcements: Police file down the escalator and stand guard at the Mailbox shopping and hotel complex in Birmingham City Centre yesterday\n\nManchester: Dressed in full armour a group of riot officers walk through Market Street on Tuesday night.

  "latent_4652": "Kevin Holt manages large cap value assets aggregating about $20 billion on behalf of funds giant Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ). The Invesco Comstock Fund, which he has co-managed since 1999, has delivered net annualized returns of 7.7% over this period, compared to 4.7% from the S&P 500 (INDEXSP:.INX).\n\nKevin Holt’s Investment philosophy\n\n“We typically hold our positions for at least four or five years – most investors don’t have the inclination or stomach to do that,” says Holt in the latest issue of Value Investor Insight.\n\nAnd that’s born out of the two cornerstones of his investment process.\n\nThe first objective is to accurately assess the value of a company over an investment cycle, ignoring short-term bad news and market pessimism.\n\nThe second task, and evidently the more difficult one, is to hold onto that investment mustering all his patience and conviction while the target company returns to normalized earnings and growth.\n\nHolt admits candidly, “For four of the five years I typically own something, I’m usually miserable.”\n\nLarge caps are favorite hunting grounds\n\nDescribing US traded stocks of market capitalization in excess of $5 billion as his preferred “opportunity set,” Holt says he picks stocks on an individual basis and separate from any macro views. Stocks that appear inexpensive in the context of their historical valuations are possible candidates for investment by Holt.\n\nTo determine whether a stock is inexpensive, he examines its metrics such as ‘price to earnings levels’, ‘price to book value’ or ‘enterprise value to sales,’ and whether these are historically low in absolute and relative terms. Detailed fundamental analysis then seeks to uncover the reasons for the historically low valuation.\n\n“We’re also trying to zero in on the three or four issues that have made the stock cheap and whether the market may be misreading or misinterpreting them,” says Holt.\n\nHe also says he is fairly indifferent to the quality of a business. “Nobody actively seeks out bad business,” he says, “but we are willing to invest in lower-quality businesses if the price is right.”\n\nCompany management\n\nHe acknowledges that meeting company management would be necessitated only if the company has issues that need to be addressed on a priority basis with an action plan for their solution.\n\nInterestingly, Holt also examines the manner that compensation is paid to management. “In particular, we want executive pay to be based on return-on-capital-type metrics rather than on earnings growth or the stock price,” he clarifies.\n\nCurrent sectors of interest\n\nEnergy, big banks and pharmaceuticals currently engage Holt’s interest. In pharma, Holt is attracted by companies such as Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), which have undergone massive cost cutting and R&D rationalisation, but whose new drug pipelines could be a storehouse of value.\n\n“So while Merck today still trades at a discount to long-term averages, it has immunotherapy cancer drugs that may have efficacy across a number of cancer types, which would be revolutionary. We’re getting the upside from that type of thing for free,” says Holt.\n\nBig banks\n\nAmong big banks, Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) is one of his largest holdings.\n\nHolt acknowledges that big banks operate today in a radically changed environment as far as profitability is concerned, but feels that the market is not properly discounting what profits could accrue in the future on a normalized basis.\n\nCiti’s current organization structure comprises its core banking operation and the segregated Citi Holdings assets. Holt says the two units generate ROE of 13% and 6% respectively. “But it’s not rocket science to assume that on a normalized basis, Citi will earn at least the 13% ROE its core business is generating in a tough environment today with an expense base we believe is much higher than it needs to be,” he observes.\n\nWith a 13% ROE, he estimates that Citi should trade around 1.3 X of its tangible book value. However, at around $ 49, the bank is trading at only 85% of its TBV. Add to that the prospect of excess capital generated by the bank of around $ 50-$ 60 billion in the coming three years, which would likely be returned to shareholders in various forms, and Citi becomes a justifiable longer-term investment.\n\n“This is typical of what we own, with not a lot to get excited about in the near future, but trading at 50% of what we believe it can be worth three to five years out,” says Holt.\n\nHow to manage the misery\n\n“If you truly have conviction in the intrinsic value, you’re willing to average down when things go against you and to persevere until you’re proven right. When you are right, the misery is forgotten,” advises Holt.",
  "latent_4679": "OnLive was the poster child for cloud gaming, before its disasterous collapse. But today, after nearly a full year of radio silence, the company which proved that you can play games over the internet has emerged with a new business model. Instead of selling digital copies of games which you can only access through the OnLive network, the company has now launched a unique partnership with Steam to let you stream PC games you already own for a $14.99 monthly subscription. Because the service interfaces with Steam to sync savegames and DLC, you can pick up right where you left off on your computer.\n\nOnLive is done trying to compete with Steam\n\nThe new service is called Cloudlift, and it's fairly limited to start. So far, OnLive has only signed two major publishers to offer a total of 20 games, with \"dozens more\" titles inbound. However, those publishers do include Warner Bros, which has agreed to include all three of the popular Batman: Arkham games, as well as the recent The Lego Movie Videogame.\n\nThe company also says it'll be vastly easier to convince publishers to put games on the service, telling VentureBeat that OnLive now works without the need to modify games. Previously, publishers had to sell games through OnLive's storefront, let OnLive modify the game code to transmit user commands over the internet, and more. Now, it sounds like they can simply give OnLive permission to stream them from a server running Steam — which coincidentally had recently been updated to add controller and short-range streaming support.\n\n\"The new strategy is providing complimentary services,\" new OnLive executive chairman Mark Jung told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn addition to the $14.99 Cloudlift subscription, OnLive will continue to offer a Netflix-like back catalog of 250 older titles for $9.99 a month, with no need to purchase individual games before you stream, as well as a new service called OnLive Go catered towards MMOs that require giant downloads, theoretically letting you experience them instantly instead of waiting for those downloads to complete. The first title there, a version of Second Life that can be viewed on tablet, smart TV or laptop, costs an steep $3 hour to play according to PCWorld.\n\nHowever, it sounds like OnLive is experimenting with all of these price points. \"$14.99 seemed like the right pirce to start with,\" new VP of product and marketing Rick Sanchez told Ars Technica. \"We hope that we've got the right price for it. Time will tell.\"\n\n\"We hope that we've got the right price for it. Time will tell.\"\n\nIn addition to the new offerings, OnLive has a new HTML5 interface that felt extremely sluggish in a quick test, and which no longer allows you to try games for free before signing up for a subscription. You can still record hilarious \"Brag Clips\" of your recent exploits, though, and spectate other people as they play, both features which OnLive pioneered before Microsoft and Sony's recent attempts to take them mainstream. The service still works on Windows, Mac, and Android devices, as well as the company's own microconsole, but iOS support is still in the offing.\n\nOnLive moves into these revamped business ventures with two new data centers in Seattle and Chicago and a brand-new management team, including Mark Jung, a former co-founder and CEO of IGN and CEO of Vudu, Carrie Holder, a former director of partner management at Electronic Arts, Rick Sanchez, another IGN co-founder and former VP of Playdom, and Don Gordon, an inventor who was a former VP at Gracenote.",
  "latent_4754": "DATE: Dec 30, 2013 | BY: Rudie Obias | Category: Sci-Fi\n\nIn roughly a month, we’ll find out if the new RoboCop will be a remake worth watching, like John Carpenter’s The Thing or David Cronenberg’s The Fly, or if it will be part of the countless remakes that are soulless, humorless, and dull, like Total Recall, the new Straw Dogs, and the recent The Thing. Director José Padilha has a few good movies under his belt, like Elite Squad and the sequel Elite Squad: The Enemy Within, but everything we’ve been seeing from RoboCop makes it look like the cheap knock off of Paul Verhoeven’s original.\n\nToday, Sony released a new image that features RoboCop facing off against a number of robotic prototypes as part of Rick Mattox (Jackie Earle Haley) – who is a military tactician responsible for training the cyborg law enforcement agent – training exercise. We’ve seen bits and pieces of this scene in almost every trailer thus far, and it certainly looks like RoboCop will square off against other robotic drones, as well as with ED-209. These new prototype robots also look like all of Tony Stark’s prototypes at the end of Iron Man 3. That was one scene missing from the original RoboCop, a training exercise where RoboCop destroys a bunch of expensive toys.\n\nRecently, Sony unveiled a number of new images and stills. A majority of the new images features RoboCop in scenes that highlight his human alter ego, Alex Murphy. One of the aspects of the new film that will be different from the original is that Murphy will be front and center throughout the whole film. RoboCop is aware of his previous identity, so he’s not going to be struggling to learn who he is. Abbie Cornish plays Murphy’s wife Clara, who appears to be RoboCop’s link to being human.\n\nAt least the filmmakers behind the remake are trying to bring a fresh perspective to the new film. Despite negative reactions to the remake, early test screenings suggest something different. It appears that some audiences are warming up to José Padilha’s version. Early reactions suggest that the remake captures Verhoeven’s vision of a dark and bleak future, while at the same time toning down the heavy violence the original is known for. It’s the RoboCop movie that you can take home to meet your mother.\n\nSet in the year 2028, a multinational conglomerate called OmniCorp has become the worldwide leader of robotic technology. OmniCorp is winning wars around the world with drones and the corporation now wants to bring their technology to the home front, to protect cities across the United States. Now meet Alex Murphy, a loving husband, father, and honest cop in Detroit, who is critically injured after a car bomb attack. OmniCorp utilizes their robotics technology to save and turn him into RoboCop.\n\nRoboCop stars Joel Kinnaman, Abbie Cornish, Michael Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson, Gary Oldman, Jackie Earle Haley, Michael Kenneth Williams, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Miguel Ferrer, Jennifer Ehle, and Jay Baruchel.

This multi-event design recognizes the need for comprehensive all-hazards planning and the complexity to ensure exercise objectives are met. Capstone 2014 is a complex emergency preparedness exercise comprised of five distinct, but linked, component events. This year’s exercise components include Alaska Shield, Ardent Sentry 14, Nuclear Weapon Accident/Incident Exercise, Eagle Horizon, and Silver Phoenix.\n\n“In order to be ready for disasters, as a nation, we have to practice how we would respond,” FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate said. “In Capstone 2014, FEMA joins state, tribal and local government, along with our partners in the non-profit, faith-based and private sectors to test and assess our joint preparedness for a disaster. Preparedness is a team effort, and every family and business can take steps to be ready for disasters by learning your risks, making a plan, and having a kit. Visit www.ready.gov to learn easy steps on how to prepare and take action.”\n\nBy congressional mandate, these exercises—formerly known as National Level Exercises and the Top Officials exercises— represent the culmination of a two-year cycle and are designed to educate and prepare participants for potential catastrophic events. These exercises are facilitated by FEMA’s National Exercise Division.\n\nThe exercise is national in scope with the goal of fostering coordination and building relationships prior to an incident occurring. Each exercise cycle varies from drills to functional assessments, and it challenges participants from all levels of government, non-governmental and private sector organizations and other organizations representing the whole community.\n\nVarious aspects of local, state, federal, non-governmental, private sector and other whole community organizations will be tested by the exercise, including the emergency response to mass casualties from the earthquake, resulting infrastructure, communication and coordination challenges and the tangential element of hazardous materials spills.\n\nAmong the exercises and participants are the following:\n\nAlaska Shield: FEMA and state emergency management agencies, including Alaska, will commemorate the anniversary of the 1964 9.2 magnitude Great Alaskan Earthquake, with an exercise that tests response and mass casualty care.\n\nArdent Sentry 14: In conjunction with Alaska Shield and other exercises during the period, the Department of Defense will exercise its Defense Support to Civilian Authorities’ mission.\n\nNuclear Weapon Accident/Incident Exercise: The Department of Energy will participate in the exercise with a scenario that tests response and recovery following an accident during secure transport convoy of nuclear weapons.\n\nEagle Horizon 2014: During this exercise, many federal departments and agencies will activate their continuity of operations and reconstitution planning to test their continuity plans and ensure that primary mission essential functions can take place from alternate facilities.\n\nSilver Phoenix 2014: This exercise explores challenges associated with examining, prioritizing, and conducting recovery activities involving multiple geographically-dispersed and competing events using the National Disaster Recovery Framework.\n\nFor more information on these exercises, visit www.fema.gov/national-level-exercise.

I joined the Green Party because it is the only party to consistently support climate action -- carbon pricing, an end to fossil fuel subsidies, aggressive efforts in energy efficiency and demand-side management and the steady expansion of renewable and green energy. These steps would improve our economic performance, create tens of thousands of new jobs across Canada, while preserving a sustainable world for our children.\n\nThe only time a major party was willing to call for a tax shift, to reduce income taxes and increase pollution taxes, was in 2008 under Stephane Dion's Liberal leadership. And what party was first out the gate to slam him? The federal New Democrats. Then, when the BC Liberals announced a provincial carbon tax, one now widely supported across British Columbia, the BC NDP launched their \"Axe the Tax\" campaign. Now, in the 2013 provincial election, we have the NDP taking a better position, by broadening the scope of the carbon tax, with, ironically, the provincial Liberals calling for a freeze.\n\nWhat Canadian politics needs is a party that is more interested in respectful debate and dialogue, in pressing for climate action as a daily commitment, than parties that swing with the winds of political expediency.\n\nI never imagined I would be a candidate for any party. As a scientist, I am way outside my comfort zone. But when I look at my children and imagine what their future will be if we continue with politics as usual, I realized I could no longer sit on the sidelines.\n\nThe decisions being made in Victoria and Ottawa are too important to be left to the politicians. Here in British Columbia, the two major parties are willing to bet our province's future on fracking and natural gas exports. Green leader Jane Sterk was able to obtain a confession from Premier Clark in the debates that the energy from the Site C dam is intended for that LNG production. Meanwhile, renewable energy opportunities for BC are being ignored and critical infrastructure improvements, for efficient mass transit, are ignored.\n\nGreens understand we will not be forming government any time soon. But we equally believe it is critical to have representatives in our legislatures who will support other parties when they have a good idea, criticize those who twist the truth, condemn those who block action, and work to promote cooperative, positive decisions to reduce greenhouse gases. Let's stop pointing fingers and work together to get the action we need.",
  "latent_4940": "Current record-shattering temperatures are shocking even to climate scientists\n\nPosted on 21 March 2016 by dana1981\n\n“Stunning,” “wow,” “shocker,” “bombshell,” “astronomical,” “insane,”“unprecedented”– these are some of the words climate scientists have used to describe the record-shattering global surface temperatures in February 2016.\n\nNASA GISS global monthly (red) and 12-month average (blue) surface temperatures as compared to pre-industrial temperatures. Illustration: Dana Nuccitelli\n\nIt’s difficult to see any ‘pause’ or slowdown in the global warming over the past 50 years.\n\nTo put the current temperatures into context, prior to last October, monthly global surface temperatures had not been more than 0.96°C hotter than the 1951–1980 average, according to Nasa. The past 5 months have been 1.06°C, 1.03°C, 1.10°C, 1.14°C, and 1.35°C hotter than that average, absolutely destroying previous records. Estimates from Noaa are in broad agreement with those from Nasa.\n\nRight now, the Earth’s average surface temperature is hotter than it’s been in thousands of years; potentially even longer.\n\nHow much of a role is El Niño playing?\n\nWe’re currently at the peak of a very strong El Niño event, which has brought warm water up to the ocean surface. That’s certainly played a major role in the current record-breaking temperatures. The hottest years are almost invariably years with El Niño events, although 2014 was the first year in decades to set a temperature record without an El Niño.\n\nFor comparison, the current El Niño event is very similar to a previous one in 1997–1998. That event made 1998 by far the hottest year on record at the time, and it’s why contrarians often cherry pick temperatures over the past 18 years – the abnormally hot 1998 was 18 years ago.\n\nHowever, the past 6 months have been 0.43°C hotter than the corresponding months in 1997–1998. So clearly, while El Niño is a big contributor to the current record-shattering temperatures, human-caused global warming is playing a major role as well. Climate scientist Michael Mann attributed the record to approximately 50% human influences, and 50% a combination of El Niño and natural weather fluctuations.\n\nAre temperatures approaching dangerous levels?\n\nLast December, 195 countries signed the COP21 international climate agreement in Paris. Graham Readfearn summarized the agreement for The Guardian:\n\nThe guts of the agreement hang off the so-called “long-term goal” that commits almost 200 countries to hold the global average temperature to “well below 2°C” above pre-industrial levels and to “pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C”.\n\nDepending on how exactly we define “pre-industrial,” February temperatures were between 1.5 and 2°C hotter than those in pre-industrial times. So, we’re already starting to tread on thin ice, in the range that the global community has deemed dangerously hot.\n\nHowever, since we’re at the peak of an El Niño, as they did after 1998, global surface temperatures will temporarily go back down once this event is over. That is, until human-caused global warming pushes them up to and beyond these temperatures once again in the near future. As climate scientists Steve Sherwood and Stefan Rahmstorf wrote,\n\nThis is the true climate emergency: it is getting more difficult with each passing year for humanity to prevent temperatures from rising above 2℃. February should remind us how pressing the situation is.\n\nA glimpse at the consequences of global warming\n\nIn the meantime, we’re getting a glimpse at the future climate consequences of our carbon pollution. Just to name a few, Africa is being battered by heat and drought, with more than 36 million people facing hunger across the southern and eastern parts of the continent as a result. Droughts in Vietnam and Zimbabwe have cost these countries 4% and 12% of their GDP, respectively. Arctic ice is in poor shape as a result of the region’s warmest-recorded winter. Australia has been breaking heat records as well, with 39 consecutive days in Sydney above 26℃ (double the previous record). And a massive coral bleaching event appears likely on the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nClick here to read the rest",

  "latent_5164": "Morgan Evenson was walking home in downtown Minneapolis on the evening of Dec. 13 when a black man got out of his car, chased her down, tackled her and repeatedly thrust a 3-4-inch blade into her flailing body.\n\nThe 26-year-old computer-store clerk frantically fought back, kicking, scratching and screaming for help.\n\nAt some point, neighbors heard her screams and came to her aid. Her attacker – described as a Somali man in his early 20s, about 5-foot-7 with a slight build and wearing grey stone-washed jeans – fled.\n\nEvenson was left bleeding on the curb with 14 stab wounds on her arms, neck and back. Her kidney was lacerated. She was lucky to survive.\n\nIt happened while she was walking home from the Apple Store, where she worked, about eight blocks away from her apartment. That’s when the man attacked her for no apparent reason. Police, who have not made any arrests in the case, are calling it a botched robbery.\n\nEvenson told KSTP she struggled with her attacker at the corner of 32nd Street and Fremont Avenue and she considers herself lucky to be alive.\n\n“It was horrifying, because I could feel something that felt like it was stinging me, but it was him stabbing me,” she said. “Doctor’s told me I had 14 wounds that needed stitches, including a lacerated kidney.”\n\nEvenson told KSTP her main concern now is getting better and helping police find whoever did this so he cannot do it again.\n\n“I cannot imagine anyone attacking someone like that and as a woman it is especially frightening, but I knew I had to fight back and I want him to know I am OK and that he will be caught,” Evenson said.\n\nPolice have called the case unusual for the level of brutality just to get a woman’s purse, leading some to wonder if the assailant didn’t want more than just a purse.\n\nThe Minneapolis Star-Tribune, the city’s largest newspaper, has been AWOL on the story.\n\nThe newspaper’s on-duty news editor, Maria Reeve, did not return WND’s calls Tuesday to inquire about why it went dark on such a brutal, unprovoked attack on a defenseless, unarmed woman walking home from work.\n\nOther media, such as the Southwest Journal, have reported on the crime but left out the assailant’s full description as a Somali migrant.\n\nOnly one media outlet, local ABC News affiliate KSTP, included in its on-air coverage the fact that the victim described her assailant as Somali, but the station’s website article failed to mention that fact.\n\nWatch KSTP’s description of the attack and the suspect in the report below:\n\nA friend of Evenson’s started a GoFundMe page to raise money for uncovered medical costs.\n\nThe page said Evenson was readmitted to the hospital Dec. 19 to monitor a recurring fever and blood pressure.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon the GoFundMe page had raised more than $15,000 for uncovered medical bills.\n\nNo isolated case\n\nThe case of Morgan Evenson continues a pattern of Somali crimes being covered up, downplayed, lightly investigated and eventually falling off the radar in Minnesota.\n\nHere are just some of the Somali-related cases in Minnesota that never seem to get resolved.\n\nJustine Damond, 40, was killed in July after calling police to report a sexual assault in progress in the ally next to her home in Minneapolis’s 5th precinct. Two officers arrived in a squad car, and the one sitting in the passenger seat, Officer Mohamed Noor, fired across his partner at Damon when she approached the police car in her nightgown.\n\nNo formal charges have yet been brought against Noor, who was precinct’s first Somali refugee to be hired as a cop, a fact that Mayor Betsy Hodges had bragged about in her city newsletter.\n\nHennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman was recorded earlier this month telling a gathering of union members that he was frustrated at a lack of evidence to charge Noor.\n\nFreeman has since apologized for his remarks, saying they were “ill-advised”, and promised more details on the “status of our charging decision” in the coming days. Relatives of Damond said last week they were concerned her death was not being investigated properly. For three straight days in late June 2016, residents of Linden Hills neighborhood on Lake Calhoun in Minneapolis were terrorized by a group of more than a dozen Somali men in their early- to mid-20s. Several of the men threatened to rape a female resident of the community, saying it was their right under Shariah law, while others drove their cars over neighbors lawns shouting “jihad,” set off bottle rockets, and pretending to shoot people on the beach. The Minneapolis police were repeatedly called, but every time they responded too late to make any arrests, and the investigation never resulted in any arrests. The story was carried by one local TV station and ignored by the newspapers. In 2014 a mysterious New Year’s Day explosion occurred at a building containing several apartments and a grocery store in the heavily-Somali area of Cedar Riverside, Minneapolis. According to a Freedom of Information lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch, the city fire department requested that the federal ATF not investigate the explosion, which killed three people, and the investigation has never come to an official conclusion on the cause. All of the apartments were occupied by Somali residents. In April 2017 WND reported on the presence of “Shariah cops” patrolling the streets of Cedar Riverside, making uninvited visits to the homes of local Somalis to make sure they were living in compliance with Sharia, requiring appropriate attire for women and minimal contact between unmarried members of the opposite sexes. Police said they were “monitoring” the situation but made no arrests, even though they knew the identity of the lead suspect, Abdullah Rashid, and had complaints from local Muslims about Rashid and his cohorts harassing them. In August 2017, someone threw a low-grade incendiary device into a window at the Dar al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington. The device was thrown into the imam’s office through a window at a time when the imam was not there. No one was hurt. Gov. Mark Dayton and local CAIR officials immediately labeled the incident an anti-Muslim “hate crime,” despite not having any evidence to tie the attack to an anti-Muslim person or group. No arrests have been made, but the mosque has raised thousands of dollars of sympathy money off the incident. In November 2017, a Somali man carried out a bloody knife attack against two brothers in the changing room of a clothing store at Mall of America. The police and local media described the incident as a botched robbery in which the two brothers were attacked after trying to stop the Somali from shoplifting. WND has since been told by a friend of the family that the narrative put out by the media was not accurate, that the attack was completely unprovoked and random.\n\nDebra Anderson, chair of ACT For America’s Minnesota chapter, said she has been trying for four years, without success, to get Minnesota sheriffs to train their departments to better prepare and deal with Sharia-related crime such as FGM, honor violence and terrorism.\n\nShe said it was telling that no police response was recorded in the stabbing attack on Morgan Evenson. Her life was only saved because she fought back and her screams were heard by people living and working in the area.\n\n“It was interesting the articles I read didn’t say anything about the police coming. Not a thing. Just sounds like the classic media template used in Europe,” Anderson told WND. “You had to get all the way through that KSTP [broadcast only] report to find out he’s Somali, and it was never mentioned in the other media outlets at all.”\n\nThat’s very disconcerting for someone who has been trying to educate Minnesotans about the pitfalls of kowtowing to the Somali community and its “civil rights” advocates at CAIR.\n\n“It’s unofficial but Minnesota law enforcement agencies are enforcing, or at least tolerating, Shariah law. Most people don’t know it yet but the police are not here to protect the indigenous Minnesotans anymore,” Anderson said. “They have been incrementally changing their search policies and their use of force policies for years. We’re not being protected anymore. They’re protecting the Muslims, so it’s becoming increasingly like Europe. Yes, it’s here now.”",

The Bay Bridged had a chance to speak with Jeff (because c'mon, how do you turn down an interview offer from Jeff Bridges?) as well as Berkeley Rose School Faculty Chair/Admissions Director Judith Wares.\n\nJeff Bridges: Hey Michael!\n\nThe Bay Bridged: Hey Jeff! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. How did you get involved with the Berkeley Rose School?\n\nJB: Well my granddaughter attends the school, and my wife and I visited, and we were just so impressed with it. We heard they wanted to expand, wanted help getting enrollment up, so we decided to put on this concert.\n\nTBB: That's great. What do you like about the school?\n\nJB: I like that their focus is on community. That’s a very potent word I think, and it kind of manifests itself at the school that from first through eighth grade, the kids are in the same class with the same teacher, the same classmates, and it really helps them build relationships.\n\nTBB: Oh, that's cool.\n\nJB: Yeah. And it's really about allowing the kid to be a kid for a long time. You don’t want to bring the cake out of the oven too soon, you know? You want to let them experience childhood as long as they can. The impulse to cram adulthood down kids' brains because parents are concerned about competition, teaching kids about computers when they’re three, doing long division too early, that’s not what this school does. They’re (the school) not against technology, but there are “seasons” for things, you know? The kids need to be kids for as as they can.\n\nTBB: That makes sense. I was reading about alumni of Waldorf education, the kind of teaching they do at Berkeley Rose School, and there were plenty of artist types like you might expect: Y'know, actors, musicians, architects, and others. But there were also CEOs, prime ministers, scientists, people who you'd think would benefit from just cramming information in their brains. They still got the tools they needed to accomplish whatever their goals were.\n\nJB: Exactly.\n\nTBB: So I see in the photo you've got a beautiful red Gretsch guitar. Is that what you’ll be playing at the concert?\n\nJB: No, we’re going to be doing an acoustic thing, I’ll be playing a J45, that’s what I’ve settled on for acoustic. We’ll be doing stuff from the film Crazy Heart, and we’ll play songs from, what have we done, three albums now? We did a live album recently with The Abiders, that’s my band. The show will be a duo with Chris Pelonis, my musical director, two acoustic guitars.\n\nTBB: Cool, and your daughter Jessie Bridges is opening the show.\n\nJB: Yeah, that’s the cherry on top of the sundae for me, I get to see her play! She’s great, and she has her stuff on iTunes, she’s got videos online.\n\nTBB: Did you have a lot of music in the house as your children grew up?\n\nJB: Yeah! Yeah, we sure did, and we’ve been on the road together, we’ve played concerts together, it’s been great.\n\nTBB: I really enjoyed Sleeping Tapes, I don’t suppose you guys will play anything from that?\n\nJB: Haha, well, you never know, probably not. We actually did a performance of one of those tunes in Brooklyn, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, with an orchestra and everything.\n\nTBB: Oh wow, that must've been fun. Any plans for more concerts soon?\n\nJB: Nothing in the works right now, we'll see what happens.\n\nTBB: Well thank you so much for talking to us, looking forward to the show!\n\nJB: Yeah, thanks, it'll be a good time!\n\nNext, Judith Wares from Berkeley Rose School:\n\nTBB: Hey Judith, thanks for speaking with me. Tell me about Berkeley Rose School and their approach to education.\n\nJudith Wares: Well, the good one-line introduction to our teaching style is that our task as teachers is to light the fire of inspiration, to build enthusiasm for learning rather than fill a person with data. We want children to speak with their own voice, and have their own experiences.\n\nTBB: That's interesting. How long have you been with Berkeley Rose School?\n\nJW: Well I've been involved with Waldorf education for about forty years, and I've been at Berkeley Rose School for five years.\n\nTBB: Oh wow. What is Waldorf education, how did it start?\n\nJW: Waldorf education is about 100 years old, started by a scientist named Rudolf Steiner. In Austria, Steiner saw some of the horrible things happening in the early 20th century and thought that society needed a new social order. So he created a system to educate the head, the heart, and the hands.\n\nTBB: I ask because it seems especially good for education today. With the internet, facts and data aren't as important to learn, since we can look up anything at anytime with the phones in our pockets. What seems necessary now is knowing what to do with that information, how to analyze, how to decide what's important.\n\nJW: Exactly, and engaging the imagination, giving room for imagination, that's how to educate people to become problem solvers.\n\nTBB: Sounds like a great school. Looking forward to the event, thank you so much for speaking to me!\n\nJW: Thank you!\n\nAn Evening of Music and Conversation with Jeff Bridges\n\nJessie Bridges\n\nFreight & Salvage\n\nApril 15, 2016\n\n8pm, $50-$125\n\nRelated Posts No related posts.\n\nTags: Jeff Bridges",

  "latent_5957": "Interim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose, who introduced a bill last month on mandatory training in sexual-assault law for would-be judges, was directly involved in the appointment of the only federal judge to resign over his conduct of a rape trial, according to a former Conservative justice minister.\n\nThat judge, Robin Camp, had acquitted an accused rapist in 2014 after asking the complainant – whom he repeatedly called \"the accused\" – why she did not keep her knees together. A disciplinary body recommended his dismissal and Mr. Camp resigned last month.\n\nRead also: Conservative bill on training judges in sex-assault law spurs political clash\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMs. Ambrose played a key role in the judicial appointment process when the Conservatives held power, according to Peter MacKay. He was the justice minister who promoted Mr. Camp to the Federal Court in Ottawa from the Alberta Provincial Court in Calgary, where he conducted the sex-assault trial. Mr. MacKay said that despite multiple levels of screening, the government was unaware of Mr. Camp's handling of the trial of Alexander Wagar when it appointed him to the Federal Court.\n\nMs. Ambrose declined to comment for this story.\n\nThe Conservative government, like its Liberal predecessors, relied on a network of \"political ministers,\" also known as regional ministers, to screen candidates in each province, and make recommendations to the justice minister, according to dozens of interviews with legal officials and members of both parties. Ms. Ambrose was political minister for northern Alberta, and Jason Kenney was political minister for southern Alberta (he is now the leader of Alberta's Progressive Conservatives). The Globe and Mail contacted Mr. MacKay after Liberals on a Commons committee studying Ms. Ambrose's bill criticized him on Tuesday for appointing Mr. Camp to the Federal Court.\n\nIn his response to The Globe, Mr. MacKay described the process in which judges are screened, first by a non-partisan committee, then by regional ministers and later by the department of justice (DOJ). Nothing turned up on Mr. Camp's comments from the Wagar trial, he said in an e-mail. At the time, he noted, the Crown was appealing the acquittal.\n\n\"There is also a search done at DOJ and checks by the Regional Minister(s). There were no formal complaints before the Canadian Judicial Council or the Provincial AG as he was a prov-trial judge when the comments were made. Not one of these oversights turned up the comments made by Camp.\"\n\nThe Globe asked Mr. MacKay specifically if Ms. Ambrose and Mr. Kenney vetted and approved Mr. Camp's appointment to the Federal Court. He replied: \"Regional Ministers always had sign off on all judicial appointments and could also challenge any GIC appointment at Cabinet when lists were presented.\" GIC refers to governor-in-council appointments – that is, appointments made by the governor-general on the advice of cabinet.\n\nMr. MacKay also said that if he had known of Mr. Camp's comments in the sexual-assault trial, he would not have appointed him. \"Had I been made aware I would never have brought the name to Cabinet for approval, period,\" said Mr. MacKay, now a partner with the global law firm Baker McKenzie, working out of Toronto.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHe added: \"Sadly there is no perfect system. We have seen past examples of judges being removed for conduct unbecoming on various matters even convicted of Criminal Code offences. Hindsight is 20/20.\"\n\nMs. Ambrose made a similar point at the committee studying her bill on Tuesday, saying any government could appoint a judge that it would live to regret.\n\n\"You have no idea what some judge might say or has said or done that your government might appoint.\"\n\nSome in the legal community say the fault lies not in judicial training – programs exist for sitting judges to receive instruction on sexual-assault law – but in the appointment process. Mr. Camp, a business lawyer, was appointed by the provincial Progressive Conservatives under premier Alison Redford to the Provincial Court, which has a huge docket of criminal matters. He went to the Federal Court even as his conduct of the Wagar trial was being appealed by the Alberta prosecution service.\n\n\"For me, it raises a question of the appointment process,\" George Thomson, the former director of the National Judicial Institute, which trains federally and provincially appointed judges, said of the Camp controversy in an interview.\n\nBrent Rathgeber was one of the few lawyers in the Alberta caucus of the federal Conservatives, from 2008 to 2013, before becoming an independent and then leaving politics to launch a private legal practice in St. Albert.

( NICHOLAS KAMM / AFP )\n\nPark Romney also maintains a website denouncing Mormonism and casting doubt on Mitt Romney’s ability to be the leader of the United States. The fundamental beliefs of the religion based on founder Joseph Smith’s translations of an Egyptian scroll, has been discredited by modern study of the documents, he said. “We are talking about a Church whose former prophet, Joseph Smith, declared himself King, and ordered the destruction of a private printing enterprise that was about to publish revelations about his personal indiscretions,” Park Romney says on his website. The two men are second cousins who share a great-grandfather, Miles Romney, and have never met.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Mitt Romney, campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul has said of Park: “Gov. Romney has never heard of this person, and he doesn’t know him.” Park Romney contends his relative needs to be held accountable to his faith. Mormon Church leaders, Park Romney says on his website, “are exploiting the faith of the lay members in extracting countless millions of dollars in tithing receipts, a significant portion of which are being invested in worldwide commercial enterprises.” If Mitt Romney is aware of this, “how do we escape the conclusion that he is party to this fraud, as a high priest of the Mormon Church?” READ MORE: U.S. election coverageE",
  "latent_6112": "The Fox 25 blackout for Verizon FIOS customers in Mass. meant that viewers could not see the Cowboys-Eagles game.\n\nJust in time for Thanksgiving football, about 400,000 Massachusetts households that subscribe to Verizon FiOS for TV service lost their signal to Fox 25 on Thursday morning because of a fee dispute between Verizon and the new owner of the Boston-area Fox affiliate.\n\nThe blackout meant that viewers could not see the Cowboys-Eagles game on Fox 25 (the Eagles won, 33 to 10), ruining a Thanksgiving tradition for some, and prompting others to vent their outrage on Facebook or search for options to watch the game.\n\n“We have people here and some of them really want to watch the game, including me,’’ said Peter Gould, 53, from his Framingham home. “We’ve been waiting all day for it.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was unclear Thursday evening when the signal would be restored. Disputes over what are known as carriage fees — charged by the owners of television stations like Fox 25 to cable companies like Verizon — are occurring with increasing frequency nationwide, and they can last for days or weeks. Both sides had worked late Wednesday before missing a deadline early Thursday morning.\n\nGet Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here\n\nAs is typical for this type of showdown, both sides blamed the other for not reaching an agreement.\n\nVerizon said the problem can be traced to the change in ownership at Fox 25, also known as WFXT-TV, last month, when Cox Media Group took control of the Dedham-based station from Twenty-First Century Fox. At that point, Cox sought a new contract with what Verizon said is an unreasonable increase in carriage fees. Verizon said it doesn’t want to give in to Cox’s demands because that would translate into higher bills for its customers.\n\nVerizon said the price Cox is seeking is substantially higher than what it pays to carry other local stations with national network affiliations, such as WCVB-TV, WHDH-TV, and WBZ-TV.\n\n“It’s unfortunate that Cox has decided to deny our FiOS customers its Fox programming because we won’t cave in to those unreasonable demands,” Alberto Canal, vice president for corporate communications at Verizon, wrote in a blog posting on the company’s website Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCox officials said they are seeking a fair price for the content offered to viewers via the local Fox affiliate, content that includes many NFL games such as the Cowboys-Eagles game.\n\n“Cox Media Group remains committed to finding a solution to this dispute because we care about all our viewers, regardless of their video provider,” Tom Raponi, general manager at Fox 25, said in an e-mail Thursday.\n\n“We have made ourselves available to Verizon whenever they would like to have further discussions . . . so talks could reconvene at any time.”\n\nNeither side would disclose the rate that Cox is seeking. However, in a statement on the Fox 25 website, Cox said it is asking for less than one-third of the roughly $6 per month that Verizon reportedly pays per subscriber for ESPN.\n\nThe American Television Alliance, an industry group that includes Verizon as a member, issued a statement condemning Cox’s stance. During the past few years, the group said, Cox has blacked out viewers in at least 12 markets over fee disputes. But the issue is by no means limited to Cox: The group said the blackout in Boston is the 75th by TV broadcasters this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The biggest turkey today is Cox, who is taking away the NFL and other programming from Americans who just want to watch TV with their families,” American Television Alliance spokesman Brian Frederick said in a statement Thursday. “By putting profits ahead of consumers on a national holiday, broadcasters are showing their true colors.”\n\nChris Tashjian, a 36-year-old Verizon subscriber in Marlborough, said he wasn’t planning to watch the Eagles-Cowboys game, but he was still annoyed by what he described as “two companies being greedy.’’\n\n“Realistically I’m not going to drop FiOS for this because Comcast customer service is horrible, and I live in a town where basically the only cable provider choices are Verizon and Comcast,’’ Tashjian said in an interview Thursday.\n\nA Verizon spokesman said nearly all of the company’s Massachusetts TV customers lost access to Fox programming, with the exception of those in four communities in Bristol County who can get WNAC-TV, a Fox affiliate based in Providence.\n\nFox 25’s programming was available on other cable providers in the area, and over the air.\n\nWellesley resident Cimarron Buser, who launched a Facebook page for people who lost service, urged them to complain to the Federal Communications Commission. He and others suggested ways to work around the blackout. One idea: Hook up a high-definition TV antenna and tune into the station’s broadcast for free.\n\n“I’m not sure who is to blame for this, but clearly two large media companies . . . are fighting it out,” Buser said in an e-mail. “The consumer is the pawn in the game.”\n\nJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com .

  "latent_6140": "A Pennsylvania university is searching for a new mascot and nickname to replace its longtime \"Crusaders\" moniker, which the school says is \"at odds\" with its \"values and commitment to diversity and inclusiveness.”\n\nSusquehanna University is asking people to submit their top choices for a replacement by Jan. 25. The top contenders -- which might include the Bobcarts or River Otters -- will then be submitted to the university president, who will in turn present them to the school's board of trustees, a university spokeswoman told FoxNews.com Tuesday.\n\nThe school's board of trustees voted in October to replace the Crusader name, after consulting with alumni, students, faculty and staff.\n\n\"An institution’s mascot and nickname should be beloved and unifying symbols.\" — School President L. Jay Lemons\n\nThe Crusader name, which was first used by a Philadelphia sports writer in 1924, was a reference to then-Susquehanna athletic director Luther Grossman’s “crusade” to bring integrity to intercollegiate athletics.\n\n\"Many critics of the term Crusader feel that connotations of the word — related to the medieval Crusaders who used violence in the name of religion — are at odds with the university’s increasing diversity and its commitment to embracing and respecting difference,\" the school said in a statement obtained by FoxNews.com.\n\n\"Moreover, many students have long indicated a desire for an unambiguous mascot that they could rally behind,\" the school said.\n\nIn June, the Board of Trustees asked President L. Jay Lemons to engage in a conversation with the school community about the name and mascot, and to return to them with a recommendation as to whether to keep Crusader or make a change.\n\nAccording to the school, Lemons carefully listened to input from students, alumni, staff and faculty over the next several months and decided the name and mascot should be changed.\n\n“Symbols are important and powerful,” he wrote in his recommendation to the board. “An institution’s mascot and nickname should be beloved and unifying symbols,” he noted, adding that has not been the case with the Susquehanna Crusader for some time.\n\n“Our ambivalence and discomfort with the ‘Crusader’ nickname has contributed to its decline. We have not been able to attach our identity to our own unique definition of Crusader,\" he said. \"To continue down that path would be unproductive and at odds with the university’s commitment to building an inclusive campus where individuals of all cultures are welcome.”\n\nThere are several colleges and universities around the country that currently bear the nickname, \"Crusaders,\" such as the College of the Holy Cross, Valparaiso University, North Greenville University, Northwest Nazarene University, Evangel University, William Carey University, Belmont Abbey College, Clarke University and Dallas Christian College.\n\nIn 2000, Wheaton College in Wheaton, Ill., dropped its Crusaders name and changed it to Thunder. Other schools have since followed suit, including Maranatha Baptist University in 2014, Eastern Nazarene College in 2009, University of the Incarnate Word in 2004 and Point Loma Nazarene University in 2003, which changed its name to the Sea Lions.\n\nThe school said Monday it had narrowed its list of 400 suggestions to five choices: the Susquehanna Bobcats, Explorers, Phoenix, River Hawks and River Otters. The school is urging the university community to rank which of the names they like best in an online survey to be submitted by January 25.",
  "latent_6181": "**Freesia, the Spirit Dancer** http://danbooru.donmai.us/data/069fb286f90c608816d559f1bac31120.jpg The above image is for reference only; it can be found here: http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/971429 Ideally, she should look much less \"stripperiffic\", but in terms of her anatomy (i.e. face, hair, skin color, etc.), the above image is a good match. In terms of outfit, I'd go with something more like this: http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080223004723/fireemblem/images/2/2b/Tethys.jpg (again, credit to the original artist) **General Concept** >Freesia is a short-ranged support Champion who uses mobility to keep up with her teammates and provide various buffs to them, as well as inflicting CC's on the enemy. She trades safety and harassment capability for making power plays and maneuverability. Oftentimes, she will put herself at great risk to secure her team's victory, but she has some tools to help her (and her comrades) survive. >When on the offensive, Freesia is very difficult to escape from if she chains her spells onto a target. However, she opens herself up to counterattacks when doing this, as she has to get within close-to-melee range of her target(s). Freesia players thus must gauge whether or not they can survive their engage. Additionally, Freesia does not make a good assassin, lacking good damage and AP scaling for damage. To compensate, her utility scales with AP in some areas. **Statistics** (numbers are subject to change) >HP: 413 (+85) HPR: 4.7 (+0.55) MP: 240 (+60) MPR: 6.8 (+0.65) Damage: 49 (+3.5) Range: 450 Armor: 16 (+3.5) Magic Resistance: 30 (+0) Attack Speed: 0.625 (+2.13%) Movement Speed: 335 **Abilities** (expect changes according to feedback) *Last Update: November 5, 2014* **P - Rhythm** (UPDATED) >Freesia gains 4/5/6% bonus movement speed for 5 seconds each time she hits an allied or enemy Champion with one of her abilities (increases at levels 7 and 13, respectively). This effect stacks up to 5 times. Additionally, Freesia passively ignores unit collision. **Q - Wind Waltz/Soothing Step** >*First Cast - Wind Waltz*: Freesia spins her sash to stir the air around her (300 range), dealing 50/80/110/140/170 (+0.5 AP) magic damage to all nearby enemies and pushing all enemies struck back a fixed distance (50 distance) away from Freesia. If Freesia damages an enemy Champion with Wind Waltz, she can cast Soothing Step within the next 3 seconds. - Wind Waltz costs 40 mana at all ranks. >*Second Cast - Soothing Step*: Freesia spins her sash again to restore 40/55/70/85/100 (+0.3 AP) health to herself and all nearby allies around her (300 range). The strength of the heal increases by 1% for each 1% missing health for each individual target, and is halved for minions. *(Maximum heal: 80/110/140/170/200 (+0.6 AP))* - Soothing Step costs 40/50/60/70/80 mana. >8 second cooldown (does not cycle while Soothing Step is available). Both spells can be cast while moving. **W - Spirit Samba** >*On-ally cast*: Freesia dashes to target allied Champion or minion, granting it a shield that absorbs up to 40/60/80/100/120 (+0.25 AP) damage and lasts up to 2 seconds. While the shield holds, the target receives +20/25/30/35/40 (+0.1 AP) bonus movement speed. Cannot be cast on self. >*On-enemy cast*: Freesia dashes to target enemy Champion or minion, dealing 50/70/90/110/130 (+0.25 AP) magic damage and slowing it by 30/35/40/45/50 (+0.05 AP)% for 1 second (max. 80%). >Freesia stores a Dash Charge every 14/13/12/11/10 seconds (reduced by cooldown reduction), up to a maximum of 2 stored at once *(this cap increases when Freesia ranks up her ultimate)*. Champion kills and assists grant Freesia a Dash Charge. Upon death, Freesia respawns with maximum Dash Charges. >Whenever Freesia dashes to a target, she marks it for up to 3 seconds. Freesia cannot dash to marked targets, but upon dashing to a new target, the previous mark is removed. Freesia's dashes can be interrupted by snares, stuns, and other similar crowd controls (much like Yasuo's Sweeping Wind). >1 second static cooldown. Costs 30 mana and one Dash Charge per use. 550 range for both effects. **E - Mesmerizing Mambo** >Freesia tethers to target enemy Champion, dealing 20/35/50/65/80 (+0.3 AP) magic damage and shields herself for up to 40/55/70/85/100 (+0.3 AP) damage for up to 2 seconds. If the target remains within 550-range for 2 seconds, Freesia receives the shield again, deals the damage again, and forces her target to dance (stuns target) for 1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4/1.5 seconds. >14/13/12/11/10 second cooldown. Costs 60/65/70/75/80 mana. 450 casting range. **R - Lover's Lavolta** >*Passive*: Increases Freesia's maximum Dash Charges to 3/4/5. >*Active*: Freesia performs her ultimate dance, emitting pulses of magic around her every second that deal 40/70/100 (+0.3 AP) magic damage per pulse and apply a Heart stack to nearby enemies (300 range, stacks last 4 seconds). If an enemy receives 3 Heart stacks, the stacks are consumed and Freesia charms it for 1/1.25/1.5 seconds. Freesia cannot charm the same enemy more than once this way per casting. Lasts 8 seconds. >The cooldown of Lover's Lavolta is reduced by 5 seconds each time Freesia gains a Champion kill or assist. Lover's Lavolta does not hinder Freesia's actions. >120/110/100 second cooldown. Costs 100 mana. **Tips** >*Playing as Freesia* * Keep track of the positions of all enemies and allies during fights and plan out your Spirit Samba dashes accordingly. * Proper use of Wind Waltz and Soothing Step will let you bait most enemies into overcommitting against you. * Because you have to get in close-quarters so often, invest into some defense to help you survive. Frozen Heart and Mikael's Crucible are great choices. >*Playing against Freesia* * Freesia lacks good range, and relies on heavy commits to engage you. Poke her from a distance or punish her for diving. * Flash can let you easily prevent Freesia's Mesmerizing Mambo from forcing you to dance. * Freesia's healing is strongest when she or her allies are low on health. Save Ignite and crowd controls for when your enemies are weak. **Champion Synergy/Difficulty** > *Works well with* >{{champion:22}} - Between your crowd controls, no one should be able to touch you. Even if they manage to get close, Wind Waltz and Spirit Samba will keep Ashe safe. She can also slow the target of your Mesmerizing Mambo, making it much easier to finish the tether. >{{champion:59}} - If he uses Cataclysm, dive in and use Lover's Lavolta to charm his trapped targets with ease. >{{champion:15}} - Spirit Samba will make kiting easy for Sivir, and you can crowd control anyone who tries to jump her. When she uses On the Hunt, your ability to engage drastically improves, letting you and her run circles around your enemies. >*Struggles against* >{{champion:12}} - Alistar can immediately negate your dives with Headbutt, or punish you for them with Pulverize. You also can't harass Alistar due to your short range, leaving you without the means of exploiting his lower mobility. Any damage you DO end up dealing to him, he can easily heal back up. Your crowd controls are also useless on him thanks to Unbreakable Will. >{{champion:18}} - Anything you can try to do to her, she can easily negate with Rocket Jump or Buster Shot. Her high late-game firepower will also shut you down long before your crowd controls can affect her. Explosive Shot can also be used to prevent you from using Soothing Step effectively. >{{champion:1}} - Get anywhere near Annie and she can instantly kill you with her stun and burst combos. Coupled with her long auto-attack range, Annie is a nightmare for Freesia to handle. Never get near her if her stun is up or nearly charged, as Disintegrate cannot miss you. **Background** (rough outline) >In the old Shuriman Empire, Freesia was a slave brought into Azir's palace to serve as a royal dancer. She had similar circumstances as Xerath, but unlike Xerath was not resentful of Azir. >Shortly before Azir was to ascend, Freesia overheard Xerath in his plots to betray the Emperor. Before she could try to warn Azir, Xerath caught her and imprisoned her in a magical lamp, which he then secrets away in a tomb. Inside the lamp, Freesia lay in a dormant state where the lamp's magic slowly changed her, granting her magical powers and immortality. Unfortunately, she could not escape her prison. >Thousands of years passed, along with the crumble of Shurima. In the modern day, Ezreal entered the tomb and found Freesia's lamp. Ezreal rubbed the lamp to make out an inscription on it, accidentally touching it with his Ascended Talisman. This broke the spell on the lamp and released Freesia. Freesia learned from Ezreal what had passed, and was devastated to learn of Shurima's fall. >A few days later, Freesia learned that the Sun Disk had risen from the sands, and traveled to it. There, she met the newly-ascended Azir, who recognized her, but was skeptical that she was the same girl he knew in the past. He put her to a test, making her dodge the attacks of his soldiers with her unrivaled dancing. She passed the test effortlessly, earning Azir's trust. >Freesia now works with Azir to both restore Shurima to greatness, and to bring Xerath to justice for his crimes. **Quotes** (in development; suggestions are appreciated) >**Ideal Voice Actor**: Julie Ann Taylor *Selection* Follow my steps to victory. *Match Start* Let's begin, shall we? And here we go. The curtain has parted. *Movement* The spirits guide my step. Fluidly. Even running is a kind of dance. Eyes on the prize? Which one? Shurima must survive as it always has.

  "latent_6338": "Russian president to be urged at G20 summit to come closer to accepting that Bashar al-Assad has to stand aside\n\nVladimir Putin is to be confronted at the G20 summit of world leaders in St Petersburg this week with an array of western intelligence including damning new French evidence directly linking Syrian government forces with a massive and co-ordinated chemical attack on 21 August that led to hundreds of civilian deaths.\n\nThe Russian president will also be urged to show a new diplomatic flexibility and come closer to accepting that the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, has to stand aside.\n\nA nine-page declassified French intelligence report was released on Monday which claimed to show Assad forces had launched an attack on Damascus suburbs held by opposition units using a combination of conventional weapons and \"the massive use of chemical weapons\".\n\nThe report follows similar documents from British and American intelligence.\n\nThe Nato secretary-general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen also insisted that \"personally I am convinced, not only that a chemical attack has taken place … but I am also convinced that the Syrian regime is responsible.\"\n\nThe French intelligence includes satellite imagery showing the attacks coming from government-controlled areas to the east and west of Damascus and targeting rebel-held zones. The report said Assad's forces had since bombed the areas to wipe out evidence.\n\n\"Unlike previous attacks that used small amounts of chemicals and were aimed at terrorising people, this attack was tactical and aimed at regaining territory,\" the report said.\n\nNearly 47 amateur video clips reportedly filmed on the morning of the attack and showing the impact on civilians had been authenticated by French military doctors, according to the intelligence. French evidence gave details of other suspected chemical attacks, in the towns of Saraqib and Jobar in April, which now appeared to have killed about 280 people, the report said.\n\nThe fresh information will also help Barack Obama in his uphill efforts to persuade Congress next week to back a punitive military strike against Assad.\n\nAssad, in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro, again denied the use of chemical weapons. \"Whoever makes accusations must provide proof,\" he said. \"We have challenged the US and France to put forward a single piece of proof. Mr Obama and Mr Hollande have been incapable of doing so. The Middle East is a powder-keg, and today the spark is getting closer.\"\n\nThe Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, also rejected the western intelligence as absolutely unconvincing, saying that there was \"nothing concrete, no geographical co-ordinates or details … and no proof the test was done by professionals\".\n\nHe urged the west to lift the veil of secrecy over its allegations.\n\nBritish sources said Putin, host of the G20, will face a concerted challenge at the summit on Thursday and Friday both to accept the intelligence, and propose a fresh diplomatic solution to the crisis by easing his support for the Assad regime.\n\nSome senior Tories continued to put pressure on Downing Street to say it might be willing to hold a second Commons vote on whether Britain would in some circumstances participate in an attack on Syria in retaliation for the chemical attack.\n\nCameron unexpectedly lost the vote last week, but the former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell led calls for Britain to keep an open mind. \"I believe taking legal and proportional action will be better than doing nothing – I think it will be more likely to bring this catastrophe to a close,\" he said.\n\n\"That's why I think it's very important in this rapidly moving situation that we don't rule anything out and it may be, for example, that after lengthy and careful consideration, Congress affirms its support for the President's plans and in the light of that our Parliament may well want to consider this matter further\"\n\nAdvocates of a second vote were briefly given succour when the defence secretary, Philip Hammond, said there might be a second vote if there were a very significant change in circumstances.\n\nBut Labour sources poured cold water on a second vote, saying the government had ruled out military action. Apparently raising the bar on military action higher than last week, Labour sources said a second vote could only be countenanced if there was evidence that al-Qaida had got hold of significant stocks of chemical weapons, or there was a direct threat to national security.\n\nThe Labour motion last week was less specific about the trigger for action, and it was not clear if all shadow cabinet members were aware of this hardened stance.\n\nLabour instead tried to refocus on diplomacy, with the shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, telling the Guardian: \"An objective for the G20 summit in St Petersburg should be to establish a Syria contact group, like that which helped end the civil war in Lebanon. Unlike the Friends of Syria group, which was established as a forum for supporting the Syrian opposition, a Syria contact group could bring together those countries that are currently backing opposing sides in the Syrian conflict, of course including Russia, but also key sponsors within the region such as Iran and Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nThe contact group would work to bring the participants in the two-year civil war to talks in Geneva. Washington, with British backing, has opposed Iranian involvement in talks.\n\nWriting in the Guardian, the senior Liberal Democrat peer Lady Williams has also called for Iran to be involved in the construction of a Syrian political settlement. She writes that the condemnation of the use of chemical weapons by the newly elected Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, \"deserves a constructive response. It is time to end the isolation of Iran.\"\n\nPlans to stage a second round of peace talks on Syria in Geneva have been stalled since March, partly over the US veto on Iranian attendance, and partly due to disputes in the Syrian rebel forces over the composition of its delegation, and the presence of forces loyal to Assad. Cameron will not have been emboldened by the publication of three separate polls on Monday showing strong opposition to British involvement in military action. A BBC/ICM poll found 71% supporting the Commons decision to stop British involvement in military action with 67% saying that \"the special relationship is not relevant to the modern age\".",

His clients had a proposed location where retail pharmaceuticals are permitted \"as of right\" and their proposed dispensary ought to be permitted there.\n\n\"You can't argue medical marijuana is not a pharmaceutical recognized by the state of Connecticut,\" Rizio said. But he said medical marijuana with recreational marijuana are popularly confused.\n\n\"Medical marijuana, if it were the same product with a different name, we wouldn't be having these discussions. It's still no different than a drug, a legal drug,\" he said.\n\nJack Whittle, the P&Z vice chairman, said the subcommittee is concerned about parking, traffic, intensity of use and impact on neighborhoods. \"It's not exactly like just another pharmacy in town,\" Whittle said.\n\nRizio said the state now permits people with only 11 categories of medical diagnoses to buy medical marijuana, but Bradley said the P&Z has no control over whether the state later expands that.\n\nWhile available locations based on the 1,000-foot buffer aren't plentiful, they may be further reduced by future P&Z decisions on which of five zoning districts should allow a medical marijuana dispensary and the parking standards for such a business.\n\nBradley said the P&Z would have to decide whether to allow a medical marijuana dispensary to open under the same parking regulations as a retail store, office building or medical building or whether to set a new standard.\n\n\"If you make parking more restrictive than retail, this can't go where retail presently exists unless there is a surplus of parking,\" Bradley said.\n\nWhittle said a medical marijuana dispensary would require \"a more intensive parking standard,\" as a dispensary in Westport could be the only one in Fairfield County.\n\nThe state granted the first six dispensary licenses earlier this month. More licenses may be awarded if there is a demonstrated need.\n\nWhittle said obstacles to a pharmacy chain dispensing medical marijuana would be the \"cash-only\" nature of the business, since banks are refusing to set up accounts for medical marijuana dispensaries, as well as a potential \"public relations quandary.\"\n\nA medical marijuana dispensary has yet to open in the state under the law approved last year, and Town Attorney Ira Bloom said that poses a problem in trying to determine what the local parking-space standard should be.\n\n\"It's such an unknown,\" he said. \"That's part of the dilemma.\"\n\nBradley thought the stretch of the Post Road from Harvest Commons to the Fairfield border is the most likely area for a dispensary if Westport officials decide to allow one to open in town. He also questioned whether states that now permit sales of recreational marijuana are allowing it to be sold from existing medical marijuana dispensaries.\n\nBloom said his office or Bradley's office would have to do research to answer that question.\n\n\"We're trying to do our due diligence here,\" Stephens said, referring to the board's timeframe for addressing local regulations before the moratorium expires in October. \"This is not a judgment on medical marijuana, recreational marijuana, good or bad. We're just dealing with getting our ducks in line with land use \" We're here to figure out if it's doable here or not and where.\"\n\nStephens said he expected more people to attend Monday night's meeting, but Rizio said a crowd would likely appear if an application to open a dispensary were filed.\n\nBradley agreed. \"When we have an actual location, the whole neighborhood will show up,\" he said.",
  "latent_6416": "Tim Murray by\n\nCanadian Shield\n\nT\n\nNo Room at Canada's Ecological Inn\n\n\"Smart Growth\" Strategies Cannot Stop Farmland Shrinkage\n\n...farmland area in Ontario totals only 12.67 million acres — less than 5% of Ontario's entire land area. The vast majority of this land is found in Southern Ontario, which is also home to over 1/3 of Canada's population. Ongoing population growth and urbanization is fueling the conversion of much of the country's best agricultural land to non-farming uses. 1/3 of Canada's Class 1 farmland can be seen from the top of the CN tower in downtown Toronto, and a large portion of this is now covered by houses, industry and highways.\n\nBetween 1976 and 2011, 2.8 million acres, or 18%, of Ontario's farmland is no longer being farmed — much of this land resource urbanized or converted to some other non-agricultural use. This is the amount of land required to feed to the City of Toronto's entire population.\n\nThe latest 2011 Census of Agriculture data indicates that we continue to lose over 350 acres of farmland every day in Ontario. Once farmland is designated or developed for non-farming uses it is unlikely that it can be restored to productive agriculture. It can take thousands of years to produce just one centimeter of new topsoil needed to sustain food and farm production.\n\nIllogicality of Avoiding Sprawl by Filling Up the 'Big Empty Spaces'\n\nClimate\n\nGreen Policies Imply Exploiting Immigrants\n\no listen to Canadian federal leaders speak of their ambitions of boosting our immigration intake from its absurdly high level of a quarter million migrants a year to 1% of the country's population level and beyond one would think that Canada is the Garden of Eden. A tropical cornucopia needing only greater input of cheap labour and capital to liberate a treasure trove of resources. Green Party leader Elizabeth May is among the most ardent advocates of this all-party gospel of denial, and on September 14, 2008 on CBC radio, she made a remarkable revelation that exposed her ignorance of Canada's reality. In answering a critic about the stress that immigration was placing on our major cities, she offered the opinion that New Canadians could simply be deflected to the depopulated regions of the country like rural Nova Scotia or northern Saskatchewan, conjuring up the image of Canada as a capacious hotel fit for many permanent guests.The sad fact is, however, there is no room at the Ecological Inn called Canada. Many of our \"rooms\" are bogs, marshes, wetlands, frozen permafrost unfit for construction, fens, taiga shields, boreal forests, mountains and lakes. If Canada attended an NHL hockey training camp and had to submit to that body fat composition test, it would be flunked out of camp the first day. The \"fat,\" that portion of our country deemed unfit for human habitation, is far too high. And even if we did have the \"space,\" space is not carrying capacity, is it? Antarctica has space. How many people can it support?Wetlands comprise 14% of Canada. Lakes 7.6% Together with permafrost tundra, the boreal forest upon which the global climate depends and mountains, they combine for over 94% for the \"other\" category that Wikipedia lists as opposed to \"arable cropland.\" The Canadian Shield covers 48% of the country's surface, and even if the Arctic Shield is excluded, it makes up 32% of the land surface. If you want an image of it while sipping your latte with your open-borders, politically correct friends, think of undulating hills of spongy swamps, decaying peat, between thick taiga forest on top of rock dotted with thousands of lakes — not an ideal site for social housing. Those millions of refugees that Elizabeth would wave into this country would have to look for alternative digs.The most compelling statistic though, is the pitifully small portion of our land base that is arable, 5.2% And 80% of that land is farmed in the prairie provinces. It gets more scary. Of the 5.2% that is arable, only .5% is classified as \"Class 1,\" and more than half of that is found in the province of Ontario. And guess where in Ontario? Close to the beacon of mass immigration, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Nationally, we have lost close to one fifth of our Class 1 farmland to development. Residents of B.C.'s Fraser Valley can bear witness. While the provincial government boasts that there are as many protected acres in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) as there were when it was introduced more than four decades ago, much of rich farmland in the Fraser Valley has been released for development in exchange for bringing land up north with poorer soil amidst a harsher climate into the ALR. Such is the power of big money and the developer lobby.It stands to reason that as Canada has fallen victim to the immigration madness of the last two decades, it has been precious farmland that has paid the price. As the Ontario Farmland Trust put it, \"Flat, cleared, agricultural land is not only easily developed, it is also very affordable to developers who are seeking to meet the demand for land to accommodate urban growth. It is often financially profitable in the long term for a farmer to sell his or her land knowing that it may be converted to some non-agricultural land-use, than to continued farming.\"Of course, for Green and progressive politicians, the scapegoat is \"sprawl\" rather than immigration, and their panacea is \"land-use planning.\" But as history has shown, even the strongest urban growth boundaries can't stand up to explosive population and development pressures. Portland, Oregon — once the poster boy of this \"smart growth\" strategy — is an object lesson in the failure of planning to contain growth. Stay tuned for the corrosion of Britain's famed Greenbelts. There is only so much \"brownfield\" urban land available to absorb relentless in-migration. Former Ontario Environment Commissioner Gordon Miller's warning must be heeded. Unless Ottawa reverses course and reduces immigration, he said, the Golden Horseshoe will see another six million people in two decades. If you want to see what that future Ontario looks like, you need only look in the rear view mirror. The Ontario Farmland Trust informs us thatAnd it should be pointed out that the rapid incremental loss of farmland not only impacts our self-sufficiency in food, but the viability of our ecosystems. Subdivisions do not control flooding, protect wetlands, watersheds, nor absorb and maintain waste water. Nor do they provide food and habitat for wildlife. That is why more 500 species-at-risk are found just at the perimeter of those urban areas of Canada that are bursting with immigrant-driven population growth. Elizabeth May speaks of \"the rich texture of cultural diversity.\" But it clearly is coming at the expense of our \"rich texture of biological diversity.\"It is curious and paradoxical. On the one hand Ms. May argues that newcomers should be concentrated with other Canadians in urban centres by \"smart\" growth, packed closely together out of harm's way from greenbelts. Sorry. As previously stated, it won't work. On the other hand, her story is that New Canadians can be steered in their millions to those empty cold places that others before them found undesirable and left. She didn't intimate how the Charter of Rights and Freedoms could be over-ridden to oblige them to go north, or how money could be found to entice them in that direction, or once having arrived there, what would compel them to stay.There is a reason, other than economics, why 90% of Canadians live within a stone's throw of the US border. Climate. Let me illustrate.The average latitude in Canada is 61 degrees. Let's select Yellowknife, latitude 62 degrees, 47 minutes as a fair inland example. Yes, it is cold in central Saskatchewan in the winter. But if you live in Saskatoon in December at latitude 52 degrees, and your average day is minus 19, and you decide to take a job in Yellowknife 1223 miles northward, your days are going to be, on average, 9 degrees colder. That is why it takes a whole lot of money to get people to establish lives in the far north.Is Elizabeth May proposing a kind of apartheid for this country then? Canadian-born and the earlier wave of immigrants enjoy the amenities of the milder south but the newest citizens swat black flies in the inhospitable north?I think that Elizabeth May's \"Great Multicultural Project,\" her euphemism for the mass immigration policy which all federal parties and leaders support with mindless enthusiasm, is best imposed on the Penguins of Antarctica. They at least know the cold, hard facts about the environment in which they live. And if any of them should object, I am sure a Penguins' Rights Tribunal could be established on the Canadian model to stifle and silence them into submission.Antarctica is a big place with lots of room for lots of people.Related posts:",

Michael Picciano, 65, says in his lawsuit that OKCupid and parent company IAC failed to conduct \"even minimal screening of its subscribers and therefore deceptively creating the impression that their dating service was safe...when in fact...[it] was a trap for the unwary.\" Picciano believes that it's OKCupid's fault that he willingly handed over tens of thousands of dollars to a stranger. To paraphrase Raylan Givens, Picciano seems like the type of fella that walks under a flock of birds and is surprised when he ends up with shit on his face.\n\nPicciano said he connected with a man who said he was named Bruce Thompson in February 2013, and he started messaging him because he \"felt safe and trusted the profile\" due to OKCupid billing itself as \"the best free dating site on Earth,\" despite the fact that it IS a free dating site open to anyone with an email address.\n\nAfter 10 days of messaging on OKCupid, they started emailing and calling; by the end of March, the Texas-native Thompson was asking him for money for a new computer parts business. And less than two months after meeting a stranger on the Internet (and never in person), Picciano agreed to send him $24,000...and then he transferred even more money to different names (\"Dennis E.

Anyone who ate at the restaurant between September 16 and October 3 may have been exposed, health officials say.\n\nAs Hepatitis A can cause damage to the liver and other health problems, the Washtenaw County Public Health is working closely with the restaurant to vaccinate all employees and to eliminate any additional risk of exposure.\n\nOfficials say the individual with hepatitis A infection is not currently working and is receiving medical care.\n\n“While hepatitis A can be very serious, we are fortunate to have an effective vaccine available,” said Jessie Kimbrough Marshall, MD, MPH, medical director with Washtenaw County Public Health. “We encourage anyone concerned about potential exposure to talk with their health care provider or Washtenaw County Public Health as soon as possible. Vaccination is strongly encouraged for all eligible individuals, as multiple counties in southeast Michigan have seen outbreaks of hepatitis A in recent months.”\n\nAnyone who has consumed food and/or drink at Cardamom since Saturday, September 16, should monitor for symptoms of hepatitis A including fatigue, poor appetite, stomach pain or tenderness, nausea or vomiting, dark urine and yellowing of the skin (jaundice). Most children under 6 years do not experience symptoms. Symptoms typically appear 2 to 6 weeks after exposure. Individuals with symptoms should call their provider or seek care.\n\nVaccination is recommended for the following at–risk individuals:\n\nHealth care workers who have direct contact with patients\n\nPeople who use injection and non-injection illegal drugs\n\nPeople who participate in commercial exchange of sexual practices\n\nPeople who are homeless or in transient living situations\n\nPeople who are or have recently been incarcerated\n\nClose personal contacts (e.g., household, sexual) of hepatitis A patients\n\nFood handlers\n\nMen who have sex with men\n\nPeople with liver diseases, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Persons with chronic liver disease have an elevated risk of death from liver failure.\n\nAny person who wishes to be immune to hepatitis A\n\nPeople who live, work, or recreate in SE Michigan and are concerned about getting hepatitis A\n\nThe vaccine is available from health care providers, at pharmacies and at Washtenaw County Public Health.\n\nHow is it spread?\n\nThe hepatitis A virus is most commonly spread from person-to-person by the fecal-oral route. Most infections result from contact with an infected household member or sex partners. Sometimes, infection results from food or drink that is contaminated with the virus. It is not spread through coughs or sneezes. Anyone who has hepatitis A can spread it to others for 1-2 weeks before symptoms appear.\n\nFrequent hand-washing with soap and warm water after using the bathroom and before handling food can help prevent the spread of hepatitis A. Appropriately cooking foods can also help prevent infection. Freezing does not kill the virus.\n\nOutbreak in Southeast Michigan\n\nThere have been 341 cases of hepatitis A diagnosed in Southeast Michigan since August 2016, a sixteen-fold increase compared to the previous year. As of October 5, 2017, Washtenaw County has not been identified as a part of this outbreak.

  "latent_6717": "by Rita Dove | Mar-15-2015\n\nHomage to Toni Morrison on the occasion of the Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award at the National Book Critics Circle Awards Ceremony on Thursday, March 12, 2015 at The New School in New York City.\n\nGood evening. Thank you, Steven Kellman and the Board of the National Book Critics Circle, for inviting me to introduce Toni Morrison as the recipient of this year's Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award. Although Toni Morrison certainly doesn't need an introduction per se, there can scarcely be too many celebratory tributes to one of the greatest novelists of our time and the only living American Nobel laureate in literature. I don’t have to rattle off Toni Morrison's many accomplishments and honors to those present here tonight. As book critics you are, by and large, deeply familiar with her works, and your organization was among the very first to publicly recognize the rising star when, in 1977, she received the National Book Critics Circle Award for \"Song of Solomon.\"\n\nIn our age of factual information cascading from smart phones at the tap of a few buttons, you don't need me to refresh your memory with all the titles of our honoree's eleven luminous – and illuminating – novels and her numerous other works – the plays and essays and children’s books. I also assume you wouldn’t want me to whittle away minutes at this podium with a recitation of previous awards... although, I admit, it is tempting to mention at least a few – such as the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for \"Beloved,\" the 1996 Jefferson Lecture, the National Humanities Medal in 2000, the honorary doctorate from Oxford and the 2012 Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nAlthough my personal panoply of greats – that literary Valhalla I call upon for inspiration— is heavily weighted in favor of the craft of poetry, Toni Morrison has always commanded a prime seat front and center, for she is not only a prose virtuoso but also a master of poetic sensibilities and lyrical language: Her influence on discourse, idiom and the vernacular has transformed our perception of the intricate paths to the interior consciousness – be it the thoughts of an illiterate slave or the harrowing logic fabricated by a father guilty of incest; of children whose souls have been damaged beyond the reach of pity and women ravaged by a longing so desperate that nothing short of annihilation will satisfy; of a ghost starved for love, of a town bent on its own brand of self-preservation. With an extraordinary poet's economy of idiom and her signature elliptical elegance, Toni Morrison has probed the crannies and tunnels of mental illness and the torment of war veterans shattered by the myriad possibilities for sabotage in the world; she has recreated the improvisational call-and-response of jazz, the see-saw proclivities of obsessive attraction and violence freighted with fear. And while birthing upon the literary stage a host of characters we, the readers, recognize as familiar and accept in the way of Family, from the praiseworthy to the quirky to the closeted, she has also been – subtly, cannily – at work on fashioning a new graph of American history whose many intersecting trajectories take us from the Anglo-Dutch slave trade through the ante-bellum insanities of Southern racial terror, from the Great Migration and 1920’s Harlem to the labor pains of the Automobile Age whose factories disgorged a glittering stream of chrome-trimmed fantasies from what are now the rust belt cities of the Midwest; from the L.A. cosmetics industry to a trailer parked outside of Whiskey, California.\n\nA few days after I received Steven Kellman's call asking me if I'd like to pay homage to Toni Morrison tonight – an undertaking somewhat tantamount to introducing Athena, while she looks on with her gray eyes – my husband and I went to a dance – a milonga – at our local Argentine tango club. In an attempt to boost everyone's mood in the middle of a drear, chilly winter and as a nod to the Carneval season, everyone was asked to come masked. But when we arrived with our Venetian facial wear and harlequin confections, we quickly discovered that the masks got in the way of dancing – ribbons tangled, feathers snagged on gold braid trim, and with obstructed peripheral vision, balance was impaired so we teetered and wobbled. After a quick confab with the young man who had asked me for the second set of tangos – a newcomer to our town – we decided to ditch the masks; and as the bandoneon throbbed to Carlos Gardel singing about the kind of woman who can ignite an \"instant violent love\", my dance partner remarked, out of the blue: \"Now that's some Toni Morrison love.\" I was struck with speechless. But by the next day my curiosity had overwhelmed my hesitancy, so I asked this young man, via a Facebook message, what his first encounter with the books of Toni Morrison had been. His response was effusive and – there's no other way to describe it – grateful. He wrote:\n\nI think I was 22 or 23—after college but before grad school. I went into a bookstore and had a sort of literary crisis. I felt that so many of the authors on the shelves were creating entire worlds and entire castes of characters that merely served as backdrops for the breakdown of yet another petty \"I.\" Like all those books could be retitled \"The Day *I* Was Sad.\" Then I picked up \"Beloved.\" Faith in literature restored. What a genius Morrison is! I think so many novelists are like peacocks with their language, flourishing feathers and letting the reader know how smart and lyrical they are. But I think Morrison is able to do extreme lyric and yet be conversational at the same time. I wish I had found her work earlier. I want to know why she isn't required reading in school. Morrison has wisdom in abundance, along with lyrical and storytelling brilliance. I wonder how she does it.\n\nAnd my tango-dancing friend ended with a postscriptum prompted by his wife of just a few months:\n\nNow my wife wants to tell you about how she battled the Dominican obsession with Aryan features as a teenager but then encountered \"The Bluest Eye\" in high school. She says Morrison gave voice to all of her dissent and made her comfortable with it.\n\nFour decades earlier I had fought a similar battle with myself and the strange environment I had chosen to immerse myself in when I attended the University of Iowa's Writers Workshop as its only African-American graduate student. As a young poet still trying to locate myself in the thicket of literary traditions, I often wandered the stacks, willing myself into unknown territory. I had yet to find myself, or at least an image I could identify with, in the pages of European and American literature; while most of the books concerned with Black America took place, by and large, either in the Deep South or in urban ghettos. What about the experiences and dreams of a black girl growing up middle class in middle America? I wondered. Was there no room, no mirror, for me? Then one day, deep in the bowels of the library, I stopped dead in my tracks. Something had caught my eye; I wasn’t sure what. There, just behind my left shoulder . . . I couldn't shake the feeling that a book was looking for me. Since it was spring, when such things happen, I didn't question the feeling; I simply turned around. And there it was, at eye-level, bound in black linen with peacock-blue lettering: THE BLUEST EYE, by Toni Morrison.\n\nThe library had removed all book jackets, so there was no biographical note, no blurb to give me a hint of the contents. The title intrigued me; I didn't know the author, but as soon as I opened the book and began to read, I was convinced that Toni Morrison, whoever she was, knew me, my people and where I came from – Akron, Ohio, one of the industrial towns sprinkled along the smudged neckline of the Great Lakes. By the time I finished the opening section – those three amazing paragraphs mimicking the eerie deadpan of primary school primers, variations on an American Dream gone horribly wrong – I was certain that this writer had also experienced, as I had, the \"double-consciousness\" which W.E.B. Du Bois defines as that \"peculiar sensation ... of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity.\" When I reached the sentence, \"Not even the gardens fronting the lake showed marigolds that year\", a wild hope began to stir that maybe, just maybe, she was from the Midwest. Fifteen pages later came the confirmation I craved: \"There is an abandoned store on the southeast corner of Broadway and Thirty-fifth Street in Lorain, Ohio.\" I began to shiver. My gut response had been right: Toni Morrison was a home girl.\n\nNo words can fully express what Toni Morrison has meant to me ever since – as a writer, a woman, a black woman, and, yes, a fellow Ohioan. She gave me literary shelter and pointed me toward the poetry in my geographical space. She taught me to pay attention to everything without prejudice, for beauty can be found in the “ginger sugar” smell rising from a polluted lake, and the fate of an empire can rest on the curve of an eyebrow. Her work has accompanied me through my years of honing myself as a writer and a woman. How desolate that journey would have been without Milkman and First Corinthians, or Flores or the intrepid Sula; without Toni’s wry humor and chastening gaze, her laughter that seems to come straight up from the middle of the earth!\n\nOver the years Toni and I have met a number of times – official events as well as more private gatherings; even once by chance, late one evening in a hotel lobby in Cleveland where we convinced the bartender to serve one more round of drinks before closing shop. But two scenes with Toni stand out vividly – a 1994 tribute in her honor at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, and a gala seven years later at the New York Public Library in celebration of her 70th birthday. In both places Toni was surrounded by orchids. Orchids – those gorgeous, engorged blooms that come in every color you can think up (and beyond), their petals veined like human hands held to the light, with a smell as intimate and ravishing as an indelicate thought crossing your mind in the middle of the 23rd psalm. As symbols of love and desire (both the light and the dark sides), they can make young girls blush and coax a Mona Lisa smile from a grown woman; these curiously mammalian creatures that seem to live on nothing but mist and air, yet can inspire in their breeders a devotion teetering on madness. Orchids are the queen bees of the flower world, and you better not mess with them.\n\nLike the orchids surrounding her then, Toni Morrison has always seemed both rooted in the earth and poised for flight, resplendent and serene. Most importantly, she has woven tales that beguile, even as they lead us deeper into the carefully shielded psyche of homo sapiens than we knew to go. She has given us stories where survival may not mean victory and cruelty may reveal itself as the ultimate tenderness; stories where home is not a country, especially when the country has never learned to be at home with its past – and from the midst of those magnificent specimens of art, Toni Morrison – woman, mother, editor, writer, critic, Nobel laureate, professor, mentor, friend – shines all the more fiercely. I thank you, Toni, for your life's work past, present and future, and for your resplendent example. May you keep on shining.\n\n© 2015 by Rita Dove. All rights reserved.

  "latent_6788": "Marking today’s release of Anarchy in Paradise, a new chapter update for Knights of the Fallen Empire — the latest digital expansion for Star Wars: The Old Republic — StarWars.com has invited the game’s creators to take our readers behind the scenes of the groundbreaking MMORPG.\n\nMy name is Michael Backus, and I’m one of the lead designers at BioWare. I’ve been working on Star Wars: The Old Republic for over seven years now.\n\nWhen I was asked to write something to Star Wars fans about Star Wars: The Old Republic, I jumped at the opportunity. From the outset, I wanted to give you some insight into our processes, and discuss what our influences were.\n\nSo I’m going to do just that. I’m going to talk about the different classes in Star Wars: The Old Republic, but more importantly, about each class’s story arc. And by this, I don’t mean spoilers about their plots, but really, what we were trying to capture in each one. What was the fantasy? What did we draw from? What experience were we trying to give all of you who play Star Wars: The Old Republic?\n\nI’m going to break this up into two parts. First, I’ll delve into the Republic, specifically: the Jedi Knight, the Jedi Consular, the Republic Trooper, and finally, the Smuggler. In part two, we’ll delve into the Imperial side of things: the Sith Warrior, the Sith Inquisitor, the Bounty Hunter, and to cap us off, the Imperial Agent.\n\nSo, let’s get started, shall we?\n\nThe Jedi Knight\n\nI start with the Jedi Knight because, honestly, it’s incredibly iconic — everyone who is a fan of Star Wars has an idea of what a Jedi Knight is and what they’re capable of. Which makes it interesting from both a design and writing perspective. Our goal is to do the class justice, but still do something fresh and new. But we knew if we went too far, fans wouldn’t feel we hit the mark.\n\nWhile the theme of the hero’s journey can be found in many of our story arcs, even on the Imperial side, it’s really core to the Jedi Knight’s arc. It’s also the foundation for the original movies — Luke’s journey to become a Jedi and his discovery of his own strength, both in the Force, as well as a person; Anakin’s discovery of his abilities in the Force as well as his destiny to tragically fall from grace; even Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon Jinn’s adventures together are all representative of the path of the Jedi Knight.\n\nThose examples were our greatest influences. But it wasn’t just about deflecting blaster bolts with our lightsabers, leaping an incredible distance into melee with a Sith Lord, or donning cool armor and wading into battle against the forces of the Empire. This story had to be…personal.\n\nBecause, you see, that’s really one of the things we love most about Luke’s journey in particular. Luke wasn’t perfect. He made mistakes, even when he was in the middle of his training. The scene I feel encapsulates this best happens during The Empire Strike Back. Luke has a premonition that his friends are in danger. Yoda tells him that he’s not ready to face Darth Vader and that he should remain on Dagobah and finish his training, even if it means sacrificing his friends. Luke goes anyway.\n\nThis scene is brilliant in so many ways. Yoda knows how important Luke is; he’s trying to protect him, prepare him. But for Luke, these are the people he cares for and the risk is worth it — he can’t turn his back on them.\n\nI think that’s why that scene resonates so much, at least for me. It’s forcing the question on us to do what’s good, versus what is right. And depending on your point of view, both perspectives make sense.\n\nReturning back to Star Wars: The Old Republic, that really is one of the hardest parts of writing for such a well-known class. The hardest part was coming up with a fresh take on what was expected.\n\nOne idea we came up with really became the inspiration for the entire storyline: What would happen if our knight errant were alone in facing the dark side? What if even your mentors and allies were tempted and you had to face off with them? All of a sudden, with little to no support from the Jedi Order, the impact of your situation became apparent.\n\nIn the Old Republic, the Jedi Knight’s path is the journey of a lone hero who must face the dark side while rising up and learning to use their power. It’s a journey about discovering your place in the galaxy; about becoming a leader even if you don’t think you’re capable of it; and more importantly, it is about becoming a beacon of hope in the darkness.\n\nThe Jedi Consular\n\nThe Jedi Consular was far tougher for us, less from a class standpoint, but more from a story standpoint. We knew where we wanted to take our cues from pretty early on. The Consular was meant to feel like Yoda, or a later, Tatooine version of Obi-Wan Kenobi. They were wise. They avoided conflict. They were diplomatic. But they were powerful in the Force. These characters are our mythological wizards — erudite and wise, seeking knowledge and the truth behind the mysteries of the world around them. They are advisors and guides to others.\n\nAs you can image, this created quite an issue when we sat down to design them. I mean, how do you make a class and story out of a character who basically avoids conflict? As a BioWare RPG, we knew that we would have strong dialog and characters supporting the Jedi Consular, but they still had to fit in with the rest of our classes. Ultimately, we had to give them conflict to overcome, both in plot as well as gameplay.\n\nThe Consular went through a number of iterations because of this. As we settled on themes we thought were compelling, it wasn’t until we left the beaten path that things started to feel right. We started with ideas I touched on above: diplomacy, resolution of conflict, trying to organize and help others in finding common ground. But it wasn’t until we asked ourselves, “What else were Consular’s responsible for?”, that things fell into focus.\n\nThat focus was the Force. And by that I don’t mean their ability to use the Force. What I mean is all the mystery surrounding the Force: studying long-lost artifacts like holocrons; researching and possessing knowledge others don’t; uncovering mysteries and lost lore; discovering new races powerful in the Force but who lack guidance or knowledge of the dark side.\n\nOnce we realized how interesting this could be, their story arc started to form. From there, it was easy to solve the problem of Jedi Consulars and the issue we had with overt conflict. Instead of being like a Jedi Knight and being on the front lines of battle, the Jedi Consulars would use their abilities to discover threats and track down plots by the deadliest of enemies. They would use their knowledge of the Force to take on threats that were hidden or couldn’t be defeated by an army. We would focus on sending them into situations where the goal was not to strike down their enemies, but figure out what was happening. The causes of these conflicts, specifically the dark side and how persuasive evil can be, became a great catalyst for their adventure.\n\nThe Republic Trooper\n\nThe Republic Trooper was a lot of fun to come up with, both class-wise, as well as story-wise. First, Charles Boyd, now our lead writer on Star Wars: The Old Republic, took point on the story arc. Charles is a huge trooper fan. He has over a dozen Republic trooper action figures sprawled out over his AT-TE (All Terrain Tactical Enforcer) on his desk, he’s a card-carrying member of the 501st Legion as a stormtrooper, and he’s currently making another costume. So, needless to say, his passion runs deep.\n\nInstantly, we knew the themes we wanted to embrace for the Republic Trooper’s story. And even designing the class came easy — I mean, it’s not hard to quickly imagine how these men and women of the Republic’s armed forces could take on a battalion of enemies, or even Force users. With access to amazing armor and weapons, coupled with their amazing skill, they easily wade into battle or take on the most dangerous of missions.\n\nThe challenge we had with the Republic Trooper was a lack of material to draw from. At the time we had begun designing and writing for the class, Star Wars: The Clone Wars wasn’t a thing. There was no Rex or Cody or any of that material to use as an influence. We actually had to take a step back even further and draw from the material that predated the cartoon. That influence was the original Clone Wars cartoon, created by Genndy Tartakovsky and George Lucas. Specifically, we loved the feel of the ARC Troopers and characters like ARC-77, also known as “Fordo.”\n\nRepublic Troopers are elite and powerful in their own right, able to stand against the biggest of threats. They are that lone-commando you see in an action movie you love so much. They’re the best of the best in terms of training, and they have the technology to back them up.\n\nEven in our story arc for Star Wars: The Old Republic, your character is clearly an elite soldier, being given the honor of joining Havoc Squad, one of the most elite trooper squads to have existed. As a Republic Trooper, you take on galactic threats like the Empire and new super weapons, but also have to deal with the political ramifications of some military operations. It’s a thrilling and fulfilling experience.\n\nThe Smuggler\n\nOh, you scoundrel. You scruffy-looking nerf herder. I can say just those two lines and you already know who I’m talking about and everything they represent.\n\nSmugglers are the shady characters who are willing to risk the Empire coming down on them hard so they can live free. They watch out for number one: themselves. But in Star Wars, our favorite smugglers are also the ones that have a heart of gold. When push comes to shove, they watch out for the little guy. They’re loyal, caring, and they know right from wrong — they just might not admit it to your face.\n\nThe chance to write a Smuggler character for Star Wars: The Old Republic was a real treat for our writing team. It was a chance to insert some great comedy into the galaxy, as well as some snark and sarcasm. From a writing perspective, it really allowed our writing team to capture a “normal” person’s reaction to the bigger picture and all the events happening throughout the galaxy.\n\nAs we talked about what made a great smuggler character with our studio’s creative director, James Ohlen, he boiled down Han Solo perfectly. Han is a tribute to the great movie characters of American tradition. Characters from the 1950s. He’s James Dean. He’s the bad boy. He has his car and the open road, and he can go wherever and do whatever he wants. He sticks it to the man, and we all root for him because he’s sexy and clever and he gets back up and fights to protect the honor of others.\n\nThat essence is what we wanted to capture with the Smuggler. A character who can say something witty in the face of huge odds. The character we all wish we could be as cool as.\n\nHonestly, the hardest part of designing the Smuggler for Star Wars: The Old Republic was combat. I mean, Han Solo didn’t have the greatest luck against Darth Vader, if you recall. So we had to find ways to make a Smuggler feel effective, but keep them true to their spirit. We did so by infusing their abilities with a little bit of humor, but also giving them mechanics that help them keep out of harm’s way, like cover, and in some cases stealth. Because, let’s face it, the best way to fight a Dark Lord of the Sith is to hit him before he sees it coming.\n\nSo, there you have a look into the Republic side of things. I hope you enjoyed some insight into how we developed the classes and their story arcs for Star Wars: The Old Republic, and at the very least, you got a sense of how we broke down archetypes and created something new and exciting, while fulfilling what we think are some great Star Wars fantasies.\n\nMichael Backus is a lead designer at BioWare and currently lives in Austin, Texas.",
  "latent_6973": "After searching government accounts -- and maybe under the sofa cushions -- Greece appears to have found the money needed to make a crucial debt payment.\n\nFinance Minister Yanis Varoufakis has told Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, that Greece will meet the Thursday deadline for its 460 million euros ($505 million) payment to the group. The pledge should alleviate investor worries over a possible default.\n\n\"I welcomed confirmation by the Minister that payment owing to the [IMF] would be forthcoming on April 9,\" Lagarde said after meeting Varoufakis on Sunday in Washington.\n\nWhile Greece has insisted it has the funds to cover loan repayments, only the government knows just how much is really left in its treasury. Tax revenues in January and February came in 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) below forecast. Some reports have suggested that the government might not be able to meet its obligations.\n\nEurozone finance ministers agreed earlier this year to extend Greece's bailout program, but only once they're happy with the country's plans for economic reforms.\n\nAthens did submit a new list of reforms last week. The document, published by the Financial Times, details the government's plans to tackle tax evasion and fraud. They include a proposal for a lottery to encourage consumers to ask for sales tax receipts, a new luxury tax, and higher revenues from tourism.\n\nRelated: Get up to speed with the Greek debt crisis 3.0\n\nBut the list also included a number of measures that are likely to spark a backlash from the creditors, including reversing earlier reforms that could cost the Greek government an extra 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) this year.\n\nNeither Greece nor the IMF released specific details of what Lagarde and Varoufakis discussed during their meeting. Reform talks are expected to continue this week.\n\n\"We had a fruitful, extremely productive discussion about the Greek reform proposals,\" Varoufakis said after the meeting. \"We are intent upon reforming Greece deeply.\"",
  "latent_7014": "The celebration may have been the high water mark for hockey fans in the Triangle.\n\nUnder a blazing sun in June 2006, an estimated 30,000 rabid Carolina Hurricanes fans gathered in West Raleigh to celebrate the team’s Stanley Cup victory. Caniac Nation had become a phenomenon.\n\nThese days finding a Caniac, let alone a nation of them, can be difficult.\n\nThe Canes are last in attendance in the NHL, averaging just 11,516 fans a game through 26 home games this season. The number of season-ticket holders has fallen for six straight years and is now 7,000, down from a peak of 11,000 the year after the team won the title. Even this weekend’s 10th anniversary celebration of winning the Cup wasn’t enough to fill the PNC Arena. Friday night’s game had about 2,900 empty seats.\n\nSign Up and Save Get six months of free digital access to The News & Observer\n\nWe have to make ourselves part of this community again. Don Waddell, Canes team president\n\nThe team’s struggles are giving new life to questions about the viability of professional hockey in the Triangle, one of the NHL’s smallest markets.\n\n“I think everybody believes that there is a market here for an NHL team,” said Don Waddell, the Canes’ team president since 2014. “We’ve got to do our job. It’s just not on the ice, it’s off the ice. We have to make ourselves part of this community again. I think there’s been a little separation the last few years.”\n\nThe Canes are trying to reconnect with the community even as owner Peter Karmanos Jr., seeks to sell all or part of the team. It’s been 16 months since Karmanos, 72, made his intentions public, but no buyer has come forward.\n\nThe future of the team isn’t just a concern for area hockey fans. Gale Force Holdings, the parent company that owns the Canes, operates and schedules events in PNC Arena, which the team shares with N.C. State.\n\nRaleigh, Wake County and the state invested a total of $40 million in the construction of the arena. Another $62 million in construction bonds were issued, debt that is being paid for by Wake County hotel and meal taxes.\n\nLosing a bundle\n\nThe Canes lost $11.7 million last season and have lost $74.2 million over the past nine years, according to Forbes. Asked about the team’s cash flow situation, and whether Karmanos is having to put in money to cover operational expenses, Waddell said such infusions are rare and small compared to previous years.\n\n“If anything right now, it would be small amounts,” he said.\n\nThe Canes have the ability to borrow as much as $100 million from the NHL’s low-interest credit line. The team declined to disclose whether it has taken out such a loan.\n\nMuch of their financial problems can be attributed to the team’s poor play on the ice. The Canes have reached the Stanley Cup playoffs just once since winning it all in 2006.\n\nThat has deprived the team of much needed revenue, both in terms of season-ticket holders and additional home playoff games. Gale Force reported its two highest revenue-producing seasonsin 2005-06 and 2008-09, when the Hurricanes won two rounds and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\n“The key to survival in the NHL is gate revenue and the most valuable tickets are sold to corporate clients and season ticket buyers,” said John Vrooman, a sports economist with Vanderbilt University, in an email.\n\nVrooman notes that in traditional hockey markets corporate accounts make up as much as 80 percent of the season ticket holder base, where as for the Canes they account for just 40 percent.\n\nCorporations are much less likely to cancel their season tickets when the team doesn’t perform, unlike fans who are more influenced by wins and losses. In markets such as the Triangle, where professional hockey is relatively new, attendance is directly tied to the team’s performance “and the bottom line grows in the playoffs,” Vrooman said.\n\nThe Canes reported $6.9 million in advertising revenue last year, a 20 percent decline from the previous year.\n\nAnd while the Triangle economy is booming, the Canes have not been able to translate the region’s success into more advertising revenue. The team reported $6.9 million in advertising revenue last year, a 20 percent decline from the previous year.\n\nWaddell said part of the team’s challenge is tailoring its corporate offerings to appeal to the types of companies that call the Triangle home. The region has just one Fortune 500 company, Quintiles, and many of its largest employers are in industries that do little or no traditional advertising.\n\n“We don’t have the major consumer brands, we have a lot of pharmaceutical, a lot of technology, a lot of nontraditional companies that don’t advertise,” Waddell said.\n\nNew marketing strategy\n\nWaddell attributes much of the recent decline in attendance to the team’s strategy, adopted last season, of reducing the number of complimentary and discounted tickets. The move is an attempt to place more of a premium on season tickets.\n\nVrooman said such a strategy makes good marketing sense, because season-ticket holders are a more reliable source of revenue. But he said slashing complimentary and discounted tickets has its downsides – revenue from concessions and parking declines, and perhaps more importantly, the smaller crowds diminish the fan experience in PNC Arena.\n\nThat has clearly become a problem for the Canes. PNC Arena, once considered the loudest building in the league, has become eerily quiet on some nights with the arena often about half full.\n\n“The side effect of that is you get a lot more of the opposing team’s fans in the arena, it really changes it,” said Norm Storwick, who has been a Canes fan since the 2006 Cup run. “You feel like you’re on contested ground or something.”\n\nStorwick, 47, used to purchase a partial season-ticket package that gave him two tickets to 13 home games a year. He stopped buying the package several seasons ago, and now shares a package with a friend and goes to about half as many games.\n\n“They definitely have been accentuating the full season-ticket packages over all of the others,” he said. “You don’t get all of the goodies with the partial that you do with the full-season.”\n\nThis year, he said, the team stopped guaranteeing that partial season-ticket holders would be able to sit in the same seats for each of their games.\n\n“To me that was always part of the fun; being able to get a little sense of community by seeing the same people around you when you would go,” Storwick said. “It made me even less interested in buying a partial season-ticket package.”\n\nWaddell, acknowledging that the team’s in-game promotions had grown stale, said the Canes implemented a number of changes at the beginning of the season to improve the atmosphere.\n\nThose changes included different music, having the team’s Storm Squad cheerleaders interact more with fans and sending T-shirt-laden parachutes down from the rafters.\n\n“We’re just trying to create a little more energy in the building,” Waddell said.\n\nImproving the atmosphere in PNC Arena won’t remove the uncertainty that will surround the team until a new owner is found.\n\nThe sale of a professional sports franchise is often preceded by cost cutting as the owner attempts to improve the team’s balance sheet and franchise value. Waddell insists that isn’t the case with the Canes and Karmanos.\n\n“This isn’t a fire sale,” he said, noting that the Hurricanes have added 48 new employees since he was hired July 2014, most of them in sales and advertising. “He is a very passionate hockey man and doesn’t want to get out. … We’re trying to do everything possible to make this a better situation financially.”\n\nWinning helps\n\nWaddell is also adamant that the Canes are not in danger of being bought and relocated. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman expressed similar sentiments in November.\n\nThe most frequently cited reason for why the Canes won’t leave is Gale Force’s agreement with Centennial Authority, the public entity that oversees PNC Arena.\n\nGale Force pays annual rent payments of $2.45 million under a lease that runs until 2024. The company receives all parking and concession revenue from non-N.C. State events and shares revenue from the building’s naming rights with N.C State and the Centennial Authority, which is responsible for maintaining and making improvements to the arena.\n\n“The one thing that is very appealing to any potential investors is this property,” Waddell said. “The building is a very positive part of this transaction.”\n\nPNC Arena will be 20 years old in 2019, and Centennial Authority has begun drawing up plans for a multimillion-dollar renovation to the building. Jeff Merritt, the authority’s executive director, said the decision on whether to go forward with some or all those improvements will likely depend on the ownership situation.\n\n“Before we go to the city and county and other partners I think the ownership thing is one of the things we’d like to have wrapped up,” he said.\n\nWhen that will be wrapped up is anyone’s guess.\n\nWaddell said he always expected it would be a two-year process to find a buyer. One major hurdle to doing so is that Karmanos is seeking to sell the team but retain control for a period. Waddell said the approach is designed to increase the pool of potential buyers.\n\n“The whole idea was to try and sell it in tranches,” he said. “… It goes to how many people or companies are out there and willing to take the whole thing on. This is probably more appealing to investors if we can continue down this path.”\n\nJim Cain, a Raleigh lawyer and a former Canes president, said he expects fan and corporate support will return once the ownership issue is settled.\n\n“We know we’re going to have to have an out-of-town owner and people are afraid of that,” he said. “The fans are nervous about that. But it can work.”\n\nCain cited the Tampa Bay Lightning’s owner, Jeff Vinik, as an example of how a new owner can turn around a struggling franchise.\n\n“We need an owner like that who’s got the resources to bring the organization back, to invest in the players and the facilities,” he said. “I’m confident eventually we’ll find one.”\n\nThe hockey business is not rocket science. .… Build a winning team and they will come. John Vrooman, sports economist with Vanderbilt University\n\nWhen Karmanos announced his intention to sell, he speculated that the Canes could be worth about $400 million, or near what the New York Islanders sold for in 2014. Forbes recently valued the franchise at $225 million.\n\nThe sales price of NHL teams typically benefits from the scarcity of franchises on the market. But with the Pittsburgh Penguins also up for sale, and rumors that the NHL could be preparing to expand by two teams, the situation has shifted to more of a buyers market, said Vrooman, the sports economist.\n\nAs for this season, Waddell said average home attendance at Hurricanes games is up nearly 2,000 since just before Christmas, a bump that has coincided with the team playing its way back into playoff contention.\n\nVrooman said the long-term survival of hockey teams in nontraditional hockey markets depends on winning and the quality of the product on the ice. The Florida Panthers, who finished dead last in home attendance a year ago, have seen a 31 percent increase this season. The Panthers are leading the Eastern Conference.\n\n“The hockey business is not rocket science,” Vrooman said. “… Build a winning team and they will come.”",

The reasons we play span from getting the opportunity to be a hero � or a villain � to experiencing a new perspective, a different ability, a new angle on the world, a new sense of a self that is not us.It can be argued that the key to a game experience is a lucky cocktail of features that make us love � or loathe � our characters, that our final impression will hinge on what that character was, or was not able to do. With that in mind, we take a look this week at five of the year�s most aberrant, interesting, compelling and effective characters in games. Minor spoilers.Aside from some pretty colors and lovely music, as an RPG,was ordinary in most ways � and that�s the remarkable thing. That one of the most derivative genres in console gaming could so seamlessly integrate the life, history and musical work of a real-life composer in such a facile, cavalier way stands out as one of those examples of the kind of engagement that games can make possible.After all, Fr�d�ric Chopin isa fictional character, and the interpretation of his life as a dream in a fantasy game encouraged more than a few RPG fans to learn about him, maybe play a piano tune or two. And a character becomes much more thought-provoking given the concept that everything you are playing and seeing might just be a dream in the head of a man as he dies.The firstmade a compelling anti-hero of the haunted soldier, andbrings us Kratos as a God. With character conventions that could serve as a primer on Greek tragedy, the piquant conflict between Kratos� condition of power and his inner torment and powerlessness gives greater relevance to the almost artful, ravenous violence that characterizes the gameplay, with each brutal stroke conveying the desperation of bitterness and a quest for redemption and absolution that remains ever out of Kratos� reach.The architect of�s Rapture serves as a cautionary example of the danger of pure philosophy. Though he�s introduced as an antagonist, Ryan quickly becomes as sympathetic as he is so bitterly wrong � despite his hard-line objectivist-influenced ideals that delineate artists from parasites, men from slaves, his greatest crime save for fatal arrogance was perhaps believing in humankind too much.When the ensuing conflict forced him to compromise, over time, his ideals, that uncompromising faith in his beliefs were worth sacrificing his life to attempt to convey to his son.�s one weakness was that, as that son, the player couldn�t elect to adopt that philosophy to thwart his own abuse.The sleeper hit of the year,, couldn�t have brought phrases like �I�m doing science� into common parlance without GLaDOS, the decaying mainframe computer with a personality disorder. The relationship between GLaDOS and the protagonist has been called everything from passive-aggressive to maternal to an out-and-out feminist manifesto.An antagonist who joyfully lies and then admits it, and then contradicts it again, who praises and then excoriates, threatens and begs, who sings you a song when you defeat her --is undoubtedly an excellent game, but GLaDOS is what really makes it happen.This year�s trends showed us clearly that networked gaming is here to stay. Social virtual worlds inspired by game concepts did a tentative introductory dance around gaming itself, and social networking, communication and personalization quickly distinguished themselves as lynchpin features that suddenly no game can do without.Blizzard�s unshakablenation seems invincible,allowed players to customize the protagonist to an unprecedented degree -- from every response he or she has, right down to the width of the eyes. Much was also made this year of choice in games as an absolute necessity � the player wants to personalize the experience, see themselves reflected in it.After chafing for years under conventions that forced film-like linear stories on players perhaps too hard, gamers have quickly declared that they�re quite happy to make their own stories, to place their preferences and their own character concepts front-and-center in an open world. The audience has set a new bar for the year to come, as gamers begin demanding game experiences where their own will is the star.",
  "latent_7185": "Young inventors from Connecticut get a taste of what one attorney calls the hardball of the business world. (Published Friday, Nov. 7, 2014)\n\nA Watertown teen and her younger sister have come up with a simple way to keep your smartphone or tablet clean in what sounds like the American Dream come true. But now the girls' family is on the receiving end of a million-dollar lawsuit.\n\n“I just feel like we're a really good business,\" said 14-year-old Sophia Forino, proudly showing off her bright idea. “It's basically just like a microfiber cloth that I cut out and you turn it over. I put double-sided tape on it.\"\n\nThe crude prototype led Sophia, her sister Marissa and the girls' father to develop a product they named HypeWipes: microfiber cloths with an adhesive that keeps them stuck to a smartphone or tablet, so they can be used anytime.\n\nThat, along with 54 different designs, has made the product a hit, something Sophia and her dad Rocco Forino, sensed for the first time at a trade show in Chicago.\n\n“There was genuine excitement for the product,” said Forino.\n\nBut the family's growing business screeched to a halt this summer when they came face-to-face with the unexpected.\n\n\"We received an email addressed to Sophia and Marissa stating that 'We appreciate your ingenious idea and it's great to be an entrepreneur and all, but you're infringing on our product and we'd like you to stop selling it and remove it from the stores immediately,\"\" Forino explained.\n\nAnother product, a sealed bleach towelette called a Hype-Wipe, has been around much longer. It's sold mainly to hospitals and companies for use as a disinfectant and cleaner.\n\nThe Hype-Wipe is made by Current Technologies Corporation of Crawfordsville, Indiana. Company president Susan Hapak, who sent the email to the Forino children, declined to comment on the case.\n\nCurrent Technologies has a longstanding trademark on the Hype-Wipe. But the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office also issued one for HypeWipes this summer.\n\nRocco Forino explains when the business came up with the name HypeWipes, the Forinos ran a Google search and nothing similar came up. More importantly, according to Forino's attorney, no website had claimed that domain name.\n\n“So we're going through all the names, checking them off, and they were like, 'HypeWipes.' It was not taken; different variations of it weren't taken,\" Forino said.\n\nHe said he paid $1,000 to conduct an exhaustive third-party search to make sure no one else was using a similar name. Nothing came up.\n\nBlake said that's not common, but not impossible. He added that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office also runs a check for similar names before issuing trademarks, but with millions of applications each year, its searches are not as detailed.\n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office would not comment on the situation.\n\nCurrent Technologies is also demanding that HypeWipes take down its website – and more.\n\n“Our customers started getting letters stating that if they continued to sell our product they would be sued,\" Forino said.\n\nForino reached out to the NBC Connecticut Troubleshooters after Current Technologies sent letters to his daughter's schools, threatening to sue them if they sold HypeWipes during any kind of fundraiser.\n\n“It's pretty aggressive, pretty tasteless, for a company that's not even in the same industry to attack a kid-owned company in that manner,\" said Forino. “It is very heavy handed. They didn't have to be as heavy handed.\"\n\nPatent and trademark attorney Michael Blake, who is not associated with the case, said these tactics are not uncommon in such disputes.\n\n\"It looks like this Indiana company wants to play hardball,\" Blake said.\n\nIn fact, Current Technologies is now suing HypeWipes for $1 million.\n\nBlake estimates that Current Technologies has about an 80 percent chance of winning.\n\n“Whoever uses the trademark first typically has priority over anyone else who comes after,\" he explained.\n\nBlake added that a judge will also consider the likelihood that people will get confused between HypeWipes and Hype-Wipe.\n\n“They're both used for cleaning, so they're fairly similar, in similar channels of commerce,\" said Blake.\n\nThe lawsuit demands that HypeWipes hand over all its inventory. Forino said he is willing to drop the name, and has already shut down the HypeWipes website, but he wants his company to sell off the $40 thousand worth of remaining HypeWipes that all have the name printed on them.\n\nFor now, Forino does not think the two sides can settle.\n\n“In order to compromise, you just can't negotiate with a gun to your head,\" he said.\n\nWe will let you know how this product standoff finally gets cleaned up.",
  "latent_7296": "Opponents to a government-sponsored bill that would legalize marriage and adoption for same-sex couples took the streets of Paris Sunday in the biggest demonstration over a social issue in France in nearly 30 years.\n\nComing from across the country, protesters held balloons and waved banners and flags that read, “All born from a man and a woman,” and “Our wombs aren’t shopping carts.” They demanded that the bill be withdrawn, arguing that legalizing marriage and adoption for same-sex couples is against nature.\n\nOrganizers of the protest said 800,000 to 1 million people attended the demonstration, while police estimated the turnout at 340,000. Demonstrators, including prominent right-wing and far-right opposition politicians, marched through the city before converging on the Champs-de-Mars, where the Eiffel Tower sits.\n\nFrigide Barjot, a Catholic comedian and spokeswoman for the protestors, delivered a speech before the crowd in which she addressed French President François Hollande directly. “You, president of the republic, will you be the one decreeing that one can be born without a man or a woman?” she said.\n\nMr. Hollande pledged to legalize marriage and adoption for same-sex couples when he ran in last year’s presidential election. On Sunday evening, French Justice Minister Christiane Taubira told TF1, a French television channel, that the bill would go to Parliament despite the protest and that no referendum would be held on the issue.\n\n“It’s just a law that opens new freedom,” Ms. Taubira said. “It’s a protective law for couples and ... most importantly, for children.”\n\nA Jan. 10 survey by pollster BVA Opinion found 58 percent of respondents supported legalization of same-sex marriage while 41 percent opposed it. Among those opposed to same-sex marriage, 58 percent said they would nonetheless attend the weddings of their children if they were gay or lesbian.\n\nHowever, by at least one measure, public support for adoption by same-sex couples has declined in recent months. A November 2012 BVA Opinion poll showed that 50 percent of respondents supported adoption for same-sex couples, while 47 percent opposed it. But by January 2013, a majority of those surveyed – 53 percent – now said they opposed the measure, with only 43 percent still supporting it.\n\nAlexis Brézet, the editor of the right-leaning Le Figaro newspaper, sided with the protesters in a column on Monday and wrote that just because a majority of voters elected Hollande doesn’t mean a majority of citizens supports the bill. “The elementary wisdom now would be to put the bill on hold and to end ... where we should have started,” Brézet wrote. “A national debate, a real one.”\n\nThe left-leaning Libération newspaper called the protest “massive” in its Monday edition but wrote that demonstrators were out of touch with reality “at a time where, in France, more than one out of two children is born out of wedlock, and where 1.2 million children live in stepfamilies.”\n\nMarie-Claude Picardat, the co-president of the Association of Gay and Lesbian Parents and Future Parents, says she is confident the government won’t backpedal on the bill despite Sunday’s protest.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\n“What matters to me is to see that the government is very motivated and that the bill will pass as was announced in the platform of the candidate for president of the republic who was elected with millions and millions of vote,” Picardat says, referring to Hollande’s victory in last year’s presidential election.\n\nA demonstration in favor of the bill will be held on Jan. 27, just two days before the discussion of the bill starts in the National Assembly, France’s lower parliamentary chamber. The bill is likely to pass, as Hollande’s Socialist Party and its allies hold a majority of seats in both the National Assembly and the Senate.",
  "latent_7310": "by Ron Paul\n\nThis article was originally published on December 11, 2006\n\nThe media, Congress, and the American public all seem to have accepted something that is patently untrue: namely, that foreign policy is the domain of the president and not Congress. This is absolutely not the case and directly contrary to what our founding fathers wanted.\n\nThe role of the president as Commander in Chief is to direct our armed forces in carrying out policies established by the American people through their representatives in Congress. He is not authorized to make those policies. He is an administrator, not a policy maker. Foreign policy, like all federal policy, must be made by Congress. To allow otherwise is to act in contravention of the Constitution.\n\nLibrary of Congress scholar Louis Fisher, writing in The Oxford Companion to American Military History, summarizes presidential war power:\n\nThe president’s authority was carefully constrained. The power to repel sudden attacks represented an emergency measure that allowed the president, when Congress was not in session, to take actions necessary to repel sudden attacks either against the mainland of the United States or against American troops abroad. It did not authorize the president to take the country into full-scale war or mount an offensive attack against another nation.\n\nBut itâ€™s not simply the decision to wage war that is left to Congress. Consider also the words of James Madison:\n\nThose who are to conduct a war cannot in the nature of things, be proper or safe judges, whether a war ought to be commenced, continued, or concluded. They are barred from the latter functions by a great principle in free government, analogous to that which separates the sword from the purse, or the power of executing from the power of enacting laws (italics added).\n\nSo Congress is charged not only with deciding when to go to war, but also how to conduct– and bring to a conclusion– properly declared wars. Of course the administration has some role to play in making treaties, and the State Department should pursue beneficial diplomacy. But the notion that presidents should establish our broader foreign policy is dangerous and wrong.\n\nNo single individual should be entrusted with the awesome responsibility of deciding when to send our troops abroad, how to employ them once abroad, and when to bring them home. This is why the founders wanted Congress, the body most directly accountable to the public, to make critical decisions about war and peace.\n\nIt is shameful that Congress ceded so much of its proper authority over foreign policy to successive presidents during the 20th century, especially when it failed to declare war in Korea, Vietnam, Kosovo, and Iraq.\n\nItâ€™s puzzling that Congress is so willing to give away one of its most important powers, when most members from both parties work incessantly to expand the role of Congress in domestic matters. By transferring its role in foreign policy to the President, Congress not only violates the Constitution, but also disenfranchises the American electorate.\n\nRon Paul is a republican member of congress from Texas.",

  "latent_7507": "How do you improve on egg-in-a-hole? Make it an egg-in-a-hole grilled cheese sandwich, and treat yourself to what is quite possibly the best breakfast sandwich ever.\n\nGet the Recipe The Grilled Cheese Eggsplosion (Grilled Cheese With Fried Eggs Cooked Into the Bread)\n\nMore Eggs Buying tips, techniques, and recipes, no matter how you like them.\n\nI wish I could say that I came up with what may well be the best breakfast sandwich concept ever on my own, but I'd be lying. I first came across the brilliant idea over on Reddit, but awesomeness rarely goes unrepeated when the internet is involved, and I have no shame in admitting that I made this sandwich within an hour of reading about it.\n\nLike the infamous Fatty Melt—that's a burger made with two grilled cheese sandwiches as a bun, the brainchild of our own Adam Kuban—the Grilled Cheese Eggsplosion is a hybrid sandwich, combining elements from two or more sources into a single glorious dish. In this case, it's a simple grilled cheese sandwich with two eggs-in-a-hole (or bull's-eye eggs, eggs-in-a-basket, whatever you want to call them) replacing plain old bread.\n\nBonus: You get to make yourself a mini grilled cheese using the circular cutouts—or a mini egg-in-the-hole, if you like.\n\nIf all goes well, once this sucker is fried up, the cheese will be perfectly melted and the yolks still runny, so that they gush forth as soon as you cut or bite into them. I strongly believe that anything good can be made better by adding a chin-dripping element. Except perhaps disposable razors.\n\nHere's how to make it.\n\nHow to Make an Egg-in-a-Hole Grilled Cheese Sandwich (a.k.a. the Grilled Cheese Eggsplosion), Step by Step\n\nStep 1: Assemble Your Ingredients\n\nFor each sandwich, you'll need two slices of sandwich bread, two tablespoons of butter, two eggs, and two to three slices of cheese. I like using a mix of American cheese (for gooeyness) and cheddar (for flavor). You'll also want to have some salt on hand.\n\nStep 2: Cut Holes in the Bread\n\nCut a hole out of the center of each slice of bread. You can use a fancy ring mold for this, an empty can with both ends cut off (tomato paste cans work great), or the lid to a Mason jar, like the one I'm using here.\n\nStep 3: Start Frying\n\nIt's important to pre-toast the bread for this recipe; otherwise, the egg will be overcooked by the time the toast is properly browned. Melt a tablespoon of butter in a large cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat, and cook the bread until it's lightly browned on the bottom side.\n\nStep 4: Add the Eggs\n\nAdd another half teaspoon of butter to the center of each eye. Let the butter melt, then break the eggs into the holes. Season the eggs with salt.\n\nCook until the eggs can easily be lifted from underneath with a thin spatula.\n\nStep 5: Flip and Add Cheese\n\nFlip each slice of bread over (carefully!), and place a slice of cheese over each one. Meanwhile, place a folded slice of cheese in between the circular cutouts.\n\nOnce the bottoms of both slices of bread are lightly browned, carefully close the sandwiches, and cook them for another minute or two, until the bread is deeply browned and the cheese is fully melted.\n\nStep 6: Make the Cut\n\nThree...two...one...eggsplode!\n\nThis post may contain links to Amazon or other partners; your purchases via these links can benefit Serious Eats.

Witnesses at the scene state the driver of a Dodge pickup ran the red light striking the cyclist. Traffic from the neighborhoods along Boulder Drive and Lake Boulevard backed up as morning commuters sat in mute witness to another traffic fatality.\n\nVictim Blaming\n\nWhen such news stories break many, ask “what did the cyclist do to cause the accident?” An uninformed yet typical question considering the driver-centric society in which we live. Beyond the obvious victim blaming that is common in cycling deaths are the myths that are perpetuated by the media.\n\nHelmet use is criminalized across the country, not by law but by the media. A local television station’s article included this enlightening tidbit. “The bicyclist was not wearing a helmet at the time of the collision.” The last time I checked a cyclist not wearing a helmet has never contributed to an accident nor protected anyone from internal injuries. To be generous let’s assume no attempt was being made to imply the cyclist was at fault. The ugly truth is such statements leave a misleading last impression in the minds of readers and television viewers while completely ignoring the driver’s actions and history.\n\nContributing factors?\n\nDriving a motor vehicle is a dangerous business. Riding a bicycle amongst countless strangers on the roadways of Redding is even more perilous. Consider the history of the driver who struck the cyclist. According to public court records, she has numerous criminal traffic offenses: one in 2000, two in 2003 and another in 2008. Rounding out her driving record are ten non-criminal traffic infractions, four which were charged in 2007 alone. One would hope our local media would find these points more informative than the absence of a helmet.\n\nToday we are left with another sad chapter for our city and riding community. Sadly the courts continue to enable drivers with a history of impaired and unsafe driving to maim and kill cyclists and pedestrians alike with little consequence. While alcohol or drugs do not appear to be involved in this incident, we are left with the lingering questions, what could have been done? When will cycling deaths be treated as any other negligent death of a driver?\n\nUntil then, our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and loved ones of today's victim.",

There was a carnival atmosphere, with people waving the Southern flag, as dancers and drummers beat out tunes. Red and white tape marked out the lines for the queues, with celebratory party balloons tied alongside. Carnival in south, concern in Khartoum In pictures: Land of oil and cattle\n\nMany people queued up to vote long before polls opened.\n\n\"My vote is for my mother and father, and my brothers and sisters who were murdered in the war,\" Abraham Parrying told the BBC as he waited to vote in the southern capital, Juba.\n\n\"I also vote for my children-to-be - if God grants me that - so that they can grow up in a south Sudan that is free and is at peace.\"\n\nAnother voter, 36-year-old soldier Maxine About, said he had \"seen the inside of war so we have to stop the war now\".\n\n\"We are very happy the Arabs are going away,\" he told the Associated Press.\n\nVoting had been due to end at 1700 local time (1400 GMT) but polling was extended in many Juba polling stations because of the long queues.\n\nSouthern Sudan has high levels of illiteracy so voters are faced with two symbols on the ballot paper - a single hand for independence or two clasped hands to remain one country.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr Kiir said the referendum was \"not the end of the journey but rather the beginning of a new one\".\n\nHe was speaking in Juba alongside US Senator John Kerry, who has been in talks with both northern and southern leaders attempting to smooth the voting process.\n\nMr Kiir, who was the first to cast his ballot, urged people to \"be patient\", in case they were not able to vote on the first day of polling.\n\nHarding on Africa After so many years of conflict, there is no mistaking the sheer appetite for peace here in Juba -a hard factor to measure, but an all too easy one to overlook Read Andrew's thoughts in full\n\nVeronique de Keyser, head of the the European Union observer team in Juba, said voting appeared to have started well.\n\n\"What I observed this morning was very moving in the sense that you can feel it, in the crowd, the expectation of the people is important,\" she said.\n\n\"It's very, very well organised. People are queuing very quietly so far and I hope it reflects what is happening in the country today.\"\n\nHowever, the run-up to the vote was marred by an attack by rebels on Southern Sudan's military in the oil-rich Unity state.\n\nCol Philip Auger, a military spokesman, told the Associated Press on Saturday that his troops had retaliated and killed four of the rebels.\n\nUN officials confirmed that they had received reports of an attack in the area, but did not say which side had suffered the fatalities.\n\nThere are also reports of clashes between southerners and Arab nomads over grazing rights for their cattle in the disputed oil-rich region of Abyei, long seen as a potential flashpoint which could trigger wider violence.\n\nIt was due to hold a separate referendum at the same time on whether to join north or south Sudan but this has been postponed indefinitely as the two sides cannot agree on who is eligible to vote there.\n\nEU-style bloc?\n\nIn an interview with the Arabic news channel al-Jazeera, Mr Bashir said he understood why many southerners wanted independence, but he expressed concern at how the new nation would cope.\n\n\"The south suffers from many problems,\" he said.\n\n\"It's been at war since 1959. The south does not have the ability to provide for its citizens or create a state or authority.\"\n\nMr Bashir said southerners living in the north would not be allowed dual citizenship, and floated the idea of the two nations joining in an EU-style bloc.\n\nSudan's Historic Vote Voting: 9-15 January\n\nTo pass, 60% of those registered need to vote plus majority of ballots\n\nVote a condition of 2005 deal to end two-decade north-south conflict\n\nMost northerners are Arabic-speaking Muslims\n\nMost southerners Christian or follow traditional religions\n\nOil-rich Abyei area to hold separate vote on whether to join north or south\n\nReferendum could divide Africa's largest country\n\nFinal result due 6 February or 14 February if there are appeals\n\nSouth would become continent's newest nation on 9 July 2011\n\nNational anthem and flag chosen, but not new country's name Sudanese voters: Your stories\n\nHe also warned that if southerners seized Abyei for themselves, it could lead to war.\n\nAnalysts say Mr Bashir is under intense pressure from northern politicians, who fear that secession of the south may lead to a further splintering of the country, in particular the western region of Darfur which has faced its own rebellion since 2003.\n\nNorth and south Sudan have suffered decades of conflict driven by religious and ethnic divides.\n\nSouthern Sudan is one of the least developed areas in the world and many of its people have have long complained of mistreatment at the hands of the Khartoum government.\n\nEarlier this week the official in charge of the referendum commission, Chan Rene Madut, said the region was attempting \"something that has never happened\".\n\n\"Nobody ever bothered to ask the people of Southern Sudan as to what their destiny should be,\" he said.\n\nTurnout in the referendum will be important, as the 2005 peace agreement stipulates that for the vote to be valid, 60% of the 3.8 million registered voters must take part.\n\nThe official result is not due to be announced for at least four weeks, partly because of the logistical difficulties gathering the ballot papers from across a region the size of Spain and Portugal which has no paved roads linking its towns and cities.",
  "latent_8414": "Buy Photo Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks at a political town hall meeting in Ames in December. (Photo: The Register)Buy Photo\n\nOn one recent Iowa visit, Bernie Sanders showed he's the kind of presidential contender who is perfectly comfortable speaking at a podium that's actually an overturned milk crate on a tabletop.\n\nSanders, a no-frills man of the people, will be welcome in the presidential race becaucharse he's so sincere about his ideas for making working-class Americans' lives better, some Iowa Democratic activists said Thursday. It's possible the Vermont second-term U.S. senator can become a real contender here — and peel away votes from frontrunner Hillary Clinton — if he can explain himself to enough voters, they said.\n\nInstead of dwelling on \"Canadian birth certificates and pants suits,\" Sanders gets to the heart of problems that bog down the national economy, said Ken Sagar, president of the Iowa AFL-CIO.\n\n\"All the labeling about, 'Oh, he's a left-wing person' — if you just set that aside for a second and listen to him talk about the issues, a lot of the stuff he talks about is pretty important,\" Sagar told The Des Moines Register Thursday morning. \"If you're a Republican, you have kids who have student loan debt, too. If you're an independent, you're worried about retirement, too.\"\n\nSanders, who announced in an overnight email that he intends to seek the White House, will focus on three issues, according to his political strategist Tad Devine, a longtime campaign operative who guided Al Gore and John Kerry's presidential bids.\n\nMORE: 6 things to know about Sanders | Sanders on Social Security: Expand it, don't cut it\n\nSanders will talk about how to fix the widening gap between the wealthy and the poor, and argue that few people benefit from the way government is currently structured, Devine told the Register.\n\nHe will detail the necessity of dealing with climate change in a comprehensive way. And he'll describe why campaign finance laws need to be changed after the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling green-lighted unlimited amounts of money in elections.\n\nSanders, who spent \"not a dime\" on TV advertising in his 2012 re-election race in Vermont, will hire Iowa staff and will personally devote time to talking with Iowans, his aides said.\n\n\"Iowa is critical to a Bernie Sanders path to victory,\" Devine said. \"It's really where the process begins.\"\n\nOn May 26, Sanders will do an official kick-off event in Burlington, Vermont, then travel to Iowa, Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said.\n\nCANDIDATE TRACKER: See where presidential hopefuls will be\n\nSanders has already made several trips to Iowa this election cycle, doing 22 events over 11 days. That ranks him sixth among all the 2016 contenders for most time invested in the state. He held meet-and-greet events in university communities, delivered speeches to progressive advocacy groups and met privately with some of Iowa's most influential liberal activists.\n\nTwenty-four-year-old Evan Burger, a political organizer who lives in Slater, met Sanders last fall.\n\n\"Blown away is the term I would use. This is someone who's not afraid to speak truth to power,\" Burger told the Register Thursday.\n\nYoung people will be a key constituency for Sanders in the Iowa caucuses, Burger said.\n\nFor his generation, Burger said, \"the disconnect with electoral politics is that most politicians are afraid of taking bold stances, like on student debt, same-sex marriage, taking on Wall Street. They want to focus-group every single thing they say in public. Their message switches depending on what will get them ahead.\"\n\nIowa activists noted that Clinton is so popular with Iowa Democratic likely caucusgoers, it will be hard for Sanders, who is far less well known, to overcome her lead.\n\nIn a January Des Moines Register Iowa Poll, Sanders ranked fourth in the Democratic horserace, after Clinton (top choice of 56 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers), Massachusetts U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (16 percent) and Vice President Joe Biden (9 percent). Sanders was the top choice of only 5 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers. A majority, 51 percent, didn't know enough about him to form an opinion, while 37 percent viewed him favorably.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Breaking News Alert newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Alerts on breaking news delivered straight to your inbox.

Warren and Biden weren't listed as choices.\n\nDespite Sanders' gap in the polls, he's competitive because \"he's so clearly out in front on so many issues, which Iowans respect,\" said Adam Mason, state policy director for the CCI Action Fund. \"Already we've seen Hillary Clinton hedge on a number of issues, including the (Trans-Pacific Partnership).\"\n\nMason argued that there's a progressive base in Iowa that Sanders can tap into. In the 2006 Democratic primary in the governor's race, progressive leader Ed Fallon claimed 26 percent, and 38,000 votes. In the 2008 presidential race, Clinton rival John Edwards, who was considered more progressive, outperformed her in the Iowa caucuses that year, although by less than 1 percentage point.\n\nSanders could pick up Iowans who consider Warren their favorite, if she stands by her vow to not run for president in 2016.\n\n\"That's a natural base for Sanders,\" Mason said.\n\nIn the 2008 presidential race, most Iowa union members aligned with Clinton, but Sanders is known as a true friend to labor, as is another potential Democratic 2016 candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, said Charlie Wishman, secretary-treasurer for the Iowa AFL-CIO.\n\nThe race to win over union activists is wide open, Wishman said. \"I think anybody right now can certainly appeal to the hearts and minds of union members in Iowa,\" he said.\n\nIn his own words\n\nHere are some of the points Bernie Sanders, the intense change-minded U.S. senator from Vermont, has made to Iowans in recent months:\n\n\"We need a political revolution in which we involve millions and millions of people – working people, young people, low-income people, people of color – who are not now involved in the political process. We're not going to make the changes we need if pundits are right and voter turnout in this coming election is 40 percent. If that's the case, the Koch brothers win. We've got to figure out a way to galvanize millions of people whose lives depend upon what happens in Washington to get involved in the political process.\"\n\n\"If we don't get our hands around this issue, an issue in which the wealthiest people in this country are getting richer while the middle class is disappearing, and while we have more people living in poverty than any time in the history of America, if we don't deal with this issue, we are not going to have a middle class in this country.\"\n\nAfter calling for more government spending on public infrastructure such as roads and schools, an increase in the minimum wage, reversing climate change, and bolstering Social Security, he said: \"These are not utopian ideas. They are not radical ideas. They are fairly common sensical ideas that can happen when you have a government that is directed by the people themselves and not by wealthy powerful corporate interests.\"\n\n\"You're not going to have a democratic form of government when the Koch brothers and others are able to buy elections by spending hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in campaigns supporting candidates whose sole purpose is to make the wealthiest people in this country even wealthier. ... We've got to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision and ... move toward public funding of elections.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1GJ4I9Z",
  "latent_8573": "The other night I saw a commercial for Polident denture cream. There’s a guy in a lab coat, a pretend dentist, who’s saying that a lot of people treat dentures like teeth even though dentures are much softer and more porous than teeth. Dentures, the guy tells us, are different to teeth. But why should I listen to him? Why should I even be able to stand him? Different to? This makes me nuts. Okay, so in England — the British Isles — it is acceptable to pair these words together, but we’re not in England. We spell realize with a z and not an s. We don’t have a monarchy. We are more discreet about our prejudices. In sum: we are different from the British. We might even be different than the British. But we are certainly not different to the British. What we are, I fear, is dumber than the British. Or getting dumb thanks to media that institutionalizes bad grammar. Ever seen that commercial for Burger King’s new line of fries? Forget what gross measures BK has taken to modulate its fry-frying technique, and focus on the message: Forty percent less fat, thirty percent less calories. If you want to get into it, there’s reason to argue that less in some contexts can be applied to countable plural nouns. Just not this one. Why couldn’t they have said: Less fat, fewer calories? Why? Because it’s not as punchy, not as advertisy, and not as indifferent to proper grammar, which is fast becoming a hallmark — even a badge of honor — for people trying to woo each other. Want to sell me something? Great, just be sure to put on your idiot face, first.\n\nI have read a lot of dating profiles. A lot. Infer from this what you will while I make the following observation: no one equates proper grammar with sex appeal. On the contrary, the worse your punctuation, the more confident you seem that strangers will want to have sex with you. Does anyone on these websites know the difference between you’re and your? There and their? I teach creative writing to undergraduates and am frequently — daily — appalled by how bad their command is of basic language skills. Fast forward twenty years and I am seeing these same people advertise themselves on OkCupid. I love to travel. Its just my thing. Reluctant non-conformist, verging on the anarchist. AKA, “a prick”. Aka a truant, since this guy obviously skipped that class on punctuation and its placement. Here’s one I like: I’m “well educated”. It’s gotten so bad that one guy, in the “what are you looking for” section, writes: “A woman who knows the difference between its and it’s.” To me that’s like saying I want to date a person who knows the alphabet. When did the bar drop so low? And, really, why do I care? On the spectrum of world problems that need bemoaning, is bad grammar really one of them?\n\nYes. Yes it is.\n\nFor a lot of people, good grammar is like the opera — elitist and snobby. Never mind that opera tickets cost less than the nose-bleeders at almost any sporting event in the country or that the stories in opera are as Everyman as it gets: boy meets girl, boy loses girl. It’s all about perception. And if you say less fat, fewer calories, maybe people get the idea you are pretentious, and if pretentious, unpalatable. This is why so many of us don’t use capital letters when we email — because it looks stuffy. Which would all be fine were it not the case that bad grammar falls into the same category as bad prose writing, which heralds the depredation of our culture and the exaltation of fascism. Seems like a bold statement, and it is, until you reread George Orwell’s “Politics and the English Language” which seems every bit as urgent today as it must have in ’46 despite fascism’s being less potent now than it was then. In the essay, Orwell contends that imprecision (and what is poor grammar but the handmaid of imprecision?) allows propaganda to thrive. Imprecision allows you to say one thing when you really mean another, or at least to obfuscate whatever it is that you do mean. Imprecision favors political conformity by relieving all of us of the burden to think. When’s the last you heard a politician who made you think? All you heard were the same hackneyed phrases and idioms that say, in essence, go to sleep now, the machine’s well-oiled. As Charles Baxter writes in his wonderful essay “On Defamiliarization,” the kingdom is running smoothly because no one is learning anything.\n\nOrwell was not actually all that big on grammar, though his grammar was impeccable. His bugbear was the debasement of the language thanks to dead metaphors, familiar phrases, euphemism, and vagueness. But I think bad grammar is equally dangerous. A commercial for Hill’s Ideal Balance dog food fear-mongers by telling me that my dog’s diet has too little vitamins. Gah, mini vitamins in my lab’s bowl! Guess I should run to the pet store right now. Similarly, next time a hurricane rolls into town and the government fails to provide adequate remuneration for people whose lives have been destroyed, I will be well pacified by the language coming out of Capitol Hill. Why worry? We’re stronger to the storm.",

They also gave the Koch brothers a pass for claiming they oversee one of \"the safest and environmentally protective\" companies. The fawning interview follows months of pro-Koch coverage by the MSNBC hosts.\n\nMorning Joe's Pro-Koch Coverage Paid Off With \"Exclusive, First-Ever Joint Interview\"\n\nMorning Joe On Koch Brothers Before Interview: \"Awesome,\" \"Godsend,\" People Should \"Thank\" Them And Stop \"Pick[ing]\" On Them. Morning Joe hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski's tireless efforts to defend industrialists Charles and David Koch paid off when the Koch brothers granted them \"an exclusive, first-ever joint interview\" on MSNBC. The Morning Joe crew had called David Koch \"a godsend,\" portrayed the billionaires as similar to \"most Americans\" in their political views, and dismissed attacks over their dark money spending as \"stupid\" and \"embarrassing.\" [Media Matters, 10/30/15]\n\nInternational Business Times: Scarborough And Brzezinski Are \"Are Self-Professed And Unabashed Koch Fans.\" Reporter Brendan James wrote that the Morning Joe hosts \"in charge of the interview are self-professed and unabashed Koch fans\" and noted that \"both Brzezinski and Scarborough earlier this year attended a weekend in Palm Springs, California, for the American Recovery Policy Forum, put on by the Kochs' organization, the tax-exempt Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce ...

The Morning Joe co-hosts did not challenge Charles Koch when he claimed that the Koch brothers' business has been \"contributing to society\" and been \"among the safest and environmentally protective producer.\"\n\nBRZEZINSKI: Let's talk about the book and start with the title. How do you define Good Profit? KOCH: Well, Good Profit, I define just that way, is profit -- a good profit is profit that becomes [sic] from contributing to society, from helping other people improve their lives. And for a business, this means producing products and services that your customers value more than the alternatives while more efficiently using resources and being among the safest and environmentally protective producer. And so when you do those, you create good profit. And so this was my philosophy I developed early on.\n\nIn reality, as Media Matters has documented, the Kochs have a terrible environmental track record. Koch Industries paid \"the largest civil fine ever imposed\" for environmental violations after the company caused hundreds of oil spills, and a government agency determined that Koch Industries failures were likely responsible for the deaths of two teenagers. Koch Industries is also among the companies most responsible for both air and water pollution in the U.S. Finally, neither Scarborough nor Brzezinski challenged Koch on his professed devotion to the \"scientific method,\" even though Koch has personally denied the firmly-established scientific consensus that human activities cause global warming.

Something that we talked about on our show time and time again ...

  "latent_8671": "New research published in Evolutionary Psychological Science suggests that the Dark Triad of personality traits does not reflect a common social or sexual strategy.\n\nThe two-party study of 1,116 adults examined the relationship between Dark Triad traits and sociosexuality. The “Dark Triad” refers to the three menacing personality traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathy. Sociosexuality refers to individual differences in people’s willingness to engage in sexual activity outside of a committed relationship or without an emotional connection.\n\nThe researchers found that Machiavellianism was negatively associated with short-term sexual behaviors. In other words, people who were more Machiavellian tended to report less short-term sexual encounters. Narcissism also showed an unexpected positive association with long-term relationships, while psychopathy was negatively associated with long-term relationships — but only among men.\n\nPsyPost interviewed the study’s corresponding author, Daniel N. Jones of the University of Texas, El Paso. Read his responses below:\n\nPsyPost: Why were you interested in this topic?\n\nJones: There is a lot of misinformation out there about the Dark Triad and sexuality. Many people believe that individuals high in any of the three traits will engage in more short-term sexual behaviors, and are exclusively short-term in their relationship focus. Although these assertions are consistent with the theoretical understanding of psychopathy, they are inconsistent with the theoretical understanding of Machiavellianism and narcissism. Machiavellianism is a trait that is associated with caution, flexibility, and goal focus, whereas narcissism is a trait associated with seeking social praise.\n\nThus, there are definitely situations where individuals high in both Machiavellianism or narcissism will not to engage in short-term sexual behavior. For example, we surmise that a cautious individual, such as someone high in Machiavellianism, would be not likely to engage in short-term casual sex. This reluctance may be out of concern for reputation, disease, pregnancy, or in the service of some larger goal. Similarly, narcissistic individuals may seek long-term relationships because successful relationships may be a source of praise. Although none of these traits would object on moral or attachment grounds to short-term sexual encounters, the actual behaviors (for example) may be too risky for someone high in Machiavellianism.\n\nWhat should the average person take away from your study?\n\nThat the Dark Triad traits are different, even when it comes to sociosexuality. Specifically, individuals (both men and women) high in Machiavellianism are not short-term focused in their sexual behaviors. In fact, when taking the other Dark Triad traits into account, they are comparatively less short-term in their sexual behaviors. All three Dark Triad traits, however, are associated with permissive sexual attitudes. So none of them object to the act of short-term sexual behavior, but caution appears to differentiate Machiavellianism from the other two.\n\nAre there any major caveats? What questions still need to be addressed?\n\nWe analyzed men and women separately and had reasonable sample sizes for our analyses. However, as is the case with any self-reported study, we have no knowledge of the veracity of behavioral claims, because we did not study actual behaviors. Future research should examine short-term sexual behavior under different contexts. For example, if it brings social praise, narcissistic individuals should be most likely to engage in such behaviors. However, if it would bring social scorn, they should be least likely. Perhaps there is a condition where short-term sexual behavior would be beneficial to a Machiavellian’s long-term goals. Under such circumstances, the results may change.\n\nIs there anything else you would like to add?\n\nThere is a lot of media attention focused on the Dark Triad. Specifically that bad boys are attractive, get the girl, are better in bed, and so forth. I think we need to be extremely careful about disseminating empirically unsupported claims of this nature. For example, in our research that is forthcoming, we have found that only certain types of women are attracted to Dark Triad men. Further, there is no evidence (to my knowledge) that Dark Triad individuals are better lovers or better in bed.\n\nFinally, these traits still differ, and we need to stop referring to individuals as “high in the Dark Triad.” Yes, when you are high on one trait you are (generally) high on the others. However, in most cases, one trait is more pronounced than others. For example, an individual either has caution (Machiavellianism) or not (psychopathy), one cannot be both at the same time (e.g., a Machiavellian-psychopath).\n\nThe study, “Differential Reproductive Behavior Patterns Among the Dark Triad“, was also co-authored by Melissa S. de Roos.",
  "latent_8680": "Imprinted small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are only found in eutherian genomes and closely related to brain functions. A complex human neurological disease, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), is primarily attributed to the deletion of imprinted snoRNAs in chromosome 15q11-q13. Here we investigated the snoRNA repertoires in the PWS locus of 12 mammalian genomes and their evolution processes. A total of 613 imprinted snoRNAs were identified in the PWS homologous loci and the gene number was highly variable across lineages, with a peak in Euarchontoglires. Lineage-specific gene gain and loss events account for most extant genes of the HBII-52 (SNORD115) and the HBII-85 (SNORD116) gene family, and remarkable high gene-birth rates were observed in the primates and the rodents. Meanwhile, rapid sequence substitution occurred only in imprinted snoRNA genes, rather than their flanking sequences or the protein-coding genes located in the same imprinted locus. Strong selective constraints on the functional elements of these imprinted snoRNAs further suggest that they are subjected to birth-and-death evolution. Our data suggest that the regulatory role of HBII-52 on 5-HT 2C R pre-mRNA might originate in the Euarchontoglires through adaptive process. We propose that the rapid evolution of PWS-related imprinted snoRNAs has contributed to the neural development of Euarchontoglires.\n\nFunding: This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 30830066) to Liang-Hu Qu.

Since the PWS-related imprinted snoRNAs are closely associated with mammalian brain functions, it is of great interest to investigate the evolution of these highly dynamic non-coding RNAs. Nahkuri et al. suggest that the HBII-52 gene family originates from a non-imprinted snoRNA, SNORD119 [33] . Ogorelkova et al. revealed that the HBII-52 family was subjected to positive selection in Europeans populations, suggesting these gene are still undergoing evolution in human populations [34] . However, these studies did not fully reveal the evolutionary process of these imprinted snoRNA genes along with the differentiation of the eutherian or its significance to mammalian neural development. In this study, using a genome-wide snoRNA identification program developed by our group, snoSeeker [35] , we performed comprehensive identification and evolutionary analyses to reveal the pattern and process underlying the evolution of mammalian imprinted snoRNAs.\n\nSnoRNA genes have traditionally been regarded as conservative components of the genome. SnoRNAs have been identified in a wide spectrum of organisms spanning eukaryotes to archaebacteria, suggesting that they represent an evolutionary ancient group of non-coding RNAs [25] . Homologues of almost all yeast snoRNAs can be found in the human genome [26] , [27] , and their modification sites in rRNAs are also highly conserved among distantly related eukaryotes [1] , [28] . However, the discovery of a large number of eutherian-specific imprinted snoRNAs led us to reexamine this supposedly ancient group of RNAs from a new perspective. Further investigations failed to find homologs of these imprinted snoRNAs in any other non-eutherian mammals or vertebrates [29] – [31] . In addition, a number of lineage-specific snoRNA genes were identified only in rodents rather than humans, and a rat-specific imprinted snoRNA cluster, RBII-36, containing 74 member genes, was not detected in mice (see the review of [32] ). These observations suggest that imprinted snoRNA genes represent a class of newly derived small non-coding RNAs that might be subjected to rapid evolution.\n\nThe top panel depicts the gene distribution across the entire PWS locus. Pink represents maternally expressed genes, blue represents paternally expressed genes, red represents imprinted snoRNA clusters, and the dashed wavy line represents non-coding transcripts. In the lower panels, each snoRNA gene is represented by a vertical bar. The distribution of snoRNA genes was scaled to their genomic location, and the colors indicate their respective gene families. Clusters are scaled relative to their size within the chromosome.\n\nSmall nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) belong to a large group of small, metabolically stable RNAs that primarily direct the post-transcriptional modification of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) nucleotides. Based on common sequence motifs involved in the assembly of sno-ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) particles, snoRNAs fall into two major classes, the C/D box and H/ACA box groups, which account for the 2′-O-ribose methylation and pseudouridylation modifications respectively of rRNA or snRNA [1] , [2] . These snoRNAs are called ‘guide’ snoRNAs, and there is a fraction of snoRNAs, the so called ‘orphan’ snoRNAs, which do not target to any rRNA or snRNA. In recent years, hundreds of snoRNAs have been discovered in imprinted regions of the eutherian genomes (imprinted snoRNAs) [3] – [8] . The expressions of imprinted genes are depending on the parent of origin. Unlike other snoRNAs, which show broad expression profiles, imprinted snoRNAs are mainly expressed in the brain and are closely associated with brain function [9] , [10] . Another feature of imprinted snoRNAs is that they usually fall within large gene clusters containing several gene families. One of such family usually contains dozens of snoRNA genes. Two large paternally expressed C/D box snoRNA families, HBII-85 (SNORD116) and HBII-52 (SNORD115), are located in the 15q11-q13 imprinted region of the human genome. Large interstitial deletions of this region underlie ∼70% of cases of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS, [MIM176270]), a complex human neurological disease [11] . Duplication of the same region is the only recurrent cytogenetic aberration associated with autism, occurring in up to 5% of autism cases [12] – [14] . The clinical symptoms of PWS include neonatal hypotonia, feeding difficulties and failure to thrive during infancy, excessive weight gain after 18 months, hyperphagia, hypogonadism, global developmental delay and equivocal facial features. Deletion of the HBII-85 snoRNA cluster results in an exhibition of all major clinical symptoms of PWS in humans [15] – [17] , but the role of the HBII-52 cluster in PWS has been difficult to define [11] , [18] . The neuronal-specific HBII-52 snoRNAs have been reported to participate in the post-transcriptional regulation of the pre-mRNA encoding the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptor (5-HT 2C R), an important neurotransmission protein, including A-to-I RNA editing and alternative RNA splicing, with in vitro experiments [19] – [21] . The biological importance of the regulatory role of HBII-52 in vivo, if any, remains to be demonstrated. Knockout of MBII-52 (murine homologues of HBII-52) in a murine model led to an increase in the editing of 5-HT 2C R pre-RNA and alterations in a number of 5HT 2C R-related behaviors, including impulsive responses, locomotor activity and reactivity to palatable food [22] . Although the molecular targets of HBII-85 are as yet unknown, an increasing number of studies have investigated the regulatory roles of HBII-85 snoRNAs and their connection to PWS phenotypes [15] – [17] , [23] , [24] . In addition, the PWS locus contains several singleton snoRNA genes of unknown function, e.g., HBII-438, HBII-13 and HBII-436 ( Figure 1 ).\n\nTo investigate the targeting pattern of HBII-52 gene families in different eutherians species, homologous sequence to human 5-HT 2C R mRNA of different species were got by BALSTP program from ensembl genome web site ( www.ensembl.org ). The binding pattern between ASE2 sequences and 5-HT 2C R mRNA in same species was analyzed by BLAST method with some modifications. Two major characters, the length of perfect binding and the distance of perfect binding from D box, were analyzed.\n\nThe K a /K s or d n /d s test is one of the most frequently used tests of selection. The test relies on the simple fact that the rate of evolution can exceed that of a neutral sequence only if there is positive selection [51] . Ka/Ks test for protein-coding gene was performed with MEGA 4.0 software [52] .\n\nTajima’s D test was performed with DnaSP software version 5.10.01 [49] . For the Tajima’s neutrality test, significant deviations of Tajima’s D values from zero suggest rejecting the standard neutral model and negative values of Tajima’s D indicate positive selection. All the gene sequences of HBII-52 or HBII-85 gene family from one species were used for the test. The statistical significance was obtained assuming that D follows the beta distribution [50] .\n\nAccording to the secondary structure we divided box C/D snoRNs gene into 5 parts: the stem region, C/D boxes, antisense element 1 (ASE1), antisense element 2 (ASE2) and the remaining sequence. To investigate the evolutionary rates of different parts of the imprinted snoRNA genes, we created an alignment for HBII-52 or HBII-85 family and defined different structural components in the alignment. The evolutionary distances (K) between humans and each of the other species were calculated for each of the five parts of the snoRNAs using the Kimura 2-parameter model.\n\nTo test whether the rapid rate of evolution was specific to the imprinted snoRNAs, we compared the evolutionary rate between imprinted snoRNA genes and their flanking intergenic sequences. We obtained 500 bp of both upstream and downstream flanking sequences for each analyzed imprinted snoRNA gene from the UCSC genome website. The substitution rates of both imprinted snoRNA genes and their flanking sequences were calculated as described above. Similar analyses were also performed using non-imprinted snoRNA genes as the reference.\n\nFor each imprinted gene family, the substitution rates between humans and each of the other species were calculated using the “between-group average calculation” method with the Kimura 2-parameter model implemented with MEGA ver. 3.1 [37] , [48] . A “group” corresponds to a multi-gene family from one species, which contains all gene members in this family. For each between-group average, an arithmetic average is computed for all valid inter-group pairwise comparisons. The standard error for each calculation was estimated by bootstrap analysis with 500 replicates. To calculate the substitution rates of non-imprinted snoRNA genes, we first identified all of the families that were conserved between humans and each of the other species ( Table S2 , the sequences were provided in data S1 and S2 ). The guide snoRNAs and orphan snoRNAs were analyzed separately. The orphan snoRNA genes were identified by the absence of targeting sites in rRNA or snRNA according the information in snoRNA-LBME-db ( https://www-snorna.biotoul.fr/index.php ) [27] . These orphan snoRNAs were listed in Table S2 . For multi-gene families, one gene member and its orthologous in the other species s was selected for the analysis. Then gene sequences from one species were linked together in order of gene name and an aliment was built with this integrated sequence of human and each of the other species. Next, the average substitution rates of the conserved families were calculated with the Kimura 2-parameter model. All of the calculations were performed using MEGA version 3.1 [37] .\n\nThe number of new genes was calculated as follows. For imprinted snoRNAs, the number of newly derived genes was estimated according to the evolutionary change in gene number described above, whereas the number of newly derived non-imprinted snoRNAs was estimated by determining the difference in gene number between closely related species. Birth rates of new genes were calculated by dividing the number of newly derived genes by the lapsed time since the species diverged from their most recent common ancestor. The time scale was set according to Hedges et al. [47] , and the weighted average data were selected.\n\nTo investigate the expansion process of imprinted snoRNAs, a combined physical-phylogenetic map for the HBII-52 or HBII-85 gene family of human or mouse was constructed. The phylogenetic trees were built with the Bayesian method as described above, each Markov chain ran for 1×10 7 generations. The clades receiving >50% posterior probabilities were kept and the derived consensus trees were reconciled with gene physical locations in the chromosomes.\n\nTo estimate the numbers of gene in ancestral species and gene gains and losses, we used the reconciled tree method [42] – [44] , in which the topology of a gene tree is reconciled with that of a species tree. A simple example is shown by Niimura and Nei [45] and Nam and Nei [44] . To apply this method to imprinted snoRNA genes, we requested the computer program described in Niimura and Nei [45] , [46] from Y. Niimura. We first constructed a phylogenetic tree using all genes of the two multi-gene families (HBII-52 and HBII-85) together with outgroup genes chosen from other close related families. The reconciled tree method was applied to these two phylogenetic trees and the Euarchontoglires tree topology. Given the relative low bootstrap value caused by short sequence of snoRNA genes, the 50% bootstrap condensed trees were used here.\n\nTo further investigate the phylogenetic relationship within the HBII-52 and HBII-85 multi-gene families, the alignment of each family was built as described above. The phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed using MrBayes ver. 3.1 [36] with a HKY+G model suggested by MrModeltest (ver. 2.2) [40] . Every analysis consisted of two runs each containing four Markov chains that ran for 2×10 6 generations, sampled every 1000 generations, with a random starting tree, default priors and equal branch lengths. The consensus trees were edited with iTOL [41] . The sequence alignments are provided in Data S2 .\n\nTo reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship of imprinted snoRNA genes in the PWS locus, a dataset containing gene sequences from all families in this locus (i.e. HBII-436, HBII-13, HBII-438, HBII-85 and HBII-52) was generated. For gene families containing more than 20 members, 4–6 representative genes were selected based on a gene tree constructed using the neighbor-joining method implemented in MEGA ver. 3.1 [37] ; for gene families containing less than 20 members, all sequences were added to the dataset. The sequences were aligned with ClustalX [38] . The sequence alignment is provided in data S1 and S2 . Then a phylogenetic network was constructed using the NeighborNet method implemented in SplitsTree ver. 4.10 [39] .\n\nFor imprinted snoRNA gene family classification, BLAST search was first conducted to identify homologs to know human or rodents imprinted snoRNA genes, the cutoff is set to 10 −3 . Nevertheless, due to algorithmic characteristics and sensitivity constraint, this classification method will lead to ambiguities when dealing with the species that are distantly related to the reference. In addition, the genomes of some species were poorly assembled, e.g. the elephant and the tenrec genome, which could not provide accurate gene mapping information to validate the classification results. Thus, phylogenetic methods were further exploited to classify imprinted snoRNA candidates into known gene families. For this purpose, phylogenetic trees containing imprinted snoRNA candidates of each species were constructed with the human imprinted snoRNA genes as the reference for family classification. The threshold value of branch support for the assignment of a candidate to known gene families was >50%. The phylogenetic trees were constructed with MrBayes ver. 3.1 [36] with a HKY+G model.\n\nTwo independent strategies were employed to search imprinted snoRNA candidates in the PWS loci: (1) The comparative genomics identification strategy with WGAs was performed as described in Yang et al. [35] . (2) The single-genome strategy was performed by searching the PWS homologous regions with snoSeeker program ( http://202.116.74.192/snoSeeker/downloads.php ) under the cutoff value of >24.0. The non-redundant candidates from these two strategies were combined for further gene family classification. The sequences of non-imprinted snoRNA genes of 15 vertebrates (with the addition of opossums, platypus and chicken) were identified from the WGAs of human and each of other species as described in Yang et al. [35] . All identified imprinted and non-impritned snoRNA gene sequences were provided in the Data S1 .\n\nThe genome sequences and related whole genome alignments (WGAs) of 12 placental mammals (Human, Chimp, Rhesus, Rat, Mouse, Dog, Cat, Horse, Cow, Armadillo, Tenrec and Elephant) were downloaded from the UCSC genome website ( http://genome.ucsc.edu/ and http://genome-test.cse.ucsc.edu/ ). These species represent all major lineages of extant placental mammals. The range of human PWS locus was identified by the gene pair of MKRN3 and ATP10A. The homologous region of PWS in other species was obtained using the “covert” tool of the UCSC genome website and the gene content was used as an index when the result of covert tool is poor. The information of PWS loci in different species is listed in Table S1 .\n\nResults\n\nIdentification and Characterization of Imprinted snoRNAs in the PWS Homologous Locus of 12 Eutherian Genomes Both single genomic and comparative genomic strategies were applied to identify imprinted snoRNA genes from 12 placental mammals to achieve high sensitivity and accuracy simultaneously (Table S1). To classify the snoRNA gene families, BLAST searches and phylogenetic analyses were combined to avoid the misassignment of individual gene members to known gene families. A total of 613 imprinted snoRNA genes were identified in the PWS homologous loci (the 15q11-q13 region of the human genome) of 12 eutherian genomes (Table 1, all snoRNA gene sequences were provided in Data S1). In general, primates and rodents have many more imprinted snoRNAs than other mammals, mainly reflected by the big volume of the HBII-52 and the HBII-85 multi-gene families. On average, primates have 77 PWS-related imprinted snoRNAs, rodents have 112, while Laurasiatheri and Xenarthra have only 17. The number of imprinted snoRNAs in elephants was comparable to that of primates. Certain gene families are missing from the ancestral lineages of placental mammals, such as Xenarthra and Afrotheria. For example, the HBII-85 gene family was missing from the tenrec genome, whereas HBII-52 was absent from the cow and the armadillo genomes. These observations may have two explanations: the first is due to the incomplete assembly of these genomes, the second one attributes to particular gene loss events occurred in these lineages. Conversely, extensive expansions of particular gene families have occurred in the mouse and elephant, leading to an excess of HBII-52 genes (130 and 70, respectively). The gene numbers of the multi-gene families (HBII-52 and HBII-85) predicted in this study were slightly lower than those of previous studies on the model species (e.g. human and mouse) [4], [5], [53]. It may attribute to the more stringent criteria for snoRNA identification used in the snoSeeker program [35].

Statistics of imprinted snoRNA genes in the PWS locus of mammalians. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0100329.t001 Based on the genomic location information of each snoRNA gene, we illustrated the precise distribution of the imprinted snoRNA genes in the PWS homologous loci of representative species (Figure 1). The size of the PWS imprinted snoRNA cluster was notably expanded in rodents. The cluster sizes of both mouse and rat were approximately two-fold that of the human. In both the rat and mouse genomes, the PWS-related snoRNA clusters were extended by the insertion of a long heterogeneous fragment containing no snoRNA genes. However, the insertion sites were different, occurring within the HBII-52 gene family in the rat genome and in the HBII-85 gene family in mouse. Interestingly, the size of the imprinted snoRNA cluster does not appear to determine the gene number. Despite similar cluster sizes, the dog has only 25% of the snoRNA genes presented in human. These results imply that the PWS imprinted snoRNA cluster is located in a highly active genomic region, a hot spot for chromosomal rearrangements and gene duplications as observed in other imprinted loci [54].\n\nPhylogenetic Analyses The phylogenetic network indicated that each gene families could form a single phylogenetic clade (Figure. S1). The phylogenetic relationship among the gene families exhibits consistence with their physical distribution in the chromosome. For example, HBII-436 and HBII-13, which are closely distributed in the locus, showed close phylogenetic relationship. Interestingly, the HBII-438 family, consisting of two gene members HBII-438A and HBII-438B, was separated by the large gene cluster of HBII-52 and HBII-85. This suggests these two gene cluster might origin from an insertion of ancestral gene(s) within the HBII-438 family and followed by extensive expansions [33]. Figure 2 shows the intra-family gene relationship of the HBII-52 and the HBII-85 family. A remarkable feature exhibited by the phylogenetic trees is that gene members from same species always form a single clade, especially in non-primates species, suggesting their close relationship. In primates, an intermixed pattern among species was observed, implying of a progressive evolutionary process of these gene families. This pattern was also suggested by the phylogenetic network shown in Figure S1. PPT PowerPoint slide\n\nPowerPoint slide PNG larger image\n\nlarger image TIFF original image Download: Figure 2.

Considering that their functional importance and gene volume, we focused this analysis on the two multi-gene families, HBII-52 and HBII-85. To estimate the gene number in ancestral species as well as gene gains and losses, we used the reconciled tree method [42]–[44], in which the topology of a gene tree is reconciled with that of a species tree. The analysis was based on the “Euarchontoglires tree” proposed by Murphy et al. [55], which suggested that primates and rodents are sister groups forming a clade named Euarchontoglires. Figure 3 summarizes the gene numbers estimated for each ancestral species and the associated changes along the different lineages. The numbers of PWS-related imprinted snoRNA genes were extremely low in ancestral organisms as compared with extant species. Interestingly, the evolutionary history of PWS-related snoRNA families is dominated by gene increases (Figure 3). In both the HBII-52 and HBII-85 families (Figure S2 and S3), most (55–98%) of the existing family members arose from lineage-specific gene gain events. In the human genome, 31 of the 41 HBII-52 genes were gained after the species diverged from chimpanzees; for the mouse, 127 of the 130 HBII-52 genes were gained after the species diverged from rats. In contrast, gene loss events were very rare. Similar results were observed for the HBII-85 cluster. Figure 3 provided an overview of the evolutionary dynamics of PWS-related imprinted snoRNA genes in mammals, which reflects the rapid gene turnover in these families. It also suggeststhat the extant genes in each species primarily arose through a lineage-specific gene gaining process occurring in each species’ recent history. This trend can also be intuitively inferred by their grouping patterns, i.e., gene members from the same species were always clustered together (Figure S1 and Figure 2). PPT PowerPoint slide\n\nPowerPoint slide PNG larger image\n\nlarger image TIFF original image Download: Figure 3. Gene numbers and changes in PWS-related imprinted snoRNA genes with respect to eutherian divergence. Numbers in black indicate the current gene number in each species, whereas red numbers indicate the ancestral gene number, blue numbers denote gained genes, and green numbers indicate lost genes. The major diversification events of eutherians are indicated on the timescale. MYA, a million years ago. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0100329.g003 Since the results suggest rapid intra-species gene expansion occurred during eutherian evolution, especially in primates and rodents, we want to ask how this happened. For this purpose, combined physical-phylogenetic maps of the HBII-52 and HBII-85 gene families in human and mouse were constructed to investigate gene duplication processes (Figure S4). There are several models proposed for gene duplication [56]. The tandem duplication model predicts a close phylogenetic relationship for physically neighboring genes. This pattern was observed in all the investigated gene families, i.e. HBII-52, HBII-85, MBII-52 and MBII-85. However, in the HBII-52 and MBII-52 family, a lot of physically distant genes show phylogenetic connections, which seems like the duplicated genes have jumped or trans-located from their original sites. This pattern could be explained with a ‘regional ectopic duplication’ model, which usually refers to duplication of individual or a small group of genes to an unlinked locus [57], [58]. The mechanism behind this may be recombination during the gametogenesis. These results also suggest different duplication processes were favored by different gene families. The tandem duplication plays a major role in the recent expansion of the HBII-85 and MBII-85 family; while the regional ectopic duplication dominates the expansion process of the HBII-52 and MBII-52 families. The birth-and-death model of gene evolution predicts the death of genes, or “gene degradation”. Consistent with this idea, we found pseudogenes in all species (Table S3, Figure S5). Gene degradation mainly occurs through the loss-of-function mutations that impair snoRNA processing or snoRNP formation, e.g., in the C/D boxes. Primates and rodents generally exhibit much lower pseudogene ratios than other species (Table S3). For example, in the HBII-52 family, the average pseudogene ratios were 0.138 and 0.158 for primates and rodents, respectively, but 0.667 for other species. This observations suggest that a trend toward gene expansion was favored in both primates and rodents and explains why these groups have more PWS-related imprinted snoRNA genes.",

It was first broadcast in Japan on October 14, 1997 and in the United States on October 15, 1998.\n\nSpoiler warning: this article may contain major plot or ending details.\n\nBlurb\n\nIn the outskirts of Fuchsia City, our heroes come across Hitmonchan, a fighter-Pokémon. With little thought, Ash attempts to capture it, but he and Pikachu are badly defeated. Hitmonchan's master has abandoned his family, training day and night, aiming for victory at the P1 Grand Prix (the number one Pokémon Grand Prix). His daughter tells Ash and his friends of her desire to make her father remember his family. In the meantime, Ash's party enters the P1 Grand Prix, but with Team Rockets unwanted, not to mention, unofficial presence at the competition, the battle goes out of control.\n\nPlot\n\nA Hitmonchan runs along a road and suddenly stops by a tree to punch the air, while a girl watches the Fighting-type from behind. Ash and his friends are amazed, but believe Hitmonchan is a wild Pokémon. Ash tells Pikachu that if he can defeat Hitmonchan, he will be a world champion Pokémon. When Pikachu doubts it, Ash says that he will teach Pikachu his secret punch, prompting Misty and Brock to question when Ash became a boxing expert.\n\nAsh challenges Hitmonchan, but Hitmonchan blocks Pikachu's efforts. Pikachu sends an improvised Rocket Punch into Hitmonchan's face, but it is unaffected. A man runs over, and tells Hitmonchan to not let his guard down, then tells him to knock Pikachu out, which it does. Suddenly, the girl runs out from behind the tree. She calls the man her father, and begs him to come home, and to give up trying to become a Trainer. The man tells his daughter, Rebecca, that he won't quit until he becomes the P1 Grand Prix champion. He then informs everyone that he will be at his Gym and leaves. At the Fighting Spirit Gym, Rebecca informs Ash and his friends about her fathers ambitions and that he has since abandoned his family. After Rebecca's pleas, Brock volunteers his and Ash's assistance, saying their Geodude and Primeape will defeat Anthony and his Hitmonchan.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Rocket gets wind of the Grand Prix as well and decide to enter. James and Meowth want to win for the all-you-can-eat buffet, but Jessie intends to go to the salon and embark on a shopping spree. However, James points out that only Fighting Pokémon can enter, but Jessie says that they will have to borrow one, pointing to a tall man and his Hitmonlee, which James identifies as the Kicking Fiend. As the P1 Grand Prix begins, Team Rocket have since stolen the man's Hitmonlee and clothes, keeping him tied and locked in a closet.\n\nAt the P1 Grand Prix, all the competitors are presented to the crowd. The first battle is between a Machop and Ash's Primeape. Despite Ash's pleas, Primeape refuses to listen, until Machop launches a Seismic Toss and sends Primeape out of the ring. Ash rushes to save it, but misses. He then asks his Pokémon if it is okay. Primeape gives Ash a sad look, then shakes it off and jumps back into the ring. Now listening to Ash, Primeape is able to take control and defeat the Machop with Scratch and Mega Kick.\n\nThe next match is Hitmonlee against Geodude. Brock waves to Rebecca, saying everything is under control. Suddenly, Rebecca tells him to look out, and Brock is hit in the head with his own Pokémon. He sends Geodude back into the ring, where it is kicked mercilessly. Anthony approaches, telling Brock that a real man knows when to admit defeat. Brock throws in the towel, and apologizes to Geodude for making it battle, and Team Rocket move onto the next round. Ash promises that he and Primeape will take care of the tournament from that point forward.\n\nAs more battles take place throughout the tournament, a Trainer and their Machoke who defeated a Poliwrath, Primeape, Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee rise to the top of the ladder. The next main match is between Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee. Jessie is ready for anything and to make sure they win. Hitmonchan steps on glue, a part of Meowth's scheme, and gets stuck. Anthony's Hitmonchan takes several Mega Kicks, and Rebecca attempts to stop the match. This forces Anthony to intervene, and he takes a hit and throws in the towel. Anthony says he is sorry he worried Rebecca and her mother. Misty says that the fighting brought a family back together. \"Giant\" then arrives to meet with Ash, though James' ill-timed appearance and response to Jessie causes them to realize it was Team Rocket in disguise. Jessie and James then try to recite their motto, although James, due to obvious strain from trying to carry Jessie, ends up collapsing beforehand.\n\nThen, the highly anticipated final battle between Ash's Primeape versus the stolen Hitmonlee takes place. Primeape blocks multiple rapid kicks from Hitmonlee and manages to sneak through a few hits. Under the arena Meowth tries to pull off another cheating move, but Pikachu spots him and decides to get moving. He finds that Meowth has planted a bomb on the stage.\n\nMeanwhile, back on the stage Hitmonlee jumps up, as per the plan, Meowth hits the button on the controls, but the bomb does not explode. Hitmonlee falls down, and Primeape grabs him. It uses its Seismic Toss and wins the match. Primeape has now become the new P1 Grand Prix Champion and proudly boasts its new championship belt. Ash says he is proud of Primeape. Anthony says it has a lot of natural talent, and offers to train it for Ash; he promises that he will make Primeape a true P1 Champion. Meanwhile, Meowth and the rest of Team Rocket are baffled as to why the bomb didn't explode. Pikachu then turns up and gives the bomb to Meowth, who thanks Pikachu for finding it.

When Pikachu handed the device to Meowth, there was no way for James or Jessie to get shocked, as there was no current.\n\nDub edits\n\nPokéRap: Day 4\n\nAsh's statement of Pikachu using an uppercut was actually supposed to be a right straight.\n\nA lot of paint edits were made in this episode. The sign outside the Gym, 闘魂ジム (Fighting Spirit Gym), was changed to \"Fighting Spirit\". A similar, yet reversed version happens in the interior of the Gym, where toukon (Fighting Spirit) is changed to \"Fighting Spirit Gym\". The \"P-1 Grand Prix\" text on the Banners are removed. Any and all banners saying 必勝 (Victory), ポケピタソ P (Pokédrink), がんばれ (Do Your Best!), ガンバレ(Do Your Best!), and ファイト (Fight!) are removed. However, a banner reading GOGO サワムラー (Go Go Hitmonlee) is left in the dub.\n\nTeam Rocket's desire for what they should get after winning the Belt were different between the original and dubbed version. In the original, Team Rocket mentioned wanting hamburg, curry, cake, ice cream, steak, spaghetti, and cola. In the dub, it was changed to honey-glazed ham, roast leg of lamb, strawberry jam, sirloin steaks, and chocolate cakes. On a related note, Jessie's original desire was to invite bishonen (pretty boys) over for okonomiyaki , whereas the dub just called them her close friends.\n\n(pretty boys) over for , whereas the dub just called them her close friends.

  "latent_9144": "Dozens of unaccompanied refugee children stranded in the French port town of Calais are giving up on ever reaching Britain, despite severe shortages of shelter and aid in the makeshift camp.\n\nAccording to the largest charity helping refugee children in the region, France Terre d’Asile, up to 35 unescorted minors have been turned away every day for the past three months because there are no beds for them in the emergency shelters.\n\nAnd since July, almost 95 percent of children who have come to the charity’s accommodation in the town of Saint Omer, a half-hour drive from Calais, seem to want to stay in France rather than travel onwards to the UK. Last year, only 15 percent of the roughly 1,500 registered refugee children traveling unaccompanied said the same.\n\nRead more\n\n“We do feel powerless,” the shelter’s director, Jean-Francois Roger, told the Guardian.\n\n“It is very hard psychologically for my colleagues who have to turn them away. It is difficult to explain to them why there are no places.\n\n“It will be worse when it gets colder, when there is water up to your knees in the camp.”\n\nEvery time a child is sent away France Terre d’Asile calls in the social services, but they too are stretched to breaking point. Many end up sleeping in tents back at the camp.\n\nRoger and his colleagues have been demanding more emergency beds from local authorities, but the political situation in France is not seen as being sympathetic towards refugees. The far-right Front National has an ever-bigger influence in the area.\n\n“A few things have happened that have persuaded children to stay,” Roger told the Guardian.\n\n“Since July, and the Brexit vote, the migrants are wondering what will happen to them if they turn up in Britain. We are not sure it is connected to Brexit, but there is a fear of what kind of welcome foreigners will have there now.”\n\nIn previous years, most of the children staying with Roger’s organization would return to Calais after a five-day break and attempt to cross the English Channel once more. But heightened security and the British-sponsored building of a four-meter high wall around the camp have made the children’s journey far more dangerous.\n\n“It is getting harder and harder to cross the frontier,” Roger added.\n\n“There is a bigger police presence, there are more checks, the barrier is bigger. It was always dangerous, but it is much more dangerous now for the children, and so they are forced to take much greater risks. It is also more dangerous in the camp in Calais itself. You have 10,000 people in a confined space and tensions are getting worse, and the children are more vulnerable.”\n\nCharities have also been actively discouraging children from attempting the illegal crossing, and are instead advising them to request asylum in France, where the process is often easier and swifter to complete.\n\nThe groups of unaccompanied children arriving in Calais are growing, with a census by the Help Refugees charity revealing almost 1,200 minors reached the camp in the last month. The youngest of them was just eight years old, and a staggering 87 percent of the children were alone.",

  "latent_9186": "Paleoanthropologists Alan Walker and Richard Leakey unearthed the Black Skull (KNM-WT 17000) in 1985 at the site of West Turkana, Kenya. The 2.5-million-year-old skull was darkened by manganese minerals in the soil where it was buried. Complete except for the crowns of its teeth, the skull appeared to match several isolated jaws and teeth previously found in East Africa. The fossils belong to the species Paranthropus aethiopicus—or Australopithecus aethiopicus, depending on who you ask. The species highlights the trouble of identifying parallel evolution, when species independently evolve similar traits, in the hominid fossil record.\n\nThe features of the Black Skull, and the related teeth and jaws, are striking. The species had massive molars and premolars, thick jaw bones and a large sagittal crest—a ridge of bone running lengthwise down the back of the skull where chewing muscles attach. All of these features align the species with the powerful masticator Paranthropus boisei, which lived in East Africa 2.3 million to 1.2 million years ago, and Paranthropus robustus, which lived in South Africa 1.8 million to 1.2 million years ago. Because of the Black Skull’s greater age, some anthropologists think it’s the ancestor of the younger P. boisei and P. robustus, and call the species Paranthropus aethiopicus. All three Paranthropus species are thought to form a dead-end side branch on the human family tree.\n\nThat’s one way to interpret the Black Skull. But other features complicate the picture.\n\nIn some ways, the Black Skull wasn’t at all like the other Paranthropus species and was instead more similar to the older, more primitive Australopithecus afarensis: It had a flat skull base, a shallow jaw joint, a protruding face and a small brain (410 cubic centimeters). In contrast, P. boisei and P. robustus had an angled skull base, a deep jaw joint, a flat face and a somewhat larger brain (500 to 545 cc)—all traits that they shared in common with early Homo. If P. boisei and P. robustus evolved from the more primitive P. aethiopicus, it means they share features with early Homo due to parallel evolution–that is, both lineages independently evolved similar cranial characteristics.\n\nIn the 1990s, Randall Skelton of the University of Montana and Henry McHenry of the University of California, Davis (one of my graduate school professors) came to a different conclusion regarding the similarities between Homo and Paranthropus. They suggested (PDF) that the two lineages actually inherited their shared features from a common ancestor, perhaps a species like South Africa’s Australopithecus africanus. In their opinion, P. aethiopicus was too primitive to be the ancestor. And in fact, the pair argued that parallel evolution, not common ancestry, explained all of the resemblances between the Black Skull and P. boisei and P. robustus; all three species must have had similar diets and therefore evolved similar chewing power. In this scenario, the Black Skull was an earlier offshoot of the Australopithecus lineage that left behind no descendants and should be called Australopithecus aethiopicus.\n\nSo, how did anthropologists come up with such different opinions about the Black Skull’s place in the human family? The answer comes down to how researchers construct their family trees, or phylogenies. The trees are made through a cladistic analysis, in which researchers, with the help of computers, group species based on the overall number of shared traits inherited through common ancestors. Different trees can arise for a number of reasons, such as how traits are interpreted and defined. For example, should large molars, thick jaws and a big sagittal crest count as three traits or one large trait complex related to chewing?\n\nOver the years, anthropologists have constructed numerous trees that support both arguments, although the P. aethiopicus scenario appears to be the most favored as that species name is most commonly used. Regardless, the case of the Black Skull reminds us that sometimes looks can be deceiving, especially in the fossil record.",

It makes 3D integration for devices otherwise stuck in 2D — in terms of imaging and editing — seem more a certainty than a novelty.\n\nNo one understands this better than Microsoft. They’ve gone all in; 3D scanning, editing, presenting, and desktop environments are all within Microsoft’s sights. It’s new, it’s 3D, and it seems to be a focal point of Microsoft’s present and future feature model.\n\nWe show you what 3D features you can expect, starting with the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update.\n\nMicrosoft Creators Update\n\nThe Windows 10 Creators Update Microsoft Unveils the Windows 10 'Creators Update' Microsoft Unveils the Windows 10 'Creators Update' The Windows 10 Creators Update, as unveiled today by Microsoft, is free, packed full of features, and landing on your PC in \"early 2017\". Let's find out what it's all about... Read More , coming in Spring of 2017, is the main thrust of Microsoft’s quest for 3D. Since Windows 10 is Microsoft’s last version of Windows Windows 10 Is the Last Version of Windows. Ever. Windows 10 Is the Last Version of Windows. Ever. Microsoft is sick of you not upgrading, and has a solution: Windows 10 will be the final \"version\" of Windows. Ever. This could mean that you will never again have to buy Windows. Read More , they’re targeting major Windows updates to give existing users a fuller Windows experience and draw more users into the fold.\n\nThe Creators Update will be the first Windows 10 update to provide truly unique 3D desktop and accessory capabilities. This includes new updates to default programs, a larger attempt to integrate desktop and smartphone features, and a new powerhouse series of personal computers (its Surface Family) to back up these future capabilities.\n\nIt seems Microsoft’s plans for Windows aren’t random. In previous updates, Windows has allotted for better creative, gaming, and productive capabilities.\n\nThe Creators Update aims to put in place the basic software framework for default 3D imaging and editing, for free and for everyone with a Windows 10 PC.\n\nMicrosoft HoloLens\n\nOne of the most impressive recent advents of Microsoft is HoloLens, a VR headgear accessory which provides augmented reality for the user. Although most VR headsets are designed for gaming purposes, Microsoft’s focus is on VR’s ability to increase and enhance desktop productivity.\n\n“What if we could go further, what if we could go beyond the screen?” This has seemed to be Microsoft’s latest focus: giving users the ability to ingrain the real world into their daily PC routine 8 Real-World Uses for Microsoft HoloLens 8 Real-World Uses for Microsoft HoloLens Microsoft's HoloLens is cool, but what will you actually use it for? We run down the most exciting possibilities. Read More . This direction seems best not only for personal but collaborative efforts as well. In fact, corporate collaboration is Microsoft’s main focus behind its little known Surface Hub.\n\nMicrosoft’s appeal to the future of PCs as a borderless, screenless experience would change everything you know about daily computer use.\n\nHoloLens’ actual experience is a bit choppier and more clunky than their advertising video, but the thrust of their HoloLens experiment remains the same. A mixed reality, revolving around the concept of 3D space as an underused asset in PC use, does seem like a legitimate way to go for Microsoft.\n\nAs many monitors, as many TVs as you want, without the need of an actual physical display. The great thing is: this isn’t a fluke. Microsoft didn’t simply develop the HoloLens a unique, experimental phase. The HoloLens is, instead, a small but impressive part of their overall scheme to integrate 3D modeling, software, and art into the general Windows experience.\n\nWith the sheer amount of effort Microsoft is putting into desktop 3D modeling, it seems HoloLens is only the start of Microsoft’s VR venture.\n\n3D Camera Modeling & Application Integration\n\nReleased October 26, the following video blew me away. It depicts, in order, the following: a user taking a video of an object, using that video to create a 3D model of the object, the user then opening that 3D model on their personal desktop, and another user taking their own 3D model and using it as an interactive 3D presentation.\n\nThe possibilities of this kind of technology are exciting. More impressive, however, is the degree of accessibility Microsoft is aiming for. In the foreseeable future, and with the help of Microsoft’s Creators Update, users with camera phones will be able to create a 3D model of anything they wish.\n\nThat doesn’t just mean Windows mobile devices. Most phones will be able to use the new Windows capture 3D experience. Just look at Microsoft’s Megan Saunders demonstrate the ease and functionality of Microsoft’s latest 3D advent.\n\nYou heard that correctly: “Today I used HP’s Windows phone, the X3, but we envision this experience on any device.” This ability to not only use your smartphone’s camera as a 3D modeling device, but the ability to also morph, modify, and integrate 3D models into Microsoft’s proprietary software, creates a full circle of easy-to-use and widely available 3D integration on behalf of Microsoft.\n\nNote that this isn’t Microsoft’s first delve into 3D imaging: Kinect Fusion, a little known side-project of Microsoft, has allowed users to use their Xbox’s Kinect as a 3D imaging tool for years now.\n\nThis new project, using smartphone cameras as 3D imaging tools, may be a revamping of software tools typically used for the Kinect Fusion. The new name for this 3D modeling smartphone app? MobileFusion. With the advent of MobileFusion, Microsoft is reinventing 3D scanning.\n\nMobileFusion has the opportunity to become the first simple, widespread, and accessible 3D scanning application on the market, its only requirement being a camera phone.\n\n3D Paint: A Look of What’s to Come\n\nFor years, both Microsoft Paint and PowerPoint have stayed relatively the same: simple software meant to serve a simple purpose. With the latest Creators Update, however, they will undergo some changes.\n\nPaint, the graphic design and illustration tool everyone loves to hate, has gone from a Windows novelty to an integral part of the general Microsoft 3D schema. With the novel ability to create 3D models from camera video, the rebranded Paint 3D 11+ New Features Coming to Windows 10 in 2017 11+ New Features Coming to Windows 10 in 2017 The Windows 10 Creators Update is due in Spring 2017.

Read More will become the de facto 3D modeling software for users in a similar way that Paint became the de facto graphic editor in Windows.\n\nThis isn’t accidental, either. Having used Paint 3D myself, it seems uniquely designed for those without prior knowledge of conventional 3D modeling software like Blender or Wings 3D.\n\nNo doubt, a tendency towards 3D drawing and modeling isn’t uniquely Microsoft-esque. Google has also created an outstanding and very popular 3D sketch software Tilt Brush compatible with the HTC Vive. This not only makes use of 3D paintings but VR as well, creating a truly unique and limitless venue for artists worldwide.\n\nThe venture into virtual 3D sculpture and sketching is something only a select individuals and companies have dipped their toes in. It’s no question Paint 3D will have a place in the hearts of burgeoning VR animators everywhere.\n\nWith Paint 3D, Microsoft is doing something that’s difficult to put into numbers: instilling curiosity in the average user for 3D creation and editing, and providing a venue to satisfy that curiosity.\n\n3D PowerPoint\n\nIf you think it stopped at Paint, however, you’re mistaken. Microsoft has also announced 3D integration for the renown presentation application PowerPoint. How would PowerPoint benefit from 3D integration? The devil is in the details.\n\n3D drawing and sketching is great, but easy and convenient 3D presentation is a game changer. Whereas before, 3D presentation was a complex cluster of 3D image and video editing, now users can simply insert and animate informative 3D models into their 2D presentations 5 Creative Uses Of PowerPoint Presentations You Haven't Explored Yet 5 Creative Uses Of PowerPoint Presentations You Haven't Explored Yet Microsoft PowerPoint can do much more than boring presentations. It’s PowerPoint 2013’s time now and the search for creative and uncommon uses of PowerPoint continues. Here are five. Read More .\n\nThis not only allows users to learn more about their subject, it also makes presentations interactive. Better yet, it makes this interactive type of presentation accessible to even the most casual of users. Remember, one of the great things about Microsoft’s quest for 3D isn’t the solo endeavor. It’s the fact that 3D models, content created by individuals, will be easily accessible to the public as well!\n\nWill this create a spring-board for a unique, Microsoft Office 3D suite? Perhaps (and it’s a stretch) holographic 3D communication with the help of VR? 3D counter-top demonstrations? Only time will tell.\n\nRemix 3D: A Three-Dimensional Community Hub\n\nWhereas before 3D models were rare due to the level of proficiency and tools needed to create them, it’s safe to say there will be a boom in 3D model creation and manipulation in the immediate future. That’s where Remix 3D comes into play. As much as 3D hardware and software often gets center stage, Microsoft doesn’t get enough credit in trying to integrate a community atmosphere to their 3D endeavor.\n\nCurrently in its developing stages, Remix 3D is an online platform where users can create, collaborate, and share their 3D creations with the world.\n\nImpressive as that is, that’s not what puts the remix in Remix 3D. Click on the Remix in Paint 3D button, and it will take you to your Paint 3D software where you can edit whatever 3D model you were previously viewing.\n\nFor some of you, this is just another 3D modeling software. For others like me, this is a great and strangely accessible venue into the future of 3D graphic art and design.\n\nIf nothing else, Remix 3D shows Microsoft’s belief in an open-source community devoted to 3D imaging.\n\nThe Revolution Will Not Be 2D!\n\nCall me a fanboy, but I am truly impressed by Microsoft’s approach to this new 3D environment. Note that not all items presented here are available for commercial use yet.

  "latent_10144": "Finally the brightness of summer is on its way. (We were getting worried for a while there; the Game of Thrones ads seemed ominously correct.) Now, for the harsh reality: you’ve had plenty of time during the last five months of gray to forget where you left your last set of sunglasses. If you’re in need of a new pair, the beloved aviator style, made popular by U.S. test pilots, and later, U.S. servicemen of all types during WWII, is always a standout choice.\n\nThe style’s popularity has endured for a reason. Aviators are as versatile a frame as you’ll find, pairing just as well with a suit as with board shorts. But while we love the original, it’s nice to stand out from the well-tanned crowd, too. We’ve picked out five alternative takes — each of which maintains the style and heritage of the classic aviator at a reasonable price tag — for your consideration this summer. Make a promise to yourself to keep track of them. Convinced? Read on.\n\nRay-Ban Folding Aviator\n\nBest New Twist on the Classic Aviator: Ray-Ban is considered the father of the Aviator frame — they were, after all, the company that released them to the public in 1937. The lenses have improved, the colors have gotten crazier, but the frame has stayed the same quintessential shape for over 70 years. This version brings the ability to fold your aviators up to the size of only one lens, making them perfectly convenient to toss into your pocket at the start of a cloudy day, just in case. If these existed in the ’60s, we’d bet McQueen would’ve had a pair on his bureau next to his folding Persols.\n\nRaen Lomis\n\nBest Aviator for the Price: The Raen Lomis takes the Aviator shape and remakes it in Italian Acetate, giving the sunglasses a more substantial look than the traditional wire frames — and making a more substantial statement when worn (we recommend channeling Rick Ross for optimal swagger). Offered in six different colorways, there’s a frame to complement any style. The kicker? Each pair has Carl Zeiss lenses with 100% UVA/UVB protection, and the $137 option is the cheapest polarized set on our list.\n\nPolarization: What the Hell is it? Quick science lesson for you. Light travels in waves. For reasons we won’t get in to, reflected light (which causes that glare we all hate so much) is horizontally polarized. Sunglasses with polarization filters block out all horizontal light waves, only allowing vertical waves to enter. Much like only letting your friends into the bar and leaving those unbuttoned-shirt douchebags out in the cold, this creates a good result: namely, cutting out much of the harsh light that hurts our eyes. Sure, it means a higher price tag, but when you’re trying to see the road, the trail or the hot girl tanning herself across the beach, they’re worth the premium.\n\nVon Zipper Decco\n\nBest Sports Aviator: Von Zipper is all about making cool looking shades for guys who get out and do stuff (usually crazy stuff involving boards, bikes, and/or big air). But even if you’re not shredding at Jaws, you can still look the part with the Decco. Its sporty, wrap-around Polycarbonate frame can take all the abuse you’ll throw at it and blocks sun and glare from all angles (especially the more expensive polarized option). It’s also affordably priced, a big plus, especially if you’re the guy who loses sunglasses every few months. Ahem.\n\nOakley Plaintiff\n\nBest Die-Hard Aviator: The Oakley Plaintiff holds true to the brand’s typical focus on (over)engineering. The frames are built from ultra-light hi-modulus C5 metal with titanium Mono-Shock hinges. In English, that means the hinges let the stems flex without mangling the frames, saving you big money next time you snag them on your t-shirt and rip ’em off your face. The lenses are polarized and protect against harmful UVA/UVB/UVC waves. Like all Oakley sunglasses, the Plaintiff is made in the U.S.; call us homers, but that’s a big plus. If you want a subtle twist and performance upgrade to the traditional Aviator, the Plaintiff is your frame.\n\nOliver Peoples TheSoloIst Teardrop\n\nBest Aviator for the Global Citizen: Though they’re technically a few seasons old at this point (they were originally launched in 2012), the vintage-inspired aesthetics of these finely crafted frames should never go out of style, wherever home happens to be for you at the moment. This particular set was one of the first two pairs to emerge from a collaboration between Oliver Peoples and renowned Japanese designer Takahiro Miyashita’s latest label, TheSoloIst. Lucky you for, the style is still available in four colors with polarized glass lenses. They’re classic, but also still on the cutting edge of global fashion — which in today’s jet setting is always a good thing.\n\nBonus: SUPER 49er Square Aviator\n\nBest Bold Aviator: The SUPER 49er stacks futuristic (Acetate upper) directly on top of classic (hand-crafted Italian wire frames) to create the most, well, unique look on this list. For the price tag, we wish polarized lenses were at least an option, if not standard; that aside, the 49er is the type of frame that will draw plenty of jealousy from your friends and admiring looks from the right kind of people.",
  "latent_10187": "eight.png\n\n(NFL game film)\n\nDETROIT -- Through seven weeks, the Lions were getting off the field on third down just 52 percent of the time. Which meant nobody was worse at getting off the field on third down. Nobody. But the last four weeks, they've slashed that figure all the way to 33 percent. And they were especially good on Thanksgiving, holding Minnesota without a conversion until the third quarter and just 2 of 10 for the game. So what's changed? A lot, obviously. Josh Bynes has replaced Kyle Van Noy at linebacker (and is playing much better). Ezekiel Ansah is getting healthier. But\n\nhas helped as much as anything. The rookie out of Southern Utah didn't play much to open the season -- just two snaps the first three weeks -- but has become a staple as a third safety in Detroit's third-down package the last couple weeks. He played 12 snaps against Jacksonville, all on third down, and finished with a team-high five tackles. All but one forced a punt. That's exceptionally efficient work -- and then he did the same thing on Thanksgiving against the Vikings. He played just nine defensive snaps, but made four tackles, three of which forced punts. The numbers were so impressive, I decided to look at each of those third downs against Minnesota to get a feel for how Detroit is using Killebrew. The answer: Pretty much everywhere. He lined up at linebacker, on the line and even at defensive back. But more than anything, it seemed he was tasked with matching up with tight end Kyle Rudolph (and the occasional back leaking out of the backfield). And Killebrew was excellent. In fact, none of his assignments achieved a first down. Here's a closer look at what I saw. (And feel free to scroll to the bottom if you're just looking for the conclusions.)\n\nSituation:\n\nThird-and-3 at DET 27\n\nPlay:\n\n(3:00 - 1st) (Shotgun) S.Bradford pass incomplete short left to K.Rudolph [E.Ansah] (no play)\n\nKillebrew:\n\nThe play didn't count because of a holding penalty on Nevin Lawson, but let's take a look anyway because it typifies what we'll see the rest of the day from Killebrew. He lines up in a de facto linebacker position and is matched up with Rudolph in man to man coverage. Rudolph dropped the pass, but would have been tackled short of the sticks even if he made the play. This was good coverage by Killebrew.\n\n*****\n\nSituation:\n\nThird-and-8 at DET 20\n\nPlay:\n\n(2:10 - 1st) (Shotgun) S.Bradford pass short right intended for L.Treadwell INTERCEPTED by G.Quin (D.Slay) at DET 10. G.Quin pushed ob at MIN 19 for 71 yards (M.Asiata). PENALTY on DET-D.Slay, Defensive Pass Interference, 5 yards, enforced at DET 20 - No Play\n\nKillebrew:\n\nAgain, the play didn't count because of a penalty. But again, Killebrew executed his assignment to perfection. He tracked Rudolph as the tight end motioned from right to left before the snap, then smothered him on a little out route. QB Sam Bradford went the other way to Laquon Treadwell.\n\n*****\n\nSituation:\n\nThird-and-8 at MIN 14\n\nPlay:\n\n(10:32 - 2nd) (Shotgun) S.Bradford pass short left to M.Asiata to MIN 20 for 6 yards (T.Whitehead)\n\nKillebrew:\n\nThis time Rudolph splits out wide on the left side of the offensive formation. Killebrew showed some versatility by lining up across from him, and again blanketing him. Bradford goes underneath to Asiata instead, and Tahir Whitehead drops him well short of the sticks.\n\n*****\n\nSituation:\n\nThird-and-9 at DET 48\n\nPlay:\n\n(4:30 - 2nd) (Shotgun) S.Bradford pass short left to A.Thielen to DET 41 for 7 yards (T.Whitehead)\n\nKillebrew:\n\nRudolph isn't on the field this time, so Killebrew drops back into zone coverage. He helps Nevin Lawson in coverage, and appears to be responsible for Matt Asiata leaking out of the backfield as well. Bradford again goes the other way, and Thielen is taken down just short of the sticks by Whitehead.\n\n*****\n\nSituation:\n\nThird-and-14 at MIN 45\n\nPlay:\n\n(1:20 - 2nd) (Shotgun) S.Bradford pass short left to K.Rudolph to 50 for 5 yards (M.Killebrew)\n\nKillebrew:\n\nHe lines up at a traditional linebacker spot, but appears to be assigned to Rudolph again. Rudolph gets the ball this time too, Killebrew closes quickly for the easy tackle well short of the first-down marker.\n\nBelow, this is a look at where Killebrew was when Rudolph caught the ball. He's in outstanding position for the tackle.\n\n*****\n\nSituation:\n\nThird-and-9 at MIN 36\n\nPlay:\n\n(12:47 - 3rd) (Shotgun) S.Bradford pass short left to J.McKinnon to MIN 38 for 2 yards (M.Killebrew)\n\nKillebrew:\n\nKillebrew appears to be working in a zone again, and passes off Rudolph to the defensive backs behind him. Bradford passes to McKinnon, and Killebrew is in good position -- once again -- to close quickly for the tackle short of the sticks.\n\n*****\n\nSituation:\n\nThird-and-5 at DET 15\n\nPlay:\n\n(7:50 - 3rd) (Shotgun) S.Bradford pass short middle to M.Asiata to DET 12 for 3 yards (M.Killebrew)\n\nKillebrew:\n\nKillebrew was assigned to Asiata leaking out of the backfield, and for the third straight time on third down, makes the tackle to force a punt. Good reads, sound tackling.\n\n*****\n\nSituation:\n\nThird-and-7 at MIN 30\n\nPlay:\n\n(3:14 - 3rd) (Shotgun) S.Bradford pass short left to C.Patterson to MIN 40 for 10 yards (M.Killebrew)\n\nKillebrew:\n\nHe's back in man coverage on Rudolph, who runs a slant from the right side of the formation to the middle of the field. Killebrew's all over it, so Bradford hits Patterson on a deeper route instead along the left sideline. But Killebrew still manages to be part of the play anyway, hustling from the hash to the sideline to drop Patterson after Nevin Lawson overpursued on a would-be tackle.\n\nBelow, this is the moment Bradford threw the ball. Notice Killebrew's tight coverage on Rudolph, and how far he had to run to tackle Patterson.\n\n*****\n\nSituation:\n\nThird-and-goal at DET 16\n\nPlay:\n\n(13:21 - 4th) (Shotgun) S.Bradford pass short middle to K.Rudolph to DET 10 for 6 yards (T.Whitehead)\n\nKillebrew:\n\nDrops back into coverage near the end zone, and wasn't involved in the play.\n\n*****\n\nConclusions:\n\nKillebrew has become a regular on Detroit's third-down defense, and it's easy to see why. He has the versatility to operate like an extra linebacker, but does so with more speed than your average linebacker. And Detroit has used that speed to help fortify its weakness against the tight end. That position was killing the Lions earlier in the year, and even Killebrew too. But he's gotten better, and against Minnesota, he neutralized a really good one in Kyle Rudolph. Minnesota converted only one third down with Killebrew on the field, and did so by targeting Nevin Lawson. Then Killebrew made that tackle, too. Of course, it helped Detroit got Minnesota into so many third-and-longs too. Killebrew's third downs were from 8, 14, 9, 5, 7 and 16 yards (plus the third-and-3 and third-and-8 that were nullified by penalty). When the Vikings got into a third-and-short, the Lions subbed Killebrew with Brandon Copeland for a bigger, more physical look. But this three-safety package was lights out, and I would expect to see more of it this week when Detroit travels to New Orleans to take on a Saints offense that just hung 49 points on Los Angeles. Their tight ends, Josh Hill and Coby Fleener, combined for 10 catches (on 10 targets) and 133 yards. The key to stopping them? It could be Killebrew, at least on third down.",
  "latent_10189": "Should FOW bring the EU bans to the United States? (J-ruler.net Guest Article)\n\nShould Force of Will bring the EU bans to the United States (and the rest of the world)? The short answer is “yes.” While I’m certain that you’ve either nodded your head in agreement with that statement or thrown me the middle finger through your screen, the fact remains that banning Pricia, True Beastmaster, Griphon Racing Across Darkness, and Captain Hook, the Pirate is vital. Issues such as game balance, uniformity, and other secondary concerns could unhinge the game if not properly cared for. It is imperative that Force of Will Co., Ltd. quickly implement these card bans across the world for the reasons I will now enumerate. With each of these arguments I will address popular counter arguments and rebut them. Let’s dive in.\n\nGame Balance\n\nThe Nine-Tailed Fox, an Object Lesson\n\nShould It Have Been Griphon or Demonic Dead?\n\nWhat About Pricia and Captain Hook?\n\nShould any Other Cards Have Been Banned?\n\nUniformity\n\nThe Real Customers of Force of Will\n\nBring the EU Bans to the US\n\nRelated\n\nThe single most salient factor in this card banning disucssion is that of game balance. Ideally, the designers of a trading card game aim for a play environment that is not lopsided toward any one strategy. While a handful of strategies are likely to emerge as dominant, it is undesirable from the point of view of a balanced game to have just one or two “top decks” that cannot be consistently beaten by other strategies. (This, of course, assumes an equal skill level on part of the participants and issue we shall address shortly.) If a trading card is to be balanced,printed (or in the current format, at least) must be equilibrated in terms of resource cost and effect. This means that if evencard breaks this cost:blanace ratio, it contributes to a possibly dominant and unbeatable strategy.To illustrate the compounding problems of unbalanced cards, let’s consider the ruler everyone loves to hate:The ruler itself is plenty powerful. Pulling resonators from your side deck is a useful ability in anyone’s book. And certainly so if the resonators you can reach for are some of the beefiest in the format. Sure, you have to make sacrifices to useeffect. But is the cost really balanced with the effect. It certainly is not in terms ofLook at this way: you sacrifice two “ingredient” resonators and a killing stone for a 1200/1200 flying resonator that nets you two magic stones. In this equation, you trade two resonators and a magic stone for another resonator and two magic stones. This puts you one turn ahead in terms of resource production. (And possibly two turns ahead, because if you’re smart, you already spent the will from the Killing Stone you sacrifice to Fox’s effect.)EnterWith this resonator in your graveyard, you essentially halve the resonator cost of Fox’s effect (since you can bring Demonic Dead into your field again and again to use as one of your “ingredients”.) So now, the equation looks like this: sacrifice one resonator and one Killing Stone for a resonator and two magic stones. Start to see a problem? Add to this that this deck has the attributes to access cards like Severing Winds and Faerur’s Spell with 100% consistency in terms of will production and you have yourself a statistically unbeatable deck. That’s a problem.With the scenario that I’ve just illustrated, an argument could be made for either Griphon, Racing Across Darkness or Demonic Dead as being the major problem in the Fox equation. Which one should have received the ban? While many will disagree with me, I think it would have worked just as well either way. With Griphon gone, the player cannot out-ramp the opponent to victory. If Demonic Dead were banned, the player could not so easily access Griphon (or the other Chimeras.) Either way, Griphon is the card that gets stopped or slowed down.Pricia, True Beastmaster is just plain broken. No one,in their right mind would say that a 1000/1000 body that recycles fresh magic stones when it enters the field or attacks for a total cost ofis balanced. No one in their right mind would say that a card that could OTK for four will is balanced. Pricia had to go. She was the most poorly designed card in all of Lapis Cluster, and we’re not sorry to see her hit the bricks.Captain Hook, the Pirate was banned because in the absence of The Nine-Tailed Fox and Pricia, True Beastmaster, Lumia, the Fated Rebirth becomes the dominant, unbeatable deck. The Lumia player can re-trigger Captain Hook’s effect over and over again, wiping the opponent’s magic stones and locking them out of the game. While this is true in theory, it can be difficult in practice. I’m not convinced that banning Captain Hook was necessary. While we lost some counters to this card when Alice Cluster rotated out of New Frontiers (I’m looking at you Prison in the Lunar Lake), we’ve gained access to several more. Consider Dawn of the Earth, Keez’s Call, and the infamous Abdul Alhazred, Poet of Madness. I think they could have held off on the Captain Hook ban until it could be conclusively proven to be a major problem. But overall, it’s not a move that I think will upset the balance of the game, cripple Lumia in any meaningful way, or turn players off.Severing Winds should have also seen the ax. While the effect is a good and possibly even necessary one at it’s core, the card is too lopsided on the effect side of the cost:effect ratio. If Severing Winds only reduced its cost by [2] instead of WW[2] if your opponent had played two or more spells, or perhaps gave your opponent 1,000 life points or some such, it would have been well designed. But this card has proved a menace and a game-stopper. No card should be so pervasive as to totally alter the structure of play for fear of its presence. I recall having stated in a previous article/video that I thought that Severing Winds was balanced . But let me admit here to all of you that I’ve come to change my mind on this card.Another major issue with the EU card bans is uniformity. It’s improper to have a trading card game that has different rules for different regions. All regions of the world, under the banner of a single game, should follow the same rules. Period. All regions of the world play in local and regional events to work their way toward a single objective in terms of competitive play: the World Grand Prix. That WGP will play by a single set of rules that should also be consistent with the rules used and implemented by the various regions. What sense does it make to have some cards banned in the EU and not elsewhere? Force of Will Co., Ltd. has done something like this before with the Wanderer format. The cards that are now banned (worldwide, mind you) in Wanderer were once only banned in that format in Europe. The company used Europe as a sort of testing ground, and when satisfied with the results, implemented the bans elsewhere. This desire to take a careful and deliberate approach to card bans in commendable. But that’s what your R&D team is for. Keep the testing in house, take your time, carefully consider and debate the issues, and when the time comes, announce a worldwide ban, errata, un-ban, or rules change. This makes the company look more professional and capable. The last thing this game needs is a slap-happy, fly-by-the-seat-of-their-pants approach to something as major as card bans.The most frequent counter argument to banning any card goes a little something like this: “Get gud scrub!” “lol you just mad cuz you suck” “Build a better deck, n00b” etc. etc. These statements are bullshit. If the cards being banned are so mathematically superior to other cards in print, or their interactions with certain other cards are so intrinsically powerful that other cards or card interactions cannot counter them, then where is no conceivable way that you can “get gud” or not “suck.” Think of it this way: I get a semi-automatic 12-gauge shotgun and you get a baseball bat. We’re expected to fight to the death. If you complain that my armaments are “superior” and “unbeatable” in our current meta, my reply is to “get gud” and stop complaining. If you can’t win, it’s because you haven’t tried hard enough. Could you beat me? Sure. It is likely. Not at all. What these “arguments” tend to forget (or fail to mention) is that the typical trading card game player is not a competitive player. The typical Force of Will player has never been to a Grand Prix. And probably will never go to one. The typical player doesn’t spend six hours a day (or even six hours a week) playing the game. And while you might label these people (including perhaps your dear author) a “n00b” and a “scrub,” they as a group spend the most money on the game. For every Top-8 GP contender there are tens of thousands of average players. These are the real audience for the game. While card bans might piss off a few people at the top of the pecking order, they aim to ameliorate the concerns of the masses. If a few top players end up quitting over a round of bans, so be it. Others will take their place and the game will be healthier overall for it. The company knows this (or has learned this over time) and is no longer catering to the top-level while ignoring the true economic powerhouse behind the game: the casuals.Should the company bring the EU bans to the US? Yes. Yes. And YES. For the reasons I’ve given hear and for those many that I’m sure to have overlooked. Let me close by again saying that in a perfect world, there would be no reason for card bans. Each and every card would be designed in such a way as to make their cost:effect ratio perfectly balanced. Not only perfectly balanced in and of themselves, but in relation to every other card in print. (A feat that by definition becomes geometrically more difficult to more cards are printed.) We don’t live in that perfect world. And we never will. Card bans are a necessary part of trading card games. Mistakes happen. I look forward to seeing the recent round of card bans implemented very soon worldwide and the attendance numbers at the local stores in my area increase.",

  "latent_10433": "An experimental, minimalistic microgame about loneliness, made for the Korean middle school students I taught for a year.\n\nLoneliness was an official selection of the Extra Credits Innovation Awards 2011, in the category of Narrative Delivery. It was also the focus of episode 25 of Extra Credits season 4: Mechanics as Metaphor.\n\nIn 2012 Loneliness was featured in CURA.\n\nDiscussion and Reactions: Ludum Dare, Notgames Forums, TIGForums, FlashPunk Forums, Newgrounds, Kongregate, Twitter, IndieGames.com.\n\nSome kind words:\n\nAffected me the first time, and even more strongly the second (Gregory Weir, creator of Necropolis and The Majesty of Colors).\n\nWhat’s amazing about it is that it undeniably has a narrative, even though it features no words… but what’s more incredible to me is how different that narrative can be for different people… This game not only tries to put us in the emotional state of that crushing loneliness… but it lets us explore it, and this to me is the unique power games have (James Portnow, co-creator of the Extra Credits video lesson series).\n\nMade me really really really really really really really really really sad inside (Elspeth, NG Comments).\n\nWorth every second (PlayIndieGames.Wordpress.com).\n\nI can’t say that this game makes me feel particularly lonely, or particularly sad. But what it does do (very well, I think), is force me to make a decision: will I continue to engage, even though I KNOW it’s fruitless, or will I give up? And that question, I think, is profound. Because that IS what loneliness feels like: a never ending pattern of rejection. A hopeless state which will not change. And the only choices are to despair (to move, alone, into the dark), or to continue to pour out energy in what we believe (what we feel we KNOW) to be a pointless endeavor. What I loved about the game was that it demonstrated that, despite my knowledge of futility, I couldn’t choose isolation (AmelMag, NG Comments).\n\nOn the flip side:\n\nYe gods, it’s not emo sixth form poetry these days is it, it’s dreadful indie games (Kate S, Twitter).\n\nSo grauenhaft wie das und seine anderen Spiele programmiert sind, glaube ich eher dass er diese \"schlichte\" Aufmachung leider nur wählt weil er es nicht besser kann (Besucher2778, Spreeblick.com).\n\nThe meta-game reason for it aside; it does have nice music and visuals, but you can’t use ‘minimalist’ as an excuse for not having any real content. There’d be many ways to take some time and actually give it a point beyond the meta-game point to it. Games can have meanings and messages beyond just being a ‘game,’ but a game must have some sort of rules and goals to it to fulfill its primary purpose as a game. Without that, it doesn’t matter the reasoning or point to it, it’ll just be dull (Pyrewraith, Kongregate).\n\nLame as fuck (Greg, IndieGames.com comments).\n\nFind a bug? Please let me know.",
  "latent_10463": "Fonterra Brands, the New Zealand-based dairy cooperative, built a thriving food service business with an igniting boost from a blank check. This powerful device shouldn’t be used to give a one-shot boost to earnings. The point is to create sustainable, profitable growth, growth that will build on itself. Before company leaders sign the blank cheque, the team receiving it has to come up with a business model that shows genuine promise.And once the cheque is signed, leaders need to monitor progress closely. If milestones aren’t met after a certain point, turn off the spigot, learn from the failure. But blank cheques succeed far more often than they fail. Team managers feel the pressure of the faith placed in them. And they feel as if they own the project.Where does the money to fund the blank cheque come from? Every business has operations that lag or move inefficiently. Those need to be trimmed or cut to channel resources to the blank cheque. That means company leaders have to make some tough decisions about priorities. But leaders do that all the time. The blank cheque should provide the momentum to be particularly aggressive about it. Savings can help fund the cheques.Once the Cadbury blank cheque team recovered from the shock of its huge new target, the members got to work on a plan. Given the short time frame, team members decided to double down on Cadbury’s strongest asset in India, the Dairy Milk chocolate bar.The team knew that the best sales came in retail outlets that displayed Dairy Milk in so-called visi coolers, refrigerated glass cases that showcased the candy and kept it from melting in the summer heat.So the blank cheque underwrote an increase in locations with visi coolers from 20,000 to 40,000. At the same time, the team raised the visibility of Dairy Milk, doubling the number of in-store displays from 5,000 to 10,000 and expanding distribution into 2,100 additional towns and villages.The budget for advertising and promotions jumped by 45 per cent. Perhaps most important, that frightening new goal forced the Cadbury blank cheque team to re-evaluate the positioning of Dairy Milk.The team moved Dairy Milk from competing in the category of chocolates into the larger market of sweets in general, in the process expanding the occasions when consumers would reach for a Dairy Milk bar.The overall results beat expectations. Cadbury in India hit the $500 million target ahead of schedule, making the year the unit’s best ever, with almost 28% revenue growth. Things went so well that the team even returned some of the blank cheque allocation. And the success has legs. Cadbury in India continued to perform well.

  "latent_10484": "Getty Images\n\nPanthers quarterback Cam Newton said after Sunday night’s loss in Seattle that he was benched for the first series because he didn’t wear a tie while traveling, which coach Ron Rivera requires of every player.\n\n“It came down to a dress code matter,” Newton said. “I didn’t follow dress code and coach told me I wasn’t going to start. I stand by his decision. His position he’s in, I follow it.”\n\nThe Panthers played at Oakland last week and did not travel home, choosing instead to practice on the West Coast for the week before the game at Seattle. Newton said he ordinarily has proper attire for traveling, but he sent his traveling clothes off when the team shipped its gear from Oakland to Seattle and found himself without anything to wear that would conform to Rivera’s dress code.\n\n“We’ve been in California for a week and we shipped our clothes off, so that was the big no-no. But we didn’t lose this game because I didn’t have a tie,” Newton said.\n\nDoes it make sense to bench the starting quarterback because he didn’t have his clothes due to a travel mishap? Newton said he understood Rivera’s position, although his explanation of it was hard to follow.\n\n“If coach didn’t feel like I was dressed appropriately then I wasn’t,” Newton said. “When you’re 6-foot-5, trying to get a shirt, I was away from home for a week, I didn’t pack a shirt. There were a lot of ties I was given but I can’t wear a tie with this. Meaning, I have a tank top on – we discussed it internally, me and coach, we got on the same page. I felt as if I wore a similar outfit like this before and nothing was done but he said he has rules in place and we have to abide by them. No person is better than the next person and it is what it is.”\n\nWhat it is, is one of the most bizarre coaching decisions in the history of the NFL. The league’s reigning Most Valuable Player was benched over his clothing.",

  "latent_10589": "Image caption Like all early computers Edsac filled the room in which it was located.\n\nThe first recognisably modern computer is to be rebuilt at the UK's former code-cracking centre Bletchley Park.\n\nThe Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (Edsac) was a room-sized behemoth built at Cambridge university that first ran in 1949.\n\nCreation of the replica has been commissioned by the UK's Computer Conservation Society (CCS).\n\nThe three-year re-build will be carried out before visitors to The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley.\n\nDigital help\n\nEdsac was one of several early British computers that pioneered the practical use of such machines.\n\nIt was conceived and created by Sir Maurice Wilkes as a machine that could carry out many different kinds of calculation for Cambridge researchers and scientists.\n\n\"Edsac was the first to go into regular service to help the people Sir Maurice saw in Cambridge, researchers struggling with computation using desk calculators,\" said Dr David Hartley, chairman of the CCS.\n\nImage caption The build of Edsac was led by Bill Renwick (l) and Maurice Wilkes.\n\nDuring its nine-year lifespan, Edsac helped two Cambridge researchers win a Nobel and aided many more try out approaches and get results impossible to even conceive without the machine.\n\nThe £250,000 cost of the re-build will be paid for from funds raised by a consortium led by entrepreneur Hermann Hauser. Dr Hartley said the project had been given the nod to proceed as the consortium has already received pledges to provide all the funds needed.\n\nThe early work of the re-build will involve scouring archives and talking to the remaining Edsac engineers to get a better idea of how the machine worked.\n\nRelatively few parts of the original machine remain, said Dr Hartley, though Cambridge university does have one chassis though it has largely been denuded of valves, a critical part of all early machines.\n\n\"We're building up a good picture of what it was like,\" he said. \"But there comes a point at which we have to guess what was in the designer's mind at the time.\"\n\nComputer conservationist Chris Burton, who was involved in re-creating the Manchester Mark I, is helping to source parts that can be used to build a faithful replica of the original.\n\n\"He's making contact with all sorts of suppliers and is optimistic that we will get there,\" said Dr Hartley.\n\nHowever, one part of the original Edsac that is unlikely to be re-created is the 1.5m (5 feet) long tubes of mercury used as a memory store. Modern health and safety regulations preclude the use of mercury, said Dr Hartley.\n\nHe added that experiments were already being carried out to use different materials to act as a \"delay line\" memory as in the original.",
  "latent_10649": "A marijuana plant is seen in Oakland, California July 23, 2009. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith\n\nHELENA, Mont (Reuters) - Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer on Wednesday vetoed a bill that would have repealed the state’s 7-year-old, voter-approved law legalizing marijuana for medical purposes.\n\nSchweitzer’s veto came as state lawmakers continued work on an alternative bill to tighten regulation of medical marijuana in the state, where 30,000 residents carry cards allowing them to lawfully use marijuana as treatment for one ailment or another.\n\nCritics of the law, approved as a ballot measure by voters in 2004, say the statute has been abused by some as a pretext for recreational pot smoking and even for illegal drug trade.\n\n“The good intentions of Montana voters has been made a mockery by the system that’s grown up in this state in the last year and a half,” said state Senator Jeff Essmann, a chief sponsor of the regulation bill.\n\nLast month, federal agents raided marijuana greenhouses and dispensaries in 13 cities across Montana in a crackdown that federal prosecutors said was aimed at supposed medical pot suppliers who were engaged in large-scale drug trafficking.\n\nAlthough cannabis is still considered an illegal narcotic under federal law, 15 states and the District of Columbia have statutes making marijuana legal for medical reasons, mostly in the West, according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.\n\nIn a shift from the Bush administration’s position on the subject, the administration of President Barack Obama said in October 2009 it would no longer prosecute patients who use medical marijuana, or dispensaries that distribute it, in states where marijuana has been approved for such purposes.\n\nBut the number of pot growers and storefront clinics has sprouted since then. And Justice Department officials say federal law enforcement will continue raids on illegal drug distribution operations wherever they are found.",
  "latent_10659": "The draft is over, but the dust hasn`t quite settled yet. Before we forget about the 8 new Maple Leafs to turn our attention to the trade market and free agency, let`s take a closer look at the players the Leafs drafted this weekend using Prospect Cohort Success %, which uses age, height, production, and league to award players a percent chance of reaching 200 NHL games played.\n\nMITCH MARNER\n\nPCS%: 80.0\n\nNHL PPG of Comparables: 0.88\n\nNotable Comparables: Steve Yzerman, Kyle Wellwood\n\nNo surprise here, but the 17-year-old OHL forward that put up 126 points in 63 games is considered to have a pretty good chance at reaching 200 NHL games played. Comparing to Kyle Wellwood isn`t what you`d like to see from a lottery pick, but comparing to Steve Yzerman is exciting to say the least. Marner is incredibly talented and the numbers back that up. All signs point towards Marner being a future NHL all-star.\n\nTRAVIS DERMOTT\n\nPCS%: 31.25\n\nNHL PPG of Comparables: 0.31\n\nNotable Comparables: Drew Doughty, Cam Fowler, Kevin Klein, Tim Gleason, Andre Benoit\n\n31.25% may seem like a big drop-off from Marner`s 80%, but it`s actually a very good PCS score and among the best CHLers in the draft. Basically, there`s a 1 in 3 chance Dermott reaches 200 NHL games played. Not bad for a 2nd-round pick.\n\nDermott has a wide range of comparables here. I certainly don`t think he`s going to be Drew Doughty and even Cam Fowler seems like wishful thinking. Klein, Gleason, and Benoit though have all had stretches in their career playing on an NHL team`s second pairing, and I`d suggest that`s Dermotts likeliest potential: as a two-way, second-pairing player.\n\nJEREMY BRACCO\n\nPCS%: 20.0\n\nNHL PPG of Comparables: 0.35\n\nNotable Comparables: Chad LaRose, Andy Hilbert\n\nKeep in mind that we`re using Bracco`s USHL numbers here, even though he played just 24 USHL games to 65 in the USDP this season. We`re using these numbers because it gives us a large sample of players to draw from (Bracco has just one comparable using his USDP numbers and a PCS% of 0).\n\nLaRose and Hilbert are the only two players of Bracco`s ten comparables here that reached 200 NHL games. Both LaRose and Hilbert had stretches in their NHL careers where they were effective third-line players. This doesn`t surprise me at all as someone who has watched Bracco play. I don`t feel comfortable saying he doesn`t have top-six upside because his numbers are just so good, but Bracco isn`t a very dynamic player and if he were to reach the NHL I wouldn`t be surprised if it was as a bottom-six player as opposed to a top-six one.\n\nANDREW NIELSEN\n\nPCS%: 18.06\n\nNHL PPG of Comparables: 0.20\n\nNotable Comparables: Brenden Dillon, Luke Schenn, Justin Falk, Keaton Ellerby\n\nYet again, no surprises. Nielsen is given a little less than a one in five chance of reaching 200 NHL games, which is just fine for a third-round pick. We also shouldn`t be surprised that a 6`3`WHL defenseman that put up 24 points and 101 penalty minutes in 59 games compares to real shutdown defensemen like Brenden Dillon and former Leaf Luke Schenn. Based on these numbers, Nielsen`s upside should probably be considered as a bottom-pairing defenseman but there could be an outside chance that he becomes a stay-at-home, second-pairing player.\n\nMARTINS DZIERKALS\n\nPCS%: 0.00\n\nNHL PPG of Comparables: 0.00\n\nNotable Comparables: Dmitri Zharikov, Alexander Kuznetsov\n\nWhoever Zharikov and Kuznetsov are, they come out as Dzierkals’ only comparables using this tool. This is why I don`t like using PCS as much for players playing outside North America. Dzierkals gets no comparables because he played in the MHL this season, and there`s just not a very big sample of players to drawn from based on history. If Dzierkals had played this past season in the CHL I can pretty much guarantee you we`d have a long list of comparables to draw from.\n\nWe could use his U-18 or U-20 numbers, but those sample sizes are so small that we couldn`t expect to draw anything meaningful from it.\n\nMuch like there are few scouting reports to draw on because people didn`t get a good look at Dzierkals, we can`t draw any sort of conclusion on Dzierkals using PCS for many of the same reasons.\n\nJESPER LINDGREN\n\nPCS%: 11.11\n\nNHL PPG of Comparables: 0.76\n\nNotable Comparables: Erik Karlsson, Dennis Persson\n\nAgain, not a big fan of using PCS with the Euro leagues. But we at least get a little bit bigger of a sample here (9 players total), and anytime you can compare to a two-time Norris Trophy winner like Erik Karlsson that`s a good thing. Dennis Persson is another noteworthy comparable because he was drafted in the first round by Buffalo in 2006, but he never ended up playing an NHL game.\n\nIn any event, we can`t come to too many conclusions here. But the fact that Lindgren compares to Karlsson is obviously good, and speaks to what many are saying about him – that he`s an offensive defenseman.\n\nDMYTRO TIMASHOV\n\nPCS%: 14.47\n\nNHL PPG of Comparables: 0.52\n\nNotable Comparables: David Desharnais, Donald Audette, Gabriel Dumont\n\nWe`re starting to notice a real trend here, where the PCS slowly becomes lower and lower as we move deeper into the draft. Timashov comes in with a 14.47 PCS%, which is pretty good for somebody drafted in the 4th to 7th rounds of the draft. Timashov has a long list of comparables, but not many notable names. Some players you may know include Montreal center David Desharnais, Canadiens “prospect” Gabriel Dumont, and former Buffalo Sabre Donald Audette.\n\nThe list for Timashov is generally a mixed bag, with not many recent players coming out of the QMJHL that share Timashov`s sort of production. That`s to be expected for a 5th-round pick.\n\nIn any event, comparing to David Desharnais is at least a good thing, and if Timashov were to turn into that kind of a player that would be good value in the 5th round of the draft.\n\nSTEPHEN DESROCHER\n\nPCS%: 3.68\n\nNHL PPG of Comparables: 0.17\n\nNotable Comparables: Jake Muzzin, Tyler Cuma, Phil Oreskovic\n\nThis seems to be aligning with what most are saying – that Desrocher`s chances of becoming an NHLer seem slim. But he does compare with Jake Muzzin, which is pretty awesome if you ask me. I like Desrocher for what he is, which is probably a really effective junior player, an effective AHL player, but probably not much more than that. I guess we`ll see how things turn out for him, but the numbers – and history – are not in his favor.\n\nNIKITA KOROSTELEV\n\nPCS%: 24.79\n\nNHL PPG of Comparables: 0.43\n\nNotable Comparables: Ryan O`Reilly, Cody Hodgson, Adam Henrique, Peter Holland\n\nThis is why I love this pick – it`s just efficient drafting. Korostelev is far from a lock to be an NHLer, but when you can get a player with numbers like this in the 7th round, well, the value simply far exceeds the cost. These numbers alone won`t carry Korostelev to the NHL – he needs to improve his on-ice play. But these numbers are great for a player drafted in the 7th round, and this is the sort of “moneypuck” pick that I love to see.\n\nThere`s probably more to this pick than just that for the Leafs, but in any event it represents the Leafs new philosophy to a tee. There`s really no guarantee on any of the Leafs picks from the 2015 draft, but this draft certainly looks to be a lot more efficient than previous ones. And that`s all you can really hope for, because in a lot of ways the draft is nothing more than blind luck. But when you take care of the process, you improve your chances at a positive outcome. I don’t think we would have seen the old regime take a player like Korostelev at this point in the draft, so this pick was a real breath of fresh air.",
  "latent_10708": "What is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was the first and is the most commonly used digital currency, also called a cryptocurrency. One of the key characteristics of Bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency, is that there is no central bank that controls the value of the currency. There are no banks that facilitate transactions. Instead, every transaction is direct – from one person or company to another. Since there are no banks in cryptocurrencies, instead of a bank account, digital currency holders have what are called digital wallets. A public record/ledger, also called a transaction blockchain, is maintained that documents every transaction.\n\nCryptocurrencies Are Anonymous – for now\n\nWhile every Bitcoin transaction is documented, identifying information (like names and addresses) is not used, making digital currency popular for illicit transactions, like the sale of drugs or weapons. But Bitcoin increasingly continues to be used for very legitimate purposes and major companies (OkCupid, Whole Foods, Subway, Microsoft) now accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. While Bitcoin isn’t mainstream yet, many believe that it’s on its way there. (As it becomes more mainstream, more regulations will likely be put in place.) After reading this, you may now begin to notice the little orange Bitcoin logo as a method of payment on the checkout pages of many websites.\n\nHow Do You Obtain Bitcoins?\n\nFirst you have to create a Bitcoin wallet and then you can obtain Bitcoin by selling goods or services and being paid in Bitcoin. Otherwise, if you want to convert traditional currency, like dollars, into Bitcoin, you can use a handful of online exchanges. Or, you can literally put cash into an ATM machine that will instantly convert your cash into Bitcoin. They’re called Bitcoin ATMs. Bobby Sharp calls them BTMs. Aside from the easy sound of the new acronym, it comes with some considerable authority as Sharp is co-founder of Coinsource, the largest Bitcoin ATM operator in the U.S. He started it just over two years ago in 2015 with co-founders Sheffield Clark and Travis Gough. Coinsource has 16 employees with offices in Fort Worth, TX and New York City.\n\nInterview with Bobby Sharp\n\nWhat got you interested in Bitcoin?\n\nSharp: My partner and I were looking for a space to get into that we thought we could be a disruptor in. We kept reading about cryptocurrencies in general, and my partner used to have a large ATM network… ATMs are a pretty saturated business, so we elected to morph the phenomenon of Bitcoin and ATMs, and we’ve been holding the tiger by the tail ever since.\n\nWhy should people care about using Bitcoin?\n\nSharp: Absolutely people should care. Do you want to be the person that can’t program your VCR in 1980? Regardless of what you believe, fiat currency (government issued) is going away. Fiat currency is expensive to secure, to hold. It’s easily replicable, it could be fraudulent. So, if you’ve noticed, with Apple pay and Droid pay, and even Starbucks, with their card, everything is going away from cash. If you’ve gone to a bank, they push you to the ATM machines to deposit your checks.\n\nNow, is Bitcoin the only digital currency in the future that’s going to be worth something? I don’t believe so. I think it’s going to be more like a commodity, like having a gold bar, or an original Babe Ruth card. I do think that Bitcoin is going to hold its own for the long term, but I also think there will be other digital currencies that will come about – probably specific to a country or maybe [a group] of countries. I don’t know. But I do know that [we’re] going away from cash.\n\nDo you think Bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies, is the future of commerce?\n\nSharp: Absolutely. I think it was only a year and a half ago that the total market cap for Bitcoin and others like Etherium, Zcash, Dash and Litecoin was $14 billion. And now the market cap has topped $400 billion. So that’s a pretty significant increase and I believe that in the following year that’s going to even double for a potentially $800 billion market cap. That’s pretty impressive.\n\nAre there other major cryptocurrencies that you might consider dispensing from your ATM machines?\n\nSharp: We’d love to onboard some other currencies, [but] there are a lot of backend and compliance mechanisms that are necessary to do that. Not to mention the liquidity of owning that to be able to sell it. So there are some hurdles, but they’re not too hard to overcome. Right now, our focus is making sure that people are just aware of Bitcoin and how to utilize it. And, importantly, how to utilize our ATMs for it.\n\nNew York City has the most Coinsource ATMs than any other city in the U.S. – 30 of the your roughly 130 Bitcoin ATMs country-wide. Why are there so many in NYC?\n\nSharp: A lot of it is because of the sheer volume of people in the city, but also because there are a lot of people that have family in other countries that can utilize this commodity to send money to relatives like an email. As opposed to having to go through the traditional method of going to a Western Union and paying some obnoxious fee.\n\nDo a large percentage of Coinsource ATM customers use the machines to deposit cash to send money to family overseas?\n\nSharp: It’s a larger percentage [than in other cities]. What I love about [Bitcoin], and what’s fascinating, is the spectrum of people that are learning about finance in general through [using Bitcoin]. Instead of having that coffee can in your house with a few hundred dollars, a lot people have converted that into Bitcoin and have made [money] because the value of Bitcoin has increased significantly.\n\nDid I read correctly that 1 bitcoin = $2,100?\n\nSharp: You probably read that a few weeks ago. It’s a little over $3,000 for one bit coin right now.\n\nSo can you buy fractions of a Bitcoin?\n\nSharp: Certainly. And that’s one of the reasons that people use Coinsource ATMs – because you could buy a dollar worth of Bitcoin if you want. Whatever you’re comfortable with. You don’t have to buy an entire Bitcoin.\n\nHow are you similar to and different from a bank?\n\nSharp: So a bank is a middleman. The government says what our money is worth and we go to a bank and store it and pay whatever it is to store it. The difference between us and a bank is there’s no middleman. You are your own bank…You could buy a boat and if the guy on the other side has his own bitcoin wallet, you could literally say “will you sell your boat for three Bitcoin?” And if he says, “absolutely,” [then] you could do that entire transaction without having to go to a bank and get a cashier’s check and say what it’s for.\n\nNot to mention, you can use Bitcoin in a variety of places. Virgin Airlines, Tesla, Target, Microsoft, Dell. So in essence, you’re your own bank. You cut out the middleman.\n\nSo how do you make money?\n\nSharp: Through the transaction fee of converting the cash to Bitcoin. When you convert money – cash in general – to a commodity like Bitcoin, there’s a ton of compliance [issues and policies to comply with]. The barrier to entry in this business is very high. So, we make money through that initial fee when we convert the cash to digital currency.\n\nWhere are your Coinsource BTMs located?\n\nSharp: They’re in stores or bodegas that have cameras and are well lit. Places where people feel comfortable bringing cash to. It’s very important to us not to just put it out there on the sidewalk…So, [it’s] imperative that we find great locations.\n\nYou can find locations of Coinsource ATMs on the Coinsource website or on Coin ATM radar, which includes competitor Bitcoin ATM operators.\n\nWho uses Bitcoin?\n\nSharp: Some parents buy Bitcoin because their kids are able to buy different characters through Microsoft games on play station – and [sometimes] the only way you can buy upgrades is with Bitcoin. Some people like to day trade [with Bitcoin]. One of our busiest machines is the one off Wall Street. And that’s a bunch of Wall Streeters that come out and diversify.\n\nIf I’m an early stage startup founder, should I consider accepting Bitcoin? And Why?\n\nSharp: Yes, you should because merchant services on average are anywhere from two to four percent…If you took in Bitcoin, your merchant services will be way less that one percent. So, as far as profit to your bottom line, instead of paying a few hundred thousand dollars to a merchant services company, that could be money potentially to your bottom line by just accepting digital currency from your customers.\n\nBy Todd Stone",

  "latent_10821": "Having retreated from the Vessenes Bitcoin Foundation to his new residence at MIT, USGavin, also known as Satoshi dress-up impersonator Gavin Andresen, has given up promoting larger block sizes.\n\nJust seven months after crying wolf that the current 1MB blocks would be insufficient for true Bitcoin adoption, true blockchain teckmologee success, and global community use of the currency for daily purchases, USGavin is backpeddaling at full speed and with the vigour of a man half his age. Where once he proposed that 20MB blocks would be oh-so superior to the current blocksize, y'know, except for the detrimental security consequences and the assuredness of economic ruin, he is now accepting the error of his ways, at least in this one regard.\n\nUndeterred as this entirely ineffectual asset of the existing fiat regime is, USGavin has now set his sights on the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) Database as an avenue from which to \"fix\" Bitcoin. His most recent article, not-so-inexplicably written on the \"ninja\" platform, presents his concerns thusly :\n\nThis is the technical objection that I’m most worried about: More transactions means more memory for the UTXO database I wasn’t worried about it yesterday, because I hadn’t looked at the trends. I am worried about it today.\n\nThose with longer memories will be understandably skeptical of anything that USGavin is presently worried about. If the blocksize didn't end up needing to be larger (au contraire !), why should we pay his ramblings any mind now, much less those he meditated on for all of a single sunrise and sunset ?\n\nLooking more closely into USGavin's back-of-napkin calculations, we see that his prices are quoted in fiat, which is essentially irrelevant to the discussion of node costs. If we look at the following numbers and re-price them in BTC, there's nothing to say that the price of memory needed to run a node will increase. As we may well find out, the price of memory could very well decrease as the infinitely elastic ball X hits the infinitely heavy wall.\n\nToday, the UTXO database is about 650MiB. DRAM costs about $10 per GB, so today if you have to spend about $7 on DRAM for your full node worst case, if you want absolute fastest access to the UTXO. No big deal. Assuming the UTXO set continues to double and RAM prices continue to drop 20% per year, next year you’ll have to spend about $11. Ten years from now, almost $800\n\nThis is not to say that bandwidth and hard drive costs aren't worth considering, just that USGavin's new focus on memory shows how badly he's been trumped in the field of battle of matters of consequence. No word yet on whether he plans to follow-up this particular charade with a focus on making Bitcoin nodes with more attractive cases. Y'know, for the ladies.",
  "latent_10899": "The senseless shooting at Chardon High School is another stark reminder that violence can happen at any given time and place. Most schools have crisis plans which include lockdowns in response to shooters inside school buildings.\n\nBut beyond locking the school building down, students, teachers and staff receive little to no instruction on what to do when coming face-to-face with a shooter.\n\nThe philosophy for school districts should be simple: when gunshots are heard, schools need to turn to a plan that details lockdown procedures as well as behavioral expectations for students, staff and teachers.\n\nSchool personnel have good plans in response to fire alarm activation.\n\nThey have excellent protocols for responding to a tornado siren. Not only are the plans well documented but they are practiced at certain times of the year. They practice their plan to enhance learning.\n\nAt a recent FBI training session that I attended, the agent commented that more people are killed by gunfire in our schools than by fires or tornados. Given that sobering news, we should do a better job of preparing our children, teachers and administrators on what to do when faced with a shooter. But what’s the plan?\n\nSchool districts around the United States typically review lockdown procedures but often fail to cover strategies for what to do when a shooter enters a room and starts killing kids and teachers.\n\nA lockdown is a sound safety tool which is very appropriate given specific shooter situations. However, school districts and administrators need to provide a survival plan of what to do when students and teachers encounter a shooter face-to-face.\n\nThe survival concepts we teach at Otterbein University where I serve as chief of police are very simple but dynamic.\n\nThere are three basic survival responses to a shooter on campus: run, hide and barricade. Then, as a last resort, attack the shooter.\n\nWe emphasize that students should run to safety and get away from the danger. If the situation is so dangerous that it’s deemed unsafe to run, then hide and barricade yourself in a room and work your plan.\n\nThe third survival tactic is the most difficult but none-the-less necessary. A shooter enters the classroom and starts shooting at people. Remember, there is nowhere to run or hide.\n\nThe strategy begins with the first person who notices the shooter and yells “GUN!” Everyone in the room then throws whatever is available, as hard as they can, at the shooter’s face causing him to flinch, and preventing him from taking aim. Then what’s known as the “throw and go” tactic is implemented.\n\nUpon throwing items at the shooter, the occupants rush to and swarm the shooter. The first few people are taught to attack and move the shooter’s gun hand and gun toward the ground.\n\nAt the same time or shortly after, the other swarmer’s attack and take the shooter to the ground. Students, faculty and staff are taught to strategically lay on the shooter’s extremities as well as their core area to maximize the amount of weight on the shooter.\n\nIn addition, they are taught to place ready-at-hand objects such as belts, T-shirts, etc., onto the shooter’s throat, nose and eyes to disrupt breathing and sight.\n\nOnce it is determined the shooter is no longer a threat, people are instructed to release pressure to allow breathing but maintain control on top of the shooter until the police arrive.\n\nCritics of this survival tactic argue that you can’t teach people to attack a shooter. But when they are questioned about other options, they become silent.\n\nWe can expect that when applying “throw and go” that some may be injured and possibly killed by the shooter.\n\nHowever, we can also expect that if people in that classroom do nothing and; lie in frozen fear, afraid to fight to live, that the shooter will probably kill everyone in the classroom until stopped. That’s not acceptable!\n\nPeople need to be taught tactics to live no matter how ugly. What’s the alternative?\n\nThe last thing we want at Otterbein University is for our students, faculty and staff not to do anything and thus be executed.\n\nWe began researching survival options to school shooters after the tragedy at Virginia Tech in 2007. One learning point was that some school shooters, like the young men at Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois University, seem to desire a large body count for media attention.\n\nThis is critical information when forming strategies such as barricading and attacking the shooter as a last resort.\n\nIt is hoped that when a school shooter encounters a barricaded room, he/she won’t take the time to attempt to break into it because they know the police are coming to take care of the threat.\n\nThey will probably move to easier, less protected targets to improve their body count.\n\nThe three survival concepts previous discussed (run, hide and barricade, Attack) can be utilized anywhere and are obviously not limited for use in schools.\n\nSearch the Internet for active shootings and you’ll find that shootings are happening everywhere, including in churches, at restaurants and, malls, and countless other locations.\n\nEducation and training are the keys to being prepared for this kind of crisis. The greatest obstacle to survival training is thinking that, “It will never happen here.”\n\nBig mistake.\n\nIt’s said in the survival world that the mind is the greatest weapon and that’s true. So let’s put this in proper perspective.\n\nResponding to school shooters is simply another crisis to prepare for much like fires, tornados, bomb threats, etc. Schools are very safe for the most part. This dialog is not intended to motivate an action plan based on scare tactics. Rather, much like Virginia Tech in 2007, maybe it can be a wake-up call where appropriate.\n\nLarry Banaszak is the Chief of Police at Otterbein University. In the past five years, the Otterbein Police Department has hosted numerous active shooters training sessions for university students, staff and faculty, as well as going to other school districts, businesses and governmental agencies.",

A St. Paul man had been walking outside when two men approached and tried to rob him, police have said.\n\nThe man, who had a permit to carry, pulled his gun and exchanged gunfire with the suspects, according to police.\n\nLowell Schoenherr was at a park across the street when he heard three shots, turned around and saw a man who hobbled away and got into the back of a car. A car pulled behind it and both drove off quickly, said Schoenherr. He didn’t see what led to the incident and he was surprised to hear the shots, he said.\n\nPolice have said the 24-year-old man got into his own car and pursued the suspects. A second gunfight followed in the 900 block of Thomas Avenue.\n\nThe 24-year-old returned to the scene of the first incident and spoke with police, and Barre later showed up at Regions Hospital with the gunshot wound to his foot. A relative of Barre’s declined comment. Police said Tuesday afternoon they were continuing to look for the second suspect.\n\nPolice had not presented a case Tuesday to the Ramsey County attorney’s office to review for charges.\n\nThe case is “very complex” with “multiple crime scenes,” said Sgt. Paul Paulos, a St. Paul police spokesman. He said the investigation includes determining how many shots were fired and whether the victim and suspects knew one another.\n\nMinnesota courts have set a four-part test to determine whether the use of deadly force is justified under self-defense, said Andrew Rothman, Gun Owners Civil Rights Alliance president. The factors are: Was the person in immediate fear of death or great bodily harm, and was that belief reasonable? Would no lesser force have served to end the threat? Was retreat not practical? And, was the person the “non-aggressor” in the initial encounter?\n\nIt’s not unlawful for someone to follow suspects, Rothman said, adding that he’d need more information about what happened in the St. Paul case to assess the second part of the incident.\n\n“At some point, if they (the suspects) initiated a second encounter, he may have again been in a situation where he was authorized by the law to use deadly force,” Rothman said.\n\nMara H.

  "latent_11405": "A follow-up to Matt's post, which covered a report that shouldn't go unnoticed, in spite of the Trump maelstrom dominating most headlines. In short, two Fox News sources familiar with the federal criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton say career agents and lawyers attached to the case were \"floored\" when FBI Director James Comey announced his decision not to recommend criminal charges against the former Secretary of State in July. The \"vast majority\" of these people are said to believe that based on the evidence they reviewed, an indictment was warranted:\n\nThe decision to let Hillary Clinton off the hook for mishandling classified information has roiled the FBI and Department of Justice, with one person closely involved in the year-long probe telling FoxNews.com that career agents and attorneys on the case unanimously believed the Democratic presidential nominee should have been charged. The source, who spoke to FoxNews.com on the condition of anonymity, said FBI Director James Comey’s dramatic July 5 announcement that he would not recommend to the Attorney General’s office that the former secretary of state be charged left members of the investigative team dismayed and disgusted. More than 100 FBI agents and analysts worked around the clock with six attorneys from the DOJ’s National Security Division, Counter Espionage Section, to investigate the case. “No trial level attorney agreed, no agent working the case agreed, with the decision not to prosecute -- it was a top-down decision,” said the source, whose identity and role in the case has been verified by FoxNews.com. A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.” “It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.”\n\nAre these two sources accurately characterizing investigators' private sentiment? We can't definitively say one way or the other, but we do know that Comey felt compelled to defend himself in multiple internal emails and memos o the Bureau's rank-and-file. We also have this new interview with Peter Schweizer, whose sources in Washington served him well as he wrote Clinton Cash, which mainstream media outlets like the New York Times and the Washington Post built upon in their own reporting. In other words, despite Team Clinton's self-interested protestations to the contrary, his reporting has credibility:\n\n\"I talked to people who'd been in law enforcement at the federal level, and also prosecutors, who said the same thing. They did not know of a current FBI who was familiar with the case who did not think Hillary Clinton should face legal jeopardy because of her actions in the email case.\"\n\nThere is simply no question whatsoever over whether or not Mrs. Clinton's actions constituted grossly negligent handling of classified material. Comey admitted as much, calling her conduct \"extremely careless\" and \"the definition of negligence.\" That's all the statute requires for prosecution. But because individuals are virtually never prosecuted without proof of intent on top of their negligence, Comey said it would have been a break from precedent to charge Mrs. Clinton. But that excuse was systematically dismantled by Trey Gowdy in two grillings of Comey, noting that Clinton's after-the-fact lies (\"false exculpatory statements) are very strong indicators of intent, which Comey was forced to admit. More indications of intent have since dripped out with the release of more FBI notes, emails, and evidence. Meanwhile, the DOJ extended sweetheart immunity deals to people at the center of the scandal, effectively ensuring that nobody would pay a price for the deliberate compromising of top national secrets. No wonder officials familiar with the details of the probe are baffled and angry over their bosses' political decisions to let Hillary and her coterie of enablers off the hook. I'd like to hear more details and confirmation from the people being described by these sources. And I'm curious if any of them would protest what they view as a politically-motivated travesty of justice by resigning or becoming an on-the-record whistleblower. I'll leave you with my segment on Fox discussing the Wikileaks revelations swirling around the Clinton campaign:\n\nWatch the latest video at <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com\">video.foxnews.com</a>\n\nLater in the exchange, I summed things up by calling Clinton a \"shape-shifting, self-serving liar.\"",

Loggers have already cut swathes through 90 percent of adjacent lands.\n\nFor the Cree, protecting the forest also means protecting the reindeer, moose and other wildlife being pushed further and further north by logging and climate change.\n\nThe Cree grand chief signed an accord with the Quebec government in July to preserve 9,134 square kilometers of woodland caribou habitat along the 450-kilometer Broadback, which flows through the taiga to the Arctic.\n\nBut Waswanipi trappers say the deal does too little to safeguard their land. They point out that half of the areas protected from logging under the accord were already off-limits to forestry firms.\n\nSince the government of Quebec unveiled a conservation plan for the north that paradoxically opened the door to more logging along the Broadback river, the town of Waswanipi has felt under siege.\n\n- Not ours to sell -\n\nForestry firm representatives have approached Don Saganash about his hunting lands in the area.\n\n\"They came to talk to me about building a bridge because the river is narrower here, but the Broadback is not for sale,\" he said of the crystal clear river where sturgeon, pike and walleye swim.\n\nSeeing trucks loaded with logs drive by \"is like getting stabbed in the gut,\" said the retired ambulance driver.\n\n\"My father used to say: the land is not ours to sell.

  "latent_11702": "January 13, 2016\n\nI BELIEVE that reviewers generally should disclose when they have a vested interest in the thing they're reviewing, so full disclosure: Barring another Jar Jar Binks fiasco, there was about as much chance of me--a geek hurtling toward middle age at light speed--hating J.J. Abrams' Star Wars: Episode VII--The Force Awakens as there is of the Millennium Falcon successfully navigating an asteroid field.\n\nThat is to say, a slim chance (approximately 3,720 to one, if we're being technical about it). Just like so many others, I spent months anticipating The Force Awakens--geeking out over every casting announcement and plot hint, squeeing over the cool new toys, and fervently hoping that the movie would be good.\n\nIt is that, I'm pleased to say: a solidly good movie--though (and I say this not to damn it with faint praise) not necessarily a great one. Or rather, it tells a good story--but its real strength is that it does it amid a landscape populated with some great characters, both old and new.\n\nDaisy Ridley as Rey and John Boyega as Finn in Star Wars: The Force Awakens\n\nTHERE'S NO doubt that Star Wars director George Lucas is a visionary in ways that have irrevocably changed cinema--from his help in creating, for better and worse, (along with cohort Steven Spielberg) the modern Hollywood blockbuster, to his special effects wizardry, to his foresight, despite his protestations that he's \"just a movie guy,\" in recognizing the potential importance of merchandising in the creation of the modern blockbuster.\n\nBut there are some things Lucas has never done very well--as many Star Wars fans are the first to admit. Like writing dialogue. (Harrison Ford once famously told him about the dialogue in Star Wars: A New Hope: \"George, you can type this shit, but you sure as hell can't say it.\") Then there is his perverse inability to leave well enough alone. (Han shot first, thank you very much.)\n\nAfter the dismal mess of the Lucas-directed Star Wars Episodes I-III, millions of fans greeted the choice of Lost and Star Trek director J.J. Abrams to helm The Force Awakens with cautious optimism--an opportunity to stay faithful to the swashbuckling spirit of Episodes IV-VI while making a Star Wars movie that could tell a new and interesting story to a new audience.\n\nReview: Movies Star Wars: Episode VII--The Force Awakens, directed by J.J. Abram, starring Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford.\n\nMany reviews of The Force Awakens have seemed to fall into two extremes: the uncritically joyous and the joylessly nit-picking. But it's worth stepping back in the wake of the release of The Force Awakens to consider how the phenomenon of fandom and marketability impacts how we enjoy this latest installment in the Star Wars franchise.\n\nThere's something obnoxious, not to mention elitist, in cantankerous Marxists looking down their noses at Star Wars fans and proclaiming that we need to \"get a life\" and stop wasting so much time and energy on debates about Sith lords and the properties of the Force. It's even more obnoxious to castigate the movies for not being properly \"political.\" Capturing a certain truth about the approach of some on the left to culture in general and Star Wars in particular, the satire site \"Worker's Spatula\" teased:\n\nNot once in the entire Star Wars trilogy does any character make reference to Marxism-Leninism or dialectical materialism. When Luke's master, Yoba, dies in the first film, while it is true that the Rebel Alliance hold their fists aloft and praise him as a great revolutionary who has become immortalized in their struggle against fascism, no reference to class is to be found in the Rebels' ideology.\n\nFOR A whole new generation of fans primed with a childhood of light saber battles, Lego Star Wars toys and episodes of The Clone Wars, however, the desire to read a sense of progressive politics into The Force Awakens is not so much about any inherent political aspirations of the film itself, but about our desire to see a better world reflected back to us on the screen.\n\nThe casting of Black actor John Boyega as rogue stormtrooper Finn matters--as does the central importance of the character arc of Daisy Ridley's Rey. In fact, the Internet exploded in a flurry of outraged white tears after The Force Awakens trailer premiered last year, with one segment of outraged fans/trolls--led by a Twitter user with the screen name \"End Cultural Marxism\"--announcing that J.J. Abrams was promoting \"white genocide\" by casting Boyega as a lead in the film. (Here's a newsflash: Having one Black actor featured as a lead character in a story that includes not only multiple ethnicities but multiple species should hardly be seen as proof positive of a Marxist takeover of Hollywood.)\n\nAside from the deeply satisfying platter of nostalgia The Force Awakens serves up, the biggest strength of the movie is in the development of its main characters, especially Finn and Rey. With Finn, stormtroopers are now more than faceless clones (with an apparently inexhaustible ability to miss a target with a laser blaster). The bloody handprint that a fallen comrade leaves on FN-2187's visor serves as more than a visual marker of his character later in the scene--it is a shocking reminder that there is flesh and blood below the white armor.\n\nThe power of seeing Finn refuse to take part in a war crime in order to claim his humanity--transforming himself from faceless number FN-2187 into a real, conflicted human person with a name of his own--matters. And it will resonate with many that it is a Black man doing so--precisely because we live in a society in which the humanity of Black people and their very right to exist is constantly under attack at the hands of the state.\n\nLikewise, Kylo Ren has the potential to be what Episodes I-III's Anakin Skywalker should have been--a deeply disturbed villain whose internal conflict we can see and relate to (rather than the sulking, obnoxious teenager we were treated to in Hayden Christensen's Anakin or the fully formed menace of Darth Vader).\n\nEven more important for The Force Awakens is Daisy Ridley's character Rey--the culmination of the promise that Lucas tantalized millions of us with in the character of Princess Leia: the awesome female Jedi.\n\nThe Force Awakens sets up the scrappy scavenger as the \"new new hope.\" Rey goes a long way toward scrubbing away the bad taste that still lingers as a result of Princess Leia's gold bikini (though Rey's exclusion from much of the first wave of Force Awakens toys remains maddening and perplexing. At least it appears as though the next wave of toys to roll out will feature her more prominently.)\n\nThe centrality of Rey also raises questions that I hope the franchise will answer in the future: Like why, if Leia was also strong in the Force, she couldn't also have been trained as a Jedi. Maybe the now-General Organa was just too busy holding the Rebellion together? (One can only hope it wasn't because she got hitched to Han. Though Han, of course, did thoughtfully build Leia a kitchen on the Millennium Falcon as a wedding gift.)\n\nSadly, the fact that one of the major debates on social media following the release of The Force Awakens has been about whether or not Carrie Fisher has \"aged well\" and how much weight she has gained in the past four decades illustrates just why we need more characters like Rey--strong, capable, smart female leads. (As the always sublimely hilarious Fisher responded on Twitter: \"Please stop debating about whether or not I aged well. Unfortunately it hurts all three of my feelings. My body hasn't aged as well as I have. Blow us,\" and \"Youth and beauty are not accomplishments, they're the temporary happy byproducts of time and/or DNA. Don't hold your breath for either.\")\n\nMARXISTS WHO sometimes would prefer that the cultural products we love not be subjected to the harsh light of scrutiny are fond of quoting Trotsky that \"a work of art should, in the first place, be judged by its own law, that is, by the law of art.\" By that law, I would say that the Force Awakens succeeds.\n\nAmong what works: Abrams broke my heart in the best way possible with the Han Solo/Kylo Ren showdown. And the deliberate echoes of the Han/Leia romance in the Finn/Rey pairing--including some tongue-in-cheek words of wisdom from Han Solo to Finn--not only works well, but has the added benefit of annoying the Internet racists who would rather see Rey date a wookie than a Black man. (One can only wonder what the reaction will be if the longshot fan theory that pilot Poe Dameron is gay turns out to be correct.).\n\nThe film isn't without its faults, however. With The Force Awakens, the replaying of significant story lines lifted seemingly straight from Star Wars: A New Hope in some cases heightens the story (mysterious parentage! inter-generational conflict and daddy issues!), but in other instances allows the thinness of the plot to show through--leaving some portions of the film a little threadbare, like that well-worn set of vintage Star Wars sheets some of us still have on our beds.\n\nThe use of the Starkiller Base as a kind of Death Star 2.0 never quite gels. Unlike with the Death Star in A New Hope, we aren't given the same sense of existential dread from the threat of the Starkiller Base, even as our heroes were supposedly seconds away from death caused by it.\n\nLikewise, the character of Maz Kanata as the \"new\" Yoda seems lacking to me. Though she is at least one small CGI step toward erasing the putrid memory of the Jar Jar Binks character, her transparent operation as The Force Awakens' Yoda figure (they might as well have hung a sign around her neck reading \"tiny mystical sage/comic relief here\") fails to add much to the movie. And Domhnall Gleeson's spitting General Hux pales in comparison to the effortlessly chilly gravitas of Peter Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin.\n\nIt's important to be admit to admit these flaws not because we should want to dismantle the things we love, but because there's a problem with pretending that judging a work of art by the law of art means not judging it at all.\n\nAnd of course, Trotsky didn't stop by saying art should be judged by its own laws. He added that \"Marxism alone can explain why and how a given tendency in art has originated in a given period of history; in other words, who it was who made a demand for such an artistic form and not for another, and why.\"\n\nAnd here is where I think Marxists have something important to add to an understanding of The Force Awakens--a film that is, perhaps more than anything else, a heaping bowl of nostalgia being spoon-fed to both an old and new audience.\n\nIN ONE of the most famous literary mediations on nostalgia, French author Marcel Proust describes being transported into memory through the act of eating a cookie--and his subsequent attempts to recapture that exact moment of transcendent feeling. I'd wager the feeling Proust had while eating his cookie is a familiar one to many Star Wars fans sitting in the theater and viewing The Force Awakens. (\"I had ceased now to feel mediocre, contingent, mortal. Whence could it have come to me, this all-powerful joy?\")\n\nI'm only kidding a little bit. My first glimpse of Han Solo saying \"We're home\" to Chewie in The Force Awakens trailer last year brought a tear to my eye--talk about all-powerful joy! That tear was real, involuntary--but it was also the byproduct of a calculated corporate machine with billions of dollars at stake trying to sell me a memory of my experience as a Star Wars fan as much as it was the result of a work of art.\n\nWhile Proust's nostalgia came from the simple sense memory of eating, my nostalgia as a Star Wars fan comes from consumption of a different kind: a purchased experience of pop culture that is further invested with economic interest at every level. (One can imagine the marketing and toy people in the background during the production process--\"Can we get another cute droid in the movie so we can make another really cool toy?\" \"How about a special new light saber for Kylo Ren?\")\n\nNostalgia itself--that pleasurable sinking into memory--is a kind of commodity, and probably no company on earth is better at selling it than Disney, the current owner of the Star Wars franchise.\n\nJ.J. Abrams claimed recently that all of the callbacks in the plot of The Force Awakens are deliberate. They aren't \"rip-offs,\" he said, but an example of \"embracing the history that we know to tell a story that is new--to go backwards to go forwards.\" To an extent, he has a point--there is a way in which the repetition of themes, characters and plot elements from the older franchise are helpful and even necessary to set up the continuation of the saga in the forthcoming Episodes VIII and IX.\n\nBut on another level, this retreading of ground made me hyperaware of the way The Force Awakens is a conscious attempt to sell me something beyond a discrete work of art known as a \"movie.\" The Force Awakens, for millions of moviegoers, isn't just about what happens to a set of characters on a screen, it is inextricably bound up with what you might call the \"Star Wars Experience™\".\n\nI have some small amount of sympathy for George Lucas, who recently said in an interview with Charlie Rose that his selling Star Wars to Disney to make the \"retro movie\" Force Awakens felt as if he sold his \"kids\" to \"the white slavers that take these things, and...\" (he trailed off).\n\nLucas' poor word choice notwithstanding, there is something infinitely calculated about every aspect of not only The Force Awakens, but everything to do with Star Wars--meant to generate revenue from an audience based in large part on capitalizing on our experience of memory and nostalgia. Admitting this doesn't have to negate enjoyment of the film, but we should try to understand it.\n\nWhat Lucas described is a kind of gilded cage--a constraining of the possibilities of artistic vision--that he himself had a hand in creating in modern Hollywood. Disney and Abrams today are merely continuing what Lucas (along with Spielberg and others) have made a central feature of American blockbuster moviemaking, from American Graffiti (which he wrote and directed) to Raiders of the Lost Ark (which he wrote and Spielberg directed)--a recycling and reselling of the past in palatable form, from the music and car culture of the 1950s in the case of American Graffiti, to 1940s movie adventure serials in the case of Raiders and Star Wars.\n\nIn some sense, the generational conflict on the screen is no less intense than the one playing out in the audience. The rehashing of the familiar is in part designed as a payoff for those of us who worked to shield our kids from spoilers about Luke and Leia's parentage until they were old enough to watch The Empire Strikes Back in its proper form.\n\nWe've inculcated in them a love of a franchise that they haven't (until now) had the opportunity to see on the big screen--and nurtured them with light sabers, lovingly crafted Lego Death Stars and trips to Star Wars Awakens at Walt Disney World. We are the ones now with the disposable income that allows us to fill our homes with (only semi-ironically) purchased R2D2 humidifiers, adult-size Princess Leia onesies (complete with faux buns!) and Darth Vader toasters (\"The empire strikes back with deliciously toasted bread, waffles and English muffins\").\n\nBut of course, for all of our completely justified and fierce devotion to them, our things--even the most thrilling artistic cultural products--can't love us back they way we love them.\n\n\"I love you,\" we say to Star Wars. \"I know,\" it replies.",

  "latent_11754": "SAN DIEGO -- Philip Rivers doesn’t want your sympathy.\n\nHe’s happy with the decision he made during the offseason last year. Rivers signed a four-year, $83.25 million contract extension in August 2015 despite speculation the San Diego Chargers entertained a draft-day trade that would have sent him to the Tennessee Titans and given the Chargers an opportunity to draft a quarterback of the future in Marcus Mariota.\n\nChargers brass never wavered in wanting Rivers to stay in San Diego. Since then, the Chargers have compiled a 5-16 record, with former teammate LaDainian Tomlinson pointing out that the future Hall of Fame quarterback is wasting the twilight of his career on a bad team.\n\n“I guess I should take that as a compliment,” Rivers said. “But at the same time, nobody should feel sorry for me, really. I have an opportunity to play quarterback in the NFL, live here and play here.\n\n“My faith, my family and this football is more than I could ever imagine as an 8-year-old little boy. Yeah, we’re in a tough stretch, but there’s doesn’t need to be any sympathy for me. I look at it as, while I honestly feel I’m playing pretty good, I look at it as my job is to find a way to lead us to win games. We've won five of 21 with me at quarterback, and I take responsibility for that, too.\"\n\n\"Nobody should feel sorry for me, really,\" Philip Rivers said. \"I have an opportunity to play quarterback in the NFL, live here and play here.\" Jamie Squire/Getty Images\n\nIt’s not like Rivers hasn’t had some success during his decade as a starter for the Chargers. He’s led San Diego to the playoffs five times, reaching the AFC Championship Game during the 2007 season.\n\nHe’s earned five trips to the Pro Bowl, and with 42,916 career passing yards needs just 125 more on Thursday against the Broncos to pass Dan Fouts (43,040) for the all-time franchise record. Rivers also is ninth all-time in the NFL with 292 career touchdown passes.\n\nRivers still had a year left on his deal when he signed the contract extension. And even if he didn’t come to an agreement with the team, the Chargers likely would have slapped the franchise tag on Rivers after the end of the 2015 season.\n\nRivers was never going to reach free agency. The Chargers were not going to allow him to leave, and he’s fine with where he is.\n\n“I feel awesome about it,” Rivers said when asked about staying in San Diego. “I don’t feel awesome about being 1-4, but I’m thankful for the opportunity to be the quarterback here with the Spanos family, and the chance they gave me to lead an organization, lead a group.\n\n“And it’s a group I really have a great deal of belief in. We’re not currently the team from a roster standpoint that we all thought we were going to be. That being said -- although it hasn’t turned into wins -- we’re better equipped to handle this year than we were in previous years.”\n\nAs far as his team’s struggles in late-game situations, Rivers feels the Chargers should at least be 3-2. They lost a 21-point lead in the second half against the Kansas City Chiefs in the season opener and a 13-point lead in the last eight minutes of the game against the New Orleans Saints two weeks ago.\n\nThe Chargers would be in a much different situation with those two wins, rather than 1-4 and with head coach Mike McCoy on the hot seat.\n\n“We gave two away, and that’s what really drives me crazy,” Rivers said. “I can watch the Colts game and say, ‘We didn’t win. I missed a throw here and there; we didn’t win the game.’\n\n“We didn’t win the other ones either, but we dominated those two games for the better part of 50 minutes, and that’s what makes us sick.”",
  "latent_12025": "Poor adults in red states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare were twice as likely to say the law had helped them than harmed them, according to a study released Wednesday that underscores the challenge before Republicans who want to revamp the program as part of their repeal-and-replace strategy.\n\nResearchers looked at four states — Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Texas — that voted for President Trump by wide margins, though only the first three accepted an influx of federal funds to expand Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor, under his predecessor.\n\n“Overall, twice as many respondents in the three expansion states reported being helped by the law than hurt by it, whereas in Texas more respondents thought the law had hurt them than thought it had helped them,” researchers Benjamin D. Sommers and Arnold M. Epstein said in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nRepublicans say Obamacare’s web-based insurance exchanges are collapsing under the weight of soaring premiums and dwindling plans choice, so it’s important to repeal the law “root and branch,” and replace it with market-oriented reforms.\n\nYet a key sticking point is what to do about the 31 states that expanded Medicaid under the law, including 13 that Mr. Trump won in November.\n\nUnder Obamacare states could expand Medicaid to those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The federal government picked up the full cost of expansion in 2014-16, though its share will slide to 90 percent by 2020 and beyond.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, has urged Congress to let states like his retain the expansion and federal funding, saying it’s reduced the number of uninsured and pricey ER visits. He said federal lawmakers seeking changes should roll back the expansion instead of repealing it.\n\nIndeed, with roughly 12 million covered since expansion, it will be difficult for Capitol Hill Republicans to turn back completely.\n\n“I think that this is one of the most difficult issues that they’re going to have to tackle. Obviously, I think governor[s of] each [state] have a vested interest based on the decision they made with respect to Medicaid expansion,” said Lanhee J. Chen, a fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institute who advised 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney on health policy.\n\nFor now the House GOP’s election-year blueprint calls for converting Medicaid into fixed block grants to the states or a per-capita system tied to the number of beneficiaries in a state, and how sick they are.\n\nRepublicans say either option would allow governors to implement Medicaid as they see fit, resulting in a more efficient program.\n\nDemocrats, however, say both models are designed to slash federal spending, so states will be forced to slash benefits or enrollment, undercutting Mr. Trump’s campaign vow to leave entitlements alone.\n\n“I think some of your biggest critics are going to be Republican governors on this, because I think Republican governors, and they’ll probably be [more] diplomatic than me, are going to see this as a Trojan Horse to cut spending,” Sen. Ron Wyden, Oregon Democrat, said at a confirmation hearing for Rep. Tom Price, Mr. Trump’s pick to lead the Health and Human Services Department.\n\nKellyanne Conway, a senior counselor to Mr. Trump, confirmed in an interview with “Face the Nation” on CBS on Sunday that the administration is eyeing block grants for Medicaid, though Wednesday’s study suggested that rolling back the expansion could upset a core bloc of Trump supporters — Southern whites.\n\nIn Louisiana, which expanded in mid-2016, white respondents who earned 138 percent of poverty or less were evenly split over Obamacare’s impact on them, while the share of whites in Arkansas and Kentucky reporting a benefit continued to “significantly exceed” this reporting harm.\n\n“Ideology has undoubtedly played a large role in states’ decisions about whether to expand Medicaid, but it may not be the sole determinant of who ends up supporting the expansion’s repeal,” the study said.\n\nSome Senate Republicans are reaching for a Solomonic solution.\n\nSens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Susan M. Collins of Maine recently offered a bill that would empower states to keep Obamacare, including Medicaid expansion, adopt GOP reforms with 95 percent of the federal funding they would have received under the 2010 law or strike out on their own with no federal assistance.\n\nAvik Roy, a conservative health policy adviser, said there are “no easy answers to anything health care, but the new Cassidy-Collins plan will no doubt appeal to the Kasichs of the world, because it allows those who like their Obamacare to keep their Obamacare, while allowing other states to opt out.”\n\nCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

She is the youngest ever winner of the prize.\n\nAfter being shot she was airlifted to Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham, where she was treated for life-threatening injuries.\n\nShe has since continued to campaign for girls’ education, speaking before the UN, meeting Barack Obama, being named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people and last year publishing the memoir I am Malala.\n\nLast month a gang of 10 Taliban fighters who tried to kill her were arrested, the Pakistan army claimed.\n\nMalala speaks at the UN in New York on her 16th birthday in 2013. Photograph: STAN HONDA/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn a statement, the Nobel committee said: “Despite her youth, Malala Yousafzai has already fought for several years for the right of girls to education, and has shown by example that children and young people, too, can contribute to improving their own situations.\n\n“This she has done under the most dangerous circumstances. Through her heroic struggle she has become a leading spokesperson for girls’ rights to education.”\n\nMalala explained how she completed the rest of her school day after learning she had won the prize.\n\n“When I found I had won the Nobel peace prize I decided I would not leave my school, rather I would finish my school time,” she said.\n\n“I went to the physics lessons, I learned. I went to the English lesson. I considered it like a normal day.\n\n“I was really happy with the response of my teachers and my fellow students. They were all saying they were proud.”\n\nSatyarthi, the Nobel committee said, had maintained the tradition of Mahatma Gandhi and headed various forms of peaceful protests.\n\n“Showing great personal courage, Kailash Satyarthi, maintaining Gandhi’s tradition, has headed various forms of protests and demonstrations, all peaceful, focusing on the grave exploitation of children for financial gain,” the committee said. “He has also contributed to the development of important international conventions on children’s rights.”\n\nThe Nobel committee said it “regards it as an important point for a Hindu and a Muslim, an Indian and a Pakistani, to join in a common struggle for education and against extremism”.\n\nSatyarthi, 60, dedicated his prize to children in slavery, telling CNN-IBN: “It’s an honour to all those children who are still suffering in slavery, bonded labour and trafficking.”\n\nHe founded Bachpan Bachao Andolan - or the Save the Childhood Movement - in 1980 and has acted to protect the rights of 80,000 children.\n\n“It’s an honour to all my fellow Indians. I am thankful to all those who have been supporting my striving for more than the last 30 years,” he said.\n\n“A lot of credit goes to the Indians who fight to keep democracy so alive and so vibrant, where I was able to keep my fight on.\n\n“Something which was born in India has gone globally and now we have the global movement against child labour. After receiving this award I feel that people will give more attention to the cause of children in the world.”\n\nYemeni Nobel peace laureate Tawakkol Karman said Malala and Satyarthi were worthy winners and that Satyarthi had taken part in an “outstanding and long struggle for the rights of the child”.\n\nThere were a record 278 nominations this year, 19 more than ever before – including US whistleblowers Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Pope Francis. Also on the list of nominees was an anti-war clause in the Japanese constitution and the International Space Station Partnership.\n\nPrevious choices include illustrious names such as Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi, and Martin Luther King - and, controversially, Barack Obama in 2009.\n\nLast year’s choice of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in hindsight seems a similar act of wishful thinking. At the time the agency’s role in overseeing the destruction of Syria’s chemical arsenal offered a very slim chance of finding a diplomatic resolution to the crisis in that country.

The program would be administered by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, which also would create a sliding scale to determine how much each worker contributes to the fund.\n\n�The United States is the only industrialized nation that does not provide paid leave to new mothers,� said Rep. Christie Kuhns, D-Cincinnati, a prime bill sponsor who gave birth to a baby last year and returned to the Statehouse four weeks later. �This is something we all need to rally behind and ensure that every single citizen in Ohio can afford themselves those benefits.�\n\nUnder the bill, a worker would be eligible for paid leave if he or she worked at least 680 hours during the period, premiums were withheld for at least one year and the leave was for eligible purposes.\n\nOhio would join five states � California, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Washington and, most recently, New York � to require paid parental leave, if passed. Ohio�s 12 weeks would match New York�s law, which passed last week, while others offer four to six weeks.\n\nUnder the federal Family Medical Leave Act, workers can take as many as 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn or adopted child, or care for a family member. But supporters of paid leave say many workers can't afford to take that much unpaid time off and currently only about 13 percent of workers have some form of paid leave through their employers.\n\nPaid leave, Kuhns said, helps moms build bonds with their babies and would positively affect Ohio�s infant mortality rate, which is among the nation�s worst. She is sponsoring the bill with Rep. Janine Boyd, D-Cleveland Heights.\n\nCincinnati and Dayton have approved six-week paid family leave policies for their workers, and Columbus Councilwoman Liz Brown said she is working to pass it in Columbus.\n\n�Having a family-friendly policy like this statewide makes it that much more attractive to move to Ohio,� Brown said.\n\nGail Dudley, owner of Ready Publication in Columbus, said paid leave can help employee morale and attract talent, �but unfortunately many small business owners can�t afford to pay for leave for their employees and that puts us at a disadvantage.�\n\nSome large companies offer paid leave and those workers could opt out of the state program if the policy is better. Dudley and others say the bill would help level the playing field for small businesses.\n\n�This bill is part of a national trend, a growing realization that the United States is so far behind the rest of the world on this critical issue,� said Keary McCarthy, president of progressive think tank Innovation Ohio. �We think offering this could be a huge savings to local businesses.\"\n\nThe bill calls for a study to determine the cost of paid leave.\n\nWith no Republican co-sponsors, the bill�s chances of movement appear slim, at least in the near future. Kuhns said she had not yet spoken to top business advocacy groups.\n\nA spokesman for Speaker Cliff Rosenberger, R-Clarksville, offered no opinion on the issue but said the bill would get �fair consideration.�\n\njsiegel@dispatch.com\n\n@phrontpage",
  "latent_12465": "How The Trump Movement Is Killing Hollywood & The Media\n\nLiz Crokin\n\nFreelance Writer\n\nAnti-Trump celebrities and several media outlets have foolishly used their platform to spew hate for President Donald Trump. The decision to put politics ahead of the best interest of their business has been ethically misguided and flat out stupid. This move has isolated and offended millions of Americans and certain outlets are now paying a hefty price for this misstep. We’re currently witnessing the slow death of leftist Trump-hating media outlets ranging from Us Weekly, ESPN and CNN to the Hollywood careers of previously beloved stars such as Amy Schumer and Shia LaBeouf. As their burial plots are getting deeper, entertainers and members of the Trump friendly alternative media are flourishing, and this phenomenon will only grow.\n\nWell over a month ago, a Hollywood insider told me there’s a big shift going on in the entertainment and media industry. The source said that the industry is looking to produce more patriotic and conservative projects to appeal to Trump supporters and more conservative news outlets will pop up. At the same time, the industry is going to distance themselves from divisive celebrities who have publicly trashed Trump in a vulgar manner such as Meryl Streep, Shia LaBeouf and Amy Schumer. As my source predicted, the backlash has begun. Schumer recently announced that she dropped out as the lead star in the “Barbie” movie due to alleged “scheduling conflicts”. LaBeouf ‘s – who started a hate-filled anti-Trump campaign with a livestream video titled He Will Not Divide Us – new thriller “Man Down” literally only sold one ticket at a U.K. box office earlier this month.\n\n“At the end of the day, the movie executives and producers in Hollywood who supported Hillary Clinton still need to make money,” the insider explained. “The dollar is still important so they are not going to take a risk alienating a large audience simply because a star like Meryl Streep wants to mouth off and disrespect President Trump. The celebrities who chose to attack Trump over the past year – it’s starting to bite them in the ass now and they are receiving less movie offers.”\n\nFor years conservatives in Hollywood have refrained from expressing their political viewpoints since so many have been blacklisted from projects because of their beliefs. Conservatives can now breathe a sigh of relief because the stigma is changing. While so many actors in Hollywood spent awards season this year trashing Trump, singer Joy Villa boldly spoke out in support of Trump on the Grammy’s red carpet wearing a make America great again-themed dress. Her risky decision instantly paid off. She gained over 150K followers on her collective social media accounts, her album I Make The Static went to no. 1 on iTunes and Amazon and she’s been approached with several offers including film roles.\n\n“So many doors have opened for me since I’ve come out as a Trump supporter,” Villa told the Observer. “I’ve got acting things lined up, a feature film and several TV show appearances. I’m getting sent scripts to read every day which is a dream come true.” Villa adds that there are a lot more Trump supporters in Hollywood than people realize. “I found out there are a lot more pro-Trump people than anyone thought, even in the entertainment industry. They are just private about it.”\n\nAs Villa flourishes, anti-Trump publications such as Us Weekly have crumbled. I worked for the entertainment magazine as a reporter for years during both President George W. Bush and Barack Obama’s administrations. The magazine during that time was apolitical. If Obama or Bush were featured, it was always a fluff piece or pictorial with no political agenda. However, Us Weekly’s longtime policy to stay away from pushing a political agenda drastically changed in 2016. I was shocked and utterly disgusted to see how many of their stories were hit jobs and low blow attacks on Trump and his associates.\n\nFor example, last summer Us Weekly posted an article suggesting that talk show host Laura Ingraham made a Nazi salute after she spoke at the Republican National Convention. Ingraham is a Christian woman, an advocate for the troops, a cancer survivor and the single mother to three adopted children. Yet, Us Weekly casted her as a Nazi. People expressed their outrage for Us Weekly’s vitriol toward Trump and his surrogates in the comments section on their social media pages. I knew then that if they continued on this destructive path of irresponsible and agenda driven journalism, the magazine would crash and burn. Their venom toward Trump did ease up after the election. They featured Trump and his family on multiple covers in a more fair and positive light – which were some of their bestselling covers of the year — but by then it was too late because the damage was done.\n\nUs Weekly suffered a roughly 30 percent decline in newsstand sales in the second half of 2016 from the same period a year earlier, according to The New York Times. As a result, it was announced earlier this month that Us Weekly’s parent company, Wenner Media, sold the failing publication to American Media. This is a microcosm of what’s happening with many mainstream media outlets that have relentlessly spread lies and trashed Trump over the past year and pushed a far left PC agenda instead of fulfilling their duty of reporting the news objectively.\n\nThis trend is affecting the entire anti-Trump leftist media such as CNN, The New York Times and even ESPN. The CNN can’t send a crew anywhere without crowds gathering around them chanting “CNN sucks” as they did at Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania the other night. The New York Times issued an apology after the election for their sloppy reporting. As Trump has pointed out, CNN and MSNBC have seen a ratings drop since the election while Fox News Channel broke a ratings record the first quarter of 2017. ESPN is suffering the effect of pushing a far left radical political agenda during the election as well. The network announced last week they’re laying off 100 employees.\n\nThe mainstream media only seems to do well these days when they feature pro-Trump members — usually in an attempt to make them look bad — of the alternative media such as Mike Cernovich and Milo Yiannopoulos. For instance, 60 Minutes featured Cernovich recently and for the first time possibly ever, the show trended on Twitter and won the ratings battle in that timeslot. It was the show’s first ratings win in almost ten years. Yiannopoulos, the wildly popular former Breitbart tech editor, just announced that he’s launching a new $12 million media company. The star power of conservative media personalities and even right-leaning Hollywood stars will continue to rise as the leftist media continues to dig their own graves deeper if they stay the course.\n\n“Conservatism is the new counterculture. It’s becoming in vogue again to be a good girl and boy, to love God and country, and be polite and smile,” Villa said.\n\nShe might be on to something!\n\nFollow Liz on Twitter @LizCrokin\n\nRead more: http://dailycaller.com/2017/05/10/how-the-trump-movement-is-killing-hollywood-the-media/\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

  "latent_12572": "Photo\n\nThe account in Sunday’s Automobiles section of The Times detailing my troubled East Coast road trip in a Tesla Model S sedan has generated quite a lot of commentary on the Internet, on Twitter and in the news media. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, issued several tweets and was interviewed on CNBC Monday afternoon, where he disputed some aspects of the article.\n\nHe stated that my account was a “fake,” that I had ignored explicit charging and driving instructions from Tesla personnel, that I had taken a “long detour” and that I had deliberately sabotaged my own trip. He said I had driven 10 miles an hour over the speed limit at times, and that he had logs that he said would show that I drove in a way that inevitably reduced the car’s range.\n\nNYTimes article about Tesla range in cold is fake. Vehicle logs tell true story that he didn’t actually charge to max & took a long detour. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 11 Feb 13\n\nLet’s answer these assertions in turn. My account was not a fake. It happened just the way I described it. When I first charged the car, which was equipped with the highest-capacity battery available, of 85 kilowatt-hours, at the Tesla Supercharger station in Newark, Del., I left it connected to the cable for 49 minutes until the dash display read “Charging Complete.” The battery meter read 90 percent full, with a range of 242 miles.\n\nI was not directed by anyone at Tesla at any time to then switch to the Max Range setting and wait to top off the battery. If I had, I might have picked up an additional 25 or so miles of range, but that would have taken as long as 30 additional minutes.\n\nI was at that point 200 miles from the other East Coast Supercharger outlet in Milford, Conn., which I barely reached by driving 10 m.p.h. below the speed limit and turning off the battery-draining cabin-heating system.\n\n(Mr. Musk’s logs may show I hit 75 m.p.h. for a mile or two during my trip, although it was likely before, rather than after, the Newark stop. The car’s power-usage meter clearly shows the major penalty driving at 75 inflicts on battery charge, discouraging any temptation to hooliganism in this 416-horsepower, $101,000 car. I drove more than 100 miles below 55 on cruise control to conserve power.)\n\nTesla data logging is only turned on with explicit written permission from customers, but after Top Gear BS, we always keep it on for media. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 11 Feb 13\n\nTesla may contend that had I added the extra 25 miles of range, I would have been able to drive the speed limit (65 miles per hour) with a comfortable cabin temperature for 200 miles in 30-degree outside temperatures. Based on the rate at which the charge level was declining, I’m skeptical.\n\nMr. Musk has referred to a “long detour” on my trip. He is apparently referring to a brief stop in Manhattan on my way to Connecticut that, according to Google Maps, added precisely two miles to the overall distance traveled from the Delaware Supercharger to Milford (202 miles with the stop versus 200 miles had I taken the George Washington Bridge instead of the Lincoln Tunnel). At that point, I was already experiencing anxiety about range and had called a Tesla employee from the New Jersey Turnpike to ask how to stretch the battery. She said to shut off the cruise control to take advantage of battery regeneration from occasional braking and slowing down. Based on that advice, I was under the impression that stop-and-go driving at low speeds in the city would help, not hurt, my mileage.\n\nBefore I set out from my home in suburban Washington, I informed Tesla that I intended to make a brief stop in New York and that I would spend the night in the vicinity of Milford rather than trying to make it to Boston, which was theoretically possible with a full charge at Milford, although it was a bitterly cold night — and that clearly affects the car’s range. I added 185 miles of range at Milford, knowing that I wouldn’t need 242 or 265 miles before recharging the next morning.\n\nWhen I parked the car for the night at a hotel, the range meter showed 90 miles remaining, and I was about 45 miles from the Milford Supercharger. As I recounted in the article, when I awoke the next morning the indicated range was 25 miles. The rest of that story is told in the article, including a Tesla official’s counsel, which I followed, that an hour of charging at the Norwich, Conn., utility would restore much of the range lost overnight, which had disappeared because of what he called a “software glitch.”\n\nA few more points:\n\nTesla made the offer to The Times to test the new East Coast Superchargers. The idea and the timing were theirs. (The Tesla public relations person who arranged the trip left Tesla last week and now works for Mr. Musk’s space-launching venture, SpaceX.)\n\nWe tested the six-station Supercharger network on the West Coast in September; it worked super, and we said so.\n\nAm not against NYTimes in general. They’re usually fair & their own prev Tesla test drive got 300+ miles of range! //t.co/QWGetnNo — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 11 Feb 13\n\nWhile Tesla officials and many armchair experts have said I should have accepted the time penalty to top off the battery in Delaware at the Max Range setting, Tesla warns specifically that this shortens the battery’s life.\n\nVirtually everyone says that I should have plugged in the car overnight in Connecticut, particularly given the cold temperature. But the test that Tesla offered was of the Supercharger, not of the Model S, which we already know is a much-praised car. This evaluation was intended to demonstrate its practicality as a “normal use,” no-compromise car, as Tesla markets it. Now that Tesla is striving to be a mass-market automaker, it cannot realistically expect all 20,000 buyers a year (the Model S sales goal) to be electric-car acolytes who will plug in at every Walmart stop.\n\nKnowing then what I know now about the car, its sensitivity to cold and additional ways to maximize range, I certainly would have treated the test differently. But the conclusion might not have been any better for Tesla.\n\nMr. Musk promised on Monday to write a blog post critiquing my drive and to publish the logs he says he has of how I drove and why the battery pack drained. We will link to those when they appear. Mr. Musk said on Twitter that Tesla always logged data during media test drives, but logs car owners’ data only “with explicit written permission.”\n\nOne final note. Mr. Musk called me on Friday, before the article went up on the Web, to offer sympathy and regrets about the outcome of my test drive. He said that the East Coast charging stations should be 140 miles apart, not 200 miles, to take into account the traffic and temperature extremes in this part of the country.\n\nBtw, more free East Coast Superchargers coming soon. Will allow lower initial charge, v high speed trip & long detours, like NYTimes drive. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 11 Feb 13\n\nHe offered me a second chance at a test drive in a few months, after additional Supercharger stations come online.\n\nI’m game.",

Hitachi High-Technologies has long been involved in the manufacture and sale of electron microscopes used in R&D, quality assurance and other areas in a full spectrum industries, most notably in the fields of nano and biotechnology.\n\nAlthough compact enough to use on a desk, the affordably priced TM-1000 can achieve 10,000X magnification. It is also extremely user friendly, offering an ease of operability comparable to that of a digital camera. For this reason, the TM-1000 is finding applications at research institutes, companies, schools and science museums in and outside of Japan, as a product that conceptually redefines the electron microscope.\n\nIn the fiercely competitive field of scientific instruments and devices, the fact that it has developed this new market and shipments of this single tabletop microscope have surpassed 1,000 units in just four and a half years demonstrates the attention and approval that this product has garnered from customers.\n\nAs part of efforts to promote science, Hitachi High-Technologies is using the TM-1000 in support of science education. In addition to employee demonstrations of TM-1000 offered at science-related events across Japan, in 2008 Hitachi High-Technologies began loaning the devices to educational institutions and other likeminded organizations. Today, the number of children who have taken part in these activities and experienced the wonders of the micro world is over 6,000. In March 2009, Hitachi High-Technologies delivered a TM-1000 to Iwanuma Elementary School in Miyagi Prefecture. This is the first such case of an electron microscope being delivered to a public elementary school anywhere in Japan, and the TM-1000 is now being used to promote the kind of science education that inspires young learners.\n\nHitachi High-Technologies considers cumulative shipments of over 1,000 units of the TM-1000 tabletop microscope as a good start, and seeking to further expand product sales in Japan and abroad. Going forward, the TM-1000 is expected to play an active role in areas ranging from R&D to quality assurance in a host of fields, including materials, semiconductors, food products, and biotechnology. Together with greater utilization of the device in science education, hopes are high that the TM-1000 will help counter the recent flow of students away from science programs.\n\nFeatures of the Tabletop Microscope TM-1000 No installation work required. Simply connect the three-pronged cord into a 100V (AC) outlet to operate Energy-saving design without continuous power on. Startup time significantly reduced to around 3 minutes Variable pressure vacuum enables observation of nonconductive samples with no special advance preparation necessary Fully automatic functions.

The Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002. The Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2009.\n\nAnother round of appreciation comes this week when the Paley Center for Media , at its locations in Manhattan and Beverly Hills, begins almost two months’ worth of programs celebrating Mr. Cosby’s 50 years in show business. So I’m going to do a little commemorating of my own. Since I’m a television critic, I’ll not dwell on his films, some of which were pretty bad, or his off-screen personality, or his occasional controversy-generating comments. Just his TV work. And no, I don’t count those pudding commercials as TV work.\n\nEveryone has favorite Cosby moments: particular episodes or scenes from his various projects, especially “The Cosby Show” (1984-1992), one of the best and most popular series television has ever seen. Has there been a smarter, better played few minutes in a family sitcom than the moment in the pilot when Mr. Cosby’s character, Cliff Huxtable, uses Monopoly money to explain to his son why he should not be content with a report card full of D’s? No, there hasn’t.\n\nI’m going to focus on five less-well-known vignettes as examples of what has made Mr. Cosby so good for so long. The first will be seen in one of the screenings offered by the Paley Center, which is emphasizing rarities and early work. The others are from my own mental inventory. Herewith, Five Keys to the Cos:\n\nTHE TRANSLATOR Mr. Cosby, of course, started as a stand-up comic, and he owned the comedy album category at the Grammys for much of the 1960s. Unlike many comics who have had to leave their raunchy stand-up personas behind when they try television, he had plenty of G-rated material. His challenge was how to mine it for themes and jokes that worked on the small screen. The opening bit from his first television special, broadcast in March 1968 (Sam Denoff and Bill Persky were also credited as writers), showed his translating skills at their best.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Cosby used a riff from “I Started Out as a Child,” his 1964 album, about playing street football as a youngster in Philadelphia . But he enhanced it: When he went out for a pass, he kept going and going and going, pursued by a young defender. He ran through the streets, a horse pasture, the tropics, a desert, someone’s golf game. Eventually Mr. Cosby jogged into the KNBC studio, where a live audience greeted him, and he appeared to have finally lost his pursuer. Turned out he hadn’t; when a pass was lobbed his way, the kid popped up out of nowhere and blocked it. It was a great extended sight gag, built from purely audio source material. Audio: An excerpt From Mr. Cosby’s “I Started Out as a Child.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTHE MAN WITH PERFECT PITCH At his best, Mr. Cosby has excelled at identifying his target audience and then serving it. When he wanted to make a family-friendly sitcom, he made the No. 1 show in the land. When he wanted a sitcom that pushed boundaries a bit, he made “The Bill Cosby Show” (1969-71), which is still admired for its subtle social commentary. And when he wanted to appeal to 3-year-olds, he was darned good at that too.",

Estonia makes heavy use of the internet so the attack caused a great deal of inconvenience, while acting as a wake-up about cyberwarfare.\n\nEstonian ministers blamed Russian government for instigating the attacks, an accusation the Kremlin robustly denied at the time. Only one person has ever been charged over the attack, a member of Estonia's ethnic Russian minority.\n\nDmitri Galushkevich, of Tallinn, was fined 17,500 Estonian Krooni ($1,641) after he was convicted of launching hacking attacks on the website of the Reform Party of Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip and government systems.",
  "latent_13031": "Premier Kathleen Wynne made history Thursday, outrunning her opponents and leaving predecessor Dalton McGuinty’s controversial legacy in the dust with a stunning majority victory.\n\n“This is a beautiful, inclusive place we live in,” she said, noting “anyone can be the premier” in such an open-minded province.\n\n“Whoa, we did this!” the 61-year-old grandmother told cheering supporters at the Sheraton Centre in Toronto, never once mentioning McGuinty by name.\n\nThe first woman elected premier of Ontario — and Canada’s only openly gay first minister ever — Wynne bested Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak, who announced his resignation, and NDP Leader Andrea Horwath.\n\n“Whether Tim (Hudak) blew it or not is a question his own party will have to answer,” said campaign co-chair Tim Murphy when asked if the Tories went too far with their plan to cut 100,000 public-sector positions.\n\nAt Liberal headquarters, activists were surprised at the loss of so many Conservative seats.\n\nWith the fourth straight electoral triumph, she returns the Grits to majority status in the house for the first time since 2011.\n\nWynne will recall the legislature July 2 for a throne speech then reintroduce the same May 1 budget that sparked the election because it would not have passed the minority legislature.\n\n“Thank you, thank you, thank you, Ontario. We are going to build Ontario up for everyone in this province — everyone. You voted for jobs, you voted for growth.”\n\nMore Ontario election coverage\n\nIt was a nasty campaign — Wynne is suing Hudak for libel over his statements about her alleged role in the Liberals’ gas-plant scandal and Horwath accused the Grits of being “corrupt” almost every day of the writ period.\n\nWhile she had promised to stay positive on the hustings, the premier demonized the Conservatives as hell-bent on firing public employees and slashing services and the New Democrats as Tory enablers.\n\nAt the same time, Hudak and Horwath constantly reminded voters Wynne was essentially the second coming of McGuinty and deserved to be punished for transgressions during his 2003-13 tenure.\n\nDespite hyperbole about the ex-premier’s costly scrapping of gas-fired power plants in Oakville and Mississauga to win five Liberal seats in the 2011 election — and an ongoing Ontario Provincial Police investigation into the debacle — the vote did not turn out to be a referendum on him.\n\nWynne weathered blistering attacks over McGuinty-era debacles from her rivals in the only televised debate leaders’ debate and insisted she has cleaned up the mess she inherited.\n\nIn doing so, her majority victory ended Hudak’s five-year reign as Tory leader and derailed his hopes to revive the spirit of the 1990s’ Common Sense Revolution of former premier Mike Harris, his mentor.\n\n“Nobody should mistake this result as an endorsement of the status quo. Kathleen Wynne promised very different behaviour from what we’ve seen these past 11 years,” the 19-year MPP said in Grimsby as he announced he would be stepping down from the helm.\n\nThe PC leader since 2009, he also took his party to defeat in the last election and on that occasion reduced McGuinty to a minority.\n\n“We did not receive the result that we wanted,” the PC leader said, putting a brave face on a staggering defeat.\n\n“I will lead our party and caucus only until that new leader is elected.”\n\nLongtime Tory Paul Rhodes, a key campaign guru and fellow Harris acolyte, said the party was well aware “that it was an uphill struggle right from the beginning.”\n\nConservatives in Ottawa and at Queen’s Park have quietly been jockeying for Hudak’s job for months and federal ministers Tony Clement, Kellie Leitch, Lisa Raitt, and MP Rick Dykstra as well as MPPs Christine Elliott, Vic Fedeli, and Lisa MacLeod as well as party president Richard Ciano are mentioned as possible successors.\n\nThe defining issue of the campaign was Hudak’s “Million Jobs Plan,” which was designed to create that many private sector positions over eight years.\n\nHis key advisers Tom Long, Ian Robertson, and Clark Savolaine wanted to make a big splash with an eye-catching number so the platform was essentially reverse-engineered from the title with little input from the grassroots.\n\nThe Tories claimed there are 1 million unemployed in Ontario — though Statistics Canada says the figure is closer to half that, 550,000 — and hammered home that message for the first weeks of the campaign.\n\nBut it was another dramatic number, 100,000, that captured voters’ attention.\n\nThat was the number of positions Hudak would eliminate from the 1.2-million-member broader public service within four years in order to balance the budget in 2016-17.\n\nReasoning that Ontario’s $12.5 billion deficit needs to be paid off as soon as possible, the Tories said the province could not afford to wait until the Liberals’ target of 2017-18.\n\nWynne pounced on the cuts, repeating every single day in her stump speeches that Hudak planned to “fire 100,000 teachers, firefighters, nurses, and water inspectors and meat inspectors.”\n\nTory candidates confided the pledge was so “sticky,” they heard about it over and over again at the doorsteps and it was easy fodder for their Liberal and NDP opponents.\n\n“We never explained it well,” complained one PC flag-bearer.\n\nUnions blanketed the airwaves with attack ads criticizing the scheme.\n\nEqually problematic was when several prominent economists revealed that the Tories had miscalculated the number of jobs in the platform.\n\nThe campaign brain trust confused “person years of employment” with permanent position created, so each was counted eight times over the eight-year plan.\n\nBut for all Hudak’s problems, Horwath was also a loser in the campaign as she no longer holds the balance of power she had since 2011.\n\nThe NDP leader triggered the vote, which Elections Ontario estimates will cost around $90 million, when she said May 2 that her party, which propped up the Liberals in 2012 and 2013, could not support a left-leaning budget.\n\nWynne caught the New Democrats flat-footed when hours after Horwath’s gambit she asked Lt.-Gov. David Onley to dissolve the legislature, plunging Ontario into an election.\n\nThe Liberals had two campaign buses — wrapped at a cost of $100,000 apiece — ready to go and staged a large downtown Toronto pep rally for staffers that night while the NDP stumbled out of the gate.\n\n“I know people weren’t hoping for this particular result tonight but New Democrats are fighters and we’ll keep fighting for the things that matter most,” Horwath told supporters in Hamilton.\n\nEven though she first proposed an Ontario pension plan since 2010 — and ran on it in the 2011 election — she inexplicably dropped it from the New Democrats’ policy handbook after the Liberals included a similar scheme in their left-leaning budget.\n\nIt was the most visible example of her distancing herself from the party’s past.\n\nIn a debilitating mid-campaign move, 34 past and present NDP supporters wrote a letter proclaiming that she was “abandoning” progressive principles in a desperate, populist appeal for votes.\n\nAt the same time, a flaccid NDP platform, unimaginatively entitled “Andrea Horwath’s Plan That Makes Sense,” failed to capture the voting public’s imagination.\n\nAt dissolution, the Liberals held 48 seats in the 107-member legislature, including the speaker, the Tories had 37, the NDP 21, and there was one vacancy.",
  "latent_13035": "Hip Dysplasia: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment And Prevention\n\nby Robert Mueller\n\nI have a friend that has recently come to me with an ailing 9-year-old yellow Labrador retriever that has hip dysplasia. I have tried to convince him for years to make the switch to the BARF diet but he was convinced that Purina was a better choice for his dog.\n\nNow that his dog is 30 pounds overweight and can’t get up on his own four feet anymore, my friend is now looking to me for a “miracle diet” to reverse his poor dog’s condition. Unfortunately, the chance of reversing this condition after the joint has been so severely damaged is marginal at best.\n\nIn hopes of helping others out there avoid the pain and heartache of seeing their own companion animals suffer through this condition, I’ve decided to focus this week’s issue of “The Intelligent Pet” about this common pet problem.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nThe cost of treating your dog’s hip dysplasia could run around $7,800.\n\nThat’s the equivalent of 3,120 patties of the BARF Diet, which would last a 65 lb. Labrador retriever for over three years!\n\nWhen you factor in all the various health benefits that a raw diet provides your dog (such as clean teeth, increased energy, silky coat, trim figure, healthy digestion, and a great quality of life) and that a raw diet helps to prevent hip dysplasia in your pet by supporting your puppy’s steady growth and weight, it’s easy to choose where you would rather your money go.\n\nIt has been reported that almost 25% of dogs visiting veterinary practices are diagnosed with musculoskeletal disorders. While dogs both large and small can develop hip dysplasia, it is much more common in large and giant breed dogs.\n\nBreeds that demonstrate the highest incidence of this disorder include:\n\nGreat Danes\n\nLabrador Retrievers\n\nNewfoundlands\n\nRottweilers Canine hip dysplasia is the most frequently encountered orthopedic disease in veterinary medicine. This condition is considered a polygenic trait, which means that more than one gene controls the inheritance of this condition. As such, pre-disposition to this illnesses in specific breeds of dogs is worrisome at best.\n\nInstead, when considering the purchase of a large breed puppy, one must be diligent to raise that puppy in such a manner as to reduce the possibility for skeletal disorders.\n\nWhat Causes Hip Dysplasia? Primarily in large breed dogs, the onset of hip dysplasia is usually associated with periods of rapid growth - between 3 to 9 months of age. Therefore, it is best to understand what causes this accelerated growth rate.\n\nFeeding a dog a very high-calorie diet loaded with carbohydrates and synthetic nutrients can exacerbate a predisposition to hip dysplasia, because the rapid weight gain places increased stress on the hips. Excessive weight gain during this period renders a higher frequency and more severe degenerative change in large breed dogs. The extra weight greatly multiplies the large breed dog’s genetic potential for hip dysplasia.\n\nDogs that are allowed to eat as much as they want anytime they want (known as free-feeding) also grow significantly faster than dogs that are fed restricted amounts of food. This escalated rate of growth during puppyhood can cause the body to develop erratically and make your puppy more susceptible to hip dysplasia.\n\nIn addition, supplementation of certain nutrients might reverse the important calcium/phosphorus balance in the body, which also plays a part in the skeletal formation process. This refers specifically to calcium supplements.\n\nMany professional breeders encourage new puppy owners to routinely supplement their pet’s diet with calcium during the entire first year of life for prophylactic measure. While they may mean well, this can actually create skeletal issues in your pet as well as produce deficiencies in other nutrients. In this instance, the risk of added supplementation of calcium does not outweigh the benefits.\n\nAnother factor that influences the condition is inappropriate exercise. During the period of rapid growth, young dogs should be discouraged from jumping up and down (such as jumping up to catch a ball), and from standing up on their back legs. Also running on pavement should be eliminated.\n\nSymptoms Of A Dysplasic Hip The hip joint is a “ball-and-socket” joint. The ball is the head of the femur and the socket is the acetabulum of the pelvis. In a dysplastic joint, the head of the femur fits loosely into a poorly developed, shallow acetabulum. In severe cases, the head of the femur is completely out of the joint and arthritic changes are marked. Joint instability and wear occurs as muscular development lags behind the rate of skeletal growth.\n\nThe age of onset hip dysplasia is 4 to 12 months of age. The affected puppy will show pain in the hip, walk with a limp or a swaying gait, and experience difficulty in the hindquarters when getting up. When placed on his back, the puppy will show pain and discomfort when the rear legs are extended into a frog-like position.\n\nDiagnosis And Treatment A proper diagnosis can only be accomplished with an x-ray of the hips and pelvis. A major problem with performing an x-ray is that the dog will be required to be under heavy sedation or anesthesia, which carries its own set of risks. If you do opt to carry out the test, the x-ray will allow your veterinarian to grade the severity of your pet’s hip dysplasia, which ranges from mild to severe. The diagnosis depends on the placement of the head of the femur into the acetabulum. Once the condition is this severe, it cannot be reversed. Lameness is unpredictable and can be present or not noticed.\n\nThere are some procedures that can give your pet some relief for the pain. These include acupuncture, veterinary skeletal chiropractic adjustments, massage, hydrotherapy, and if required, pain medication.\n\nAcupuncture and Acupressure Many pet owners have touted acupuncture as a great means to help relieve chronic pain from hip dysplasia. This ancient form of Chinese has no negative side effects and it is a good treatment method to try to provide your pet some comfort and improve their mobility.\n\nAcupressure is similar to acupuncture except that instead of using needles, the practitioners hands, elbows and knees are used to maintain light pressure on the same meridian points that are used in acupuncture. Acupressure is easier for those that wish to perform at-home treatments for their ailing pet. There are a variety of books and how-to videos out there to help you get started. Just make sure to consult with your veterinarian before you start to attempt this treatment yourself.\n\nChiropractic Care When the hips are in bad shape, the rest of the body will often overcompensate to relieve the damaged joint. After a while, this unbalanced distribution of weight can cause your pet’s spine to misalign. That’s why regular visits to the chiropractor are a good idea for your pet to help rectify this and prevent further issues down the road.\n\nMassage A licensed massage therapist can help improve your pet’s stiff and aching limbs and reduce discomfort from hip dysplasia. Many people also swear by massage therapy to help those suffering from arthritis and muscle strain.\n\nHydrotherapy When your pet’s hips are damaged, one of the most important things to regulate is your dog’s body weight. Excess weight on your pet will put added stress on the hips and cause increased pain. This often causes your pet to become more sedentary which only exuberates the condition. Hydrotherapy offers your pet a low impact form of exercise, helping to promote mobility and weight loss as well as to reduce the stiffness in the muscles and joints.\n\nPain Medication Use of NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and other anti-inflammatory drugs can help to temporarily relieve pain but are not recommended for prolonged use. These strong pain medicines put excess stress on the liver and can cause a variety of other negative side effects.\n\nA safer alternative to NSAIDs is the use of homeopathic pain relievers. Here are two that we recommend:\n\nFor topical relief try Organic Lavender Noni Lotion from Hawaiian Health Ohana.\n\nfrom Hawaiian Health Ohana. For internal use, Traumeel from Heel USA is great. These two products are non-invasive and have been reported by our customers to be the most effective remedies for muscle and joint pain.\n\nPrevention Is Key Research studies have indicated that nutrition plays an important role in preventing and treating this condition. Studies have shown that approximately 60% of all influencing factors for hip dysplasia are environmental in nature – one of those factors being what we feed out pets. The nutritional influence on this condition is the reason why our clients seek the help of a raw meat diet.\n\nFeeding a balanced, biologically appropriate diet that supports steady growth and reduces the obesity factors is critical to the prevention of hip dysplasia.\n\nRobert Mueller, BSc, Pharm. is a registered pharmacist, author of \"Living Enzymes: The World's Best Kept Pet Food Secret\", and co-developer of BARF World's BARF diets patties, nuggets and supplements - the first company to make the Biologically Appropriate Raw Foods (BARF) diet conveniently available to animals everywhere.

  "latent_13803": "The debate about the suitability of Confederate generals as national heroes invites us to search the past for figures who better exemplify our declared ideals of democracy and equality.\n\nA little-known radical abolitionist from the 18th century, Benjamin Lay, deserves our consideration. Two generations before the emergence of an anti-slavery movement, Lay, a Quaker and a dwarf, endured persecution and ridicule as he fiercely attacked slavery and imagined a new, more humane way of life. Lay was born of humble origins in England in 1682, labored on the high seas, sailed to Barbados where he first witnessed the horrors of slavery, and then settled in Philadelphia—where he utilized dramatic guerilla theater in his fight against prominent Quaker (and other) slave owners. His long, lonely fight against bondage was nothing short of heroic. He deserves to be remembered and honored.\n\nLay staged public protests against wealthy Quakers to shock the Friends of Philadelphia into awareness of their own moral failings about slavery. Conscious of the hard, exploited labor that went into making seemingly benign commodities such as tobacco and sugar, Lay showed up at a Quaker yearly meeting with “three large tobacco pipes stuck in his bosom.” He sat between the galleries of men and women elders and ministers. As the meeting ended, he rose in indignant silence and “dashed one pipe among the men ministers, one among the women ministers, and the third among the congregation assembled.” With each smashing blow Lay protested slave labor, luxury, and the poor health caused by smoking the stinking sotweed. He sought to awaken his brothers and sisters to the politics of the smallest, seemingly most insignificant choices.\n\nWhen winter rolled in, Lay used a deep recent snowfall to make a point to Quaker slave owners. He stood on a Sunday morning at a gateway to the Quaker meetinghouse, knowing all Friends would pass his way. He left “his right leg and foot entirely uncovered” and placed them in the snow. Like the ancient philosopher Diogenes, who also walked barefoot in snow, he again sought to shock his contemporaries into awareness.\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nOne Quaker after another took notice and expressed concern, urging Lay not to expose himself to the freezing cold. He would surely get sick. Lay listened carefully to their words, then replied, “Ah, you pretend compassion for me but you do not feel for the poor slaves in your fields, who go all winter half clad.” He made two points: First, anyone without proper clothing in cold weather deserved compassion. Second, Quakers were not practicing a maxim central to their faith, drawn from Matthew 7:12, “Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.” So saith Lay the prophet.\n\nOn another occasion, Lay called one morning on an unnamed gentleman “of considerable note,” who politely invited him to sit down to breakfast with his family. As Lay began to take his place at the table he saw a man of African descent appear at the door of the dining room to serve the meal. Lay turned somberly to his acquaintance and asked, “Dost thou keep any Negro slaves in thy family?” When the gentleman answered yes, he did indeed keep slaves, Lay pushed back and stood up from the table. He announced, “Then I will not partake with thee, of the fruits of thy unrighteousness.” Lay would have no intercourse with those who owned slaves. He walked out.\n\nLay also began to disrupt Quaker meetings in and around Philadelphia. The 19th-century radical Quaker Isaac Hopper relayed the following story, which he had apparently heard as a child, to fellow abolitionist Lydia Maria Child:\n\nAt the Monthly meeting of Friends [Lay] was a diligent attendant.\n\nAt that time, many members of the society were slaveholders. Benjamin gave no peace to anyone of that description. As sure as any character attempted to speak to the business of the meeting, he would start to his feet and cry out, “There’s another negro-master!”\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nNever afraid to point the finger of shame, Lay insisted that slave holding and Quakerism were utterly incompatible. “No justice, no peace” was his message.\n\nLay carried his guerrilla theater across the city, visiting a variety of churches and ranting at ministers he disliked, just as he had done in London and Colchester. According to Roberts Vaux, he “attended all places of public worship, without regard to the religious professions of their congregations,” sometimes in sackcloth to emphasize his humility before God. He listened to the sermons and judged them, usually harshly. His responses “were sometimes so long and vehement as to require his removal from the house; an act to which he always submitted without opposition.” When an ungodly minister owned slaves, as was not uncommon in Philadelphia, Lay doubled his wrath.\n\nThese rants sometimes went awry. Ministers did not as a rule welcome a stranger’s harangue, least of all in the presence of their congregation. When a Philadelphia preacher announced during a sermon that he heard “a voice from Heaven,” Lay blurted out that “from thy life, and preaching, I question whether thou ever heardst a voice from heaven in thy life, and if thou didst, I am sure thou hast not obeyed it.” Outraged, the clergyman seized a bullwhip and chased his critic from the church. Yet, not all congregants took Lay’s interventions so seriously. On another occasion, Lay went to (Anglican) Christ Church in Philadelphia to hear the Reverend Robert Jenney preach about Judgment Day. As the congregation filed out of the church Lay stood at the door and asked person after person, “How can you, by such preaching as you have been hearing, distinguish the sheep from the goats?” A gentleman grabbed Lay’s bushy beard, gave it a hard tug, and said merrily, “By their beards, Benjamin, by their beards.”\n\nThese spectacular prophetic performances repeatedly dramatized what was wrong in both the Society of Friends and the world at large. For a quarter century, Lay railed against slavery in one Quaker meeting after another, in and around Philadelphia, confronting slave owners and slave traders with a savage, most un-Quaker-like fury. Whenever he performed guerrilla theater, his fellow Quakers removed him by physical force as a “trouble-maker” or “disorderly person.” He did not struggle against eviction, but back he came, again and again, undeterred, or rather more determined than ever.\n\nHe began to stage his theater of apocalyptic outrage in public venues, including city streets and markets. He refused to be cowed by the rich and powerful as he freely spoke his mind. He practiced what the ancient Greeks called parrhesia—free, fearless speech, which required courage in the face of danger. He insisted on the utter depravity and sinfulness of “Man-stealers,” who were, in his view, the literal spawn of Satan. He considered it his Godly duty to expose and drive them out. His confrontational methods made people talk: about him, his ideas, the nature of Quakerism and Christianity, and, most of all, slavery. His first biographer, Benjamin Rush—physician, reformer, abolitionist, and signer of the Declaration of Independence—noted that “there was a time when the name of this celebrated Christian Philosopher. . . was familiar to every man, woman, and to nearly every child, in Pennsylvania.” For or against, everyone told stories about Benjamin Lay.\n\nThe zealot carried his activism into print, publishing in 1738 one of the world’s first books to demand the abolition of slavery: All Slave-Keepers That Keep the Innocent in Bondage, Apostates. All enslaved people were innocent, Lay believed, so he called for all to be emancipated, immediately and unconditionally, with no compensation to slave owners. Slave keepers had transgressed the core beliefs of Quakerism in particular and Christianity in general: they should be cast out of the church. Lay wrote his book at a time when slavery seemed to many people around the world as natural and unchangeable as the sun, the moon, and the stars in the heavens. No one had ever taken such a militant, uncompromising, universal stand against slavery in print or in action. Lay demanded freedom now.\n\nPerhaps because he had little education, Lay ignored the rules of convention in writing his book. It made for odd reading, then and since, but it is a veritable treasure trove for a historian: a mixture of autobiography; prophetic Biblical polemic against slavery; a commonplace book into which he dropped writings by others as well as his own thoughts on a variety of subjects: haunting, surreal descriptions of slavery in Barbados; an annotated bibliography of what he read; and a vivid, scathing account of his own struggles against slave owners within the Quaker community. It is a founding text of Atlantic antislavery.\n\nLay knew that the wealthy Quakers who vetted all publications would never approve his book. Most of them owned slaves. So he went directly to his friend, the printer Benjamin Franklin, and asked him to publish it. When Franklin saw a confused jumble of pages in a box he expressed puzzlement about how to proceed. Lay answered, “Print any part thou pleaseth first”—assemble the materials in any order you like. As one exasperated reader later noted of the different parts of the book, “the head might serve for the tail, and the tail for the body, and the body for the head, either end for the middle, and the middle for either end; nay, if you could turn them inside out, like a glove, they would be no worse for the operation.” (Lay was one of the world’s first postmodernists.) Franklin agreed to publish the ringing rant against slavery, knowing full well that the weighty Quakers assailed in it would howl in protest. He quietly left the printer’s name off the title page.\n\n*\n\nPart of Lay’s guerrilla theater was his distinctive appearance. He was a dwarf or “little person,” standing a little over four feet tall. He was also called a “hunchback,” meaning that he suffered from over-curvature of the thoracic vertebrae, a medical condition called kyphosis. According to a fellow Quaker,\n\nHis head was large in proportion to his body; the features of his face were remarkable, and boldly delineated, and his countenance was grave and benignant. He was hunch-backed, with a projecting chest, below which his body became much contracted. His legs were so slender, as to appear almost unequal to the purpose of supporting him, diminutive as his frame was, in comparison with the ordinary size of the human stature. A habit he had contracted, of standing in a twisted position, with one hand resting upon his left hip, added to the effect produced by a large white beard, that for many years had not been shaved, contributed to make his figure perfectly unique.\n\nLay’s wife, Sarah, was also a “little person,” which caused the enslaved Africans of Barbados to remark in delighted wonder, “That little backarar [white] man go all over world see for [to look for] that backarar woman for himself.” Yet Sarah was more than a help-meet; she was a principled abolitionist in her own right. Lay was by some definition “disabled,” or handicapped, but I have found no evidence that he thought himself in any way diminished, nor that his body kept him from doing anything he wanted to do. He called himself “little Benjamin” but he also likened himself to “little David” who slew Goliath. He did not lack confidence in himself or his ideas.\n\nLay’s prophecy speaks to our time. He predicted that for Quakers and for America, slave keeping would be a long, destructive burden. It “will be as the poison of Dragons, and the cruel Venom of Asps, in the end, or I am mistaken.” As it happens, the poison and the venom have had long lives indeed. We still live with the consequences of slavery: prejudice, poverty, deep structural inequality, and premature death. Just as tellingly, Lay counseled his readers to beware rich men who “poison the World for Gain.” It may have taken more than two and half centuries, but it seems that the world is finally beginning to catch up with the prophet’s radical, far-reaching ideas through a growing, if far from universal, environmental consciousness.\n\nIt is time to make a prominent place for Benjamin Lay in American history. We live in a time when some of those once regarded as national heroes are being removed from their pedestals. Lay embodies a set of higher ideals and is a more suitable hero for a society that claims democracy and equality as its core historical values.\n\n__________________________________\n\nFrom The Fearless Benjamin Lay: The Quaker Dwarf Who Became the First Revolutionary Abolitionist, by Marcus Rediker.

How many M&M's fit into a Klein Bottle?\n\nI cannot squeeze M&Ms into my Classical Klein Bottles, because the neck diameter is slightly less than the diameter of an M&M. But you can put them into a Bottom Mouth Erlenmeyer (I use wider diameter tubing for this type of Klein Bottle. Which leads to the obvious question: How many M&M's are there inside this Klein Bottle?\n\nRemember, these Klein Bottles have Zero volume. And they're one-sided. No edges. Nonorientable. Nonvolatile.\n\nHERE IS THE WINNING ENTRY\n\nJune 2002: I took a *long* time to tabulate the entries. Mainly, I was lazy, what with about 300 entries. The answer is 547 M&M's. Most guesses were in the 200 to 400 region, with many \"zeros\" and \"all in the world\" and a couple \"infinities\". About ten entries were wonderful: sonnets, poems, haiku, and generally nice writing. I'll post 'em when I find the time...\n\n23 Sept 2001: CONTEST IS NOW CLOSED - I AM TABULATING THE RESULTS AND COUNTING M&M's.. About 100 entries came in (a few people entered twice). I'll read all the email this week, figure out which are the best entries, and notify winners, and post the results here,. Probably around the end of September.\n\nSept 27, 2001 -- I've been reading entries (but I haven't yet counted the M&M's). (A short summary: 93 legible entries arrived; 2 or 3 people entered twice; many UK entries, several delightful notes, poems, haiku, and a most fascinating scientific paper. How can I judge this one???)\n\nHere's a standard Acme bottom-mouth Klein Bottle, made of borosilicate glass. It's filled all the way with M&Ms, from the mouth through the nexus, up through the top loop, and into the reservoir.\n\nContest rules:\n\nOne entry per person, unless you have several real good ideas. But if you enter many times, and they're all boring entries, the judges will probably reduce your score.\n\nEntries can be via email to the usual email address at this domain dot com, letter, postcard, package, teleportation, mental imagery, bowling ball, or other media. If you send email, please use the word \"Contest\" someplace in the subject header, so that my filter will correctly route your email. (I am *not* collecting email addresses to spam. Indeed, I probably won't reply to most entries unless you ask me to.)\n\nWinner may be judged on accuracy, precision, creativity, rhyming & meter, basal metabolism, or some other criteria.\n\nAxolotls are not allowed to enter, unless landbased.\n\nRules may change depending on the whims of the judge(s). Feel free to mix metaphors.\n\nEach entry become the property of Acme Klein Bottle, and may be used by Acme to promote or demote its goods. I'm baffled how I could do so, but I figure I might as well say so.\n\nIf nobody enters, I'll eat those M&M's myself. (aah- as of August 13, entries are arriving at the astounding rate of one per day. Just 1 more month...)\n\nWinner receives the bottom-mouth Erlenmeyer Klein Bottle pictured below, including the M&M's (which will be somewhat stale by then). For a really fantastic entry, I may send a Klein Stein of M&M's.\n\nRunner up receives a Klein Bottle Hat . Honorable mention gets a Baby Klein Bottle.\n\nContest ends on the 2001 Autumnal Equinox, whenever that is. I'll post a list of winners here, unless you demand anonymity. No purchase required, but it sure won't hurt...\n\nCONTEST ENDS SEPT 22, 2001 at 4:05 PM Pacific Daylight Time (As of Sept 20th, about 80 people have entered. I haven't looked at the entries yet.)\n\nSame Klein Bottle, but with a calibration label to help you count the M&M's. A Close Up of the Klein Bottle. Notice that there are no Blue M&M's in here. Question: how many blue M&Ms were removed from the mixture?",
  "latent_13880": "About 800 employees from the University of Southern California’s Keck Hospital planned to strike Wednesday over wages and benefits, according to the National Union of Healthcare Workers. The group was set to hold a rally in front of the hospital at noon.\n\nThe union said that 1,200 nurses represented by the California Nurses Association were also scheduled to hold an informational picket line from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. and that about 100 contract employees who work in the hospital's cafeteria were rallying as well.\n\nHospital administrators brought in contract workers in anticipation of the strike.\n\nAccording to the union, one in six of the 900 hospital workers earn less than $15 per hour. A hospital spokesperson refuted that figure.\n\nThe union also said Keck workers don't receive the same retirement-plan contribution USC gives to its other employees.\n\n\"Keck-USC also denies these workers, many of whom are people of color, the tuition assistance benefit it offers to the rest of its workers, which provides financial assistance to the children of USC workers who are admitted to the university,\" the union said in a statement.\n\nAccording to the hospital, that benefit isn't available to \"any other represented group within the Keck Health System. Any allegations that our refusal to concede on this benefit is discriminatory are patently untrue.\"\n\nKeck Medical Center CEO Rod Hanners said that the hospital has been negotiating a new contract with its employees for almost a year and has been “making great progress.” He added that matters concerning the cafeteria workers, who are employed by Sodexo, aren’t within the hospital’s purview.\n\nEnrico Dines of Sodexo said that the company is evaluating a proposal laid out by the union at a meeting on Tuesday and that they plan to meet again in March.\n\n“The patients, they need care,” said Diluvian Oliva, a Keck cafeteria employee who joined the strike Wednesday. “We need to wipe off their tables. We need to help them sit up. We need to see if everything is OK.”\n\nOliva said that the group came out on Wednesday with heavy hearts.\n\n“We are worried about our patients of course… If we miss one day, they notice us,” she said. “We're the ones that come in with the smile; we come in with the customer service; we come in ready to work. But we also ask the Keck-USC looks at us with respect.”",
  "latent_13934": "Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nTwo Gazan women were caught on Wednesday smuggling explosives from Gaza into Israel for Hamas. The sisters hid the weapons in medical supplies they had been given in Israel, after one had been treated here for cancer.\n\nLast month, Deputy Defense Minister Eli Ben-Dahan revealed that Hamas was using Gazan cancer victims as mules to smuggle money and gold into Israel to finance terrorist operations.\n\nEveryone remembers Wafa Samir Ibrahim al-Biss, the 21-year-old Palestinian woman from Gaza who in 2005 was caught wearing 10 kilo of explosives in her underwear, en route to blowup Soroka-University Medical Center in Beersheba where she was being treated for burns.She admitted to being recruited by Fatah’s Aksa Martyrs Brigade, and added that she had wanted to kill as many Israeli children in the hospital as possible.Despite the security risk, Israel annually allows tens of thousands of Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip for medical treatment in Israel (and in the West Bank and Jordan).I know this firsthand. For a decade I served as a public affairs and development officer at Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer, the largest hospital in the Middle East. At any given time, one-quarter of all patients in that institution’s Edmond and Lily Safra Children’s Hospital are Arabs from Gaza.Treating these children from enemy Hamastan is a complex humanitarian commitment that stems from compassion that is ingrained in Jewish history and tradition.The doctors and administrators at Sheba (and other Israeli hospitals that offer similar care to Palestinians from the West Bank, to Syrian refugees, and quietly, to Arabs from across the Mideast) are proud of their efforts.But it hurts when wicked forces exploit this professionalism and goodwill for nefarious purposes; when they abuse our humanitarian generosity to commit terrorism.I was eyewitness to the following sordid tale.Several years ago, there was an eight-year-old Palestinian boy ill with a rare form of cancer. He was clearly going to die without a bone marrow transplant, and was brought to Sheba.Sheba worked hard to obtain permission to enter Gaza and test the child’s relatives, until doctors found an 18-year-old brother who was an almost perfect bone marrow match. The problem was that Israeli authorities didn’t want to grant this brother entry to Israel for the operation, because he was a hard-core Hamas activist with ties to known terrorist operatives.Nevertheless, a number of doctors at the hospital successfully petitioned the Defense Ministry to grant special dispensation and allow the older brother into Israel, in order to save his little brother’s life.The older brother arrived late Friday afternoon.The doctors began the delicate procedure.Within a 24-hour window, the plan was to suppress the patient’s immune system, harvest the bone marrow from the donor brother, and carry out the transplant.But Friday night at midnight, when it was time for the donor brother to do his part, he was gone.Disappeared! The doctors went crazy. One nurse said: I saw two Shin Bet agents come and take him away. This was a death sentence for the sick eight-year-old Palestinian child.What do you do in the middle of the night? The hospital director called the Prime Minister’s Office (which oversees the security services).Where is my bone-marrow donor, he demanded to know! Within two hours, a very senior security official was on the line admitting that, yes, the Shin Bet took him away. You see, the Shin Bet had been taking precautions. It had been eavesdropping on the 18-year-old’s cellphone conversations.And from within the Israeli hospital to which he had been specially brought in order to save the life of his younger brother, this youthful Palestinian terrorist had been giving instructions on the phone to his Hamas handlers in Gaza on how to get past security at Sheba Medical Center and blow the place up.(The end of the story is that, despite this outrage, the director of the hospital asked that the young terrorist be returned to the hospital for a few hours in order to save the life of the eightyear- old. The Shin Bet brought him back at 4 a.m. in leg irons to donate bone marrow, and the doctors indeed managed to save his baby brother’s life. Then the 18-year-old terrorist was whisked away again.) Needless to say, this story makes the blood boil. It stings to be taken advantage of by radical Palestinians; to act with humanity and compassion, while our enemies act with inhumanity and cruelty.The story exacerbates our sense of isolation and demonization, when in fact, the demons are those would blow up an Israeli hospital that is going out of its way to treat Palestinians, and even Hamas family members. The story breeds Israeli indignation, rightfully and righteously so.It also adds to our chagrin about being unappreciated by the world. Let’s say I had told this story to a senior foreign journalist (something that wasn’t possible at the time) like The New York Times correspondent in Israel. Do you think the paper would have run the story? Do you think the paper would have made such a story – sympathetic to Israel and severely unflattering to Palestinians – a front-page feature? Unlikely. I can tell you from years as a professional spokesman for Israeli medical, academic, defense and diplomatic institutions just how difficult it is to get a story placed that doesn’t fit the conventional, politically correct line about Israel being the victimizer and the Palestinians the victims.A direct line runs between this bias and the suave op-ed article by Palestinian “leader and parliamentarian” Marwan Barghouti published in the Times this week.That paper never would have run an op-ed by convicted Taliban or al-Qaida terrorist sitting in Guantanamo Bay, and certainly not without correctly labeling him as a convicted mass murderer.So why didn’t the Times brand Barghouti in this way? Because doing so would be unflattering to the Palestinian national movement, and by inference too sympathetic to Israel.www.davidmweinberg.com\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

Read on for more details.The requirement for utilities will progressively ramp up, from 0.5% of total power supply by June 2012, to 1.5% the following year, to 3% by June 2014, then 6% by June 2015. This might not seem like much, but for solar power, it would be a big step forward, and 6% of the power supply of Illinois is still a pretty significant amount of power.\n\nThis new mandate will work in conjunction with the more general state target of 25% of energy from renewables by 2025.\n\nThe second bill that was signed into law protects the rights of homeowners to install solar panels on their roofs and prevents homeowner associations from banning rooftop PV. They can still create guidelines, and I bet that some associations will try to indirectly ban solar panels using those, but it's a step in the right direction.\n\nLet's hope other states are paying attention...

  "latent_14040": "• Those out of work and claiming unemployment benefits rose by 2,400 in January, against forecasts of a fall.\n\n• Highest number of vacancies since three months to Jan 2009\n\nWages have fallen to a five-month low, the Office for National Statistics said. Average weekly earnings stood at just 1.8pc in December 2010, down from 2.1pc the month before. Workers were typically paid £456 a week in total in December.\n\nUnemployment also rose by 44,000 in the three months to December 2010 to reach 2.49m, the figures revealed. The claimant count grew unexpectedly by 2,400 between December and January, to reach 1.46m, the ONS said.\n\nThe figures come as consumer prices index (CPI) inflation surged to 4pc in January, double the Government's target.\n\nMillions of workers will be hit by the effective pay cuts amid the rising cost of living - its highest level in more than two years.\n\nHowever, Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said the slow down in wage growth was \"rare good news\" for the Bank of England. He said: \"This indicates that higher inflation and rising household inflation expectations are so far not feeding through to push up wages.\"\n\nHe added: \"The main test is yet to come with many of the pay agreements for 2011 yet to be settled - and future pay developments will play a critical role in determining exactly when and how quickly the Bank of England will raise interest rates. We expect wage growth will remain muted due to workers' weak bargaining position given high and likely to rise unemployment. This is a key factor underpinning our belief that the Bank of England will only raise interest rates gradually even if they act in the near term, which is looking increasingly likely.\"\n\nEmployment experts warned the worsening unemployment figures serve to show the fragility of the labour market, with workers lucky to be in a job rather than being in a position to negotiate higher wages.\n\nThe youth unemployment rate swelled to 20.5pc, up 1.5pc on the quarter and the highest figure since comparable records began in 1992. The number of young people out of work is closing in one the 1m mark, at 965,000, the highest figure since comparable records began.\n\nThe number of people in work fell by 68,000 over the quarter to reach 29.12m, the figures from the ONS revealed.\n\nHowever, the number of employees working part-time fell by 62,000 on the quarter to reach 6.69m. The fall occured entirely among women. But the number of people working part-time or in self-employment because they could not find full-time jobs increased by 44,000 on the quarter to reach 1.19m, the highest figure since records began in 1992.\n\nThe number of people working full-time increased by 66,000 on the quarter to reach 18.2m, rising among both men and women.\n\nBrian Johnson, an insolvency practitioner at HW Fisher & Company accountants, said: \"Unemployment is certain to rise further during 2011. Public sector cuts are still in their infancy and the private sector is on the rack. It's unrealistic to think that the private sector can take up the public sector slack.\"\n\nHe added: \"This week's inflation figures are going to have a major effect on unemployment levels moving forward. Rate rises in the near future now look certain and increased borrowing and loan repayment costs will further inhibit many struggling companies. If employment in the SME sector is going to rise, the banks need to lend to fund expansion growth.\"\n\nThe ONS figures also showed that the number of economically inactive people rose by 93,000 over the quarter to reach 9.36m. Of those, the number of people who had taken retirement before reaching the age of 65 grew by 49,000 over the period, to reach 1.57m - the highest figure since records began in 1993.\n\nHowever, the ONS said there were 500,000 job vacancies in the three months to January 2011 - up 40,000 from the three months to October and up 20,000 from a year earlier. The figures include temporary job vacancies arising from the 2011 Census. Excluding the Censue jobs, there were 466,000 vacancies up for grabs.\n\nAndrew Goodwin, senior economic advisor to the Ernst & Young ITEM Club, said: “These figures provide further confirmation that the labour market outlook is deteriorating.\n\n\"The ILO variables have continued to weaken - with employment falling and both unemployment and inactivity rising - but it is notable that the claimant count has now relapsed too. Though the rise in the claimant count might have been small, it is symbolic of the direction in which the labour market is heading.\"\n\nJob vacancies and career advice at Telegraph Jobs",

  "latent_14328": "Anyone else feel overwhelmed when it comes to making your guests feel at home? Why not try these easy tips to make your guests feel welcome!\n\nBeing hospitable isn’t something that has come naturally for me like I had hoped it would. I love and enjoy people, so somehow it just seemed like making guests feel welcome should be easy. And when it wasn’t, it caught me off guard and left me rather surprised. But I believe that hospitality is important and I’m finding that it’s definitely one of those things that gets easier the more I do it.\n\nMaybe you are like me and find hosting guests, especially overnight guests, a little daunting! Take heart, it really doesn’t have to be totally overwhelming. With a little planning and preparation, it can actually feel very manageable and even fun!\n\nWe semi-frequently have overnight guests and even though we live in a small house and our guest room also doubles as office and storage space, I still enjoy trying to provide as much of a Bed and Breakfast experience as possible. I rarely pull everything off flawlessly and I’m finding that having 3 children makes this much more challenging! But I keep trying and learning!\n\n7 Tips to Make Overnight Guests Feel Welcome\n\n1. Create a Welcoming Guest Room\n\nLittle touches can go a long way in making even not-so-nice spaces a bit more welcoming. A vase of flowers on the dresser, a welcome note for your guests saying how much you are looking forward to hosting them, a couple of chocolates on their pillow, even a bottle of water and a small snack such as a granola bar are nice! None of these things that take a lot of time or money, but they let your guest know that you anticipated them.\n\n2. Anticipate their needs\n\nAt minimum, I try to always have an alarm clock, tissues and a trash can in our guest room. Some other things you might want to consider:\n\nHave towels and wash clothes in the room or make sure guests know where to locate them and where to put them when they are done using them.\n\nwhere to put them when they are done using them. If you have wifi, provide the password for their use.\n\nCollect body wash, shampoo, toothpaste, lotion, toothbrushes etc. and put them in a cute basket in your guest room (I love using free samples or hotel freebies that I’ve collected for this.)\n\nPlace some extra pillows and blankets on the bed- everyone has different comfort levels and what you might think is enough actually isn’t!\n\nYou may even want to have a note pad and pen in an obvious spot in case they need them.\n\n3. Communicate\n\nIt makes it easier for you and your guests if you can clearly communicate your expectations. Talk to them about what time would work well for meals. Let them know of any plans that you have for when they are there. Find out what their expectations are of your time together- are there places they want to visit, things that they need to do? Will they need to do any laundry? Even something as simple as finding out if they prefer showering morning or evening and then talking about what times would work best is helpful. Because if you are like me, you find it much easier to relax and just take your time if you know that you aren’t taking up your hosts’ usual “shower slot”!\n\n4. Prep the Kids\n\nKids don’t just automatically know what is appropriate and inappropriate to do when there are guest around, it’s something they learn! Before your guests arrive discuss the your expectations basics with your kids. Explain how important it is to respect your visitor’s privacy. Remind them that other people’s personal things are not for them to mess with or use. Explain that they will need to be more quiet during the times when your guests are resting.\n\nIt’s also great if you can include them in helping to get ready for your guests. Encourage them to think about ways that they can make your guests feel welcome, especially if there are other kids.\n\nObviously, kids will be kids and even with prepping there will still likely be moments that aren’t ideal. But I’m always amazed at how much more smoothly things go when we make our expectations clear ahead of time!\n\n5. Keep Things Simple\n\nYou’ll save your self a lot of stress if you keep meals and activities very simple and basic. Realize that just by having other people around, you will not get as much done as you usually do.\n\nFor myself, I find that the more work I can do ahead of time to prepare for our guests, the more I feel free to just relax and enjoy them, which is what I really want to be able to do anyway! Plan out your meals and do as much meal ahead of time as possible. Think of other things that will help you be less busy such as getting all the laundry caught up or doing your weekly errands/grocery shopping before they arrive.\n\n6. Keep Things Clean & Tidy\n\nYou don’t need to keep your house spotless while you have guests- obviously you are living in it and there will be dirt. Besides, if you have kids it’s pretty much impossible to ever have a spotless house! But you do want your home to be welcoming and a place where your guests feel comfortable and relaxed.\n\nHere are some of the things that I try to do when we have overnight guests:\n\nAfter our guests go to bed, I do a quick walk-through of the main living areas and make sure that everything is in it’s place.\n\nIf needed, I’ll grab a broom or the vacuum and sweep up the worst of the dirt.\n\nI also make sure any shared bathrooms have clean sinks. Actually, I often kind of keep my eye on this throughout the day too because I just find splashed up, dirty bathroom counters gross.\n\n7. Relax\n\nMore than anything, relax and just enjoy your guests! As hard as you try, everything won’t go perfectly. There might be flopped recipes, late meals, embarrassing moments and unruly children. But stay calm, smile, laugh and keep focused on enjoying your guests. Because if you can stay relaxed, your guests most likely will too!\n\nWhat are your favorite ways to make guests feel welcome?",

  "latent_14432": "A total of £1,146,614 was handed out to the operators of 13 Scottish wind farms, including almost £300,000 for a development built on land owned by the Duke of Roxburghe.\n\nThe money, which ultimately comes from electricity consumers’ bills, was given to wind farm companies to compensate them for not producing power during periods of high generation and low demand.\n\nThis can happen when it is too windy so as not to overload the National Grid. Anti-wind farm campaigners fear the payments will only increase thanks to Alex Salmond’s drive for a large expansion in the number of turbines north of the Border.\n\nAccording to figures provided by the Renewable Energy Foundation (REF), a charity that publishes information on the energy sector, more than £1 million in such “constraint payments” were paid out on April 29.\n\nThe largest sum paid out on that date was £348,349, which was to shut off the Crystal Rig II wind farm operated by energy company Fred Olsen in East Lothian.\n\nHowever, the second-largest beneficiary was the Fallago Rig Wind Farm run by EDF on land it rents from Roxburghe in the Lammermuir Hills. The French energy firm was handed more than £296,000 to shut down the turbines, which only started generating electricity at the end of January.\n\nMurdo Fraser, a Conservative MSP and a prominent wind farm critic, said: “People struggling with rising electricity bills and growing levels of fuel poverty will be astonished to learn that millions are being paid to companies for power which isn’t even being used.\n\n“This illustrates yet again the folly of the SNP government’s wind energy policy.”\n\nDr John Constable, the REF's director, said: “Constraint payments to wind are well in excess of the lost subsidy income, suggesting that the industry is taking advantage of the difficulties that they cause on the network.\n\n“While perfectly legal, this is clearly unfair, and the regulator Ofgem needs to step in to protect the consumer.”\n\nAccording to the REF figures, enough wind-generated electricity to power 10,000 homes was “dumped” by the National Grid last month. A total of £3.6 million of constraint payments were made to wind farm companies in April, the highest monthly total since September 2011.\n\nEDF charged between £89 to £149 for every megawatt hour (MWh) of energy that was not produced, compared to £50 per MWh the company would have received for selling it.\n\nAlthough the Duke of Roxburghe will not benefit from the constraint payments, a recent book by Struan Stevenson, a Tory MEP, suggested the landowner could receive up to £1.5 million per year in rent.\n\nA spokesman for EDF said the constraint payments reflected the costs and lost revenues from shutting down the turbines.\n\nHe added: “All generators are required to have commercial agreements in place with the National Grid. These agreements cover periods when the Grid instructs generators to temporarily decrease the power they generate.”\n\nA spokesman for the National Grid said the payments spiked while maintenance was carried out.

  "latent_14609": "Mark Dantonio's Spartans and Pat Fitzgerald's Wildcats have often been able to outperform their efficiency rankings. US Presswire\n\nESPN’s Sports Analytics Team released its preseason Football Power Index last week, and the Big Ten took a bit of whooping.\n\nOnly three conference teams landed in the Top 25 of the rankings. The highest was Michigan at No. 11 -- significantly further down the food chain than most early preseason rankings expect the Wolverines to be.\n\nPoor rankings led to poor schedule strength. The five weakest schedules among Power 5 schools next season belong to Big Ten teams, according to the FPI. Only four Big Ten schedules are ranked in the Top 50 (none higher than Ohio State at No. 31) despite an East Division with three playoff contenders and some marquee non-conference games like Wisconsin vs. LSU and Ohio State vs. Oklahoma.\n\nIt’s important to remember the FPI is a statistical ranking determined by numbers and not people, but it does beg the question:\n\nWhy do the numbers hate the Big Ten?\n\nThe preseason rankings are built around four major components, each given different weight: performance in the past four years (with more emphasis on the most recent season), returning starters, recruiting rankings and coaching tenure. Most folks assume the recruiting rankings sink the Big Ten, but the first two factors actually have a more detrimental impact this season.\n\nFor example, Ohio State checks in at No. 17 on the list despite its 50-4 record over the past four seasons. The Buckeyes are three spots behind Notre Dame, a team they beat by two touchdowns in their most recent game. So why did they drop so far? Only six starters return from last season's team, which is the lowest number of any FBS team in the country.\n\n\"That’s a big thing impacting Ohio State. Michigan State is returning only 10, which is a pretty low number,\" said Sharon Katz from ESPN’s Stats & Information Group. \"If they were returning an average number (about 13), I think they’d be way higher.\"\n\nThe returning-starter metric gives extra weight to teams that return a starting quarterback -- another factor that hurt the Big Ten this year. Michigan State, Michigan, Penn State and Wisconsin all suffered because they are searching for a new starter under center this spring.\n\nIt’s also important to note the \"past performances\" category isn’t based on a team’s win-loss record, but its efficiency on offense and defense. That’s how Northwestern (10-3 in 2015) lands at No. 52, one spot behind Boston College, which didn’t beat an ACC team last season. The Wildcats won their close games. The Eagles didn’t. But the teams had comparable efficiency rankings (terrific on defense, dreadful on offense). The thought is both will move toward the mean.\n\nBut, if the numbers tell us a 10-win team with plenty of returning starters is comparable to a three-win Boston College that lost the leader of its top-notch defense ...\n\nWhy is the FPI using those numbers?\n\nWell, mostly because they work.\n\nThe main purpose of the FPI is to predict the winner of individual games. The rankings are only data points in a formula that determines who is more likely to win each matchup on a team’s schedule. And in that regard, the FPI has been pretty successful. Last season, it got 77.7 percent of its predictions correct (Oddsmakers in Las Vegas had a 78 percent success rate). The Prediction Tracker, a website that ranks rankings, had the FPI as the 12th most accurate system among the 68 that it tracks.\n\n\"If you’re a fan I completely understand, ... it’s all about the rankings,\" Katz said. \"To us the rankings are a means to an end.\"\n\nCan’t the FPI do better at ranking teams anyway?\n\nYes, of course. Predicting the actions of 20-year olds and the bounces of a prolate spheroid is difficult. The analytics team swings and misses on a few teams each season and tries to tweak its formula to account for those issues. For instance, last season they started given more consideration to programs that have experienced transfer quarterbacks replacing an outgoing starter at that spot.\n\nThere are problems that continue to vex those making the formula. How do you account for coaches that seem to always find a way to win? Teams like Mark Dantonio’s Michigan State and Pat Fitzgerald’s Northwestern outperformed their efficiency rankings, while Boston College clearly did not.\n\n\"We toyed with this offseason, how can we capture the 'Dantonio factor?'\" Katz said. \"I have a feeling that’s something in the next years we’ll try to dive into more. (Coaches like him) obviously have an impact as well.\"\n\nFor now, Big Ten fans will have to find solace in the idea that a few of the conference’s teams have a habit of outperforming the numbers. As for those weak strength of schedule rankings, though, they have only themselves to blame. Newcomers Maryland and Rutgers ranked 74th and 75th in the FPI this offseason. Only one Power 5 program (Kansas) was lower.",
  "latent_14628": "A Mensa meeting it's not.\n\nA Mensa meeting it's not.\n\nRepealing the law “root and branch” is probably out of the question, the chamber’s parliamentarian is hinting, because some parts of Obamacare don’t affect the federal budget. That’s a must in order to use the obscure procedure known in Senate parlance as reconciliation, which allows lawmakers to avoid the 60-vote filibuster hurdle and pass bills on a simple majority vote. […] The conundrum has many on the far right urging GOP leaders to take on the Senate parliamentarian, who will ultimately rule what can and cannot be repealed through reconciliation, and try to repeal the entire law using a one- or two-line sentence that simply reads: \"Repeal the Affordable Care Act.\" But policymakers and staff working on the matter are finding it's not so straightforward. The so-called Byrd rule prevents reconciliation from being used to make policy changes that don't affect the deficit, which is the main goal of the fast-track procedure. \"We're really just trying to game out all of the different options our members have to basically repeal in whole or in part,\" said one senior GOP Senate aide. \"We definitely are preparing to do only budgetary things.\"\n\nFive years after the fact, Republicans are learning yet again that slogans don't actually equate with policy. They're also figuring out that while it's really easy to hold 55 symbolic votes to repeal Obamacare, making it actually happen isn't so easy —never mind coming up with something to replace it with!That means lots of hard work. And it means trying to figure out what will save money instead of just costing—and because so many of the provisions actually raise significant amounts of revenue, it's really complicated to try to tease out that balance. The simple idea of \"repeal,\" sold by people with simple minds to voters with simple minds just isn't how it works in reality.\n\nBut they don't have to work in reality! That's because they have the \"fairy dust\" magic they created by imposing \"dynamic scoring\" on how the Congressional Budget Office figures out what stuff is going to cost. So they can at least make it all look like it could work, and on paper they can look like they're doing real stuff. And they know they won't have to suffer the consequences of it all blowing to hell, because a presidential veto will save them from that. So maybe this governing thing isn't that hard, after all.

But not all blackouts are created equal; there are two types, \"en bloc\" and \"fragmentary.\" As their names imply, fragmentary blackouts cause the drinker to not recall moments for small periods of time, whereas en bloc refers to larger periods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople who experience fragmentary blackouts, sometimes referred to as \"brownouts,\" can typically recall forgotten events once they're reminded of them. En bloc blackouts aren't so lucky. But both types are believed to be caused by the same thing, namely a neurophysiological, chemical disruption in the brain's hippocampus, a region integral to memory formation.\n\nAlcohol interferes with the receptors in the hippocampus that transmit glutamate, a compound that carries signals between neurons. During this interference, alcohol prevents some receptors from working, while activating others. This process causes the neurons to create steroids that then prevent neurons from communicating with each other properly, thus disrupting long-term potentiation (LTP), a process believed necessary for learning and memory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn simpler terms, the effect is similar to anterograde amnesia in that the brain temporarily loses the ability to create new memories. Blackout sufferers still may be able to partake in spirited discussions or send late-night emails to former employers. What they won't be able to do is create memories of any of it. And of course, there's a dark side to all this. Blackouts tend to indicate a high level of intoxication, during which time drinkers don't exhibit their best judgment, raising the risk of dangerous behavior such as having unprotected sex or driving a car.\n\nCan blackouts be avoided?\n\nAs is the case with many drinking-related woes, having a full stomach helps. Not eating will cause your blood alcohol level to elevate more quickly. Drinking less and slower also obviously helps. Studies show a blackout's main culprit to be a fast, dramatic spike in blood alcohol content; they usually kick in at blood alcohol levels of at least 0.15 percent. That's roughly twice the legal limit for driving. And the trouble really begins when this level is reached quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWomen may have a harder time avoiding blackouts since their blood alcohol content increases more quickly than men's. Not only do they tend to have less water in their bodies to disperse the alcohol, but they also have less gastric dehyrogenase, an enzyme that breaks down alcohol.\n\nThere also appears to be a tendency for people to revert back to blackout states once they start experiencing them, so you probably should lay off the sauce for a while after blacking out. But basically the way to avoid a blackout is either to not drink quite so much, or to at least drink it slower.\n\nDoes blacking out mean I'm an alcoholic?\n\nAddiction expert E. M. Jellinek, who started the first significant research on blackouts in the 1940s, believed blacking out was a sure sign of dependency. More recent studies tend to indicate this isn't always the case, as social binge drinkers—hey there, frat guys—are just as likely to experience blackouts as people who drink heavily on a daily basis. Basically, it all comes down to that sudden spike in blood alcohol content, though evidence suggests some people may have a genetic predisposition to blacking out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEither way, frequent blackouts should not be taken lightly. Aside from engaging in questionable behavior that you'd likely regret if you could remember, any time you alter your basic brain function in such a significant way leaves you open to long-term damage. basic functions in the brain are significantly altered could represent long-term damage.\n\n[NIH, LiveScience, WUSTL 1, 2, NYT, Drug Free, New Harvard Guide to Women's Health, Globe and Mail]\n\nImage credits: Shutterstock/yuriy kulik, Wiki Commons",

  "latent_15080": "X-Men: Days of Future Past has earned $90.7 million on its first weekend of release, with a Memorial Day four-day debut of $111m. That total that includes $8.1m worth of Thursday previews. That's a lower opening than the 2006 debut of X-Men: The Last Stand, which earned $102m Fri-Sun and $124m Fri-Mon over its Memorial Day debut. Heck, adjusted for inflation, it's a smaller Fri-Sun debut than X2: X-Men United ($85m back in 2003) about on par with X-Men Origins: Wolverine ($85m in 2009) and X-Men ($54m in 2000, which would be about $80m today without any 3D bump). The question becomes exactly how 20th Century Fox viewed this seventh X-Men picture. Was it merely intended to improve upon the box office fortunes of the last three installments, or was the \"franchise all-stars to the rescue\" super-sequel meant to shoot the 14-year old X-Men franchise to towering new box office heights? If it's the former, then the picture will certainly be a success. But in terms of relative comparisons to the X-Men franchise as a whole, it's coming up somewhat short. X-Men may no longer be a god among insects in America. I add that caveat because it also earned $191m overseas this weekend. So as of Monday, the film has already earned $302m worldwide, or more than the $296m total of the first X-Men.\n\nThe film's $91.4 million weekend is the third biggest of the year, behind Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($95m) and Godzilla ($93m), but ahead of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 ($91m). The good news is that the film played a little better than X-Men: The Last Stand over the long weekend. X-Men 3 opened with a $45m opening day (the second biggest on record) and then went on to earn $102m Fri-Sun (about $125m today not accounting for 3D) and $124m Fri-Sun (about $151m today), for a 2.7x four-day multiplier and an awful 2.2x Fri-Sun multiplier. This time around, X-Men: Days of Future Past earned $36m on opening day (the third-biggest of the year) for a 2.9x Fri-Mon multiplier and a solid 3x Fri-Sun multiplier. It's also the fifth-biggest Fri-Mon Memorial Day opener ever, behind Fast & Furious 6 ($117), X-Men: The Last Stand ($124m), Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ($126m), and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End ($153m, which included $13m worth of Thursday previews).\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past, which brings back Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen for a time-travel story that also involves James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, and (the now red-hot) Jennifer Lawrence, was supposed to scale new heights for the franchise or merely stem the relative bleeding domestically. If Fox was looking for a Fast Five-type breakout success, it will have to happen overseas. Memorial Day weekend openers generally have terrible legs over their domestic theatrical run. X-Men: The Last Stand earned just 1.88x its four-day figure overall, ending its domestic run with $235 million. Most Memorial Day openers aren't much better, with X-Men: The Last Stand, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, The Hangover part II, Fast & Furious 6, and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (the top five Memorial Day openers of all time prior to this weekend) doing around 1.85x-2.2x their 4 or 5 day debut figures.\n\nIt would seem at this juncture that the absolute best-case scenario is that X-Men: Days of Future Past ends its domestic total with $255m domestic (2.3x). That's a solid figure, but it's also below the $285m adjusted-for-inflation domestic totals of X2 and X-Men: The Last Stand. Like the Spider-Man reboot, it could be that the X-Men franchise, which was once one of the towering giants of the comic book superhero sub-genre, is now just another too-expensive fantasy property. The absolute nightmare scenario, and I'm not outright saying this is how it's going to go, is that X-Men: Days of Future Past performs exactly like X-Men: The Last Stand from here on out and ends its domestic run with $207m. It''s doing about average for the franchise in America, although it's clearly breaking out overseas.\n\nFox was arguably expecting that the return of Bryan Singer and the returning of the old cast members would cause X-Men: Days of Future Past to play like a proverbial X-Men 4, with the inflated budget to match. Like The Amazing Spider-Man 2, with great budgets come great expectations. I don't want to be too negative in case it performs like, for example, Fast Five, which earned $200m here and over $600m worldwide. The overseas marketplace has changed since 2006. It already earned $191m overseas in 100 markets, the vast majority of markets in which it will be playing. Considering that The Wolverine holds the record for overseas totals for a X-Men film at $282m, it would appear that at least a foreign record will be broken for an X-Men film. So does this mean that the domestic total is irrelevant? Maybe, but that remains to be seen. By the way, the film played 56% male, 59% over 25, 53% Caucasian, 20% African America,n 14% Asian, and 13% Hispanic.\n\nThe other major release was a somewhat shocking whiff. Warner Bros. (a division of Time Warner ) dropped the Adam Sandler/Drew Barrymore romantic comedy Blended as a form of counter-programming, but everyone who didn't see X-Men went to see Warner Bros.' Godzilla or Universal's Neighbors instead. Blended opened with just $14.45 million, outright terrible for a mainstream Adam Sandler comedy. The film will theoretically cross $18m by Monday. The good news is that it cost just $45m to produce, meaning $50m here and $50m overseas will put the film in eventual break-even form.\n\nThe implications for Sandler's box office pull as a mainstream comedy lead are troubling. This is one of Adam Sandler's worst domestic debuts as a headliner ever, or about what That's My Boy debuted with two summers ago. That one was a vulgar R-rated comedy. Blended was supposed to be a safe film, one that reignited Sandler's box office mojo by re-teaming him with his Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates co-star. Interestingly, it played 59% female and 71% over 25-years old. Even in an era of the declining movie star, Adam Sandler has been among the most consistent draws for a $35-$40m debut when he does PG-13 mainstream comedies.\n\nThis is pretty grim news for the star, even if the film is cheap enough to eventually make its money back. The good news is that if the Sandler brand is \"finally\" declining a bit, that means that perhaps Sandler will be open to more films like Punch Drunk Love or Reign Over Me. Say what you will about Jim Carrey's declining box office muscle, but it freed him up to take chances with films like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and I Love You Phillip Morris. No one stays on top forever, and perhaps if we stopped expecting them to than they'd be more open to more off-the-beaten path films.\n\nIn holdover news, Godzilla dropped a sharp 66% from last weekend, earning $31.4 million for the Fri-Sun frame and an expected $39m for the holiday. That's a harsh drop, even with competition from X-Men, but the film has $148.77m today and will still have $155m by Monday, or about its $160m budget. For what it's worth, the film surpassed the $136m domestic total of Roland Emmerich's Godzilla on Saturday. And Gareth Edwards's monster mash started the weekend with $220m worldwide, so a new cume of over $300m is all-but-certain (I'll probably be gone when the overseas numbers drop, so I'll update on Twitter). It's not quite the word-of-mouth sensation that some hoped, but with a likely final domestic total of around $200m-$220m, it's still a solid hit. Marketing Does Matter. And so do Reasonable Budgets.\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 earned $7.8 million over the Fri-Sun weekend, with a projected $10m holiday take. The Sony sequel finally crossed the $180m domestic mark yesterday, which is what Spider-Man 2 earned in six days back in 2004. The film will have $187m by Monday. Overseas is a better story, with $675m worldwide by the end of the holiday frame, including $90m in China. Again, if this one wasn't so expensive, if the Spider-Man series hadn't previously scaled taller heights, and if so much weren't riding on its success, it would be a solid hit. Mom's Night Out earned another $1m over the four-day weekend for a $8.6m cume.\n\nHeaven Is For Real is expected to have $2.55m for the holiday frame, giving it a new cume of $86m. Jon Favreau's Chef expanded to 498 theaters and grossed $2.26m over the Fri-Sun frame. It is on track to earn around $3m for the four-day frame, which would bring its domestic cume to $4.25m. Universal's Neighbors is still chugging, having earned another $13.9 million over the Fri-Sun frame and a projected $17m by Monday. That would give the $18m Seth Rogen/Zac Efron/Rose Byrne comedy a terrific $117m domestic and $181m worldwide cume.\n\nWalt Disney's Million Dollar Arm earned $7.09m for the Fri-Sun frame, with a projected four-day frame of $9m and a new $22m domestic cume (it crossed $20m today). At just $25m, the Jon Hamm vehicle may just break even if it can do even a little overseas business. The Cameron Diaz/Leslie Mann/Kate Upton bawdy comedy The Other Woman is sticking around, as the $40m Fox release has now earned around $78m after five weeks in domestic release. Oh, and Frozen ($1.219b) has now passed Iron Man 3 ($1.214b) to become 2013's biggest worldwide grosser. So for the record, domestic (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) and worldwide (Frozen) box office were topped by female-centric blockbusters in 2013. By all means, learn nothing from that.\n\nThat's it for today. Join us next weekend when Walt Disney debuts Angelina Jolie as Maleficent while Universal drops Seth McFarlane's all-star western comedy A Million Ways to Die in the West.

  "latent_15247": "The website of America’s largest bank appeared to be suffering sporadic downtime on Monday afternoon amid a flurry of voluntary distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks from “hacktivist” group “Anonymous.”\n\nWhile the site was still available at time of this story’s publication, reports were surfacing across Twitter noting infrequent outages. Raw Story was able to confirm, via two third party website verification services, the site’s technical difficulties on Monday (with screenshots here and here).\n\nGreg Mitchell, who pens The Nation‘s media blog, also noted sporadic outages on Bank of America’s domain.\n\n“Anonymous” had declared a cyber war against Bank of America over its refusal to process payments for secrets outlet WikiLeaks, which had claimed it possessed a large trove of files from a hard drive belonging to one of the bank’s executives. Other groups recently targeted for voluntary DDoS attacks included PayPal’s blog, MasterCard Worldwide, Visa and Swiss bank PostFinance.\n\nThe attacks were a response to the financial community’s decision to stop serving funds to WikiLeaks. PayPal, MasterCard and Visa have all suspended their business with the site.\n\nWhile prior efforts by “Anonymous” were successful in causing service interruptions at MasterCard and PostFinance, other attacks against Amazon.com — which kicked WikiLeaks off its servers — and Twitter — which banned an “Anonymous Operations” account for its participation in the campaign — ended in failure with the sites still online.\n\nOther sites, such as those for Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT) and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, were also recently targeted and subsequently went offline under a barrage of Internet traffic.\n\nWhile much of the international press characterizes the efforts of “Anonymous” as “hacking,” use of the term appears to reflect a mis-perception of reality, according to Evgeny Morozov, who wrote recently in Foreign Policy that voluntary DDoS networks actually represent the next generation sit-in protest.\n\n“[Both] aim at briefly disrupting a service or an institution in order to make a point,” he opined. “As long as we don’t criminalize all sit-ins, I don’t think we should aim at criminalizing all DDoS.”\n\nThe New York Times, in an editorial published Saturday, argued that the world’s largest financial institutions lining up against WikiLeaks posed a disturbing problem.\n\n“What would happen if a clutch of big banks decided that a particularly irksome blogger or other organization was ‘too risky’?” they asked. “What if they decided — one by one — to shut down financial access to a newspaper that was about to reveal irksome truths about their operations? This decision should not be left solely up to business-as-usual among the banks.”",
  "latent_15256": "By 2050, the National Football League (NFL) will be like the Barnum and Bailey Circus of today. Bankrupt, closed, irrelevant, morally passe.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the circus was all the rage. After a century of the product’s consumption by a culture increasingly sensitive to the abuse of the weak and helpless—in this case, circus animals—the “Greatest Show on Earth” has been relegated to an empty sideshow. It is simply too brutish for sophisticated moderns who wince at the crack of a whip on an elephant’s rump.\n\nFootball will soon follow. Its massive billion dollar stadiums and marketing machines seem immortal for now. But these titanic play pens will soon crumble under the same cultural force that killed the circus: our culture’s growing concern for victims.\n\nI am not judging football’s coming demise as a good or bad thing. I see it as simply a symptom of larger social forces that we should understand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe parallels of football and Roman gladiatorial games have been noted before. In the Colosseum, the Roman emperor would have a grand procession into the arena to the standing ovation of the assembled masses. Today, our U.S. Defense Department-sponsored games begin with the procession of the American flag and anthem. It is often accompanied by dramatic aerial flyovers by jet fighters and fireworks, symbolizing the transcendent might and grandeur of America’s military conquerings. So too, the Roman games often reenacted the empire’s greatest battles.\n\nToday’s latest controversy involves whether football players should stand united in honor of the flag. The sacredness of the flag rests in its long-standing ability to unify even enemies as the opposing teams simulate. Like any symbol, the flag serves as a vessel for people to place powerful emotions: memories of grandpa’s military service, apple pie, cookouts, neighborly support for one another are all wrapped in its colors.\n\nAbove all, the one thing the flag represents the most is the unifying power of sacrifice. We are united as one collective family in our reverence for the flag and anthem. The flag is sacred because it represents, as its loudest defenders proclaim, the blood shed by soldiers fighting for our freedoms.\n\nInterestingly, gladiatorial games were first started as sacrificial offerings accompanying funerals. It was thought that the blood spilled by slaves and captives honored the death of state leaders with the transcendent unity of the crowd. With every pitiful animal howl and human cry, citizens felt swept up as one body in collective satisfaction and relief from mundane rivalries and resentments.\n\nToday, governments like to take the suffering and courage of our sons and daughters who enlist and turn it into a marketing ploy for why we all need government coercion controlling our lives—who we hire, what we pay them, permission to cut hair, how big our sodas can be, how much we cook our milk, which drugs we can use to alter our minds, and so on. Governments also like to transmute our goosebumps we feel when the anthem plays into maintaining a trillion dollar annual foreign policy paid by debt created out of thin air and backed by the OPEC oil cartel’s energy markets.\n\nAt sporting events, our government captures the nostalgia we feel for neighborhood friendship and family pastimes, associates it with the anthem and flag, and then converts it into passive, numb surrender to perpetual warfare. Even while the nation divides over whether players should kneel or stand for the flag, our government continues to arm expand its military footprint overseas and drop more bombs, all in our name.\n\nBut the state, in collusion with powerful corporate allies, uses spectacles like football to distract and pacify the people. Instead of the violent slaughtering of Roman games, our Christianized culture sends players into simulated, padded warfare. We pick teams to unite our personal lives under and forget about the state’s socio- and economic abuses just outside our doorsteps. Studies even suggest that violent crime drops during major televised sporting events.\n\nBut now, Trump and his liberal mirror rivals have pierced the veil by injecting the NFL with the profanity of politics: the realm where real factions use real violence of the state to punish their rivals through regulations, mandates, and taxes. When Trump said “fire them” about the protesting players, invoking the specter of both the penal and paternal side of government, forcing people to take sides and not over the gridiron but at either side of the water cooler and dinner table, it did the game no favors.\n\nEventually, it took a church monk named Telemachus challenging the violent sacrifice of the Roman gladiatorial games to end their carnage. He climbed into the arena and protested until he was summarily slaughtered. His self-sacrifice for the defense of victims led to the public’s loss of appetite for the violence.The last known Roman gladiatorial event was in 404 AD, less than two decades after Telemachus’s death.\n\nToday, myriad scandals serve as a persistent Telemachus threatening to bring the NFL down. Mothers and fathers all around the country are pulling their sons out of football due to the increased revelations of concussions and resulting brain damage caused by the sport. Whereas Roman citizens demanded their fighters stripped of armor to maximize carnage, increased paddings will end up making players look like Michelin men with bobble head-sized helmets.\n\nIn Rome, no one cared how gladiators treated their lovers. Today, growing public disgust with widespread reports of spousal abuse is souring the NFL’s mystique.\n\nIn college, the NCAA’s state-protected profiteering off of unpaid players’ physical sacrifice is increasingly criticized as well.\n\nMeanwhile, diehard fans once thrilled by simulated violence are losing interest with ever constrained penalty rules and concussion concerns. The suspension of disbelief required to enjoy the game is waning: talks of brain damage, flags no longer able to unify people around soldiers’ sacrificial deaths, spousal abuse, and racial undertones are all exposing football as just a silly game to appease desires for tribalism and aggression—and make fat cat owners fatter. Not worth all the drama.\n\nWe should be proud that we do not send hungry lions into arenas with naked prisoners anymore. We have made progress because of Christianity’s leavening of the collective’s history-long abuse against the misfit person. Yet absent such gladiatorial games, our culture must confront our sacrifices of the innocent and nonviolent to appease our love for aggression as the means of keeping peace.\n\nDavid Gornoski is your neighbor—as well as an entrepreneur, speaker and writer.

  "latent_15414": "The team behind the Smach Z portable Steam Machine (i.e. handheld) has been disclosing a little more info as they are gearing towards their virtual social event on the 8th of December. While this project may sound like vaporware at this stage, at least they have now announced who plans to manufacture the console itself. ImasD Technologies.\n\nImasD technologies is a Spanish manufacturer that has been known for recently announcing (in March 2015) the Click-ARM tablet device, on which you can install any operating system (not limited to Android, but also Linux, Tizen).\n\nThe problem is that the said tablet was supposed to be available by Q3 2015 and as far as I could tell it has still not be released. So that puts some doubt as to whether ImasD, if proved legit, can even deliver something by end 2016 for the Smach Z project.\n\nSo, what else ? We have a new picture of the proposed machine. Here it is.\n\nThey have been bold enough to announce what kind of games you can actually play with it:\n\nPowerful enough to play any game on the market: Portal 2, DOTA, Left 4 Dead 2, Team Fortress 2, SOMA, Civilization V, Metro: Last Light Redux, Borderlands 2, The Witcher 2, …\n\nI understand they need to get the hype running, but I’m pretty sure the hardware they plan to use (“AMD embedded G-Series SoC “Steppe Eagle” with Jaguar-based CPU and GCN based Radeon graphics”) is not going to support very well some of these games (Witcher 2, Metro: Last Light Redux in particular). At least they did not risk mentioning that Shadow of Mordor would run on it, because we already know it runs not-too-well (here’s a euphemism for you), even with medium details, on the Alienware Steam Machine.\n\nHow about controls ? Well, it seems that they answer to the usual question “what if you don’t want to use the trackpads to play games?” is an interesting take on the problem:\n\nBut if you are “classic” gamer, and you prefer more traditional controls, SMACH Z will include magnetic adapters to configure physical controls your way. Just put the add-on on top of any of the touchpad and play.\n\nSo, they plan to address it with some additional parts to put on top of the trackpads. Not sure how well it would work in the end, but for now they are not shying away from the issue.\n\nThey will probably announce at least 2 models down the road, since the 4G connection bullet point refers to another version of the Smach Z:\n\n4G mobile network connectivity (PRO model only).\n\nAll in all, it will be very difficult to say how serious of a project this is until they disclose any video of a running prototype, or showcase one during an upcoming event in 2016. I certainly hope they plan to be either at an upcoming CES or E3 to let people try it by themselves before they launch a pre-order campaign.\n\nAt BoilingSteam, we strongly dislike ads and that is why you won't find any during your visit.

  "latent_15514": "He had known better than to marry. He’d seen his parents hurt each other, and leave, and hurt and leave others, the casual lovers, the stepparents. But he gave it a shot anyway, and it ended pretty much as he imagined, with him wandering the streets in tears.\n\nCyclists yelled at him on the Brooklyn Bridge. He found himself gripping something with fierce resolve. Looking down, he discovered a glossy postcard advertising two-for-one drinks during happy hour at a gentlemen’s club. He tried putting it away, but there was no back pocket. He was wearing his gray linen pajama pants. What did it matter? It was over. Nothing mattered.\n\nKnowing it was useless—she was gone, gone—he threw his cell phone into a trash can. When he came to his senses and returned for it, he searched and searched, but he had the wrong street corner.\n\nHe and his wife had married in Cuba (by way of Nicaragua) four years earlier, long before the embargo was lifted. They had thrilled to the risk, the style, of kicking off their days under staid old matrimony in such rebel fashion. There was a priest, and a punto band, and the beach, and the stars, and the northern wind, and everything about that night was emblematic of how they hoped to shape the years. Now they would divorce. Well, so what? Sooner or later, everyone got divorced.\n\nThere was motion and transition everywhere, the urgent, churning city, the cry of a siren fading around the block. At the Empire State Building, they tried to get him to take a tour.\n\nHeedless at the corners, he was nearly hit by a cab. He turned right for no reason, and on that block, as he walked, some invisible industrial fan seemed to whir violently, sending up trash. Suddenly, before his eyes, there was an aircraft carrier.\n\nWhen he returned to the bagel place, there was the usual line, but his hope dwindled with every face that wasn’t hers. He went around the block for the dozenth time. After that, he came untethered and wandered south.\n\nIt was no surprise where he wound up. He hoped to find her there. How he loved her—her face, her smile. He took a deep breath and entered the lobby.\n\n“Who is it?” she asked through an ancient intercom.\n\n“It’s Nick,” he said, and there followed the longest pause of his life. He had second thoughts. Was he presentable enough? Could he make the right impression? Another minute went by before she buzzed him in.\n\nThe elevator, an old cat hibernating on some upper floor, rattled to life when he called it and roared down to him. The doors opened, and he stepped forward with his head down . . . and a second later stepped back with his head up, as a family of four charged out—the father first, with the stride of a bandleader, then an excitable boy in a Viking hat blasting enemies with a caulk gun, then a German shepherd, then an older brother wearing athletic knee-highs and a soccer jersey as long as a gown, followed at last by Mom, stuck, with her rumpled flannel shirt and sweatpants, in the wrong family in the wrong season, crying out for Bill to be careful with the tomatoes.\n\n“Oh, my God,” she said, and stopped and stared. They had switched places: he was inside the elevator, and she was looking at him from the lobby. “I thought that was you.” She was gawking. She was tongue-tied. “You are just . . . awesome.”\n\n“Thank you,” he said, pressing the button to hurry the door along.\n\n“I mean it—I just love you.”\n\n“Thanks.”\n\nShe finally came to her senses, and a hand shot up to her mouth. “Oh, I’m so embarrassed!” she said. The door began to close. She waved. “Bye!”\n\nOn his way up, he put the family out of mind and returned to thinking about her—her face, her smile.\n\nHe stepped off the elevator, and there she was, on the phone, propping the apartment door open. One strap of her denim overalls hung off her shoulder, and when she saw him she smiled happily. Then he neared, and her happiness faded. She palmed the mouthpiece. “Is something wrong?” she said.\n\n“She’s gone.”\n\n“Who’s gone?”\n\n“My wife,” he said.\n\nShe frowned, waved him in, and hurried to get off the phone.\n\nHe moved inside, out of the way of the closing door. How many times in the past had he stood like this, on the brink, with the merciless eyes of a child? He took in the Santa Claus welcome mat many months out of season, the wicker basket against the far wall spilling over with sandals and tennis shoes, the lacquered console table on which the house keys and loose change had been tossed . . . and all the many colors, and vibes, and impressions, and the hundred other ways these perfect strangers chose to live. On, astonishingly, six other occasions, when his parents met other people, and fell in love, and married, and ordered the instant integration of two families’ lives, their laundry, and their lore (and, to often disastrous effect, their DNA)—the Morgans, followed by the Dinardos and the Teahans, on his mother’s side; the Winklows, the Andersons, and that insufferable Lee clan, on his father’s—he had stood like this, appraising and rejecting, and wanting nothing more than to return to the bunk bed in his first room, where all the linens and the wall shadows had been under a single, steady proprietorship. For as soon as his parents were married and moved in, and all the painful adjustments were made, they were divorcing again and moving out.\n\n“I’m sorry,” she said. “This will just take another minute.”\n\n“Are you alone?” he asked.\n\nShe raised a finger and looked away as she wrapped things up with customer service.\n\nA different stranger might have fled, but, as he was easy in unfamiliar surroundings—one of the virtues of his childhood—he made himself at home and casually took in the state of the apartment. It was a mess. There were toys everywhere, puzzle pieces communing with cereal flakes under the table, and a pink knit blanket on the hardwood floor which she presently swooped down on with furious efficiency (pocketing the cell phone at last) and folded as they approached the door leading into the next room.\n\n“I can’t believe it,” she was saying. “It’s really you!”\n\n“It’s really me,” he said. “Were you painting?”\n\n“Oh, trying to.” She put her finger to her lips. “We have to go through the baby’s room to get to the living room,” she whispered. “It’s the crazy way this apartment was designed. Try not to wake her!”\n\nMore family clutter awaited them in the living room. The table lamp was on in daylight, and there were cups on top of coasters. Wheeled toys on leads had been dropped mid-pull. A box of crayons had fallen in front of the sofa and fanned out around a carton of dried-out diaper wipes. She hurried to clear a spot for him, heaping stray items on top of a toy bin. He sat down and came up holding a yo-yo. She plucked it from his hand and, before sitting down next to him, gave it an underhand toss and hit the top of a beanbag.\n\n“So what happened?” she asked.\n\n“She went out this morning for bagels,” he said. “We have this routine on Sunday mornings—one of us runs out for bagels and the newspaper, and we spend the morning in bed.”\n\n“Oh, my God,” she said. “People still do that?”\n\n“But she never came home. I called and I called. She never picked up. She didn’t reply to my texts. I waited—I thought maybe she was taking a walk, you know, to clear her head, or whatever. But I don’t think so.”\n\n“Did you guys have a fight or something?”\n\n“This has been a long time coming,” he said.\n\n“I’m sorry to hear that,” she said. “Marriage is so hard.”\n\n“And, who knows, maybe she is out on a walk.”\n\n“How long has it been?”\n\n“Four hours?” he said. “Maybe five?”\n\n“That’s kind of a long walk,” she said.\n\nHe had met her at the Arts Fund annual gala, in a d.j.’d ballroom in the Paramount hotel, in midtown. Two grown women in diapers and pigtails were led around the crowd on a single leash before dinner, and men in mascara shook hands with spiky rings on all ten fingers. They were seated next to each other at a table that included Stephanie Savage and Ryan McGinley. She was Calarusso’s sometime assistant, there that night to see that the great man ate his soup. During appetizers, Nick learned that she painted in her spare time. By dessert, she was showing him thumbnails of her most recent work and promising to watch his series (if she could find the time to stream it on Netflix). It was not one of the shows that her friends were always telling her she just had to watch.\n\nAfter the thanks were doled out and the speeches concluded, Calarusso demanded to go home, and she went off to find him a car. The enormous painter, to whom Nick had not been introduced, turned to him and said, with tasteless relish, “The poor girl. She’s about to burn her life to the ground and she doesn’t even know it.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\nCalarusso’s eyes got wider and gleamed with mischief. “The husband’s grown fat.”\n\nAn hour later, with Calarusso gone, she suddenly confessed that it had been a little more than a million years since she was last out of the house, and she had overdone it. She had had too much to drink and needed to get home.\n\n“Let me drop you off,” he said.\n\n“No, it’s O.K. I can take the subway.”\n\n“Don’t be silly,” he said. “I have a car waiting outside.”\n\nHe had hoped that they would continue their conversation, but she fell asleep and slept straight through the sudden stops, the thundering starts, the potholes exploding beneath them like mortar bombs. Waiting for her at home, he imagined, was everything anyone could ever want, and she no longer saw much appeal in a stranger. She was above that now. He admired her for it. Her only vice these days? Stolen sleep.\n\nWhen the car pulled up to her building, he woke her gently, and she opened her eyes and took a deep breath. For a split second, she probably wondered where on earth she was and how she had got there.\n\n“I’m sorry,” she said. “How long have I been asleep?”\n\n“Since midtown, more or less.”\n\n“Oh, I’m so sorry.”\n\n“Don’t be,” he said.\n\n“Thank you,” she said. “You’re very sweet.”\n\nShe said good night and stepped out of the car. That was four days ago.\n\n“I knew it was coming,” he said to her now. “I predicted it: eventually, she would leave me. She had to. Day to day, things were just too . . . too . . . ”\n\n“What? Awful?”\n\n“Do you know what she does?” he asked incredulously. “First of all, there are flowers. She brings flowers into the house, just to have them around. Then, when they die, instead of just tossing them, she hangs them up to dry and then takes the petals off and puts the petals in these Japanese bowls and then places the bowls here and there around the house.”\n\nShe waited.\n\n“Who does that?” he asked her.\n\nShe laughed in agreement. “I don’t know,” she said. “I take it you guys don’t have kids!”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Nobody’s drying flowers around here,” she said. “Dried flowers wouldn’t make it past breakfast.”\n\n“And then she makes everything smell nice. There are pleasant little pockets everywhere you go. A little pocket of lemon here in the foyer. A little sachet of lavender near the bathtub. A little candle of verbena in the kitchen. Do you know what that’s like?”\n\n“We have pockets like that around here,” she said, “but of rotten milk and urine, usually.” She laughed.\n\n“I love your apartment,” he said.\n\nShe looked around, mock startled. “Why?” she asked. She laughed again. “No, it is a nice apartment. It’s just too small for us. But rent is so crazy.”\n\n“I love how lived-in it is.”\n\n“Oh, it’s lived-in, all right. Sometimes it feels like Homer and Langley decided to have children.” She picked up a squeeze toy—for a child? a pet?—and made it squeak before tossing it after the yo-yo.\n\n“This is also where you work?”\n\n“Every free minute of every day,” she replied.\n\n“You’re very driven.”\n\n“No,” she said. “Just terrified.”\n\n“Of what?”\n\n“Of never finishing another painting. Of losing myself to motherhood. Of going completely out of my fucking mind.”\n\n“I’m so sorry to barge in on you like this,” he said. “You’re probably trying to get some work done while the baby naps, and here I show up without even calling.”\n\n“Please,” she said. “I’m happy to see you.”\n\n“You have a nice home,” he said. “So full of life. Nothing at all like my apartment.”\n\n“Where it’s clean, you mean? And everything smells nice? And it’s quiet? And you can hear yourself think?”\n\nShe laughed at herself, or perhaps for his sake, to reassure him, but the mirth drained from her face soon enough, and then she looked around again at the disarray.\n\n“From the outside,” she said, “it must look like a pretty good life, like a fulfilled life—which it is. But, when you’re plunked down in the middle of it, sometimes it just feels like time fleeing.”\n\n“I love you,” he said.\n\nShe pulled back. “Pardon?”\n\n“No, just this life, I mean. Your apartment. The mess, even. I love the . . . I really love rooms like this one, where you can practically hear the children playing, and the washing machine going, and you can smell the banana bread baking in the oven. You really feel the love in this room, that’s all I meant. You and your husband have three kids, is that right?”\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“Where is he now?”\n\nBut she had gone silent.\n\nShe was the real thing. He could not simply say “I love you” and look at her until she melted. Calarusso was wrong. She had resolve, and self-respect. She would not just run off with the latest man who flattered her, as his mother had done, or tape the children up for transport in a used box, to test the advantages of a different address.\n\n“Listen, I’m sorry,” he said. “I didn’t mean to give you the wrong impression. Naomi—that’s my wife—she’s not some insane person who needs to have everything perfectly in place all the time. Our apartment gets plenty messy. But let me tell you something she does do without fail every day. She makes the bed. Now, I wasn’t taught to make the bed every day. Some of my stepparents hated that about me, and I didn’t make the bed on purpose half the time just to get back at them. But then I got married, and, for some reason, I’d look at the bed Naomi had made and I’d see, you know, not kindness, not . . . whatever. I’d see spite! I’d think she’d made the bed deliberately to criticize me, or to prove how much more considerate she was than me, or some other stupid thing, and I resented her for it. For making the bed! We’d get into these fights, I’d bring up the bed, she’d look at me, like, What are you talking about? What does making the bed have to do with anything? And then, one day, it just dawned on me. She’s not making the bed to get back at me. She’s making the bed because she likes a made bed. She wants our lives, our shared life together, to be pleasant. I had never thought about that before, the fact that I had a shared life.”\n\n“You should have kids,” she said. “Then you know it’s shared.”\n\n“I was telling you about how my apartment smells good,” he said. “Well, when I was a kid, right, and into my teens, and into my twenties, even, I was surrounded—this will sound weird, now that I’m about to say it out loud—by all of these strange people’s smells, the different odors of different families. I mean the soaps they had in their bathrooms. Their coat closets, their family recipes. The breath their sofas let out when you sat down on them. And then the grosser things—how they left the bathroom, what they gave off when you got too close. It wasn’t always repugnant, just foreign, and I didn’t want the foreign. I wanted the familiar. That’s what family is: what’s familiar. And every new house I went to, every new family I joined, they had all these scents that weren’t familiar. I could no longer say what would have been familiar. I just knew that it was nowhere present in those houses. So, when Naomi and I got married, and I had to adjust to a whole new set of scents—and, you know, things, possessions, wall hangings, whatever—I was just, like, no. What was the point of being married if I just had to keep adjusting? I wouldn’t do it, I refused. In my head, I mean. Those were Naomi’s things, not mine. What was mine? I had no idea, really. I just knew, in my head, I would not give in. So we fought. We fought like cats and dogs. Until one day I realized that her scents had become my scents. They were my scents. This was my life. Why was I sabotaging it? I finally knew what was mine.”\n\nHe stopped talking. She narrowed her eyes and looked at him intently. “Huh,” she said. Something in his monologue had provoked her. She looked away. She even stood up, crossed her arms, and started to pace back and forth. She seemed to have forgotten entirely about his blurting out that he loved her. She came to a stop and said, “It’s the exact opposite with me.”\n\n“How so?”\n\n“Well, I used to have my own odors—that’s a funny way of putting it. You know what I mean. My own life. But it’s the kids’ life now, it’s the kids’ odors. They’ve blotted everything else out. God only knows what I smell like now.” He expected her to laugh, but she didn’t. It wasn’t meant to be a joke. “Do you know how hard it is some days just to find time to take a shower and put on lotion? Will I ever take a bath again? I don’t know. Will I ever smell of perfume again? Will I ever paint something that’s worth a damn?”\n\n“What does your husband say?” he asked.\n\n“About what?”\n\nHe wasn’t sure, and shrugged. “Your painting. Your desire to take a bath.”\n\n“He and I have our ups and downs,” she said. “Like any couple.”\n\nReturning to the sofa, she folded the white onesie that had suddenly appeared in her hands, setting it down absent-mindedly on a pile of children’s books. “Anyway,” she said.\n\n“It’s worse now,” he said. “I might have been better off never figuring it out.”\n\n“Figuring what out?”\n\n“What’s mine.”\n\n“That’s worse than not knowing?”\n\n“Perfect terror,” he said.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because now I know what there is to lose.”\n\nHe had returned to the fact of Naomi’s abandonment and all the loss he had suffered when she hadn’t come back to the apartment that morning.\n\n“It’s more than just a made bed,” he said. “We talked, the two of us. We shared things. No one in my family ever talked. They shouted, they slammed doors, and then they filed for divorce. My mother had one of her wedding receptions in a McDonald’s. That’s how casual these things were. But Naomi and me, we made dinner together every night I wasn’t on set. We planned things. We did things.”\n\n“And now that’s over?”\n\n“Over completely.”\n\n“But you loved her.”\n\n“I did, yes, very much. I never used to live for my life. I lived to prove something, and to get revenge. But my life was a small, mean thing. Then, somewhere along the way, it became everything. That was terrifying.”\n\n“But beautiful, too,” she said, fingering her wedding ring. “Not sure I do that.”\n\n“You don’t live for your life?”\n\n“I don’t know what I live for,” she said. “I live to neglect the other half of things.”\n\n“What’s the other half of things?”\n\n“Well, for instance. When I’m painting, I’m not taking care of my kids. And when I’m taking care of my kids I’m not painting. That pretty much guarantees that I don’t do either very well, and every night I sort of hate myself for it.”\n\n“And your husband?” he said. “What do you neglect when you’re with him?”\n\n“Calarusso, for one,” she said. “And other things. Friends. Museums. Life.” She laughed.\n\n“He doesn’t like museums?”\n\n“It isn’t that he doesn’t like them,” she said. “It’s that we never go to them. If we do anything together, it’s watch TV. You probably don’t watch TV, do you? Oh, that’s a stupid question—you’re on TV. But you know what I mean. With your wife. When you’re both tired. As the thing two people do. To be together.”\n\n“I know what you mean,” he said. “But, no, Naomi preferred to do other things. Dinners, plays. She was with me on Corsica last year when I was filming this absolutely terrible independent movie, and I remember we got out of the car and walked down these ancient crumbling stairs to the beach, and we had this long swim, but when we came back the car was surrounded by all of these wild boars. Rutting like crazy—it was really funny. But scary, too, you know? This man from Marseille began honking his horn and somehow led them away. We’d still be there to this day if it weren’t for him.”\n\nShe didn’t seem to know how to respond to this story. “Sounds romantic,” she said.\n\n“Romantic?”\n\n“I just mean Corsica.”\n\n“Oh, I guess it was,” he said. “But, you know, looking back, it wasn’t the travel we did. It was the fact that we were polite to each other. Where I come from, no one was ever polite. If I’m being honest, she taught me how to live.”\n\n“This is a mortal woman we’re talking about, right?”\n\nHe laughed. “Oh, look,” he said. “She had her flaws, trust me.”\n\n“Like?”\n\nHe gave the question some thought. “She doesn’t have nearly the sense of humor you do,” he said. “Or the richness.”\n\n“Richness?”\n\nHe didn’t know how to answer, and the question hung in the air. She got to her feet again, walked to the middle of the room, and with her back to him stood thinking.\n\n“She sounds amazing,” she said at last, “and you should fight for her. Wherever she is, find her and fight for her. For your sake.”\n\n“But it’s too late,” he said. “We exhausted something, working through it. You try to make it work, but something gets ruined along the way. I tried her patience too many times. There’s nothing I could say now, and nothing I could do.”\n\n“You have to beg her. You have to vow to change, and then change.”\n\n“I have changed. Completely. She just doesn’t see it. To her, I’ll always be that bratty kid who couldn’t bring himself to make the necessary adjustments. Do you know how easy it is to get pigeonholed by the person you’re married to, and then you just can’t get out of it?”\n\n“Oh, God, yes,” she said.\n\n“That doomed us. We were always going to be the same people to each other, no matter how much we changed.” He gestured around the apartment. “I never considered her capable of any of this, for instance.”\n\n“Any of what?” she asked. “The mess? The madness?”\n\n“No, no,” he said. “The . . . the nurture. The wholeness of your lives. How there’s goodness behind every little thing in sight. Your husband must feel the same way.”\n\n“Oh, sure,” she said. “He can’t shut up about it. He’s always romancing me for everything he finds on the living-room floor. Are you kidding me?”\n\n“The minute I walked in,” he said, “I thought, Here is how life is best lived. Everywhere you look, there’s a sign of life. And you created it. It’s amazing. It’s like . . . like a garden in here. No, hear me out,” he said, when she had raised her eyebrows skeptically. “And what you are growing, here, and there, and over there, are little moments, and the little moments make your memories, and the memories make a life that can’t be taken away from you by anyone or anything, not other people’s fickleness, not even death. In the long run, you know, that’s better than bowls of dried flowers, or whatever.”\n\n“I don’t know,” she said. “I’m pretty intrigued by those bowls.”\n\nWhen he had finished, she came back to the sofa, curled one leg under her and sat down, looking at him with (he thought) a sexy pucker to her mouth, eyes narrowed, and held his gaze a beat longer than was strictly necessary.\n\n“And what about love?” she asked.\n\n“Love is everywhere in this house,” he said. “Everywhere.”\n\n“I don’t mean that kind of love,” she said. “Don’t be seduced by the children’s toys.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“What do you mean, what do I mean? I mean love. I mean . . . what do I mean? O.K., it’s like this,” she said. “Do you see that toy over there? It’s some kind of caped lion. But also a digital clock. I’m not really sure what the hell it is, to be honest. But when Micah—that’s my oldest—when Micah first got that caped lion-clock thing, it was everything to him. I mean, it was the most precious thing on earth. He went around all day hugging it to his chest. But now he never plays with it. Ever. You know what he plays with?”\n\nShe plucked off the floor a spent roll of toilet paper with a twisted rubber band taped to it. “This.”\n\nShe waggled the toilet roll, and the strap of her overalls fell off her shoulder again.\n\n“And that’s what my husband has become, to me, and what I have become to my husband. He and I both remember, sort of, way back before kids, that we had something, but in all honesty now, after the kids go to bed, we go right back to playing with our toilet rolls. Oh, my God,” she said. “I can’t believe that just came out of my mouth.”\n\n“And what is your husband’s toilet roll?”\n\n“His iPhone,” she said without hesitation.\n\n“And yours?”\n\n“Whatever I’m painting at the moment,” she said. “You worry about losing everything. I worry about wanting to hold on to it. Some days, I just don’t want to hold on to it.”\n\n“You’re unhappy,” he said.\n\nShe was forced to look away, but turned back quickly and looked at him as if she were seeing him there for the first time. “How did you get in here?” she asked him, smiling. “Did I let you in?” He remained still, staring at her with his chin lowered, a faint smile curling the ends of his mouth. “It must be those eyes,” she said more quietly than before. “Those eyes are hard to say no to.”\n\nSo she was susceptible, after all. She had not fallen asleep on their ride to Brooklyn because she was above it all. She was not what the state of her apartment had suggested: a mother through and through. Calarusso had not been wrong.\n\nHis disappointment in her was sharp but brief, and bound up with excitement. He reached across the sofa and slowly lifted the denim strap to her shoulder. “Maybe I should be going,” he whispered.\n\nShe nodded. “Maybe you should.”\n\nNeither of them moved.\n\n“I can’t seem to bring myself to.”\n\n“Seems you can’t.”\n\n“The truth is, I want to stay.”\n\n“Why?” she whispered. “Is it all the sippy cups?”\n\nHe smiled. “No.”\n\n“The wide selection of Little Golden Books?”\n\n“It’s you,” he said. “It’s this. It’s all of this.”\n\n“I’m flattered.”\n\n“I’m serious.”\n\n“But you’re still in love with your wife,” she said. “Aren’t you?”\n\nHe would always love her, he admitted. But it had been so much worse in days past, when he drifted, crying, down dead industrial blocks, and strangers removed their earbuds to ask him if he was all right. Oh, yes, it had been much worse. This morning was an afterthought, a fainthearted performance, the death rattle, and, when he came to his senses, what had he done? He had walked straight over the bridge to her.\n\n“This is the life I want!” he said. “I want you!”\n\n“Are you sure it’s me,” she asked, “and not some fantasy you’ve constructed around my life?”\n\nThen he told her that there was a woman who kept recurring in his dreams. “She shows up every few months, always while I’m in transit. I’m on a boat, or an airplane, and she just happens to be seated next to me. We talk, and then she looks at me, and I wake up. I’m always sad to wake up. I’ve had this dream for twenty-five years, ever since I was a kid, and I’ve always just believed that she was a figment of my imagination. Until I sat down next to you at dinner four nights ago.”\n\n“We weren’t in transit.”\n\n“I drove you home.”\n\n“Does that count?”\n\n“I’m counting it. And do you remember the name of the painting Calarusso auctioned that night?”\n\n“ ‘Across the Waters to Saint-Tropez.’ ”\n\n“While we were on the bridge, a favorite song of mine came on the radio. An old song called ‘San Tropez.’ ”\n\n“Hey, I know that song,” she said. She sang the first two lines. “That one?”\n\n“ ‘And you’re leading me down to the place by the sea,’ ” he sang. “That’s the one.”\n\nThey shared another look, and then she kissed him. After the first few tentative kisses, she crossed a leg over his lap and straddled him.\n\nWhen they broke off, she looked at him from only a few inches away.\n\n“Oh, my God,” she said. And she suddenly threw her head back and laughed. “This isn’t happening.”\n\n“Yes,” he said. “It is.”\n\nThey kissed again, and afterward began a series of goodbyes, for her husband would be home from the park soon with the boys and the dog in tow, and everyone would be hot and cranky and in need of a snack, and it would be better, she said to him, thinking vaguely of the future, that he not be seen, not known, yet. They had every intention of getting up from the sofa but remained there, kissing more freely now, and between kisses he shared with her more of his childhood, and recommended that no one act rashly, for the sake of the children.\n\n“No, yeah, of course. No one’s going to . . . no one’s doing anything stupid,” she said. “But, listen . . . ”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Well, I don’t know,” she said. “I just . . . I just know that I have to paint, that’s all.”\n\n“Of course you do,” he said. “Always. We’ll make sure of it.”\n\nAnother ten minutes passed, and now it was imperative that she send him on his way. But they stole another minute, and when they left off kissing again she backtracked, saying it could never work out between them, because he was used to an apartment that smelled nice, where you could read the paper on a Sunday morning, and not a pigsty, where toys were scattered everywhere.\n\n“But I can’t live like that anymore,” he said. “It’s too precious. I need a good mess.”\n\n“That’s too bad,” she said, “because I wouldn’t mind a little verbena in my life.”\n\n“Oh, well, that I can do,” he said.\n\nThen it was time, they had to get up, and four daring and exquisite minutes later they did. Holding hands this time, they returned through the baby’s room to the front door. The baby stirred, then let out a cry—and then it didn’t matter how carefully she shut the door behind her. Nap time was over. “Shit,” she said.\n\n“Go,” he said. “Take care of him. I’ll see myself out.”\n\n“It’s a her,” she said, and they kissed a final time. He was halfway out the door when she called him back and hurried across the room.\n\n“Maybe I should just tell him,” she said.\n\n“Who?”\n\n“My husband,” she said. “Doesn’t he deserve to know?”\n\n“What would you tell him?”\n\nShe thought about it. “I don’t know,” she said, and caught herself. “What’s even happening?!”\n\n“Nothing,” he said. “And everything. Maybe you should. I don’t know—whatever you think is best.”\n\nShe leaned into him to steal one final kiss. Then he left the apartment and walked toward the elevator, which disgorged an unhappy man, two hot and sullen boys, and a Jack Russell terrier panting from the heat.",

What do all of these women have in common? They are Democrats. And they are butt ugly. Mere statistics alone would suggest if you got a dozen or so Democrat women politicians together there would be some glimmer of attractiveness, no matter how dim, somewhere. But you would be wrong. However, now, thanks to SCIENCE, we know why:\n\nResearch has found that being attractive influences many things in a person’s life — their salary, their popularity and grades in school, even the prison sentences they receive. So why not their politics? A recently published study in the Journal of Public Economics concludes that the attractiveness of a candidate does correlate with their politics. They find that politicians on the right are more good looking in Europe, the United States and Australia. The study shows correlation, not causation, but the researchers float a simple economic explanation for why this might happen. Numerous studies have shown that good-looking people are likely to earn more, and that people who earn more are typically more opposed to redistributive policies, like the progressive taxes and welfare programs favored by the left. The researchers also offer a more general psychological explanation for the trend: That good-looking people are often treated better than others, and thus see the world as a more just place. Past studies have found that the more attractive people believe themselves to be, the lower their preference for egalitarianism, a value typically associated with the political left.\n\nAnd this might be the first time the “Hot-Or-Not” method has been used to develop data for an article in a peer reviewed journal\n\nIn their first experiment, the researchers showed respondents photographs of political candidates in Finnish municipal and parliamentary elections, members of the European Parliament, U.S. candidates for Senate and governor, and candidates for Australia’s House of Representatives. They asked participants to rate the photographs on a five-point scale. The results suggested that politicians on the right are more beautiful on all three continents.\n\nNothing is 100%, of course. And always remember, that we are speaking in relative terms because politics is Hollywood for ugly people. Though I focus on women (not being gay I feel more comfortable with making judgments of attractiveness on the opposite sex, though even if I were gay there is nothing wrong with that), the rule applies to men, too. Al “Rubber Face” Franken, One-eyed Harry Reid. Anthony “Weiner” Weiner, are all proof that the rule transcends sex.\n\n**I date the beginning of my decline from having perfect vision to the day in 1997 when I encountered Donna Shalala in tennis whites in Montrose Park in Washington, DC.",
  "latent_15642": "The tornado that plowed a wide swath of death and destruction through Joplin, Mo., on Sunday unleashed winds of up to 198 miles per hour, federal forecasters said yesterday.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's preliminary analysis ranks the twister as an F4, the second-highest rating on the five-point scale used to classify tornadoes.\n\nAgency officials said the Joplin storm, at times three-quarters of a mile wide, was the deadliest single tornado to hit the United States since 1953. At least 116 people died and 500 were injured by the storm. The numbers are expected to climb as aid workers comb through the wreckage left behind.\n\n\"This is the ninth-deadliest tornado year on record so far,\" said Jack Hayes, director of NOAA's National Weather Service. \"More than 450 people have been killed. ... With so many fatalities this year, I think we have to ask ourselves the tough questions now. Why is this happening?\"\n\nBut experts said there is no easy explanation for the ferocious intensity of this year's tornado season.\n\n\"Certainly, I think you could say we have a high-impact season,\" Hayes said. \"I think we have more F4s and F5s than in past years -- but for us to say this is climate change, I don't know that we have the evidence that we can say that definitively.\"\n\nUnusually warm surface water in the Gulf of Mexico -- about 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal -- may be a factor, he said.\n\nA 'remarkable pattern' shifts killer storms eastward\n\n\"When you have a long, prolonged stretch of warm humid air coming in from the Gulf of Mexico, you are going to set up conditions that are ripe,\" Hayes said. \"And then, when you have these slow-moving fronts and an injection of cooler air, it collides and triggers this instability.\"\n\nThat collision between very warm, humid air at low levels of the atmosphere and cool air at higher levels creates the upward vertical winds within a thunderstorm that sometimes turn into a tornado, said Thomas Schwein, deputy director of the National Weather Service's Central Region, which includes Missouri.\n\nThis year, the jet stream has been dipping farther south than normal, allowing it ready access to that warm Gulf of Mexico air. \"It's been a remarkable pattern from a day-to-day weather perspective,\" Schwein said. That has also shifted this year's tornadoes farther to the east, into more densely populated sections of the country, which may account in part for the high number of fatalities.\n\nAnother expert suggested a potential influence from the current La Niña weather pattern, in place since last summer.\n\n\"We have been coming out of a La Niña,\" said Russell Schneider, director of NOAA's Storm Prediction Center. \"There is some emerging research that links more active severe-weather seasons -- particularly months like April -- to emerging within a La Niña.\" Such a pattern was observed in 1965 and 1974, which Schneider called \"major springtime severe-weather outbreak years.\"\n\nNOAA's storm survey crews hope to issue a final storm strength rating today for the Joplin tornado. The agency sent additional crews to Missouri yesterday to examine the pattern of destruction left by the twister, observations NOAA scientists will use to estimate the tornado's power.\n\nSome insurers see climate connection to rising risks\n\nSunday's tornado also thrusts the insurance industry toward a potential record-breaking year for thunderstorm-related damage. Inland storm claims over the last three years have risen to about $30 billion altogether. That accounts for almost one-third of all the thunderstorm damage going back to 1990, amounting to $97.8 billion, according to the Insurance Information Institute. This year will add billions more onto that tally.\n\nThe number and ferocity of those storms have been rising for at least 25 years. It's unclear what's causing the rise, but many insurers are responding by raising rates and reducing policies. Factors behind the damage could include expanded development and rising property values.\n\nBut some insurers also believe climate change is playing a part.\n\nThe Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club, which collected $2.1 billion in premiums last year, writes homeowners insurance policies in Missouri, Texas and California. Those areas face \"catastrophic risk\" that could be increased by global warming, the company told California insurance regulators this month.\n\n\"The primary risk that climate change may pose would be any potential increase in the frequency or intensity of strong thunderstorms, hurricanes or brushfires,\" the company said on a climate risk disclosure form that California began requiring insurers to file this year.\n\n\"More severe or more frequent events would increase the number and cost of claims and have an impact on the financial health of the company,\" the Automobile Club wrote. \"If the impact was large enough, it could affect our ability to write new or renew business in some catastrophe exposed areas.\"\n\nAbout 1,200 tornadoes touch down in the United States annually, but this year is on pace for more. About 1,076 twisters have already been counted -- and that was before the storms in Missouri this week.\n\nThe accelerating activity has convinced Allstate Insurance Co. that the change is permanent. Chairman and CEO Thomas Wilson told Wall Street analysts last month that the company now believes it will face about $2 billion in damage annually from thunderstorms -- about four times the amount it paid a decade ago.\n\nReprinted from Climatewire with permission from Environment & Energy Publishing, LLC. www.eenews.net, 202-628-6500",

Here are the big takeaways:\n\nFacebook will use machine learning to notify users when a photo of them is uploaded, giving them an option to contact the user who uploaded it.\n\nThe new feature can help professionals avoid being associated with embarrassing photos, or can protect users from having their photos used in advertising.\n\nFacebook will use machine learning to alert users if a photo of them has been uploaded by another user, even if they haven't been tagged in the photo. The new feature was detailed in a blog post by Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, Facebook's director of applied machine learning, on Tuesday.\n\nProfessional users can leverage the feature to make sure they aren't tagged in any inappropriate or embarrassing pictures. On the other hand, it could also help consumers from unwittingly having their photos used with an advertisement or associated with a specific Facebook page.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, it's because Facebook has been using the same kind of artificial intelligence (AI) and facial recognition technologies to suggest certain friends for photo tags and more for quite some time.

  "latent_16009": "The story of the Red Ghost began in 1883 at a ranch near Eagle Creek in southeastern Arizona. The Apache wars were ending, though a few renegade bands still prowled the area as isolated ranches far from any neighbors were easy targets for the occasional Apache raid. Early one morning, two ranchers rode out to count their sheep, leaving their wives and children behind. Some time that morning, one of the women went to a nearby spring to get a bucket of water. Suddenly, the other woman who was inside the ranch heard the dog begin to bark followed by a terrified scream. When she peered out the window, she saw a reddish-colored beast race by. Riding on its back was an evil looking creature that some thought to be the devil.\n\nHorrified, she locked herself and her children up in the house until the men returned home and told them of what she saw. When they searched by the spring, they discovered the other woman's body, which had been trampled to death. The next morning when they went back to the area, they discovered reddish strands of hair and cloven hoof prints that were much larger than a horse's and nothing like they had ever seen before.\n\nA few days later, prospectors who were camping nearby close to Clifton, Arizona reported awakening to the thundering sound of hooves and people screaming. Though their tent collapsed, they managed to escape just in time to see a large creature run off. The next day, another woman was found trampled to death. As news of the beast, which came to be known as the Red Ghost spread, people began to make up or embellish stories. One man claimed to have seen the creature kill a grizzly bear and eat it, while another said that he actually chased it, but that it vanished in front of his eyes.\n\nMonths later, two other prospectors were searching for precious metals along the Verde River when they spotted the Red Ghost, again with something attached to its back. They fired their guns at the creature but missed. However, as it ran away they saw a chilling object fall from its back: a human skull with flesh still covering part of it. Embedded into the flesh was strands of red hair.\n\nAbout a year afterwards, a cowboy near Phoenix caught sight of the creature grazing on grass while he was on his horse. Wanting to capture the beast, he took out his rope out and managed to lasso the animal's head with it. However, instead of attempting to running away, it charged at him and knocked both him and his horse to the ground. As it galloped away, the cowboy saw that on its back was a headless skeleton.",

On the other hand, immigration continues to be the biggest issue facing the U.S., according to the almost 2,000 Latinos who participated in the poll.\n\nWhen asked about this week’s results, FIU professor Eduardo Gamarra told Latino USA the following:\n\n“This is the 19th consecutive week of polling and the data continue to show remarkable consistency week to week. Mrs. Clinton appears to have an ironclad grip on Latinos as she has been above 70% since mid May and nothing appears to even nudge her numbers. In contrast, Mr. Trump has dropped down again below 13% nationally. He is unlikely to have any impact on our Latino numbers in the near future and if you examine the past 18 weeks, it is unlikely that he will manage to recover even his highest score of 17.3%. Our poll can lead us to speculate only that older Latinos are drawn in greater proportion to Trump and to third party candidates. This week, older Latinos appear to be more drawn to candidates other than Trump. Overall, as we noted three weeks ago, these numbers in Florida spell serious trouble for Donald Trump especially if voter turnout is high among Latinos.

  "latent_16049": "Deleuze was very sick in his final years. The last essay he published is very short; it is an extraordinary text. “Immanence: A Life” was published in 1995, and he took his own life on November 4, 1995. The concept of a “plane of immanence” is borrowed from Spinoza, who used it to describe the world as an attribute to the one substance, God. I like the concept of a transcendental field which is prior to consciousness, and consciousness “becomes a fact only when a subject is produced at the same time as its object, both being outside the field and appearing as “transcendents.”\n\nSource: Deleuze, Gilles. Pure Immanence: Essays on A Life. 2nd ed. Zone Books, 2005. Print. p. 25\n\n__________________________\n\n“What is a transcendental field? It can be distinguished from experience in that it doesn’t refer to an object or belong to a subject (empirical representation). It appears therefore as a pure stream of a-subjective consciousness, a pre -reflexive impersonal consciousness, a qualitative duration of consciousness without a self. It may seem curious that the transcendental be defined by such immediate givens: we will speak of a transcendental empiricism in contrast to everything that makes up the world of the subject and the object. There is something wild and powerful in this transcendental empiricism that is of course not the element of sensation (simple empiricism), for sensation is only a break within the flow of absolute consciousness. It is, rather, however close two sensations may be, the passage from one to the other as becoming, as increase or decrease in power (virtual quantity). Must we then define the transcendental field by a pure immediate consciousness with neither object nor self, as a movement that neither begins nor ends? (Even Spinoza’s conception of this passage or quantity of power still appeals to consciousness.)\n\nBut the relation of the transcendental field to consciousness is only a conceptual one. Consciousness becomes a fact only when a subject is produced at the same time as its object, both being outside the field and appearing as “transcendents.” Conversely, as long as consciousness traverses the transcendental field at an infinite speed everywhere diffused, nothing is able to reveal it.[1] It is expressed, in fact, only when it is reflected on a subject that refers it to objects. That is why the transcendental field cannot be defined by the consciousness that is coextensive with it, but removed from any revelation.\n\nThe transcendent is not the transcendental. Were it not for consciousness, the transcendental field would be defined as a pure plane of immanence, because it eludes all transcendence of the subject and of the object.[2] Absolute immanence is in itself: it is not in something, to something; it does not depend on an object or belong to a subject. In Spinoza, immanence is not immanence to substance; rather, substance and modes are in immanence. When the subject or the object falling outside the plane of immanence is taken as a universal subject or as any object to which immanence is attributed, the transcendental is entirely de-natured, for it then simply redoubles the empirical (as with Kant), and immanence is distorted, for it then finds itself enclosed in the transcendent. Immanence is not related to Some Thing as a unity superior to all things or to a Subject as an act that brings about a synthesis of things: it is only when immanence is no longer immanence to anything other than itself that we can speak of a plane of immanence. No more than the transcendental field is defined by consciousness can the plane of immanence be defined by a subject or an object that is able to contain it.\n\nWe will say of pure immanence that it is A LIFE, and nothing else. It is not immanence to life, but the immanent that is in nothing is itself a life. A life is the immanence of immanence, absolute immanence: it is complete power, complete bliss. It is to the degree that he goes beyond the aporias of the subject and the object that Johann Fichte, in his last philosophy, presents the transcendental field as a life, no longer dependent on a Being or submitted to an Act – it is an absolute immediate consciousness whose very activity no longer refers to a being but is ceaselessly posed in a life.[3] The transcendental field then becomes a genuine plane of immanence that reintroduces Spinozism into the heart of the philosophical process. Did Maine de Biran not go through something similar in his “last philosophy” (the one he was too tired to bring to fruition) when he discovered, beneath the transcendence of effort, an absolute immanent life? The transcendental field is defined by a plane of immanence, and the plane of immanence by a life.\n\nWhat is immanence? A life. .. No one has described what a life is better than Charles Dickens, if we take the indefinite article as an index of the transcendental. A disreputable man, a rogue, held in contempt by everyone, is found as he lies dying. Suddenly, those taking care of him manifest an eagerness, respect, even love, for his slightest sign of life. Everybody bustles about to save him, to the point where, in his deepest coma, this wicked man himself senses something soft and sweet penetrating him. But to the degree that he comes back to life, his saviors turn colder, and he becomes once again mean and crude. Between his life and his death, there is a moment that is only that of a life playing with death.[4] The life of the individual gives way to an impersonal and yet singular life that releases a pure event freed from the accidents of internal and external life, that is, from the subjectivity and objectivity of what happens: a “Homo tantum” with whom everyone empathizes and who attains a sort of beatitude. It is a haecceity no longer of individuation but of singularization: a life of pure immanence, neutral, beyond good and evil, for it was only the subject that incarnated it in the midst of things that made it good or bad. The life of such individuality fades away in favor of the singular life immanent to a man who no longer has a name, though he can be mistaken for no other. A singular essence, a life…\n\nBut we shouldn’t enclose life in the single moment when individual life confronts universal death. A life is everywhere, in all the moments that a given living subject goes through and that are measured by given lived objects: an immanent life carrying with it the events or singularities that are merely actualized in subjects and objects. This indefinite life does not itself have moments, close as they may be one to another, but only between-times, between-moments; it doesn’t just come about or come after but offers the immensity of an empty time where one sees the event yet to come and already happened, in the absolute of an immediate consciousness. In his novels, Alexander Lernet-Holenia places the event in an in-between time that could engulf entire armies. The singularities and the events that constitute a life coexist with the accidents of the life that corresponds to it, but they are neither grouped nor divided in the same way. They connect with one another in a manner entirely different from how individuals connect. It even seems that a singular life might do without any individuality, without any other concomitant that individualizes it. For example, very small children all resemble one another and have hardly any individuality, but they have singularities: a smile, a gesture, a funny face — not subjective qualities. Small children, through all their sufferings and weaknesses, are infused with an immanent life that is pure power and even bliss. The indefinite aspects in a life lose all indetermination to the degree that they fill out a plane of immanence or, the same thing, to the degree that they constitute the elements of a transcendental field (individual life, on the other hand, remains inseparable from empirical determinations). The indefinite as such is the mark not of an empirical indetermination but of a determination by immanence or a transcendental determinability. The indefinite article is the indetermination of the person only because it is the determination of the singular. The One is not the transcendent that might contain immanence but the immanent contained within a transcendental field. One is always the index of a multiplicity: an event, a singularity, a life…\n\nAlthough it is always possible to invoke a transcendent that falls outside the plane of immanence, or that attributes immanence to itself, all transcendence is constituted solely in the flow of immanent consciousness that belongs to this plane.[5] Transcendence is always a product of immanence.\n\nA life contains only virtuals. It is made up of virtualities, events, singularities. What we call virtual is not something that lacks reality but something that is engaged in a process of actualization following the plane that gives it its particular reality. The immanent event is actualized in a state of things and of the lived that make it happen. The plane of immanence is itself actualized in an object and a subject to which it attributes itself. But however inseparable an object and a subject may be from their actualization, the plane of immanence is itself virtual, so long as the events that populate it are virtualities. Events or singularities give to the plane all their virtuality, just as the plane of immanence gives virtual events their full reality. The event considered as non-actualized (indefinite) ìs lacking in nothing. It suffices to put it in relation to its concomitants: a transcendental field, a plane of immanence, a life, singularities. A wound is incarnated or actualized in a state of things or of life; but it is itself a pure virtuality on the plane of immanence that leads us into a life. My wound existed before me: not a transcendence of the wound as higher actuality, but its immanence as a virtuality always within a milieu (plane or field).[6] There is a big difference between the virtuals that define the immanence of the transcendental field and the possible forms that actualize them and transform them into something transcendent.”\n\nNOTES:\n\n1] “As though we reflected back to surfaces the light which emanates from them, the light which, had it passed unopposed, would never have been revealed” (Henri Bergson, Matter and Memory [New York: Zone Books, 19881, p. 36).\n\n[2] Cf. Jean-Paul Sartre, who posits a transcendental field without a subject that refers to a consciousness that is impersonal, absolute, immanent: with respect to it, the subject and the object are “transcendents” (La transcendance de l‘Ego [Paris: Vrin, 1966], pp. 74—87).

But this doesn’t change the fact that all transcendence is constituted solely in the life of consciousness, as inseparably linked to that life…“ (Méditations cartésiennes [Paris: Vrin, 1947], p. 52).

  "latent_16263": "Catherine Keefe is an essayist, poet, editor, and writing instructor at Chapman University in Orange, California.\n\nA man looks over the Affordable Care Act signup page on HealthCare.gov (Mike Segar )\n\nAt the moment President-elect Barack Obama proclaimed that “change has come to America,” I stood at the foot of my husband’s bed in the cardiac ICU of Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo. I was praying. Jim lay, with a ventilator tube down his throat, recovering from open-heart surgery to replace a congenitally defective aortic valve.\n\nI was elated — for Jim’s survival and for Obama’s victory. I looked forward to one of Obama’s major campaign promises: to provide national healthcare reform so Americans with a pre-existing condition could get insurance. Since his heart diagnosis in 2005, Jim, who probably couldn’t have found a policy as an individual because of his condition, had been covered by small-business group insurance — because his self-storage business in Banning had one other employee. But his work, and his coverage, were always subject to change.\n\nI remained vulnerable as a freelance writer and part-time university professor who had to pay for her own health insurance. I also had had a few health hiccups, including surgery to repair a herniated disk from spinal degeneration, and so I lived with the daily realization that one bit of bad health news could cause my policy to be canceled.\n\nAs it happened, the 2008 election was the first time Jim and I were bitterly divided on candidates. Jim foresaw healthcare reform as an addition to the federal deficit more worrisome than any health benefit. When I told him about Obama’s victory, he grumbled, “I guess I can’t blame Obama for breaking my heart.” But, he worried that he would eventually be able to blame the president “for keeping me from getting better.”\n\nThe transition to Obamacare – at least for a 59-year-old man and a 56-year-old woman in south Orange County – wouldn’t be quite that bad. But it would be, in three big ways, far rougher and more frustrating than I’d ever dreamed.\n\n1) Obamacare brought us new health insurance options, but cost us our more affordable plans.\n\n“If you’re one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance — this law will only make it more secure and more affordable,” President Obama promised in 2012.\n\nThe fact that this wasn’t true would be our biggest disappointment. In November 2013, Jim learned his small-business policy would be canceled because it didn’t comply with the new mandate to cover pediatric dentistry and maternity care. So Jim went to Covered California, the state’s health insurance exchange, to look for coverage for his employee and himself.\n\nHe found that the cost of his employee’s individual “bronze” plan monthly premiums went up 13 percent, and that his own new individual “silver” plan was also more expensive. In 2014, Jim was individually paying $82 more a month in premiums. The deductible (the amount you have to pay before the insurance company starts footing the bill) did go down — from $5,000 to $2,000 for each individual insured. But if you added together 12 months of premiums, the deductible, and the new policies’ out-of-pocket maximums, we were potentially on the hook for $13,260 — rather than the $11,024 from 2013 — if Jim got very sick. Around this time, Jim was diagnosed with prostate cancer, so the threat of high medical bills was real.\n\nThe individual plan I had with Blue Cross was canceled, too. The bronze plan I got at Covered California raised my monthly premium payment from $301 to $422, with a $5,000 deductible. The maximum I might be responsible for if I got really sick went from $8,612 to $11,314.\n\n2) We learned patience, but we couldn’t keep our doctors.\n\nThe only way to decrease the cost of our premiums was to get the subsidy offered by the federal government to lower- and middle-income people. And the only way to get the subsidy was by getting insurance through Covered California. But contacting Covered California, especially by phone, was maddening. The elevator music they played on hold became our winter soundtrack.\n\nWe had applied online and sent copies of our passports to California Covered for verification, but we received no bill, no confirmation of our coverage, no insurance cards. Jim spent an hour and a half on hold once before getting disconnected. He tried again the next day, waiting another two hours before getting disconnected.\n\nAfter a few more calls, Jim drove to a pop-up Covered California shop in the Laguna Hills Mall on Jan. 15, 2014, the deadline for adding coverage. He hoped to avoid website computer glitches and phone hang-ups. All we had were verbal assurances, which were not enough to see the cardiologist and a urologist at the insurance-negotiated rate. Receptionists at the doctors’ offices said we could pay cash: $150 per visit for the urologist, $203 for the cardiologist, plus lab and treatment expenses.\n\nOn Jan. 22, we finally got our enrollment number and made our first payment to Blue Cross so we could start seeing doctors. Jim went to his cardiologist on Feb. 10, only to discover the doctor had left Blue Cross.\n\nThus began a session of musical chairs as we tried to match our insurance to the doctors we wanted to see before the music stopped. This was one time we had the advantage over an employer-sponsored health plan, which has only one open enrollment period in a year. Due to the start-up problems with state insurance exchanges, the deadline for Affordable Care Act insurance kept being pushed back, allowing us to change coverage twice.\n\nWe canceled Blue Cross and enrolled in Blue Shield so Jim could see his urologist. Then, when the urologist’s office said they didn’t accept Blue Shield patients enrolled through the state exchange, we canceled California Covered Blue Shield and bought directly from the insurance company, even though that meant foregoing the subsidies.\n\nBut the urologist wouldn’t accept our new Blue Shield plan – even though the Blue Shield website said he did. Jim’s regular dermatologist left Blue Shield, too.\n\nIn each case, the doctor’s office said the reimbursements for the insurance we had were too low. In each case, the receptionists chirped, “We’re happy to make you a cash patient.”\n\nEventually, we requested records and sought new doctors. Although we read frequent reports of patients unable to find physicians willing to take new patients, in our case Jim found a new urologist he liked better than the old.\n\n3) The Affordable Care Act saved us money this year, but it didn’t alleviate our concerns about obtaining affordable medical care.\n\nJim treated his prostate cancer with radiation, and received his recommended echocardiogram and MRI. So in 2014, we paid the maximum out-of-pocket expense and the insurance company covered the rest. Tallying his medical costs, Jim said, “I take back what I said. Obamacare did help me get better.”\n\nI’m well below my annual deductible. I baby my back, neck, knees, and hip degeneration with regular walking, yoga, and acupuncture. I’ve benefited from regular $28 acupuncture treatments, something that wasn’t covered in my old plan. But my licensed acupuncturist hasn’t received any reimbursement yet. It’s also harder for her to make a living — the insurance company cut her pay by 25 percent.\n\nWhat Obamacare hasn’t eliminated is worry: We’re deeply concerned about our ability to get quality medical care from doctors we trust. The day may soon come when we can’t afford the plans our doctors accept, or we’ll have to wait hours to seen. Will the best doctors flock to a cash-only model? How long can a good doctor be satisfied with the $39.75 the insurance company paid her for my annual check up a few months ago?\n\nWe had thought that our work and businesses had paid us enough to live on in these older years — but we’re discovering we didn’t account for such dramatic increases in health care costs. Medical expenses already gobble up 20 percent of our income. In 2015, if we keep the same plans, our premiums will rise $95 a month. We have no choice to opt out of the required pediatric dentistry or maternity coverage we’ll never use, so we’ll eventually have to settle for less generous policies, with higher deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. My husband isn’t required by law to insure his one employee, though he feels it’s the right thing to do. As costs continue to rise, we may have to direct him to buy his own health insurance at his own cost.\n\nWe’ve already started the dance of enrollment all over again and are having a hard time finding partners. As I write this, the “Find a Provider” link on the Covered California website offers 2014 health providers, but not 2015, even though we’re shopping for 2015 insurance policies. Ditto Blue Shield. Administrators at our medical group won’t say yet if they’ll remain with Blue Shield. At least this year, we think we know the steps to the dance. Let the music begin.\n\nThis article was written in partnership with Zocalo Public Square.",

I guess I can do what I want with my own website. :)\n\nSo now that I’ve had some time to really digest after three viewings, here’s some thoughts on Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I’ve tried my best to give it the benefit of the doubt and come with fresh eyes with each viewing. Normally I don’t care to publicly express any opinions because, honestly, who cares? This is just to provide some catharsis, and if it benefits you in any way, I’m happy about that. I also write this knowing full well that Star Wars is just a movie series and, as much as I love it, it isn’t anything more than that in my life. Also, if this is the worst I have to complain about I’m doing alright!\n\nThe Last Jedi was a fun movie going experience. I won’t deny that. On first pass, it was a fun movie, and had a lot of surprises and good things going for it (every scene with Kylo Ren and/or Rey), but tying it into Star Wars lore as a whole, it ultimately dishonors ALL Star Wars that came before. And I’m m not just saying that for dramatic effect.\n\nI’m just going to list all the issues I had with the movie, hopefully in order of importance (highest to lowest, then technical issues) but this is more a stream of consciousness so I might not adhere too strictly to that.

Repeat after me: the Muslim Brotherhood is “moderate.” The Muslim Brotherhood is “largely secular,” because the Obama administration’s director of national intelligence said so. This is all a misunderstanding and has been taken out of context, because you don’t speak Arabic, and surely there are nuances on the word “kill” to consider.\n\nNothing to see here. “Cairo rally: One day we’ll kill all Jews,” by Eldad Beck for YNet News, November 25:\n\nA Muslim Brotherhood rally in Cairo’s most prominent mosque Friday turned into a venomous anti-Israel protest, with attendants vowing to “one day kill all Jews.”\n\nSome 5,000 people joined the rally, called to promote the “battle against Jerusalem’s Judaization.” The event coincided with the anniversary of the United Nations’ partition plan in 1947, which called for the establishment of a Jewish state.\n\n“Against Jerusalem’s Judaization”: hysterical historical revisionism.\n\nHowever, most worshippers who prayed at the mosque Friday quickly left it before the Muslim Brotherhood’s rally got underway. A group spokesman urged attendants to remain for the protest, asking them not to create a bad impression for the media by leaving.\n\n‘Treacherous Jews’\n\nSpeakers at the event delivered impassioned, hateful speeches against Israel, slamming the “Zionist occupiers” and the “treacherous Jews.” Upon leaving the rally, worshippers were given small flags, with Egypt’s flag on one side and the Palestinian flag on the other, as well as maps of Jerusalem’s Old City detailing where “Zionists are aiming to change Jerusalem’s Muslim character.”\n\nPropaganda material ahead of Egypt’s parliamentary elections was also handed out at the site.\n\nSpiritual leader Dr. Ahmed al-Tayeb charged in his speech that to this day Jews everywhere in the world are seeking to prevent Islamic and Egyptian unity.\n\n“In order to build Egypt, we must be one. Politics is insufficient. Faith in Allah is the basis for everything,” he said. “The al-Aqsa Mosque is currently under an offensive by the Jews”¦we shall not allow the Zionists to Judaize al-Quds (Jerusalem.) We are telling Israel and Europe that we shall not allow even one stone to be moved there.” […]\n\nThroughout the event, Muslim Brotherhood activists chanted: “Tel Aviv, Tel Aviv, judgment day has come.”\n\nSpeaking to Ynet outside the mosque following the prayer, elementary school teacher Ala al-Din said that “all Egyptian Muslims are willing to embark on Jihad for the sake of Palestine.”",
  "latent_16371": "Darkheart\n\nWeapon (Longsword) Rare\n\nYou gain +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\n\nHoly Blade. When you kill a Humanoid of a different faith, the creature must make a wisdom saving throw equivalent to double the blades damage only. On a fail, the creature submits its soul to Asenrir. As a reward, Asenrir will look past your faith and imbued your weapon with holy power dealing an extra d6 of radiant damage. For the purpose of this weapon, \"Humanoid\" refers to any creature considered Humanoid.\n\nWhen the blade is activated it sets alight but not with flame, radiant energy beams off of it as if it were ablaze. These ethereal flames shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light an additional 20 feet past that.\n\nSubmission. If you choose to attune to this item, you can gain another d6 to your damage but must convert to a worshipper of Asenrir. After attuning you suffer from 'Conversion' for 2d8+1 Days.\n\nBonded. Providing the wielder is on good terms with Darkheart, the soul within grants the creature advantage on religion checks. The weapon must be attuned to gain this benefit.\n\nBlade Description\n\nDarkheart is a Longsword, forged of steel and a very powerful soul. The metal is darker than basic steel due to its dark nature. Even though the sword is of Asenrir a predominantly good and bright deity the magic within is one born from desperation in dark times, this evidently took a toll on the blades colour.\n\nThe hilt has a large ball within its centre mass, acting as an eyelid to an eye that only reveals itself in times of need and desperation and sometimes upon request. The eye has the ability to turn 360 degrees and view its surrounding as well as communicating through vocal methods not quite apparent.\n\nThis central part is much darker and sinister than the blade itself. A dark wrap around the grip a mixture of dark fur and grey leather. A small hand guard shaped almost like horns protecting the ball and handle of the weapon and hopefully the hands of its user.\n\nWhen Darkheart has activated the blade grows half a foot in length as well as lighting up in radiant flames. When the blade is activated the eye is a lot more active and more willing to respond, however, it is not something that has to happen, it depends on the souls mood and relationship with the creature weilding the weapon.\n\nDungeon Master Information\n\nConversion\n\nThe DM must roll a d4, this will determine the amount every score will be decreased by for 2d8+1 days. Make sure to remind the player that their conversion and faith now changed has left them shaken and confused and that is why they are not making some checks.Be sure to have other flavours so that player does not feel like they made the wrong choice or are being bullied.\n\nBackstory\n\nIn my Campaign, there was a great battle between deities, the deities each had different warriors and those who were the best or strongest were given stronger weapons and promised more time on the material plane. Darkheart was a powerful sword that captured the soul of Gwalter Gorlois, the original wielder. He was slain in his sleep and was not ready to leave the material plane, therefore, granted the ability to stay on the plane by having his soul implanted into the weapon as his murderer had not left.\n\nThe character who wields the weapon is considered the champion of Asenrir, this sword is one of a kind but there are others created like it from Asenrir. When Darkheart is nearby another weapon of Asenrir it will lightly hum and if the two weapons cross they will both shatter. They reconstruct themselves at dawn if a soul is inside while shattered it will experience immense pain. If this happens the swords will be telepathically screaming and reduce the wielder's AC by 2 as the screaming is so distracting.\n\nIt would be possible to communicate and build a relationship with Darkheart (Gwalter) he was a very religious man and providing he is on good terms with the wielder of the weapon he grants advantage on religious checks\n\nIt is unknown how many of these swords exist in the world but it is known that other deities have created similar weapons, defeating the champions of other deities isn't necessarily a good thing either, it is only appreciated when the deity of an opposite alignment, this means that Good on Good causes weapon to shatter, good on neutral will not be appreciated but good on evil will be rewarded.\n\nCredit\n\nSword Lines: Allentr\n\nDetails, Creation and bad colouring: Purry Collins /u/Purryplays\n\nIf you are to download this as a PDF please pay mindful tribute to the site that made it possible, The Homebrewery by Natural Crit",

  "latent_16476": "Last year saw the debut of a new series of bullion coins from collector favourite, the Perth Mint. Released much earlier in the year that it’s usual triumvirate of semi-numismatic silver bullion coins (Koala, Kookaburra, Lunar), and with a considerably higher fixed mintage at one-million units, the first coin depicted one of Australians best-known threats to human life, the Saltwater Crocodile. It was a hit and the mint sold out in just a couple of months.\n\nFast forward to 2015 and yet another of Australia’s menagerie of psychotic killers gets its own coin, the Funnel-Web Spider. Growing up to 5cm in length (the spider, not the coin…), these quite beautiful creatures are capable of inflicting a particularly nasty bite, and doing it in your own garden. Nice. The fangs in particular are an arachnophobes worst nightmare, along with their ability to walk along the bottom of your water-filled swimming pool for a couple of days while still being able to attack you.\n\nThe coin follows last years quite closely in design concept, a clean representation of the animal on a clean background, with all the inscriptions in a bordered surround near the rim. The spider lends itself well to this style, and we think it’s actually a slight step up from last years design as the crocodile seems a difficult animal to get right on a coin, although Perth did a good job twelve months ago.\n\nAvailable in 25-coin tubes, or in monster-boxes of 500, it’s a low-premium, good quality silver bullion coin of good design and restricted mintage. Only available in the one-ounce format, there were no proof, or other collector versions of the Saltwater crocodile released last year, so we wouldn’t expect any of this either. Seems like a bullion winner to us. At present we’ve only seen it up for bulk sale at Texas Precious Metals, a big Perth Mint bullion dealer in the US, but expect this to crop up in loads of places over the next week.",
  "latent_16693": "I spent a good chunk of the last four days installing an Internet web forum, which claims it can be up and running in 30 minutes.\n\nI like to think I’m pretty alright at computers. So what went wrong here? Well let me tell you.\n\nI don’t want to name and shame here, because this is not my first such experience and the problem is larger than one individual product. (Let’s just say it rhymes with “piss horse”.)\n\nThe 30-minute claim came because the software only officially supports being installed via Docker, the shiny new container gizmo that everyone loves because it’s shiny and new, which already set off some red flags. I managed to install an entire interoperating desktop environment without needing Docker for any of it, but a web forum is so complex that it needs its own quasivirtualized OS? Hmm.\n\nI tried installing the vendor Docker (I’m using Ubuntu 14.04, the current LTS release), but that’s 1.0, and Docker has gotten up to 1.7 in the intervening year and a half, and this software needs at least Docker 1.2. I stress that this web forum is so cutting-edge that it refuses to install without technology that did not exist two years ago.\n\nSo I tried installing current Docker via the officially condoned mechanism, which of course involves piping curl into your shell. That’s a fucking appalling idea, but security is kind of a joke with Docker anyway. It also didn’t work, giving me the rather useless E: Unable to locate package docker-engine instead. I’m sure glad Docker exists, to save me from all those package management nightmares!\n\nSome digging revealed that Docker just doesn’t exist for 32-bit, even though they say it should work (as evidenced by the existence of a canonical 32-bit Ubuntu package), and they just don’t bother mentioning this in their README or installation docs or shell script that runs as root.\n\nAt this point I was pretty sick of Docker, so I decided to try installing the damn thing manually. It was just a Rails app, after all, and I’ve managed to install those before. How hard could it possibly be?\n\nHa, ha! After a git clone (because the app isn’t in rubygems??), I then spent maybe six hours fighting with RVM. (I’m sure you have a suggestion for a different Ruby environment thing I should be using instead, and I don’t care, shut up, I already had RVM installed and running something else.)\n\nThe problem was some extremely obtuse errors when running bundle install , which is supposed to install all of the app’s dependencies. Some library was complaining that a .a file in its own build directory didn’t exist, which didn’t make a lot of sense. Also, I spotted x86_64-linux in the path, which made even less sense.\n\nSee, I actually have a 64-bit kernel, but a 32-bit userspace. (There’s a perfectly good reason for this.) And the Ruby binary that RVM built was, of course, 32-bit — it wouldn’t have worked otherwise, since libc and everything else are all 32-bit. But those binaries thought they were on a 64-bit system (which they were), and rubygems uses the system architecture for building native extensions for some stupid fucking reason, so everything was built as 64-bit. In a way I’m lucky that this one particular package happened to fail, because all the others built just fine, and I only would’ve found the problem later when I actually tried to run the damn thing.\n\nI tried all kinds of environment variables and hand-editing of files and whatnot to convince Ruby that it was actually 32-bit, to no avail. Eventually I resorted to reading a bunch of RVM’s source code, and then I discovered a --32 flag that magically fixes everything. It’s not documented, but don’t worry! I found a GitHub issue comment from three and a half years ago, saying the docs will be fixed with RVM 2.0.\n\nSo now I had a working Ruby, and after some tedious rebuilding, I had a set of gems as well. Super.\n\nNow I just had to figure out how to configure the damn app, which is tricky when the README just says “use Docker”. It had a config/app.conf.sample file, but this turned out to be sample configuration for Upstart, the Ubuntu service manager. I ended up discovering that there are still docs for installing on Ubuntu, just not linked from anywhere.\n\nThe next step was to migrate the database from “doesn’t exist” to “exists”, which is usually a breeze in Rails, by which I mean I have never once had it actually work without descending into a hellish nightmare and this time was no exception. The documentation claims the app needs to be superuser. Let’s see what PostgreSQL says about superusers.\n\nSuperuser status is dangerous and should be used only when really needed.\n\nYes, this definitely seems like something a web forum needs. I opted not to give it root on my entire database, which of course broke the migrations because they use CREATE EXTENSION to load binary extensions into my server, a perfectly reasonable thing for database migrations to be doing. I didn’t even have the required extension installed, and of course the documentation never once mentions needing it, so off I went to install it.\n\nI installed postgresql-contrib , and then some funny things happened. Long story short, I was running Postgres 9.1, and the current Ubuntu version is 9.3. I’d originally installed the postgresql package, and using Arch Linux on my desktop has spoiled me into thinking that that will keep me on the latest version, but Ubuntu cares about trivialities like “not breaking your entire server” and had just kept me on 9.1 the whole time. But postgresql-contrib , unqualified, meant the current version now which was 9.3, and had also installed the full server. Whoops! So I just took a quick detour to upgrade to 9.3, which I’ve done before and which is relatively painless.\n\nOkay! Now I have a database.\n\nAt this point the docs take a wild detour into installing some Ruby process management library called Bluepill and copying some massive pile of “configuration” (actually just Ruby code, of course) and using that to run the app and also adding Bluepill to the user’s crontab as a @reboot and what the ever-loving fuck.\n\n(I assumed this was some oblique Matrix reference, but someone later pointed out to me that it’s called bluepill and it keeps things up. Charming, but par for the course for Ruby.)\n\nAnyway, I opted to not do all that, and just ran the thing directly with rails server .\n\nAlmost done. Now I just need to proxy nginx to it. The app helpfully provides some configuration for me, which is two hundred lines long and consists mostly of convoluted rules for which URLs are static assets and which should be proxied. I decided to hell with it and just proxied the whole thing and I’ll fix it later if I feel like it.\n\nNow we’re up and running! Except I never get any signup email, and it turns out this is because I also have to run “sidekiq”, a job processor. And with that, now we’re done.\n\nI tell you this story to make the point that this is all completely fucking ridiculous.\n\nSet aside the oddball tool breakage and consider that if you follow the instructions to the letter, this web forum requires:\n\nCloning (not installing!) the software’s source code and modifying it in-place.\n\nCopy-pasting hundreds of lines of configuration into nginx, as root, and hoping it doesn’t change when you upgrade.\n\nCopy-pasting hundreds of lines of Ruby for the sake of bluepill, and hoping it doesn’t change when you upgrade.\n\nInstalling non-default Postgres extensions, as root.\n\nRunning someone else’s arbitrary database commands as a superuser.\n\nInstalling logrotate configuration, as root.\n\nThere’s nothing revolutionary here. It’s an app that wants to accept HTTP connections, use a database, and send email. Why is this so fucking complicated?\n\nI’ll tell you why—\n\nMy experience is admittedly limited here, but as far as I can tell, installing a Rails app is impossible. It reads configuration from the source directory. It logs to the source directory. You have to manually precompile all the assets, which are of course also written to the source directory.\n\nRails is one of the most popular web frameworks in the world, championed by developers everywhere. And you can’t actually install anything written with it. This is a joke, right?\n\nBack in the day, when Windows effectively didn’t have users and everyone just ran everything as an administrator, Unix nerds (myself included) would crow about how great Unix was for making heavy use of separate users for everything.\n\nBoy, do I have egg on my face. Let’s recap here:\n\nIf you’re missing a library or program, and that library or program happens to be written in C, you either need root to install it from your package manager, or you will descend into a lovecraftian nightmare of attempted local builds from which there is no escape. You say you need lxml on shared hosting and they don’t have libxml2 installed? Well, fuck you.\n\nto install it from your package manager, or you will descend into a lovecraftian nightmare of attempted local builds from which there is no escape. You say you need on shared hosting and they don’t have installed? Well, fuck you. Only one thing can bind to port 80 and it has to run as root , so your options are to use nginx and need root to add a new app, or use Apache and do .htaccess or something equally atrocious.\n\n, so your options are to use nginx and need root to add a new app, or use Apache and do or something equally atrocious. You want your app to start automatically, of course. You can add it to your crontab with @reboot , which is kind of a hack and also won’t restart it if it dies. So you can also install your own local process manager, like this app did. Or you can do what most people do and add it to the system’s daemon manager, as root . Allegedly many modern daemon manager things allow non-root users to set their own things up, but I’ve never seen this actually done or even explained very clearly.\n\n, which is kind of a hack and also won’t restart it if it dies. So you can also install your own local process manager, like this app did. Or you can do what most people do and add it to the system’s daemon manager, as . Allegedly many modern daemon manager things allow non-root users to set their own things up, but I’ve never seen this actually done or even explained very clearly. If you want to rotate your logs, well, that needs root .\n\n. You think Docker solves any of this? Let me know how piping curl to a shell script that uses sudo works out for you. Oh, and if you’re in the docker group, you are root.\n\nModern Linux desktops are pretty alright at the multi-user case, which basically no one uses. On the server side, well, if you have a server everyone just assumes you have root anyway, so everything is a giant mess. Even RVM, which is designed for having multiple per-user Ruby installations, prompted me for my password so it could sudo apt-get install something.\n\nWe are really, really bad at enumerating and handling dependencies.\n\nI mean, we can’t even express them in our own software. System package managers deal with it, and that’s great — but I’m a developer, not a packager. If I write a Python library that wraps a C library, there is no way to express that dependency. How would I? There’s no canonical repository of C/C++ packages, anywhere. Even if I could, what good would it do? Installing a shared C library locally is a gigantic pain in the ass, involving LD_LIBRARY_PATH , or maybe it was LDFLAGS=-rpath ? See, I don’t even know. Virtually no one does it, because it’s a huge pain, because virtually no one does it.\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that there is no way whatsoever to list dependencies on services. You’d think that a web app could just have some metadata saying “I need Postgres and, optionally, Redis”, but this doesn’t exist. And the other side, where the system can enumerate the services it has available for a user, similarly doesn’t exist. So there’s no chance of discovery. If you’re missing a service the app needs but failed to document, or you set it up wrong, you’ll just find out on the first request.\n\nSpeaking of:\n\nFor all the moving parts and all the things that can go wrong, there sure is a huge lack of reporting when it breaks. I basically rely on people tweeting at me or asking on IRC if something is broken. This particular app relied critically on a job queue, but didn’t notice it wasn’t running.\n\nThere are a few widgets that will email all crash logs to you, but what idiot came up with that? That’s completely fucking useless. I have over two thousand unread crash emails for my perfectly functional modest-traffic website. Almost all of them are some misconfigured crawler blowing up on bogus URLs in a way I don’t strongly care about fixing.\n\nBut if the app goes down and completely fails to start, I get zero email. If the app runs but every request takes 20 seconds, I get zero email. If every page 404s, I get zero email. And if real actual pages start to break, I get a flood of email that I’ll never notice because I don’t even look in that folder any more.\n\nThese are not unique problems. Yet the only solutions I’ve seen take the form of dozens of graphs you’re expected to keep an eye on manually.\n\nWe should have apps that install with one (1) command, take five minutes to configure, and scale up to multiple servers and down to shared hosting. If I cannot install your web forum on Dreamhost, you have failed spectacularly.\n\nBut we haven’t even tried to solve this, and all the people who are most capable of solving it are too busy scaling Twitter or Amazon up to ten million servers or whatever. Installing basic web software gets harder all the time, and shared hosting becomes less useful all the time, and web developers flock to garbage like Docker that basically runs a VM because we can’t figure out how to make two apps use the same damned database.\n\nThe thing I want, but never figured out how to build, is an intermediate web app for the express purpose of installing and managing web apps. Yes, sure, like cPanel or whatever, but not with ad-hoc support for some smattering of popular apps; I also want a protocol for apps to explain their own minimal requirements.\n\nI want to be able to say “install the Ruby app ‘pisshorse’”. And it goes and finds that gem. And it sees what Ruby version it claims to work on, and installs an RVM environment with that version. And it makes a new gemset and installs the gem. And it looks at a metadata file in a Well-Known Place, and it sees that the file demands a Postgres database and a Redis instance. And it inspects the common ways you might expect to be able to connect to Postgres or Redis. And then it asks me where Postgres and Redis are, and it offers whatever it found as defaults, and it accepts something concise like postgresql:///pisshorse rather than ten separate fields that make no sense if you’re not connecting over TCP. And it double-checks that those are okay, and it writes them to a very small configuration file in ~/.config/webapps/pisshorse or wherever. At no point am I asked to configure some ridiculous value like the TTL of database connections, which no one cares about and which the computer should be smart enough to gauge on its own.\n\nIf this is a shared host and you only have one Postgres database, that’s totally fine, because this is a magical world where people actually know about and use Postgres schemata, and apps actually support them.\n\nThe metadata file also lists any system-level libraries or binaries that are required (or desired), and if any of them aren’t installed, you’ll be asked to install them, with a single apt-get or yum or packer command you can inspect and then run yourself. Again, if this is a shared host and you can’t install software yourself, then the installer can either attempt to do it locally or just give up, and everything’s fine because it turns out web forums don’t actually need optipng and can just carry on without it.\n\nThen it adds the app to your user-scoped daemon manager, and if you don’t have one then it quietly pretends to be one, using the @reboot hack. And it sees that the app also needs a job queue running, so it adds that too. It uses gunicorn or unicorn or uwsgi or whatever, but you don’t actually care which, and if you do then you can ask for a different one. It defaults to only two workers, but it also keeps an eye on the load and spawns a few more if necessary, learning how much traffic is normal as it goes. If it thinks it’s eating too much of the machine, it sends you an email or pings you on IRC or whatever.\n\nThe app is bound to ~/.config/webapps/pisshorse/pisshorse.sock , which isn’t too useful to you. And this is the hard part that I haven’t figured out yet, because there’s not really a good way to determine what your HTTP vhost setup looks like, and if you’re using nginx then you still need root. But I have ideas for a couple (convoluted) workarounds, so let’s pretend that the world is a nice place and it can set up the reverse proxying for you, without needing root. It even adds rules for caching the static assets (also defined in the metadata file), and perhaps can ask you for a CDN if you have one.\n\nNow the app runs, but it has no users, and you can’t log in because you don’t have a confirmed email yet. But that’s okay, because the metadata file also specifies a few administrative commands you can run from the command line, and of course the magical web GUI can also do this for you.\n\nFrom here you can basically forget about the management GUI. But it quietly collects logs and stats, and there are graphs to look at if you please. If at any point the app fails to start, or there’s a sharp uptick in failures on pages that used to work, or it can’t keep up with requests, or the job queue is broken, you get a ping.\n\nEventually you’ll need to upgrade, and that’s also fine, because it’s just a single button click. Your current instance goes into read-only mode, which is a thing that all apps support, because it would be embarrassing if they didn’t. The job queue is shut down, the database is copied and upgraded, and a separate new instance of the app is launched. New requests are directed to the new code, the old instance is shut down, and the old database is archived. Or, if the new instance immediately starts to spew errors, the old code is kept up and an irate email is automatically sent to the app’s maintainer. Either way, the disruption is minimal.\n\nAnd the app benefits as well, because it uses a small library that knows whether it’s running under gunicorn or uwsgi or something else, and can perform some simple tasks like inspect its own load or restart itself or run some simple code outside a request.\n\nI can dream.\n\nWe’ve been doing this for 20 years. We should have this by now. It should work, it should be pluggable and agnostic, and it should do everything right — so if you threw away the web gui, it would look like something a very tidy sysadmin set up by hand, not autogenerated sludge.\n\nInstead, we stack layer after layer of additional convoluted crap on top of what we’ve already got because we don’t know how to fix it. Instead, we flit constantly from Thin to Mongrel to Passenger to Heroku to Bitnami to Docker to whatever new way to deploy trivial apps came out yesterday. Instead, we obsess over adding better Sass integration to our frameworks.\n\nAnd I’m really not picking on Ruby, or Rails, or this particular app. I hate deploying my own web software, because there are so many parts all over the system that only barely know about each other, but if any of them fail then the whole shebang stops working. I have at least five things just running inside tmux right now, because at least I can read the logs and restart them easily.\n\nThis is terrible and we should all be ashamed. No wonder PHP is so popular. How am I supposed to tell a new web developer that this is what they have to look forward to?",

There is a metropolitan media bias that says Trump can’t win, but they can’t vote. In betting terms, this is not a done deal. I see parallels with the Brexit vote at this stage.”\n\n“Trump at 4-1 or 11-2 will attract the smaller punters. But I don’t think that is only reason for the number of bets on him, and we have had to cut the odds on Trump three times in the last couple of days. This isn’t over.”\n\nWilliam Hill expresses caution on the US Election market, despite competitor Paddy Power announcing yesterday that it had closed the market paying out £800,000 to punters that had backed Clinton.\n\nFollowing its decision Paddy Power warned Should Trump upset the odds and become 45th President it will trigger the biggest political payout in bookmaking history and leave its trading team with some very expensive pie on its face.",
  "latent_17118": "Pro Tour has come and gone, leaving behind a format that isn't for the faint of heart. Effectively six mono-red decks dominating the Top 8, making control appear to be at its historical weakest. I wrote last time about U/R Control splashing and I was confident that the deck had high consistency as well as power. I ran it through gauntlets, went 4-0-drop in two Leagues, and confidently purchased the required cards for Pro Tour . I tested with the squad and impressed fellow Lingering Soul, Travis Woo. He was immediately onboard with the deck, watching me devastate each aggressive and midrange opponent with ease. The weekend before the Pro Tour in Kyoto featured a limited Grand Prix, which allowed me to keep the lid on my powerful control deck for the time being. After opening one of the weakest Sealed pools in recent history, I decided to hell with secrecy, and prepared to battle in the PTQ that Sunday.\n\nThe PTQ was an eight-round competition, filled with some powerful, Silver-level professionals. My expectations did drop prior to the event because we started testing against the new Ramunap Red phenomenon. Control, or any control for that matter, was at an extreme disadvantage against red decks. My hope was that the fad hadn't caught on yet, so I entered the arena with maindeck , hoping to skillfully dodge the red scare. I defeated nearly every archetype in Standard, falling once to Ramunap Red in the Swiss. My record of 7-1 was enough to propel me to the Top 8, but pure luck enabled me to make the elimination rounds, as, in Round 6, I battled against my second red-playing opponent of the day.\n\nThe first time didn't go well at all, but this opponent was playing a few Eldrazi creatures, making the matchup significantly better. When these burn decks tap all their mana for four- and five-drop creatures that aren't indestructible, control has a fighting chance. This match was intense, with Game 3 coming down to a on Ramanap Ruins, followed by a on the next activation to seal the game. I won that game at one life, against a crude version, and I still needed to muster every ounce of luck to do so.\n\nThe Top 8 of the PTQ began and my opponent started with a turn 1 . I was on the play with and no removal, so I easily lost to the influx of creatures and burn that followed. Game 2, I had the best possible opening hand. I deployed a on turn 1, an on turn 2, a counterspell on turn 3, a on turn 4, and a couple of s to flex control's card advantage muscle in the face of my opponent.\n\nI easily lost this game.\n\nHis hand was reduced to a couple of lands, but my life total was at six after a few bouts with a pesky Phoenix that haunted me from the graveyard. After exiling the annoying thing, I found myself dead to three land tosses and my PTQ victory with it. At this point, I realized that Ramunap Red was a different animal and much more resilient than Mono-Red has ever been. It can win with no resources, or flooded. The creatures prevent blocking, making Ramunap Red strong against decks that would historically have had an advantage.\n\nI informed my team that control had no shot to defeat this new plague on Standard, which broke my heart. I had found a control deck that can compete with any archetype, except for the most-played one in that upcoming Pro Tour. My teammates and I hit the database, looking for cards that gained life in . Understandably, black was the color with the most options, but each spell had a double color requirement. This left artifacts as the only go-to for control's survival. We tried , , and , but to no avail. These spells didn't gain life at a fast-enough rate, nor did they put pressure on the opponent. We finally came across a hidden bomb from Sealed tournaments, .\n\nprovides a lifelink threat against aggressive decks at a reasonable cost. The biggest concern we had in testing was if the Ramunap Red players would sideboard in additional s for . If opponents decided to bring in more s, then this sideboard plan would be inherently flawed.\n\nEven after testing against a full set of hate from the red decks, was still the best shot control had. This evened the matchup to a coin toss, 50/50, but only in Games 2 and 3. Game 1 was almost a guaranteed loss unless I butchered the deck in a way that would ruin the other matchups. Being down one game and even post-sideboard is a terrible gameplan for a Pro Tour against the best deck. For this reason, I tabled this powerful control deck and betrayed everything I've ever stood for.\n\nThis is nearly identical to the 75 I ran in the PTQ. The only changes are the additions of , a couple , and a few numbers tweaks in the sideboard. The maindeck is the same and I wouldn't change it at this point. I understand that is embarrassing against Ramunap Red, but cutting it hurts the mirror, midrange, and combo decks. Game 1 is as close to a giveaway as possible, so focus your strengths on defeating red decks after sideboarding.\n\nMy team and I thought of as a sideboard option against aggressive decks. It is the best blocker that U/R-style decks can muster, leading us to these desperate measures. , four , and a set of s combined give Control the tools required to even the score.\n\nAlthough Ramunap Red has endangered the well-being of control in Standard, it takes only slight metagame shift to resuscitate the archetype. Zombies is on the rise as a deck that can tango with and friends, which is a fantastic matchup for all builds of control. If a few more of these midrange decks surge forward and take the throne away from Ramunap Red, control will be in position to pounce. That is what good Standard is all about: metagames that continuously shift, where one deck becomes dominant and then others exploit weaknesses and climb to the top. Ramunap Red isn't unbeatable, but it is kryptonite to all forms of control. Being able to win by drawing lands that deal damage is a dimension that control decks cannot regularly defeat.\n\nMy Treason\n\n\"I have never walked around a tournament with this much time between rounds. I guess I will go get a beverage.\" @shaheenmtg pic.twitter.com/GkZ2ECZVZH — Brian David-Marshall (@Top8Games) July 29, 2017\n\nWith the sting of that Top 8 defeat and the futile attempt to make work, I turned to the enemy. Team #LingeringSouls and I took the most powerful deck, once again, and attempted to make the best version. The team and I determined that four was the correct number early in testing. Hazoret is the key to the Ramunap Red mirror, which means having less than four copies was a bit ambitious. The mirror boiled down to which player can get a God attacking first, so adding the fourth copy was a no-brainer. The biggest mistake we made after that revelation is not adding an additional land. Having four copies of in the sideboard, four copies of Hazoret in the main, and only twenty-three lands was a bit foolish.\n\nWe learned this in the tournament as many of us fell to not hitting the fourth land on time for a crucial God or planeswalker. The team had an overall positive record with Ramunap Red at Pro Tour . Donald Smith started hot at 7-1 and all the rest of the Souls made Day 2. I started off Constructed at 3-0 on Day 2, once I figured out how to aggro appropriately. The event was very enjoyable, as BDM posted a few images of my new guilty pleasure.\n\nI will not lie, my friends: finishing rounds with 30 minutes or more on the clock was a new phenomenon for me (outside of Limited). I will say I hated the gameplay of the mirror match, which resulted in three of my five Constructed losses. I felt that the games outside of the mirror had a decent amount of play to them, but nothing compared to the satisfying icy grip that control provides. I wanted my last event with the team to be unified, piloting the deck of my enemies, and I have no regrets. I did reaffirm my dislike of the archetype in competitive play and I will probably never cast a Raging Goblin-style card again, but I did gain additional perspective on aggro that I didn't have prior.\n\nAggro decks aren't the only aspects disappearing from my competitive game. Team #LingeringSouls is officially no longer together after Pro Tour . The team I crafted from a ragtag group of Twitter leftovers achieved incredible things. Donald Smith Jr. is a Platinum pro with a Pro Tour Top 8, Chris Fennell is a Gold pro with another Pro Tour Top 8, Travis Woo is a Gold pro, and both Andreas Ganz and I achieved Silver once again.\n\nWhen this group was crafted, we only had a couple of Silver-level pros amongst us. Stepping back and observing the gains is awe-inspiring, which helped create this wonderful narrative from the Pro Tour Team Series. Brian David-Marshall came to one of our testing houses, interviewed us, and watched us dominate the leaderboard and enter the top four teams after Pro Tour Amonkhet. The teams around us were cluttered with Hall of Famers, squads fully comprised of Platinum pros, and dominated by the best players in the world. We were truly the underdogs that achieved great things together and I am going to miss my squad, my family, my friends.\n\nWith every end, there is a new beginning. I am proud to announce that I will be a member of #TeamCardhoarder, effective immediately. I was approached with the offer as the professional season ended and I accepted with high expectations. The members of #TeamCardhoarder are talented professionals that I have known for a very long time. Noah Walker, Devin Koepke, and Joe Lossett are all close friends of mine that I have known for years. I am also joining Jack Kiefer and Bobby Graves, who are both powerful up-and-comers in the game that I am very excited to work with.\n\nThis group of players reminds me of my previous team in many ways. They are young, talented, and hungry, which creates a recipe for success. I come in as the veteran, older mage once again, bringing some wisdom from years of playing on the SCG and Pro Tours. I expect #TeamCardhoarder to rise to the challenge, just as Team #LingeringSouls did before. Old man experience, combined with youthful vigor, is a dangerous duo!",
  "latent_17167": "Survey of 200 executives indicates most manufacturers plan to increase investments in data analytics over next year – even while delaying other technology investments\n\nA recent survey of manufacturing executives indicates many respondents (67 percent) are pressing ahead with plans to invest in data analytics even as they pare back spending in other areas to combat tough business conditions.\n\nThe reason: Many say they view data analytics – a key component of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) – as a viable solution to a cycle of problems that lead to downtime and lost revenue.\n\nMore than 200 North American manufacturing executives took part in the survey titled Data’s Big Impact on Manufacturing: A Study of Executive Opinions. The survey was jointly conducted by Honeywell Process Solutions (HPS) and KRC Research, from May 23 to June 8, 2016.\n\n“Executives need to keep their businesses running smoothly and safely, and they’re banking on IIoT technologies to help navigate challenges, even during cash-strapped times,” says Andrew Hird, vice president and general manager, HPS Digital Transformation.\n\n“For more than 40 years, Honeywell has provided leading automation technologies that help manufacturers meet those goals. The IIoT by Honeywell is the next step in that evolution.”\n\nAmong other key findings of the survey:\n\nSome companies are feeling pressure to continue working under the threats of unscheduled downtime and equipment breakdowns, which are viewed the most detrimental to maximizing revenue.\n\nThe majority of companies say they are already investing in data analytics technology.\n\nMore than a quarter said they don’t plan to invest in data analytics in the next year; of that group, not understanding the benefits of data analytics and inadequate resources are among the most cited reasons for this lack of investment.\n\nA tough cycle of downtime\n\nUnscheduled downtime was ranked as the top threat to maximizing revenue, but 42 percent of respondents admitted to running equipment harder than they should. When asked how often their companies experienced a list of issues in recent years, 71 percent of respondents said they experienced equipment breakdowns at least occasionally, while 64 percent said the same for unscheduled downtime.\n\n“Running plant equipment harder than appropriate presents a host of issues ranging from equipment breakdowns to potential safety incidents,” says Hird. “Those issues inevitably lead to more downtime, which leads back to lost revenue. It’s easy to see how many companies feel they’re caught in a vicious cycle. Predictive analytics achieved through an effective IIoT by Honeywell solution can help companies break out of that cycle.”\n\nForty percent ranked unscheduled downtime as the biggest threat to maximizing revenue. Other threats included:\n\nSupply chain management issues (39 percent)\n\nInadequate staffing (37 percent)\n\nOff-spec products (36 percent)\n\nEquipment breakdowns (32 percent)\n\nData analytics as a viable solution\n\nData analytics is a key component of a successful IIoT implementation for manufacturers. Most respondents had favorable views of the benefits of data analytics as a solution. For example, the executives said they agreed big data analytics can reduce the occurences of:\n\nEquipment breakdowns (70 percent)\n\nUnscheduled downtime (68 percent)\n\nUnscheduled maintenance (64 percent)\n\nSupply chain management issues (60 percent)\n\nRespondents also said they believe data can enable well-informed decisions in real time (63 percent), limit waste (57 percent), and predict the risk of downtime (56 percent).\n\n“It’s easy to put that puzzle together – these executives correctly believe data analytics can help them combat the biggest threat they see to business: unscheduled downtime,” Hird says. “This is why they feel it makes sense to continue investing.”\n\nAdditionally, more than two-thirds of respondents (68 percent) said they are currently investing in data analytics, and 50 percent said they believe their companies are right on track in their use of data analytics. Fifteen percent said they believe their companies are ahead of the curve as it relates to data analytics usage.\n\nNot everyone is sold\n\nWhile the majority of respondents said they are already investing and/or planning to increase their investments in data analytics in the coming year, 32 percent said they are not currently investing in data analytics. Meanwhile, 33 percent said their companies are not planning to invest in data analytics in the next 12 months, or are unaware of any plans to do so.\n\nOf those who currently have no plans to invest:\n\n61 percent believe their organizations already have systems in place to ensure safety, yield and success\n\n45 percent said their companies have seen some growth without data analytics\n\n42 percent said they don’t fully understand the benefits of big data\n\n35 percent believe people are overstating the benefits of big data\n\nSixty-three percent of respondents who said they have no investment plans indicated they just don’t have the resources to appropriately do so, while 39 percent said they don’t have the right staff to make the most of data analytics.\n\n“For some companies, hurdles remain before the IIoT can be fully adopted,” explains Hird. “Some don’t believe they need it while others say they lack the resources to do it right. The good news is that IIoT is something that doesn’t require a wholesale change – it can be phased and scaled depending on an individual company’s circumstances. This is precisely why Honeywell says IIoT represents an evolution, not a revolution.”",
  "latent_17219": "Washington, DC— Earth's magnetic field shields us from deadly cosmic radiation, and without it, life as we know it could not exist here. The motion of liquid iron in the planet’s outer core, a phenomenon called a “geodynamo,” generates the field. But how it was first created and then sustained throughout Earth’s history has remained a mystery to scientists. New work published in Nature from a team led by Carnegie’s Alexander Goncharov sheds light on the history of this incredibly important geologic occurrence.\n\nOur planet accreted from rocky material that surrounded our Sun in its youth, and over time the most-dense stuff, iron, sank inward, creating the layers that we know exist today—core, mantle, and crust. Currently, the inner core is solid iron, with some other materials that were dragged along down during this layering process. The outer core is a liquid iron alloy, and its motion gives rise to the magnetic field.\n\nA better understanding of how heat is conducted by the solid of the inner core and the liquid in the outer core is needed to piece together the processes by which our planet, and our magnetic field, evolved—and, even more importantly, the energy that sustains a continuous magnetic field. But these materials obviously exist under very extreme conditions, both very high temperatures and very intense pressures. This means that their behavior isn’t going to be the same as it is on the surface.\n\n“We sensed a pressing need for direct thermal conductivity measurements of core materials under conditions relevant to the core,” Goncharov said. “Because, of course, it is impossible for us to reach anywhere close to Earth’s core and take samples for ourselves.”\n\nThe team used a tool called a laser-heated diamond anvil cell to mimic planetary core conditions and study how iron conducts heat under them. The diamond anvil cell squeezes tiny samples of material in between two diamonds, creating the extreme pressures of the deep Earth in the lab. The laser heats the materials to the necessary core temperatures.\n\nUsing this kind of lab-based mimicry, the team was able to look at samples of iron across temperatures and pressures that would be found inside planets ranging in size from Mercury to Earth—345,000 to 1.3 million times normal atmospheric pressure and 2,400 to 4,900 degrees Fahrenheit—and study how they propagate heat.\n\nThey found that the ability of these iron samples to transmit heat matched with the lower end of previous estimates of thermal conductivity in Earth’s core—between 18 and 44 watts per meter per kelvin, in the units scientists use to measure such things. This translates to predictions that the energy necessary to sustain the geodynamo has been available since very early in the history of Earth.\n\n“In order to better understand core heat conductivity, we will next need to tackle how the non-iron materials that went along for the ride when iron sunk to the core affect these thermal processes inside of our planet,” Goncharov added.\n\nThe paper’s other authors are Zuzana Konopkova of DESY Photon Science, Stewart McWilliams of University of Edinburgh, and Natalia Gomez-Perez of Universidad de Los Andes.\n\nCaption: An illustration of how the diamond anvil cell is used to mimic and study planetary core conditions, courtesy of Stewart McWilliams.

  "latent_17261": "One of my favourite seasonal treats from the forest garden is the hostas. No, no spelling mistake: hostas are really edible. In fact, they are a near perfect forest garden crop. Woodland is the natural habitat of many hosta species, so they like moist soil with plenty of organic matter and tolerate a considerable amount of shade. A friend tells me that they have a positive allelopathic relationship (i.e. they secrete chemicals that help each other) with apples, and since the research on it is published in Russian I’ll have to take her word for it. Hostas are no novelty nibble: they have the potential to be a major productive vegetable.\n\nThe best part of the hosta is the ‘hoston’, the rolled up leaf as it emerges in the spring, although many varieties are still pretty good even once they have unfurled. The best way of cooking them depends on the size of the hostons. Small ones are delicious if you fry them for a few minutes, then add a little light soy sauce and sesame oil. The slight bitterness of the hostons complements the saltiness of the soy sauce very well. Similarly, they go very well in stir fries. The chunkier hostons are better boiled briefly and used as a vegetable. In the picture below, the hostons on the right are bound for frying, those on the left are for boiling.\n\nHostons are best cropped by gripping them firmly near the base and snapping ones off the edge of the clump. If you can snap them off right at the base they will hold together as a whole instead of falling apart into individual leaves. The short leaf scales around the base are bitterer than the larger leaves so they are worth removing. It is much easier to harvest the hostons if the crown of the plant is a little above ground level when it is planted. It is possible to harvest the whole first flush of leaves of an established plant without killing it: ornamental hosta growers will sometimes ‘mow’ their plants to get a second flush of fresh, attractive leaves.\n\nLater on, the open leaves can be used as a general pot herb or substituted for spinach in recipes like ‘hostakopita’. The flowers and flower buds are also edible: the Montreal Botanical Garden lists all species as edible and Hosta fortunei as the tastiest.\n\nIt seems to be an open question whether every single species of hosta is edible and therefore whether it is a good idea to try any unidentified hosta that you may happen across. The species I have eaten regularly myself are H. sieboldiana, montana and longipes. Martin Crawford lists H. crispula, longipes, montana, plantaginea, sieboldii, sieboldiana, undulata and ventricosa. Plants for a Future add H. clausa, clavata, longissima, nigrescens, rectifolia and tardiva and list no known hazards for the genus as a whole. This covers all the common ornamental species except H minor, which probably isn’t worth it anyway, and H fortunei, which must be edible since the most popular variety of it, ‘Sagae’ originally arose in hostas being grown for food in Sagae City in Japan. On the basis of that I’m happy to try any hosta myself, but if you’re going to do that, remember to try only a small piece first and test for a skin reaction by rubbing a piece on your skin before putting anything in your mouth.\n\nFor more on eating hostas, there is a discussion and some astonishingly beautiful pictures of hosta dishes on the Seed Savers’ Forum. There was also a very useful article in Permaculture Magazine No. 58. It isn’t online unfortunately, but you can buy the back issue if you are really keen. A fellow wordpress blogger has also been writing about eating hostas here.\n\nIn Japan, hostas are prized as sansai or ‘mountain vegetables’, a class of plants that are usually gathered wild from the mountain and are considered to be particularly strong in vitality. There’s a great blog post about sansai at http://shizuokagourmet.com/sansai/.\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_17300": "In the mid-nineteen-eighties, when he was the head of the photography program at the San Francisco Art Institute, Larry Sultan hired me as an adjunct faculty member—the beginning of our lifelong friendship. I’d visit him often in his studio at the Headlands Center for the Arts, in a converted old military barracks at the foot of Rodeo Beach. Assembled on the wall was a grid of small film stills he had made from his family’s home movies, the beginning of his series “Pictures From Home.” When I’d walk in, he’d be standing there, staring at the grid, sipping a little Scotch, moving a few pictures around, having himself some fun. We might talk for a while about the cinematic rhythm of the grid, the psychological clues residing in this scavenged record of his childhood, or about whether this kind of personal documentation had any cultural relevance at all. Then, invariably, we would head out for a late-afternoon hike on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific and sit there for a while, the vastness of the ocean an open platform for our free-floating conversations. Sometimes we plumbed the deeply personal, at other times the wilds of Derrida or Foucault, but, by the time the sun was levitating just above the horizon, our serious musings had devolved into a bunch of goofy laughter.\n\nOne day, we were talking about intelligence—what composes it, how it’s manifest, agreeing that academic aptitude alone is not what propels civilization forward. I wondered aloud if all great ideas didn’t have some fundamental emotional source, like the Wright brothers’ impulse to fly, for example. Larry then said something that stopped me in my tracks: “Isn’t imagination really the final measure of intelligence?” It was the most obvious thing in the world—and revelatory—but it had never occurred to me before. He seemed always to have such observations, casually offered, as if in an afterthought, and, because of it, I always found myself learning something when I was with him.\n\nIn 1983, after completing a series of conceptual collaborations with his classmate Mike Mandel, including their masterpiece “Evidence,” Larry embarked on a personal opus, “Pictures from Home.” The photo series was completed in 1991, and has recently been republished by Mack Books. An exploration of his own childhood undertaken through an almost forensic scrutiny of his family, the project presents a combination of still images culled from home movies, contemporary photographs that Sultan took of his mother and father in their affluent Palm Springs retirement community, and conversations he recorded with them. Larry mined the memories and musings of his parents, Jews who had migrated from New York to California in the late nineteen-forties; he was interested in their ideas about creating a home, and their values and desires in pursuit of the good life, but he was equally interested in exploring the act of documentation itself. He wondered how to navigate his paradoxical role as a “subject in the drama rather than a witness.”\n\nIt was a running joke between us that Larry’s contemplation of his childhood in “Pictures from Home” got him as far as puberty. For his next body of work, he returned to the neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley where his own sexuality had formed. In “The Valley” (1998–2003), he documented pornographic-film production in suburban homes rented out for that purpose. One picture, from 2001, “Sharon Wild,” presents an archetypal figure sitting undressed on the edge of a bed with her arms folded across her chest—the Hitchcock blonde gone bad. I can imagine Larry standing with his camera in the doorway of that suburban bedroom, the resonance of his own parents’ bedroom summoning the sixteen-year-old in him all over again. Sharon sits there in bra and panties, looking at the camera tentatively, her arms folded gracefully, self-protectively. Larry saw beyond the porn actress, more exposed in the intimacy of a quiet moment in front of a stranger’s camera than when she was performing before a cast and crew. “The Valley” is a visual contemplation of an animal impulse in the context of late capitalism, activated by the artifices and edifices of the American suburb.\n\nBoth “Pictures from Home” and “The Valley” probe the narrative possibilities and limitations of photography, and the longing summoned by a presiding American Dream. In “Homeland,” the series Larry completed soon before he died, in 2009, he once again returned to the California suburbs, this time to explore a different side of the land of opportunity. Larry hired immigrant laborers who assembled every morning in strip-mall parking lots for daily jobs in construction. He employed them as photographic models in a variety of staged activities set against the backdrop of the “promised land.” These workers had come to the United States not to make a home for themselves but to make enough money to send back home to their families in Mexico or Central America. In Larry’s own words, “the resulting dramas are small and mundane in nature: carrying food to a potluck, stringing lights on a tree, or walking to a waiting car. They are routines and rituals related to place and domesticity, alluding to the poignancy of displacement and the longing for home.”\n\nLarry and his wife, Kelly, lived in Marin County at the very end of a half-mile-long boardwalk, past an array of idiosyncratic houses. Their house—spare and unique, but elegant and comfortable—seemed to float on water. In the last years of his life, Larry’s studio was next door; when he worked, he could look out at the fortress of San Quentin prison, on the other side of the Bay, or across the open marshlands, with their egrets and wrens, to a distant view of the San Francisco skyline. Larry’s photographs possess a quality of hard-edged California light, heightened color, optical precision, and, often, domestic familiarity made more fascinating by the power of his imagination. Whenever I walked down the boardwalk and entered his house, I was reminded of the light in his pictures; this is where he honed his precision-cut insight. The home he created with Kelly in no way resembled the suburban theatre of his childhood, investigated in his many bodies of work; it was the home he had always wanted.\n\nThis piece was drawn from “Larry Sultan: Here and Home,” which was published by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and DelMonico Books / Prestel in 2014. “Here and Home,” a retrospective of Sultan’s work, opens at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art on April 15th.",
  "latent_17332": "The textbook simplicity of this format is irresistible. The visual self-schooling particular to looking at art kicks in, and almost before you know it your eyes are off and running, darting back and forth, parsing differences in style, brushwork, color, detail and overall effect, the expression of emotion that Matisse said he was always after.\n\nSpread through eight galleries whose spaciousness aids concentration, each pair or group forms its own mini-seminar. Together they show Matisse restlessly roving between extremes, relentlessly rethinking and revising his way to greatness with radical ideas about economy and finish that changed the course of painting. His palette is rarely less than audaciously original. Attention should be paid to his habit of painting dark colors over bright ones to create a subtle underglow and his frequent emphasis on blank canvas as a source of light and texture. Always he sought an implicitly modern directness and rawness that created a brave new intimacy among artist, object and viewer. He claimed to work “toward what I feel; toward a kind of ecstasy.”\n\nMatisse’s practice of copying grew out of his academic training, which by long tradition involved copying old masters in the Louvre. But he shifted this exercise toward the present, copying far more contemporary works, trying out different, mostly Post-Impressionist styles. The first gallery includes a still life homage to Cézanne (1904) and another work depicting the same arrangement in the Pointillist-based manner of Paul Signac (1904-5). Even more interesting are two 1899 still lifes with compote and fruit. One is richly painted, an encompassing Post-Impressionist tribute (van Gogh, Gauguin, Cézanne, Vuillard) cast in a honeyed light. The other is spare, almost skeletal: the fruit and vessels are denoted by flat silhouettes of bright color, the cabinet on which they rest by mostly unpainted canvas. Natural light as such is absent, but the seeds of all Matisse’s great economies are here.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Did Matisse start with the simpler version and like it so much that he deemed it finished, and so switched to a second canvas to make the richer if more conventional Neo-Impressionist medley he originally intended? Or did he paint the more heavily worked canvas first and then, attempting something more pared down, lose his nerve and leave the second unfinished? Either way, Matisse was already beginning to use copying as a way to take the same motif to different pictorial conclusions, shifting from opulent to austere, or austere to opulent. In the case of two 1906 “Young Sailor” paintings, the first can be read as an overworked farewell to Fauvism, while the second cuts to the chase, conveying its subject with consummate abbreviating ease against a flat pink background as if dispatched in a single work session. (Its simplicity apparently made Matisse a little uneasy; when he showed these canvases to the collector Leo Stein, he dissembled briefly, saying that the second had been painted by a rural letter carrier.) Meanwhile he seems almost to have abandoned the 1909 “Seated Nude,” with its patchy color, flurries of pencil and disturbing doll-like face, for its more robust twin of the same year, “Nude With a White Scarf,” more conventionally fleshed out in paint and thick black lines.\n\nIt is possible to spend your entire visit in the second and third galleries of this mesmerizing exhibition, mulling over the sailors, the nudes with white scarves, the more regal nude with attendants of “Le Luxe I” and “Le Luxe II” of 1907-8 (Matisse’s “Birth of Venus”?) or the contrasting psychological chords and spatial treatments of the Laurettes. The Museum of Modern Art’s magisterial “Goldfish and Palette,” with its fractured, quasi-Cubist transparencies and incessantly scratched paint, overpowers its more demure cousin, “Interior With Goldfish” (both 1914), until you notice that in this second work the hot orange of the goldfish glimmers subversively through almost the entire surface.\n\nAnd it is almost shocking to see that the Modern’s great, sketchily painted, nearly all-blue “View of Notre Dame” (1914) has an unlikely fraternal twin from the same year: a relatively realistic view of that cathedral that might almost be a blowup of a postcard except for the daring brevity of its watercolor-thin pastel colors and frequent passages of exposed canvas. Both paintings challenge conventional notions of finish, though from almost opposite directions.\n\nBut there is much more on offer. Two relatively comfy views of Matisse’s first hotel room in Nice are traduced by the grandeur of “Interior With a Violin,” a larger third version whose prevailing shades of black dramatically highlight the bit of sunbaked beach visible through the louvered shutters. Three views of the beach at Étretat, on the coast of northern France, revisit a scene beloved by Monet, presenting different catches of the day while experimenting with deep space and variously notational ways of indicating pebbles, bluff and water.\n\nIn the 1930s Matisse began having black-and-white photographs taken of his paintings at regular intervals as he worked on them. This was clearly another way to preserve artistic ideas for future use, but he also sent photographs to clients and further valued them as proof against critics’ claims that his paintings were casually dashed off. In 1945 he went so far as to exhibit six paintings, each surrounded by its matching photographs, at Galerie Maeght in Paris. The seventh gallery of the Met show presents three of the Maeght canvases amid their evidentiary pictures. They establish that Matisse’s progress was often grueling and yet, especially with the ornate vessels and shell in “Still Life With Magnolia” (1941) and the sleeping model in peasant blouse of “The Dream” (1940), he worked through his difficulties to a final image that exudes consummate freshness and ease.\n\nBy the time you reach this point in this astounding exhibition, it is clear that Matisse’s paintings are almost always hard-won distillations, but it is nonetheless marvelous to see the process so forthrightly chronicled. His ecstasy was built on numerous forms of transparency.",
  "latent_17335": "58 Pages Posted: 1 Aug 2011 Last revised: 18 Jan 2016\n\nDate Written: January 13, 2016\n\nAbstract\n\nIn recent years, the courts have invalidated a variety of campaign finance laws while simultaneously upholding disclosure requirements. Courts view disclosure as a less-restrictive means to root out corruption while critics claim that disclosure chills speech and deters political participation. Using individual-level contribution data from state elections between 2000 and 2008, we find that the speech-chilling effects of disclosure are negligible. On average, donors to state-level campaigns are equally likely to contribute in subsequent elections in states that increase the public visibility of campaign contributions, relative to donors in states that do not change their disclosure laws or practices over the same time period -- estimates are indistinguishable from zero and confidence intervals are narrow around zero. Moreover, we do not observe heterogeneous effects for small donors or ideological outliers despite an assumption in First Amendment jurisprudence that these donors are disproportionately affected by campaign finance regulations. In short, the argument that disclosure chills speech is not supported by the data.",

The white working class is having a hard time. The white middle class is contracting. The white working poor are slipping even further into crushing poverty. We know this because rates of suicide, drug addiction and alcoholism are up all over the country in white communities. And contrary to the popular myth, unemployment, alcoholism, and drug abuse are not the result of \"moral failings.\"\n\nYou guys are getting your asses kicked by an economy that doesn't work for you anymore and you're in pain. It must be even more frustrating because it's the economy you wanted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nStop. Furiously denying it won't change anything. This is a Republican economy full of Republican \"free markets\", Republican deregulation, Republican tax cuts and you voted for Republicans. The 1% has more money than 90% of the country. Just 8 people, 6 of them from the United States, control as much wealth as half of the entire population of the planet. You'd have to work a month to earn what a CEO makes in an hour. And that's if you even have a job that pays more than minimum wage. Does any of that sound like the \"Socialist/Communist/Marxist\" economy you've been told liberals want?\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nThis is a Republican economy and it's what you voted for.\n\nThis will not be something that you want to hear but it's true. It's also true that Republicans have zero interest in the job creation you crave because they do not care about you. You hear a lot about how liberal government regulations kill jobs but no one can ever quite seem to explain to you how allowing Wall Street to recklessly gamble with your bank deposits will lower unemployment. We all know how easily that gambling destroys your job, life savings, and your future but when was the last time a booming stock market created a single job opening in your town?\n\nWall Street doesn't care about giving back to your community. Why are you so eager to have Republicans repeal regulations that are keeping the banks from fucking you like they did in '08? This is what you voted for so who's fault will it be when they crash the economy again?\n\nThe decline of coal jobs is a little different but that's also not our fault. It's not your fault for voting Republican, either, in case you were wondering. It's not even the fault of coal companies, environmentalists or the Chinese. Sometimes technology just kills jobs and even as a pro-labor liberal, I can't say, \"Don't use machines that can do the job of 1000 men!\" It sucks, but it happens.\n\nWhat is your fault is what came after. We could easily spend a teeny tiny fraction of the budget to retrain coal mining country (and the entire rust belt). Every out of work coal miner can be taught to professionally install solar panels or any of 1000 or more other good paying jobs, so why aren't we doing that? Again, because the Republicans you keep voting for refuse to help you. As far as they're concerned, coal miners are good for photo ops and talking points and that's it. Jesus Christ, they even tried to cut healthcare for miners suffering from Black Lung! Do you honestly think they're going to fix your local economies?\n\nI could go on like this for a while but you get the idea.\n\nAt some point, you have to ask yourself: What is more important to me? Do I want my kids to have healthcare, a paying job and a future? Or is it more important to punish gays for having anal sex? Do I want to be able to retire someday or do I want to keep working until the day I die because I oppose birth control? Do I want to a job that pays a living wage with benefits or will I keep working part time for peanuts because I don't like immigrants?\n\nYou tell us that you vote Republican because they will \"make America great again\" but all they're proposing is more of the exact same economic policies that made you so angry in the first place. More tax cuts for the insanely rich. Less regulations for the banks. Less benefits for you that you've paid for your entire working life. What the hell are you doing?\n\nYou've been steadily losing the culture wars for decades but it was only when the economy really abandoned you that you started to drink and take drugs and commit suicide in record numbers. This tells me that while, yes, you flipped out over marriage equality and the black man in the White House, the destruction of your economic future hit you in a much more personal way that you didn't understand how to articulate other than self-destruction.\n\nIt doesn't have to be that way. You may reflexively hate the Democratic Party because they're godless liberal commies but listen to what they want: Opportunity for our kids. Good paying jobs for us. The ability to retire with dignity. Sound familiar? It's what Trump promised but cannot deliver because Republicans will never give him the chance. I'll bet you money that if a Democratic majority handed Trump a bill to rebuild roads and bridges in your city and create hundreds of jobs in the process, he'd sign it in a heartbeat. You will never get that from Republicans. Ever. Republicans don't do infrastructure anymore.\n\nYes, Democrats want equality for minorities and the LGBT community, too, but if you live in the Midwest, why do care? It hardly affects you. A gay couple getting married down the street may make you feel threatened but they're not going to foreclose on your house or take away your Social Security. On the other hand, we've already seen firsthand where Republican economics leads us and if you didn't lose your home, you probably know someone who did. What is going to hurt you more, bankruptcy or two men kissing?\n\nYou have a choice: Allow your distaste for Those People to override your economic self-interest or stop voting for the party that has spent decades stripping you of your future. Even if Republicans banned gay marriage, abortion, and immigrants tomorrow, they still wouldn't lift a single finger to create jobs for you because they do not care about you. They'd just find something new for you to be afraid of and demand you vote for their massive 1% tax cuts so they can fight whatever tomorrow's scary new threat is.\n\nYou're hurting and all the drugs and alcohol in the world won't make that pain go away until you make the Republican economic agenda that's killing you go away.\n\nThere are 469 days left to the 2018 elections.\n\n- This article kills fascists\n\nPlease consider becoming a paid member of The Daily Banter and supporting us in holding the Trump administration to account.

That is unbelievable!’\n\n“But then you see the games. There are no easy one, two, three situations where he could have scored and you think ‘uh-oh, he should have scored’.\n\n“I’ve been here a year, and even I have thought in some moments: ‘Ball… Sturridge…. Goal. Oh No!’ There are moments when you think he should score and he doesn’t but you have to carry on.\n\n“It is a very important and very useful moment in his career.\n\n“A big name.... (Robert) Lewandowski. There were times when he didn’t score. Gerd Muller! There were games he didn’t score.\n\n“I still can’t believe it. You look back on his career and he scored 600 times but there were moments when he didn’t score.\n\n“It is only to handle situations like this. It is not to make too big a thing about it.”\n\nKlopp hasn’t felt the need to talk to Sturridge about his long wait for a Premier League goal.\n\n“I don’t have to,” he said. “It’s like when you have a problem, you don’t want someone coming up to you all the time, tapping your shoulder, and saying: ‘hey, it’s all right! You can do it!’\n\n“I respect these guys. I know, they know, so let’s go through.”\n\nDaniel has no issues physically\n\nSince missing the opening weekend win at Arsenal as he recovered from a hip problem, Sturridge has started four times in the league and come off the bench on three further occasions.\n\nHis barren run may now stretch beyond 10 hours of Premier League football but Klopp insists he has still been making a contribution.\n\nThe German coach pointed to Sturridge’s intelligent movement and unselfish build up play which created goals for Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane in last month’s win over champions Leicester City.\n\n“Daniel is hard working,” Klopp said.\n\n“He is fit, no issues physically. And now it’s the same as for every other player, what he has to do is work.\n\n“Look at Jamie Vardy last year. His shot against us, we all thought he had to run another 20 yards and instead.... goal. Sometimes you are in a moment when these things work, sometimes not.\n\n“With Dan, we have to work on it together. He’s my player, and that’s my job. He didn’t score until now, that’s true, but what is also true is that he has had really good games for us.\n\n“For me, the (Firmino) goal against Leicester was the goal of the season so far. Because when you have this kind of movement, and you work so hard in training on it, and it comes off....\n\n“Especially for a striker who in the public view isn’t scoring enough, to make this run out of the box to take the two centre-halves out and open everything up, that is a sign of development.\n\n“I’m fine with his form. My job is to help him, and all the other players, arrive in situations to score goals more often.”\n\nWest Brom are the visitors to Anfield on Saturday and it was in this fixture three years ago that Sturridge scored once of the greatest goals of his Reds career.\n\nAfter Luis Suarez had helped himself to a hat-trick in the 4-1 victory, Sturridge provided the icing on the cake as he surged forward and then executed a stunning left-footed chip from the edge of the box over Boaz Myhill in front of the Kop.\n\nIt was the work of a marksman operating at the peak of his powers.\n\nMost of the time football has been easy for him because he is so skilled\n\nSturridge scored 24 goals in that remarkable 2013/14 campaign as he was part of the most lethal double act in European football.\n\nHowever, since that rout of the Baggies in October 2013 he has netted just 25 league goals.\n\nInjuries forced him to miss large chunks of the past two seasons and some have questioned whether those issues have taken their toll. Is he still the same player?\n\n“Come on! Strikers have moments where they are here, moments when they are here, and hard working moments too,” Klopp said dismissively.\n\n“I think in this moment of course it is not easy for Dan. Most of the time in his life, football has been easy for him because he is so skilled. And he is still so skilled.\n\n“Everybody needs confidence, the right moments, an easy goal, whatever. But the job to do for all of us is clear.\n\n“He cannot think about a moment like this where he has not scored in five or six games. I don’t care, it’s normal.\n\n“I can’t just work with players who are 100% in form, 100% in shape, everything. If I was to do that then I would be alone here! Every player struggles with this or that, little problem here or there.\n\n“Daniel Sturridge is an outstanding player, there is no doubt about that.”\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether Klopp’s backing of Sturridge extends to him keeping his place for Saturday’s Anfield clash with Tony Pulis’ side.\n\nIf Gini Wijnaldum and Adam Lallana return to the line up then Emre Can and Sturridge appear to be the two most likely to make way.\n\nKlopp believes whoever played up front against United would have struggled to make an impression because Liverpool were so wasteful in possession. He expects a sizeable improvement in all departments against the Baggies.\n\n“It was a difficult game for Daniel on Monday,” Klopp added.\n\n“When you have nine players around the box then it is not a striker’s game.\n\n“But it was not a striker’s game more because we did not find him enough. When you play the wrong passes, who suffers the most? It’s the striker.\n\n“We have to improve our general play. We have done well but in this game (against United) it was not so good, especially in the first half.\n\n“But the last game is not the biggest influence on my line-up for this game.”",

For 2018, this amount is at least the standard deduction, $12,000 for an individual return and $24,000 for a joint return, or more if the taxpayer has over that amount in itemized deductions.\n\nAdditional taxes [ edit ]\n\nThere may be taxes in addition to the tax rates shown in the above table.\n\nTaxpayers earning income above certain thresholds ($200,000 for singles and heads of household, $250,000 for married couples filing jointly and qualifying widowers with dependent children, and $125,000 for married couples filing separately) pay an additional 3.8% tax on all investment income. [3] [4] Therefore, the top federal tax rate on long-term capital gains is 23.8%.\n\nTherefore, the top federal tax rate on long-term capital gains is 23.8%. State and local taxes often apply to capital gains. In a state whose tax is stated as a percentage of the federal tax liability, the percentage is easy to calculate. Some states structure their taxes differently. In this case, the treatment of long-term and short-term gains does not necessarily correspond to the federal treatment.\n\nCapital gains do not push ordinary income into a higher income bracket. The Capital Gains and Qualified Dividends Worksheet in the Form 1040 instructions specifies a calculation that treats both long-term capital gains and qualified dividends as though they were the last income received, then applies the preferential tax rate as shown in the above table.[5]\n\nCost basis [ edit ]\n\nThe capital gain that is taxed is the excess of the sale price over the cost basis of the asset. The taxpayer reduces the sale price and increases the cost basis (reducing the capital gain on which tax is due) to reflect transaction costs such as brokerage fees, certain legal fees, and the transaction tax on sales.\n\nDepreciation [ edit ]\n\nIn contrast, when a business is entitled to a depreciation deduction on an asset used in the business (such as for each year's wear on a piece of machinery), it reduces the cost basis of that asset by that amount, potentially to zero.[6] The reduction in basis occurs whether or not the business claims the depreciation.\n\nIf the business then sells the asset for a gain (that is, for more than its adjusted cost basis), this part of the gain is called depreciation recapture. When selling certain real estate, it may be treated as capital gain. When selling equipment, however, depreciation recapture is generally taxed as ordinary income, not capital gain. Further, when selling some kinds of assets, none of the gain qualifies as capital gain.\n\nOther gains in the course of business [ edit ]\n\nIf a business develops and sells properties, gains are taxed as business income rather than investment income. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in Byram v. United States (1983), set out criteria for making this decision and determining whether income qualifies for treatment as a capital gain.[7]\n\nInherited property [ edit ]\n\nUnder the stepped-up basis rule,[8] for an individual who inherits a capital asset, the cost basis is \"stepped up\" to its fair market value of the property at the time of the inheritance. When eventually sold, the capital gain or loss is only the difference in value from this stepped-up basis. Increase in value that occurred before the inheritance (such as during the life of the decedent) is never taxed.\n\nCapital losses [ edit ]\n\nIf a taxpayer realizes both capital gains and capital losses in the same year, the losses offset (cancel out) the gains. The amount remaining after offsetting is the net gain or net loss used in the calculation of taxable gains.\n\nFor individuals, a net loss can be claimed as a tax deduction against ordinary income, up to $3,000 per year ($1,500 in the case of a married individual filing separately). Any remaining net loss can be carried over and applied against gains in future years. However, losses from the sale of personal property, including a residence, do not qualify for this treatment.[9]\n\nCorporations with net losses of any size can re-file their tax forms for the previous three years and use the losses to offset gains reported in those years. This results in a refund of capital gains taxes paid previously. After the carryback, a corporation can carry any unused portion of the loss forward for five years to offset future gains.[10]\n\nReturn of capital [ edit ]\n\nCorporations may declare that a payment to shareholders is a return of capital rather than a dividend. Dividends are taxable in the year that they are paid, while returns of capital work by decreasing the cost basis by the amount of the payment, and thus increasing the shareholder's eventual capital gain. Although most qualified dividends receive the same favorable tax treatment as long-term capital gains, the shareholder can defer taxation of a return of capital indefinitely by declining to sell the stock.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nUS Capital Gains Taxes history chart\n\nFrom 1913 to 1921, capital gains were taxed at ordinary rates, initially up to a maximum rate of 7%.[11] The Revenue Act of 1921 allowed a tax rate of 12.5% gain for assets held at least two years.[11] From 1934 to 1941, taxpayers could exclude from taxation up to 70% of gains on assets held 1, 2, 5, and 10 years.[11] Beginning in 1942, taxpayers could exclude 50% of capital gains on assets held at least six months or elect a 25% alternative tax rate if their ordinary tax rate exceeded 50%.[11] From 1954 to 1967, the maximum capital gains tax rate was 25%.[12] Capital gains tax rates were significantly increased in the 1969 and 1976 Tax Reform Acts.[11] In 1978, Congress eliminated the minimum tax on excluded gains and increased the exclusion to 60%, reducing the maximum rate to 28%.[11] The 1981 tax rate reductions further reduced capital gains rates to a maximum of 20%.\n\nThe Tax Reform Act of 1986 repealed the exclusion of long-term gains, raising the maximum rate to 28% (33% for taxpayers subject to phaseouts).[11] The 1990 and 1993 budget acts increased ordinary tax rates but re-established a lower rate of 28% for long-term gains, though effective tax rates sometimes exceeded 28% because of other tax provisions.[11] The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 reduced capital gains tax rates to 10% and 20% and created the exclusion for one's primary residence.[11] The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 reduced them further, to 8% and 18%, for assets held for five years or more. The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 reduced the rates to 5% and 15%, and extended the preferential treatment to qualified dividends.\n\nThe 15% tax rate was extended through 2010 as a result of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005, then through 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made qualified dividends a permanent part of the tax code but added a 20% rate on income in the new, highest tax bracket.\n\nThe Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 caused the IRS to introduce Form 8949, and radically change Form 1099-B,[13] so that brokers would report not just the amounts of sales proceeds but purchases to the IRS, enabling the IRS to verify reported capital gains.\n\nThe Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 exempted taxes on capital gains for angel and venture capital investors on small business stock investments if held for 5 years. It was a temporary measure but was extended through 2011 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 as a jobs stimulus.[14][15]\n\nIn 2013, provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obama-care\") took effect that imposed the Medicare tax of 3.8% (formerly a payroll tax) on capital gains of high-income taxpayers.\n\nSummary of recent history [ edit ]\n\nFrom 1998 through 2017, tax law keyed the tax rate for long-term capital gains to the taxpayer's tax bracket for ordinary income, and set forth a lower rate for the capital gains. (Short-term capital gains have been taxed at the same rate as ordinary income for this entire period.)[16] This approach was dropped by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, starting with tax year 2018.[2]\n\nJuly 1998 – 2000 2001 – May 2003 May 2003 – 2007 2008 – 2012 2013 – 2017 Ordinary Income Tax Rate Long-term Capital Gains\n\nTax Rate Ordinary Income Tax Rate Long-term Capital Gains\n\nTax Rate** Ordinary Income Tax Rate Long-term Capital Gains\n\nTax Rate Long-term Capital Gains\n\nTax Rate Ordinary Income Tax Rate Long-term Capital Gains\n\nTax Rate 15% 10% 10% 10% 10% 5% 0% 10% 0% 15% 10% 15% 5% 0% 15% 0% 28% 20% 27%* 20% 25% 15% 15% 25% 15% 31% 20% 30%* 20% 28% 15% 15% 28% 15% 36% 20% 35%* 20% 33% 15% 15% 33% 15%*** 39.6% 20% 38.6%* 20% 35% 15% 15% 35% 15%*** 39.6% 20%***\n\n* This rate was reduced one-half percentage point for 2001 and one-half percentage point for 2002 and beyond.\n\n** There was a two percentage point reduction for capital gains from certain assets held for more than five years, resulting in 8% and 18% rates.\n\n*** The gain may also be subject to the 3.8% Medicare tax.\n\nRationale [ edit ]\n\nPercent of personal income from capital gains and dividends for different income groups (2006).\n\nWho pays it [ edit ]\n\nCapital gains taxes are disproportionately paid by high-income households, since they are more likely to own assets that generate the taxable gains.[17] While this supports the argument that payers of capital gains taxes have more \"ability to pay,\"[18] it also means that the payers are especially able to defer or avoid the tax, as it only comes due if and when the owner sells the asset. The disproportionate incidence on high-income households means that most debate on tax rates is partisan. The Republican Party favors lower rates, whereas the Democratic Party favors higher rates.[19]\n\nEven though the incidence of the tax is on high-income taxpayers, low-income taxpayers who do not file capital gains taxes may wind up paying them through changed prices as the actual payers pass through the cost of paying the tax. Another factor complicating the use of capital gains taxes to address income inequality is that capital gains are usually not recurring income. A taxpayer may be \"high-income\" in the single year in which he or she sells an asset or invention.[20]\n\nExistence of the tax [ edit ]\n\nThe existence of the capital gains tax is controversial on partisan grounds. In 1995, to support the Contract with America legislative program of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Stephen Moore and John Silvia wrote a study for the Cato Institute. In the study, they proposed halving of capital gains taxes, arguing that this move would \"substantially raise tax collections and increase tax payments by the rich\" and that it would increase economic growth and job creation. They wrote that the tax \"is so economically inefficient...that the optimal economic policy...would be to abolish the tax entirely.\"[21] More recently, Moore has written that the capital gains tax constitutes double taxation. \"First, most capital gains come from the sale of financial assets like stock. But publicly held companies have to pay corporate income tax....Capital gains is a second tax on that income when the stock is sold.\"[22]\n\nRichard Epstein says that the capital-gains tax \"slows down the shift in wealth from less to more productive uses\" by imposing a cost on the decision to shift assets. He favors repeal or a rollover provision to defer the tax on gains that are reinvested.[23]\n\nPreferential rate [ edit ]\n\nThe fact that the long-term capital gains rate is lower than the rate on ordinary income is regarded by the political left, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, as a \"tax break\" that excuses investors from paying their \"fair share.\"[18][24] The tax benefit for a long-term capital gain is sometimes referred to as a \"tax expenditure\" that government could elect to stop spending.[25] By contrast, Republicans favor lowering the capital gain tax rate as an inducement to saving and investment. Also, the lower rate partly compensates for the fact that some capital gains are illusory and reflect nothing but inflation between the time the asset is bought and the time it is sold. Moore writes, \"when inflation is high....the tax rate can even rise above 100 percent\",[22] as when a taxpayer owes tax on a capital gain that does not result in any increase in real wealth.\n\nHolding period [ edit ]\n\nThe one-year threshold between short-term and long-term capital gains is arbitrary and has changed over time. Short-term gains are disparaged as speculation and are perceived as self-interested, myopic, and destabilizing,[26] while long-term gains are characterized as investment, which supposedly reflects a more stable commitment that is in the nation's interest. Others call this a false dichotomy.[27] The holding period to qualify for favorable tax treatment has varied from six months to ten years (see History above). There was special treatment of assets held for five years during the Presidency of George W. Bush. In her 2016 Presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton advocated holding periods of up to six years with a sliding scale of tax rates.[28]\n\nCarried interest [ edit ]\n\nCarried interest is the share of any profits that the general partners of private equity funds receive as compensation, despite not contributing any initial funds.[29] The manager may also receive compensation that is a percentage of the assets under management.[30] Tax law provides that when such managers take, as a fee, a portion of the gain realized in connection with the investments they manage, the manager's gain is afforded the same tax treatment as the client's gain. Thus, where the client realizes long-term capital gains, the manager's gain is a long-term capital gain—generally resulting in a lower tax rate for the manager than would be the case if the manager's income were not treated as a long-term capital gain. Under this treatment, the tax on a long-term gain does not depend on how investors and managers divide the gain.\n\nThis tax treatment is often called the \"hedge-fund loophole\",[31] even though it is private equity funds that benefit from the treatment; hedge funds usually do not have long-term gains.[32] It has been criticized as \"indefensible\" and a \"gross unfairness\",[33] because it taxes management services at a preferential rate intended for long-term gains. Warren Buffett has used the term \"coddling the super rich\".[34] One counterargument is that the preferential rate is warranted because a grant of carried interest is often deferred and contingent, making it less reliable than a regular salary.[35]\n\nThe 2017 tax reform established a three-year holding period for these fund managers to qualify for the long-term capital-gains preference.[36]\n\nEffects [ edit ]\n\nThe capital gains tax raises money for government but penalizes investment (by reducing the final rate of return). Proposals to change the tax rate from the current rate are accompanied by predictions on how it will affect both results. For example, an increase of the tax rate would be more of a disincentive to invest in assets, but would seem to raise more money for government. However, the Laffer curve suggests that the revenue increase might not be linear and might even be a decrease, as Laffer's \"economic effect\" begins to outweigh the \"arithmetic effect.\"[37] For example, a 10% rate increase (such as from 20% to 22%) might raise less than 10% additional tax revenue by inhibiting some transactions. Laffer postulated that a 100% tax rate results in no tax revenue.\n\nAnother economic effect that might make receipts differ from those predicted is that the United States competes for capital with other countries. A change in the capital gains rate could attract more foreign investment, or drive United States investors to invest abroad.[38]\n\nCongress sometimes directs the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to estimate the effects of a bill to change the tax code. It is contentious on partisan grounds whether to direct the CBO to use dynamic scoring[39] (to include economic effects), or static scoring that does not consider the bill's effect on the incentives of taxpayers. After failing to enact the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014,[40] Republicans mandated dynamic scoring in a rule change at the start of 2015, to apply to the Fiscal Year 2016 and subsequent budgets.[41]\n\nMeasuring the effect on the economy [ edit ]\n\nSupporters of cuts in capital gains tax rates may argue that the current rate is on the falling side of the Laffer curve (past a point of diminishing returns) — that it is so high that its disincentive effect is dominant, and thus that a rate cut would \"pay for itself.\"[39] Opponents of cutting the capital gains tax rate argue the correlation between top tax rate and total economic growth is inconclusive.[42]\n\nMark LaRochelle wrote on the conservative website Human Events that cutting the capital gains rate increases employment. He presented a U.S. Treasury chart to assert that \"in general, capital gains taxes and GDP have an inverse relationship: when the rate goes up, the economy goes down\". He also cited statistical correlation based on tax rate changes during the presidencies of George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Ronald Reagan.[43]\n\n[44] Top tax rates on long-term capital gains and real economic growth (measured as the percentage change in real GDP) from 1950 to 2011. Burman found low correlation (0.12) between low capital gains taxes and economic growth.\n\nHowever, comparing capital gains tax rates and economic growth in America from 1950 to 2011, Brookings Institution economist Leonard Burman found \"no statistically significant correlation between the two\", even after using \"lag times of five years.\" Burman's data are shown in the chart at right.[42][44]\n\nEconomist Thomas L. Hungerford of the liberal Economic Policy Institute found \"little or even a negative\" correlation between capital gains tax reduction and rates of saving and investment, writing: \"Saving rates have fallen over the past 30 years while the capital gains tax rate has fallen from 28% in 1987 to 15% today .... This suggests that changing capital gains tax rates have had little effect on private saving\".[17][45] Hungerford also studied top marginal tax rates from 1945 to 2010 and likewise found no correlation with saving, investment and productivity growth.[46]\n\nFactors that complicate measurement [ edit ]\n\nResearchers usually use the top marginal tax rate to characterize policy as high-tax or low-tax. This figure measures the disincentive on the largest transactions per additional dollar of taxable income. However, this might not tell the complete story. The table Summary of recent history above shows that, although the marginal rate is higher now than at any time since 1998, there is also a substantial bracket on which the tax rate is 0%.\n\nAnother reason it is hard to prove correlation between the top capital gains rate and total economic output is that changes to the capital gains rate do not occur in isolation, but as part of a tax reform package. They may be accompanied by other measures to boost investment, and Congressional consensus to do so may derive from an economic shock, from which the economy may have been recovering independent of tax reform. A reform package may include increases and decreases in tax rates; the Tax Reform Act of 1986 increased the top capital gains rate, from 20% to 28%, as a compromise for reducing the top rate on ordinary income from 50% to 28%.[47][48]\n\nTax avoidance strategies [ edit ]\n\nStrategic losses [ edit ]\n\nThe ability to use capital losses to offset capital gains in the same year is discussed above. Toward the end of a tax year, some investors sell assets that are worth less than the investor paid for them to obtain this tax benefit.\n\nA wash sale, in which the investor sells an asset and buys it (or a similar asset) right back, cannot be treated as a loss at all, although there are other potential tax benefits as consolation.[49]\n\nIn January, a new tax year begins; if stock prices increase, analysts may attribute the increase to an absence of such end-of-year selling and say there is a January effect. A Santa Claus rally is an increase in stock prices at the end of the year, perhaps in anticipation of a January effect.\n\nVersus purchase [ edit ]\n\nA taxpayer can designate that a sale of corporate stock corresponds to a specified purchase. For example, the taxpayer holding 500 shares may have bought 100 shares each on five occasions, probably at a different price each time. The individual lots of 100 shares are typically not held separate; even in the days of physical stock certificates, there was no indication which stock was bought when. If the taxpayer sells 100 shares, then by designating which of the five lots is being sold, the taxpayer will realize one of five different capital gains or losses. The taxpayer can maximize or minimize the gain depending on an overall strategy, such as generating losses to offset gains, or keeping the total in the range that is taxed at a lower rate or not at all.\n\nTo use this strategy, the taxpayer must specify at the time of a sale which lot is being sold (creating a \"contemporaneous record\"). This \"versus purchase\" sale is versus (against) a specified purchase. On brokerage websites, a \"Lot Selector\" may let the taxpayer specify the purchase to which a sell order corresponds.[50]\n\nPrimary residence [ edit ]\n\nSection 121[51] lets an individual exclude from gross income up to $250,000 ($500,000 for a married couple filing jointly) of gains on the sale of real property if the owner owned and used it as primary residence for two of the five years before the date of sale. The two years of residency do not have to be continuous. An individual may meet the ownership and use tests during different 2-year periods. A taxpayer can move and claim the primary-residence exclusion every two years if living in an area where home prices are rising rapidly.\n\nThe tests may be waived for military service, disability, partial residence, unforeseen events, and other reasons. Moving to shorten one's commute to a new job is not an unforeseen event.[52] Bankruptcy of an employer that induces a move to a different city is likely an unforeseen event, but the exclusion will be pro-rated if one has stayed in the home less than two years.[53]\n\nThe amount of this exclusion is not increased for home ownership beyond five years.[54] One is not able to deduct a loss on the sale of one's home.\n\nThe exclusion is also pro-rated if there is a portion of the ownership period in which the home was not the principal residence of the taxpayer, spouse, or ex-spouse.[55][56][57]\n\nDeferral strategies [ edit ]\n\nTaxpayers can defer capital gains taxes to a future tax year using the following strategies:[58]\n\nSection 1031 exchange – If a business sells property but uses the proceeds to buy similar property, it may be treated as a \"like kind\" exchange. Tax is not due based on the sale; instead, the cost basis of the original property is applied to the new property. A business cannot avoid capital gains taxes, but can defer them indefinitely with this technique. [59] [60]\n\nAlthough 1031 treatment is not available for personal real estate, the taxpayer can reside in the property. For example, a homeowner could move out of the primary residence, rent it out temporarily, exchange it for a new house, rent that house out temporarily, and then move into it. [61]\n\nAlthough 1031 treatment is not available for personal real estate, the taxpayer can reside in the property. For example, a homeowner could move out of the primary residence, rent it out temporarily, exchange it for a new house, rent that house out temporarily, and then move into it. Structured sales, such as the self-directed installment sale, are sales that use a third party, in the style of an annuity. They permit sellers to defer recognition of gains on the sale of a business or real estate to the tax year in which the proceeds are received. [62] Fees and complications should be weighed against the tax savings. [63]\n\nFees and complications should be weighed against the tax savings. Charitable trusts, set up to transfer assets to a charity upon death or after a term of years, normally avoid capital gains taxes on the appreciation of the assets, while allowing the original owner to benefit from the asset in the meantime. [64]\n\nOpportunity Zone – Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, investors who reinvest gains into a designated low-income \"opportunity zone\" can defer paying capital gains tax until 2026, or as long as they hold the reinvestment, and can reduce or eliminate capital gain liability depending on the number of years they own it.[65]\n\nProposals [ edit ]\n\nIn 2011, President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13531 establishing the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (the \"Simpson-Bowles Commission\") to identify \"policies to improve the fiscal situation in the medium term and to achieve fiscal sustainability over the long run\". The Commission's final report took the same approach as the 1986 reform: eliminate the preferential tax rate for long-term capital gains in exchange for a lower top rate on ordinary income.[66]\n\nThe tax change proposals made by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform were never introduced. Republicans supported the proposed fiscal policy changes, yet Obama failed to garner support among fellow Democrats; During the 2012 election, presidential candidate Mitt Romney faulted Obama for \"missing the bus\" on his own Commission.[67]\n\nIn the 2016 campaign [ edit ]\n\nTax policy was a part of the 2016 presidential campaign, as candidates proposed changes to the tax code that affect the capital gains tax.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's main proposed change to the capital gains tax was to repeal the 3.8% Medicare surtax that took effect in 2013. He also proposed to repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax, which would reduce tax liability for taxpayers with large incomes including capital gains. His maximum tax rate of 15% on businesses could result in lower capital gains taxes. However, as well as lowering tax rates on ordinary income, he would lower the dollar amounts for the remaining tax brackets, which would subject more individual capital gains to the top (20%) tax rate.[68][69] Other Republican candidates proposed to lower the capital gains tax (Ted Cruz proposed a 10% rate), or eliminate it entirely (such as Marco Rubio).[70]\n\nDemocratic nominee Hillary Clinton proposed to increase the capital gains tax rate for high-income taxpayers by \"creating several new, higher ordinary rates\",[71] and proposed a sliding scale for long-term capital gains, based on the time the asset was owned, up to 6 years.[71] Gains on assets held from one to two years would be reclassified short-term[72] and taxed as ordinary income, at an effective rate of up to 43.4%, and long-term assets not held for a full 6 years would also be taxed at a higher rate.[73] Clinton also proposed to treat carried interest (see above) as ordinary income, increasing the tax on it, to impose a tax on \"high-frequency\" trading, and to take other steps.[74] Bernie Sanders proposed to treat many capital gains as ordinary income, and increase the Medicare surtax to 6%, resulting in a top effective rate of 60% on some capital gains.[71]\n\nIn the 115th Congress [ edit ]\n\nThe Republican Party introduced the American Health Care Act (House Bill 1628), which would amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\" or \"Obamacare\") to repeal the 3.8% tax on all investment income for high-income taxpayers[75] and the 2.5% \"shared responsibility payment\" (\"individual mandate\") for taxpayers who do not have an acceptable insurance policy, which applies to capital gains.[76] The House passed this bill but the Senate did not.\n\n2017 tax reform\n\nHouse Bill 1 (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) was released on November 2, 2017 by Chairman Kevin Brady of the House Ways and Means Committee. Its treatment of capital gains was comparable to current law, but it roughly doubled the standard deduction, while dropping personal exemptions in favor of a larger child tax credit. President Trump advocated using the bill to also repeal the shared responsibility payment, but Rep. Brady believed doing so would complicate passage.[77] The House passed H.B. 1 on November 16.\n\nThe Senate version of H.B. 1 passed on December 2. It zeroed out the shared responsibility payment, but only beginning in 2019. Attempts to repeal \"versus purchase\" sales of stock (see above),[78] and to make it harder to exclude gains on the sale of one's personal residence, did not survive the conference committee.[79] Regarding \"carried interest\" (see above), the conference committee raised the holding period from one year to three to qualify for long-term capital-gains treatment.[36]\n\nThe tax bills were \"scored\" to ensure their cost in lower government revenue was small enough to qualify under the Senate's reconciliation procedure. The law required this to use dynamic scoring (see above), but Larry Kudlow claimed that the scoring underestimated economic incentives and inflow of capital from abroad.[80] To improve the scoring, changes to the personal income tax expired at the end of 2025.\n\nBoth houses of Congress passed H.B. 1 on December 20 and President Trump signed it into law on December 22.\n\n\"Phase two\"\n\nOn March 13, 2018, Trump appointed Kudlow the assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council, replacing Gary Cohn,[81] effective April 2. Kudlow supports indexing the cost basis of taxable investments to avoid taxing gains that are merely the result of inflation, and has recently suggested that the law allows Trump to direct the IRS to do so without a vote of Congress.[82][83] The Treasury confirmed it was investigating the idea, but a lead Democrat said it would be “legally dubious” and meet with “stiff and vocal opposition”.[84]\n\nTrump and Kudlow both announced a \"phase two\" of tax reform, suggesting a new bill that included a lower capital gains rate.[85] However, prospects for a follow-on tax bill dimmed after the Democratic Party took the House of Representatives in the 2018 elections.[86]\n\nReferences [ edit ]",

But in reality, Ontario’s years of rapid spending growth are to blame,” Ben Eisen, associate director of the Ontario Prosperity Initiative at the Fraser Institute and the study’s co-author, said.\n\nThe report points to an increase in provincial program spending of 71.6 per cent since the 2003/04 budget as one of the main drivers of the ballooning debt. Spending on everyday government operations reached $120.9 billion in 2015/16, up from $70.4 billion 13 years earlier. While some of that increase can be dismissed as a result of a growing population, the spending increase outpaced the economic growth in the province, as well as the inflation and population growth combined.\n\nThe Fraser notes that if Ontario had restrained spending increases since 2003/04 to the rate of economic growth, the government would have posted a $10.7 billion surplus for the current fiscal year, as opposed to a $7.5 billion deficit.\n\n“If successive Ontario governments had exercised greater control of spending, provincial finances would be in much better shape today,” Charles Lammam, director of fiscal studies at the Fraser Institute and another of the study’s authors, said.\n\nThough the report acknowledges the current Liberal government has slowed the rate of spending growth over the past few years, it says the steps have been “inadequate” in combating the province’s fiscal problems.\n\nOntario plans to release its 2016/17 budget next week, and has announced it will postpone the phase-in of the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan by one year. While interest rates remain at historic lows, assuaging some of the cost of borrowing, the spending and high debt load continue to take their toll.\n\nAhead of the new budget’s release, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce is also advocating restraint, calling for Ontario to take steps to eliminate the deficit.\n\n“Eliminating the deficit and reducing the debt should be the government’s top priority,” Allan O’Dette, president & CEO Ontario Chamber, said. “The provincial debt is now roughly $300 billion—interest payments on that debt are consuming an ever greater portion of the provincial spend. To ensure Ontario’s future competitiveness, we need to get back to fiscal balance.”\n\nThe Ontario government continues to insist it will balance its books by 2017-2018—10 years after it last registered a small surplus.",
  "latent_17486": "The 2017-2018 Mavs schedule was officially released on Monday afternoon. The mid-August NBA schedule is always a gift from above since it always takes place at such a slow time in the sports calendar. Unless the “Big 3” Tournament is satisfying your basketball fix. In which case, you need re-evaluate said basketball fix.\n\nIn this day and age of super teams, there are a plethora of elite games that everyone will immediately circle on their calendar. Games such as:\n\nMonday, October 23rd and Wednesday, January 3rd against the defending champion Golden State Warriors .\n\nNovember 11th against LeBron James , (maybe?) Kyrie Irving and the rest of the Cleveland Cavaliers .\n\nWednesday, January 24th against James Harden and his new backcourt partner Chris Paul and the Houston Rockets .\n\nWhile tons of fans will pay ridiculous prices to sit in the nosebleeds of the American Airlines Center to see those games, the true NBA fan should look for the hidden gem of a game on the schedule. Here are five games that will have sexy storylines, but won’t make you break the bank on the secondary market in order to get tickets.\n\nFriday, October 20th against the Sacramento Kings\n\nThere were a slew of point guards selected in front of Dennis Smith Jr. at number nine in June’s NBA draft. One of those is the Kings’ De’Aaron Fox out of the University of Kentucky. Fox represented the last pick of the top five talents in the draft that seemed to be for sure picks with the likes of Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, Jayson Tatum and Josh Jackson. By the middle of July, Smith Jr. likely had some of teams who picked in the top five re-thinking their choices thanks to his summer league performance.\n\nThe Kings also made some interesting signings this summer by adding the likes of George Hill, Zach Randolph and former Maverick Vince Carter to multi-year contracts. Despite that, they aren’t exactly receiving love as far as playoff projections.\n\nThe franchise seems to be headed in the right direction, but it’s always entertaining to see the Kings be crazy. Especially in person.\n\nSaturday, October 28th against the Philadelphia 76ers\n\n“The Process” makes its lone appearance in Big D on the first Saturday night home game of the season. The 76ers, unlike the Kings, are relative dark horse candidates to snag one of the lower Eastern Conference playoff spots. After years of losing, they appear to have the numerous young and talented players available to field a competitive roster.\n\nThe aforementioned Markelle Fultz and 2016 number one pick Ben Simmons will be early on in their rookie seasons. Joel Embiid, when healthy, quickly turned into a must watch player during his short season last year. Philly also added sharpshooter J.J. Reddick on a one year/$23 million contract this summer.\n\nFun fact: J.J. Redick’s $23 million salary this season will be nearly FIVE times Dirk Nowitzki’s $5 million this year. Again, Dirk chose that salary, but it’s still crazy to think about that.\n\nSaturday, November 18th against the Milwaukee Bucks\n\nWhen was the last time anything out of Milwaukee was something you didn’t want to miss? The answer to that is unknown, but the Bucks have become one of the most exciting up and coming teams in the league thanks to a talented young roster built around potential MVP candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\n“The Greek Freak” is a fitting nickname thanks to the insane size and athleticism that allows him to get up and down the court as quickly and smoothly as, well, a buck. Don’t you dare bring up how easily the Mavericks could have had him back in the 2013 draft. We’re all trying to get past that.\n\nMilwaukee’s coach is of course the legendary Jason Kidd. Future basketball Hall of Famer and starting point guard for the 2011 NBA Champion Dallas Mavericks. If there’s ever a chance to give a standing ovation to a member of that team at a game, you’ve got to take it.\n\nSaturday, January 13th against the Los Angeles Lakers\n\nThis game is scheduled for 2 PM and if you’ve never been to an afternoon Mavs game, you have to do it. There’s just a different energy in the building and it’s fun to walk out of the building and still have plenty of time to do something after the game.\n\nOf course there will also be tons of so-called Lakers “fans” at this game to go back and forth with. Just be sure to keep it PG around the kiddos. The only exception would be if you see Lavar Ball. Every fan in every NBA arena needs to let that guy know that he needs to stop clogging up our social media feeds with his insane opinions and enormous personality.\n\nThe much more relaxed Lonzo Ball will be in the middle of his rookie season with the Lakers and will sure to be a polarizing figure on the court no matter how he performs. Matchups between Dennis Smith Jr. and his fellow rookie class point guards will certainly can’t miss matchups for a few seasons.\n\nTuesday, April 10th against the Phoenix Suns\n\nThis will be the regular season finale and it could possibly be Dirk Nowitzki’s final game as a Maverick. Hopefully they make the playoffs and he plays another season, but who knows how his body will feel throughout the grind of another 82 game season. If the Mavericks are out of the playoff picture and Nowitzki has given any subtle verbal hints, this one will be a can’t miss as well.\n\nAs far on the court product, Devin Booker of the Suns is another electrifying young player on a bad team. He scored a deceptive 70 points in a loss to the Boston Celtics last season and he also drained a buzzer beater to beat the Mavs at the AAC in a game that proved to be a major blow to the Mavs’ slim playoff chances at the time.\n\nRemember how cheering for members of the 2011 Mavs is a must? If Tyson Chandler is still donning a Suns jersey at this time, cheer extra hard for the big man who anchored the Mavs locker room and defense during their only championship season.\n\nThere are many other games worthy of paying to see in person this season, but these five represent great opportunities to see young talent against the Mavs young and improving roster. What games can you not wait to see this season?",

  "latent_17546": "This story originally appeared on InsideClimate News.\n\nThe Arctic has warmed more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit since 2000 because of human-driven climate change, scientists announced last month. This has caused drastic declines in sea ice, marine animals, and vegetation, and threatened the overall health and viability of the world's northernmost ecosystem.\n\n\"The impacts of a persistent warming trend over the last 30 years is clearly evident both in the sea and on land,\" Kit Kovacs, a biologist at the Norwegian Polar Institute, said at a press conference. \"And we can expect to see continued, widespread, and systematic change to the Arctic\" in the coming decades as the world continues to warm.\n\nKovacs is a co-author of the 10th annual Arctic Report Card, a peer-reviewed scientific analysis of the region by 72 researchers from 11 countries—organized by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration—which was published last month.\n\nIt contained some sobering news about the state of the region: Walruses, for instance, have declined 50 percent in the North Pacific in the past decade. The Arctic tundra has browned as plants have died from the warmth. Lower-latitude fish like cod have moved north in search of cooler climes, displacing native Arctic fish populations. Early ice and snow melt in Alaska helped to fuel the state's second-worst wildfire season on record. Maximum sea ice extent peaked 15 days earlier than average in February and was the lowest since 1979, when records began. More than 50 percent of the Greenland Ice Sheet experienced some melting and Arctic snow cover hit a near-record low in June.\n\nLast month in Paris, 195 nations agreed to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial temperatures. But even that amount of warming will have major consequences, scientists argue, and what is happening in the Arctic today is a warning of what's ahead in many parts of the world.\n\n\"Warming is happening twice as fast in the Arctic as anywhere else in the world,\" said Rick Spinrad, the chief scientist at NOAA. \"But what happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic...The trailing indicators for the region are in fact the leading indicators for the rest of the world.\"\n\nWarmer air and sea temperatures in the Arctic mean faster ice melt and expanding seas that can raise sea levels elsewhere in the world, threatening low-lying coastal communities like New York City, South Florida, and the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nWhat sea ice is forming in the Arctic is younger and thinner than what used to be there, the report says. The percentage of stronger, thicker \"old\" ice in the region has fallen from 85 percent to 30 percent in three decades. Newer ice is more vulnerable to collapse or early melting. Animals like walruses and seals are shifting toward land as their habitat and hunting grounds disappear.\n\nScientists also said they are closely monitoring whether this year's record El Niño in the Pacific Ocean could make a bad situation worse in the Arctic in the coming months. Spinrad said NOAA has redirected research vessels and resources to examine the relationship.\n\n\"There is a possibility, but not a certainty\" that this year's El Niño could impact the Arctic, said Jim Overland, an oceanographer and Arctic scientist for NOAA. \"We'll be studying it closely.\"\n\nInsideClimate News is a Pulitzer prize-winning, nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers clean energy, carbon energy, nuclear energy and environmental science—plus the territory in between where law, policy, and public opinion are shaped.

In a year of way too much TV, we thought you might need some help figuring out which shows are worth bingeing on before we say goodbye to 2015.\n\nSo we reached out to some of the year’s most prominent TV showrunners and creators, along with a couple who have new projects premiering soon, and asked them to recommend the shows they enjoyed most over the past 12 months.\n\nBelow, in no particular order, are the answers they gave us.\n\nAziz Ansari (Master of None)\n\nNathan for You was fantastic this season. They really pushed their format this year and the season finale was a classic.\n\nMelissa Rosenberg (Marvel’s Jessica Jones)\n\nThe Walking Dead drew me back in this year. Such rich character development, and so many great surprises. I’m particularly loving what they’re doing with Carol this year. She’s becoming something of a sociopath—you never know what she’ll do. Love it!\n\nDavid Benioff (Game of Thrones)\n\nShit, can I pick two? A drama and a comedy? For drama, Mr. Robot. I watched half the season on a single airplane ride. Brilliant writing and a star-making performance from Rami Malek. For comedy, Klown. A bit like Curb Your Enthusiasm but more sex-obsessed, more outrageous, and much more Danish.\n\nD.B. Weiss (Game of Thrones)\n\nI watched 2 seasons of Rick and Morty in about a week. So many brilliantly executed ideas, such great voice work. And it manages to be the funniest thing out there, veer into melancholy, and then turn right back to insanely funny without breaking, which is an impressive trick.\n\nSarah Gertrude Shapiro (UnREAL)\n\nTransparent really changed my world this year—it gave and gives me so much faith in specific, grounded familial storytelling. I love the world. I love the characters. I love the sense of place. The moment when Maura (Jeffrey Tambor’s character) slams her fist down on the table of the worst Shabbat dinner ever and says “ENOUGH!” was fascinating because it let us see a patriarch become a matriarch—to see how power and leadership intersects with gender. I also binge-watched Empire because: COOKIE.\n\nPaul Weitz (Mozart in the Jungle)\n\nThe show I have been binge-watching this last year is Modern Family, largely because my 11-year-old daughter has been binge-watching it, and while I want to tell her to turn off the TV, I get sucked into it. There is a slight Boyhood effect because she lumps together old episodes with newer ones, so you see the kids at different ages (the grown-ups somehow look the same). If you want to look for the demise of the romantic comedy in film, you can start here, with this show, which seamlessly pulls off multiple romantic comedies. Also, it’s a network show, and I like to root for the underdog.\n\nAline Brosh McKenna (Crazy Ex-Girlfriend)\n\nI loved Catastrophe, watched all of it in one day. An effortlessly funny two-hander. So irreverent and insane and heartfelt, with characters that are sometimes awful in ways I adored. I loved every moment but the first episode is a particular gem. Loved it.\n\nJonathan Ames (Blunt Talk)\n\nThe only show I binge-watched in 2015 was the delightfully entertaining The Walking Dead. I’ve been a fan for years, but, for some reason, I only binge-watch from around midnight to 5 a.m., usually when I have an important professional obligation the next day for which I should be rested. But I can’t help myself. A self-destructive madness takes over me and with each compulsive click of “the next episode,” I feel my id beating my super-ego. The id says: “I love The Walking Dead. I want to stay up all night. I want to feel like I’m with Rick’s clan, that I’m part of the family. Also, I admire Rick and his heroism. I want to be a hero!” My super-ego then says: “Go to bed you idiot, you won’t be able to function tomorrow.” Anyway, the id, which is probably short for idiot, doesn’t listen, and I am destroyed the next day. I am—for a lack of a better word—a zombie. Which is maybe why I really want to watch the show—I see myself in those poor creatures. They don’t know who they are, they wander through life aimlessly, and they seem to be in a lot of pain. Anyway, I love The Walking Dead, and I look forward to my next late-night indulgence in this marvelous series.\n\nJessica St. Clair (Playing House)\n\nBecause I am really an 85-year-old trapped in the body of a 39-year-old, my latest binge watch was the BBC’s The Great British Bake Off, a show where 12 home bakers compete in a “bake off” in the hopes of being crowned “Britain’s Best Baker.” Everything they make involves heavy cream and my fave judge, cookbook author Mary Berry, looks and sounds like an elderly Mary Poppins and says things like, “Oh no, you have some irregularly shaped balls.” What’s not to love?\n\nJay Duplass (Togetherness)\n\nI can’t get enough of The Americans. A Cold War spy show is not what I would normally watch, but it’s one of those shows that tackles so many different things at once… mystery, relationships, the Cold War, family matters, personal crisis, politics, and did I mention it’s an impeccable ’80s period piece with pitch-perfect acting?\n\nMark Duplass (Togetherness)\n\nI know it’s not a current show, but I watched a ton of Mister Roger’s Neighborhood when it came onto Netflix and it knocked me out. So slow, loving, and impactful. Really inspired me to try to make something patient.\n\nDavid Cross (Todd Margaret)\n\nThat’s easy. I really don’t watch a lot of TV at all, but the one thing that I watched every episode of and couldn’t wait until the next one was Better Call Saul. It was just great storytelling. Everything about it was great: the cinematography, the direction, the writing, the acting. That’s my No. 1 show of last year. And on the comedy side, I loved Silicon Valley. I think that’s another well-written, well-acted, well-cast show. The cast is so good.\n\nNic Pizzolatto (True Detective)\n\nI binged all four seasons of Episodes. I thought it was great—consistently hilarious, very human, and with a pretty savage wit. I also binged W/ Bob & David. Only four episodes, but it didn’t disappoint. As hysterical and absurd as that group ever was. My favorite sketches were probably “Know Your Rights” and the police interrogation one, where two detectives trying to play good cop/bad cop get into hurting each other’s feelings until it explodes into an armed standoff: simple and instantly classic. Please make more of both.\n\nJon Glaser (Neon Joe, Werewolf Hunter)\n\nI binge-watch AFV [America’s Funniest Home Videos] all the time. What’s not to love? It’s the funniest show on television. I am guaranteed hard laughs every episode. One thing that stands out was a hilarious montage of people having tough experiences with pinatas. Funny as hell.\n\nRaphael Bob-Waksberg (Bojack Horseman)\n\nW/ Bob & David. I devoured it. As a comedy writer I especially loved the behind-the-scenes fifth episode where I got to witness the working relationship of two hilarious minds who have been at the top of their game for over 20 years now.\n\nJason Jones (The Detour)\n\nI probably watched more television this year than ever before but there was no greater show than The Jinx. Applying narrative dramatic structure to the documentary format really took the genre to the next level. Pulpy, sure, but riveting from start to finish. And then when it finished it got even better. I just don’t think there was a more chilling moment this year (actually, I may go out on a limb and say ever) than an admission of guilt that came over a black screen with a hot mic. And of course, the burping. Who could forget the burping.",
  "latent_17848": "March 18, 2014\n\nNovel approach paves way for new quantum devices\n\nTORONTO, ON – A team of University of Toronto physicists led by Alex Hayat has proposed a novel and efficient way to leverage the strange quantum physics phenomenon known as entanglement. The approach would involve combining light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with a superconductor to generate entangled photons and could open up a rich spectrum of new physics as well as devices for quantum technologies, including quantum computers and quantum communication.\n\nEntanglement occurs when particles become correlated in pairs to predictably interact with each other regardless of how far apart they are. Measure the properties of one member of the entangled pair and you instantly know the properties of the other. It is one of the most perplexing aspects of quantum mechanics, leading Einstein to call it “spooky action at a distance.”\n\n“A usual light source such as an LED emits photons randomly without any correlations,” explains Hayat, who is also a Global Scholar at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. “We’ve proved that generating entanglement between photons emitted from an LED can be achieved by adding another peculiar physical effect of superconductivity – a resistance-free electrical current in certain materials at low temperatures.”\n\nThis effect occurs when electrons are entangled in Cooper pairs – a phenomenon in which when one electron spins one way, the other will spin in the opposite direction. When a layer of such superconducting material is placed in close contact with a semiconductor LED structure, Cooper pairs are injected in to the LED, so that pairs of entangled electrons create entangled pairs of photons. The effect, however, turns out to work only in LEDs which use nanometre-thick active regions – quantum wells.\n\n“Typically quantum properties show up on very small scales – an electron or an atom. Superconductivity allows quantum effects to show up on large scales – an electrical component or a whole circuit. This quantum behaviour can significantly enhance light emission in general, and entangled photon emission in particular,” Hayat said.\n\nOther U of T team members are physicists Hae-Young Kee, Kenneth S. Burch and Aephraim M. Steinberg. The research was published in Physical Review B, an international journal specializing in condensed-matter phenomena and materials physics on March 10.\n\nFull article: http://journals.aps.org/prb/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevB.89.094508\n\nMEDIA CONTACTS:\n\nAlex Hayat\n\nNow at: Technion, Israel Institute of Technology\n\nTel: +972-4-829-4682\n\nalex.hayat@ee.technion.ac.il\n\nKim Luke\n\nCommunications, Faculty of Arts & Science\n\nUniversity of Toronto\n\nTel: 416-978-4352\n\nKim.luke@utoronto.ca",

I knew a bit was going on — I just didn’t realise how much. But the boys have been brilliant from the word go. They have bought into what we are trying to do. They didn’t let the off-field stuff affect them, they stuck together. So the performances are not a surprise, because we have good players.\n\nSimon Hill: Has it helped that you have had your brother, Ross, with you as your assistant?\n\nRound 21 Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre\n\nJohn Aloisi: One thing I learnt from my stint at Melbourne Heart, was to make sure I had a lot of good people around me. Ross is one of them, but I also brought in Craig Moore, Scott Higgins as team manager, Karl Dodd, a whole new medical staff, a new youth coach in Josh McCloughan. They make my job a lot easier.\n\nRoss and John Aloisi, Source: News Corp Australia\n\nSimon Hill: The club now seems to be on a more even keel financially — the owners have recommitted, you have a new training facility on the way. Is that the reality, or is Roar still a cottage industry, in need of more investment?\n\nJohn Aloisi: We’ve still got a long way to go. We haven’t got the new training facility yet, but hopefully soon. We have to make sure financially we are stable, but at the moment, we’re not where we want to be as a club.\n\nSimon Hill: How has your approach changed at Brisbane from your days with Melbourne Heart?\n\nJohn Aloisi: The main thing Heart gave me was the understanding of how much goes on away from the football field. I ended up having 12 different training grounds in six weeks there. So when I stepped in at Roar (and had a similar situation), I knew how to handle it, because I’d experienced it before. First time around I didn’t know, and maybe that affected me as a coach. You’re always evolving, and no doubt I’m a better coach now.\n\nSimon Hill: During your time out of coaching, you went overseas to visit different clubs — what did those experiences teach you?\n\nJohn Aloisi: I learnt a lot about how to get your philosophy across, and how to deal with big stars. They need to buy into how you want to play — for their own benefit as well. A lot of people said Roar had big egos, players who would do their own thing. But I haven’t found that; I have had no issues. Broich, McKay, North — they’ve been such good leaders. But the youngsters too. Jack Hingert had never been a regular, but he’s been one of our most consistent players.\n\nJohn Aloisi of the Roar celebrates victory after the A-League Elimination Final match between the Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory at Suncorp Stadium last weekend. Source: Getty Images\n\nSimon Hill: Were there times — after Heart — when you felt you weren’t cut out for coaching?\n\nJohn Aloisi: Getting the sack was a hard time for me, I won’t lie. It was one of the worst feelings ever. You don’t know the direction you are headed. I never doubted I was going to be a coach, but you never know when the next opportunity is going to come along. So, I made sure I was ready for it. Even doing media work with Fox Sports, I was always looking to improve my knowledge of the A-League, and the way I deliver messages too — because on TV you have to be very clear in the way you talk. Everything was to prepare myself when that opportunity came.\n\nSimon Hill: I believe the national team coach was a big part of the reason you got the job at Roar?\n\nJohn Aloisi: Yes, Ange Postecoglou was the reason I got the job. Chris Fong (then Chairman of Brisbane Roar), asked him for his opinion. He put my name forward, and suggested Brisbane give me an opportunity. He believed I was going to be a coach that could be successful. I’m grateful to him.\n\nJohn Aloisi and Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou. Photo David Caird. Source: News Limited\n\nSimon Hill: At the start of the season, you made two major signings for two key roles. Corona to fill the void left by Luke Brattan, and Jamie Maclaren to provide the goals that hadn’t been there since the departure of Besart Berisha. You must be delighted with your judgment on both?\n\nJohn Aloisi: Not all your signings are going to come off, but I’d seen enough of Jamie to know he was going to suit us. I watched him at Perth under Ali Edwards, and I thought his movement was outstanding. He was someone I was really keen on, so when the opportunity came to sign him, I didn’t hesitate. Some questioned whether he could score double figures, but I was confident. With Corona, I knew the way we wanted to play through midfield would suit his game. He is exceptional on the ball, so intelligent. I knew he would fit in straightaway.\n\nJamie Maclaren and coach John Aloisi at Brisbane Roar training. Pic Jono Searle. Source: News Corp Australia\n\nSimon Hill: How far can Jamie go in football?\n\nJohn Aloisi: I think he can get to the highest level. This has been his first season of regular football. He will improve with another pre-season under his belt. He works on his movement, his runs, his finishing, and he can still improve on his link up play. We can all see his talent, and he has a lot of improvement left in him.\n\nSimon Hill: On Sunday you face your old Socceroos teammate Tony Popovic. You’ve known each other for such a long time ... are there any football secrets left between the two of you?\n\nJohn Aloisi: (Laughs) We know each other pretty well that’s for sure. But one thing I can guarantee, is that watching their team all season, and ours, it will be entertaining. Both like to play possession based football, both like to attack, and it’s going to be a real battle in midfield, with the Spanish contingent, Petratos, Nichols. So, I don’t think it’s so much about us, as two good teams.\n\nSimon Hill: What’s the potential for a club like Brisbane — crowds seem stuck around the 13,000 mark — how do you make the great leap forward to make Roar a super-club?\n\nJohn Aloisi: I think its about promoting the club more — and individuals, like Jamie Maclaren. Make them big stars here. The football we have played has been entertaining, and we’ve won a lot of home games, so we should be getting 20,000. It’s up to us as a club to promote it, make sure we are out there, and that people know we are playing. Then, when people do start to come along, hopefully they will stay.\n\nSimon Hill: If you do get through — Adelaide (your home city) or Melbourne City (your old club) — any preference?!\n\nJohn Aloisi: I really don’t have a preference, but if we do play Melbourne City it would be at home, so that would be nice. If it’s Adelaide, its in front of our family, so that would be nice too!\n\nSimon Hill: If it was Adelaide, who would your family support?\n\nJohn Aloisi: Only one answer to that — blood is always thicker than water!",
  "latent_18132": "Life's Rocky Start\n\nPBS Airdate: January 13, 2016\n\nNARRATOR: They are dazzling, priceless, at times even glowing…\n\nROBERT HAZEN (Carnegie Institution for Science): How can one not fall in love with rocks and minerals? I mean the colors, the shapes.\n\nNARRATOR: …and they're the building blocks of modern civilization.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: We wouldn't have televisions, we wouldn't have automobiles, we wouldn't have buildings, without the mineral riches that we have.\n\nNARRATOR: But could rocks and minerals also solve the greatest mystery of all time: the origin of life?\n\nROBERT HAZEN: The rocks we pick up tell a story: that life couldn't have occurred without rocks.\n\nNARRATOR: Could cold, lifeless stone hold the key to every living thing on Earth? From Australia to Morocco, NOVA goes around the world and back in time to investigate the origin and evolution of life…\n\nRUTH BLAKE (Yale University): You look at a rock, you think, \"Ah, well, nothing.\" But this holds the signature of life.\n\nNARRATOR: …from its first spark…\n\nJEFFREY BADA (Scripps Institution of Oceanography): People were saying they made Frankenstein in a test tube.\n\nNARRATOR: …to the survival of the fittest.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: These were immense creatures, sharks that may have been 50 or 60 feet.\n\nNARRATOR: Was it the secret link between rocks and life that made the difference? Life's Rocky Start, right now, on NOVA.\n\nThe ancient market of Marrakech, a chaotic, colorful gathering place, teeming with life for thousands of years: the perfect place to ask, \"How did this exotic, beautiful and sometimes bizarre thing called life begin?\" How did Earth go from a lifeless, molten rock to a living planet, full of diverse and spectacular creatures?\n\nIt's a question that has long perplexed scientists. Now, Robert Hazen, a geologist, is trying to show we are missing an essential ingredient in the recipe for life: rocks.\n\nNothing seems more lifeless than a rock. It's inanimate. It's the antithesis of a living thing. But we are beginning to realize that rocks played an absolutely fundamental role in the origin of life.\n\nNARRATOR: Hazen is out to expose a secret relationship between rocks and life that helped drive both the origin of life and its evolution into complex creatures.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: This is a very new set of understandings, and the more we look, the more we see that life depends on rocks, rocks depend on life. And this has been going on for four-billion years.\n\nNARRATOR: As a geologist, it's no surprise that Hazen is searching for answers written in stone. But is he right? Are rocks the missing spark of life?\n\nThe history of Earth is unimaginably long. If it were sped up to the equivalent of a single day, all of humankind, from the earliest skeletons to the invention of the iPhone, would have occurred in only the last four seconds; dinosaurs were still roaming Earth about 20 minutes before that; but the creation of our planet occurred more than 23 hours earlier, two cycles on this clock, or 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nComprehending Earth's vast history is a formidable task.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: There's four-and-a-half-billion years of change, but you can divide it into half a dozen ways of describing Earth through time.\n\nNARRATOR: Bob Hazen has come up with another way to visualize Earth's long history that reveals this special relationship between rocks and life. He has divided it into six stages, each represented by a different color.\n\nTo understand how we ended up with Green Earth, the planet we now know, requires us to turn the clock back, to before there was any life at all. Stage one was the creation of Black Earth.\n\nBack in Morocco, Hazen and Adam Aronson, a meteorite expert, seek out a small rock from the beginning of our cosmos.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: Wow, look at this pile here.\n\nNARRATOR: These are meteorites, rocks that have fallen from space.\n\nADAM ARONSON (Meteorite Expert): This is Tamdaght. This is the one that fell 20 kilometers up the road from here. People saw it fall.\n\nNARRATOR: A recent meteorite fall in Siberia was captured in videos that have shown up on YouTube. Other space rocks have ended up for sale, here, in Morocco.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: So you'd buy this without doing tests?\n\nADAM ARONSON: I would drop the cash right now, if you would give me a good price.\n\nNARRATOR: Meteorites here can sell for tens of thousands of dollars. That may seem a steep price for a lump of rock, but these are some of the very oldest objects in our solar system.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: This is the oldest object you could ever hold in your hand. It's 4.6-billion years old and it was formed before Earth formed. This is the very first solid material, the very first rock in our solar system, and these came together to build all the planets.\n\nNARRATOR: Our Earth was created out of the rocks and dust present at the start of our solar system. Over time, small fragments of orbiting rock collided, coming together into the planets circling the sun. At first, Earth was molten, with temperatures in the thousands of degrees. But in the cold vacuum of space this hot rock began to cool and change.\n\nNothing, not a speck of dust, is believed to have survived from the period of Black Earth. It was a hellishly unpleasant time. Volcanoes spewed hot lava from deep inside the planet. When it cooled, it covered Earth with its first rock, called basalt, and it was black.\n\nIt seems like a desolate landscape, but some ingredients that life will need are already here, in these rocks. Look inside, and you begin to understand how intriguing even an ordinary rock is.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: Every rock, you slice it open, you look inside, there's something special.\n\nNARRATOR: Rocks are made up mostly of minerals, which are crystals, like quartz or diamonds. Looking through a microscope at super-thin slices of a rock lets you see its mineral composition.\n\nThis is the rock peridotite, made up of small crystals including olivine and pyroxene.\n\nEven a simple black basalt rock, spewed from a volcano, becomes a patchwork of colorful minerals.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: It is sort of like a fruitcake. You know, you slice it open, there's nuts and there is dried fruit and maybe some lemon peel. It's made of lots of little things. And it's not until you slice into that fruitcake that you see all the stuff inside that makes it special.\n\nNARRATOR: What makes them special is not only their beauty. Minerals have remarkable chemical and physical properties and are a source of many of the elements, nature's building blocks.\n\nThat is why they're essential in our modern world, to make everything, from skyscrapers taller to mobile phones smaller. Extract the element molybdenum from the mineral molybdenite to make steel harder, or add a pinch of cobalt and your iPhone battery will last longer.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: Minerals are the fundamental building block of societies. We wouldn't have televisions, we wouldn't have automobiles, we wouldn't have buildings, without the mineral riches that we have.\n\nNARRATOR: So, were the remarkable chemical properties of minerals also key in creating life? If so, Earth would need more than it started with.\n\nIt's estimated that the meteorites that formed Earth had only about 250 minerals, sort of a chemical starter kit containing many of the elements. Then, in the intense heat and pressures in the creation of our planet, new minerals began to form. This changed the appearance of our Earth from black to gray.\n\nYosemite National Park is a relatively new piece of Earth, but the kind of the rock that makes up these dramatic cliffs goes back much further. These huge walls are granite, containing minerals like quartz and feldspar. Granite became the foundation of our continents, leading Earth into the Gray period.\n\nAt this point, Earth is still a long way from the glorious diversity of plants and animals that makes Yosemite so picturesque, but the stage is set for the next character in our planet's story, water, which will turn Earth blue.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: Water plays a central role in every model for the origin of life. That's because water is such a great solvent. All these different kinds of molecules can be floating around the water and then they have the potential to interact together. The starting point is the water.\n\nNARRATOR: So when did Earth cool enough to have liquid water, this element key to life?\n\nROBERT HAZEN: One of the biggest unknowns in this whole idea of going from black to grey to a blue water-covered Earth is how quickly it happens. The timing was a big mystery.\n\nNARRATOR: The Pilbara, in Western Australia, is one of the oldest places on Earth, and so, one of the best places to solve the mystery of the planet's first oceans.\n\nHazen joins an all-star team of geologists, including Martin Van Kranendonk, from the University of New South Wales, and John Valley, of the University of Wisconsin.\n\nValley is collecting rocks that could hold clues to when water first appeared.\n\nJOHN VALLEY (University of Wisconsin—Madison): We can get zircon and other minerals that date all the way back to 4.4-billion years old.\n\nMARTIN VAN KRANENDONK (University of New South Wales): Hopefully.\n\nNARRATOR: Some rocks here contain sand-sized grains that weathered from even older rocks. One in a million, literally, is a crystal called zircon, one of the longest lasting materials in nature. Zircon is a popular gemstone, but the microscopic zircon found here is even more precious.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: Zircon crystals there are especially amazing. Gemstone zircons of course are valued, but these tiny ones that geologist value are microscopic. They make a lousy ring, but they tell an incredible story.\n\nNARRATOR: To tell that story, John Valley must first find the tiny crystals, the ultimate \"needle in a haystack.\"\n\nJOHN VALLEY: If you want to find a needle in the haystack the first thing you do is you burn down the haystack. Then you sift through the ash to look for the needle.\n\nNARRATOR: Rocks are pulverized into sand-sized grains, and sorted by weight, in a machine developed to pan for gold. The gold that Valley is looking for are heavy zircon crystals, which get channeled into different tracks. Then, grain by grain, with a very steady hand, thousands of small crystals are sorted and analyzed.\n\nThe chemical structure of a zircon crystal holds evidence of both the environment and the age when it formed. Some of these tiny crystals go very far back, just over 100-million years after Earth formed. They are the oldest pieces of Earth ever discovered, so they could shed light on what our young planet looked like.\n\nJOHN VALLEY: It's totally amazing to me. To hold this grain of sand in the palm of your hand is, literally, to see back through time. It is a time machine.\n\nNARRATOR: Valley expected these crystal time machines would confirm the long-held view that the young Earth was covered in molten lava, still cooling after its violent formation. So, what he discovered was shocking, because this type of zircon, created 4.3-billion years ago, could only have formed in the presence of liquid water.\n\nBut how could there be water, if Earth was still hot and hell-like?\n\nJOHN VALLEY: The implications were that the early Earth had water. It was cooler and it was wet. It's starting to look very much more familiar.\n\nNARRATOR: And if water is a key starting point for life, could there be life that early, too?\n\nJOHN VALLEY: The science of the zircon is telling us that the earth for a very, very long time, was a habitable environment, not necessarily that there was life then, we don't know that yet. But there's no reason why there couldn't have been life as early as 4.3-billion years ago.\n\nNARRATOR: So if life were possible that early, it begs the question, how did life begin?\n\nIn 1871, Charles Darwin speculated, in a letter to a friend, that a warm little pond might be life's birthplace. A warm soup of chemicals, bathed by energy from the sun, would have been, well, comfortable for molecules to come together in new ways and create life.\n\nJEFFREY BADA: Darwin was way, way ahead of his time. A nice little warm soup is going to get you a long way.\n\nNARRATOR: Jeff Bada, of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, in San Diego, has spent his career working to understand the early earth's soup of chemicals. He began under the direction of perhaps the most famous scientist in origin-of-life research, Stanley Miller.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: There are, in the history of science, turning points, where we suddenly see the history of Earth and life differently. In the early 1950s, Stanley Miller, the eager graduate student, and Harold Yuri, the Nobel-Prize-winning mentor, at the University of Chicago, conducted this astonishing experiment, where they made an early-Earth environment.\n\nJEFFREY BADA: It looks like this, sort of, Frankenstein-type apparatus, but, actually, it's a very carefully thought-out design.\n\nNARRATOR: Bada sets up a modern day test of the 1950s experiment on Miller's original lab equipment.\n\nJEFFREY BADA: One flask contains water. That's to simulate the ocean. The other flask has just got the gases in it. So, this is the atmosphere.\n\nNARRATOR: Just as it does in nature, water from the ‘ocean' evaporates and rises into the ‘atmosphere,' where it condenses and returns to the ‘ocean.' Miller simulated what he believed to be the atmosphere of early Earth with different gases, like ammonia and methane. Then, he added a spark of genius.\n\nJEFFREY BADA: Miller and Urey decided to use a spark to simulate lightning, because that's such a ubiquitous process in the atmosphere of the earth.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: That was the real inspiration: these little electric sparks. They acted like simulated lightning.\n\nNARRATOR: The energy from the spark of lightning breaks down the gas and water molecules, so they can undergo further chemical reactions.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: To their astonishment, when they turned this apparatus on, after only a couple of days, you started seeing this pink color developing. And then, in a few more days, black, oily goo is forming around the electrodes.\n\nNARRATOR: The electrodes get covered with new substances, organic compounds usually associated with life.\n\nJEFFREY BADA: And it wasn't just any organic compound, it was amino acids that make proteins, the ingredients for life.\n\nNARRATOR: Amino acids are the building blocks of life. They form proteins, which are the key component of muscles and other tissues.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: And people thought. \"Ah ha! This is a key step in the origin of life.\"\n\nEDWARD VAN SLOAN (as Doctor Waldman in Frankenstein/Film Clip): And you really believe that you can bring life to the dead?\n\nCOLIN CLIVE (as Henry Frankenstein in Frankenstein/Film Clip): That body is not dead. It has never lived. I created it.\n\nNARRATOR: The experiment raised the fear that a Frankenstein creation, like in this classic film, was just around the corner.\n\nJEFFREY BADA: People were saying they made Frankenstein in a test tube.\n\nCOLIN CLIVE (as Henry Frankenstein in Frankenstein/Film Clip): He's alive! Now, I know what it feels like to be God!\n\nNARRATOR: Had Miller and Urey cooked up life, in a test tube?\n\nJEFFREY BADA: Many of the news headlines were saying \"Life created in the laboratory!\" \"Life created in a test tube!\" Well, of course, that was wrong. The real news was he'd made these compounds that are part of life.\n\nNARRATOR: By creating amino acids, the Miller-Urey experiment seemed to confirm that Darwin was right: life must have begun in a shallow pond.\n\nBut then, 24 years later, a shocking discovery radically challenged that idea.\n\nOn the dark ocean floor, more than a mile below the surface, explorers found hot, mineral-rich hydrothermal vents, like underwater volcanos. Temperatures reached more than 600 degrees, and yet, here, life was thriving, not off the sun's energy, but though chemical energy from the vents.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: No one realized that life could thrive without sunlight. Here you have this extreme temperature and this extreme pressure. So, you have to shift your perceptions and realize that just because it's extreme to us doesn't mean it's extreme to those microbes.\n\nNARRATOR: Instead of the warm shallow pond, could this dark and unlikely environment be where life began?\n\nTo answer that, Hazen decided to try creating life's building blocks in the conditions of a deep-sea vent.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: My first thought was, \"Gee, why don't we just do a Miller-Urey experiment, but do it at high temperature, high pressure?\"\n\nNARRATOR: Hazen's laboratory is at the Carnegie Institution for Science, which is famous for experiments that simulate the intense pressures deep inside Earth, with powerful tools, called pressure bombs.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: They're called \"bombs\" for a reason: because things can explode.\n\nNARRATOR: Hazen and his colleagues adapted these pressure bombs to model the environment of the deep-sea vents in a small gold tube. What they discovered came as a surprise: nothing happened.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: You can take basic gases: nitrogen, CO2, maybe some sulfur compounds. You can mix those, you can put them in a gold tube, you can heat them up; you don't get much that's very interesting.\n\nNARRATOR: Simply squeezing and heating the ingredients had little effect. Hazen was missing the spark, like in the Miller-Urey experiment, the thing that kick-starts the chemistry.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: So we said, \"Well, what's going on? What's different? Well, look at the natural environment, there's all these rocks and minerals. Let's try putting some rocks and minerals in.\"\n\nNARRATOR: They recreate the early-Earth cocktail, but this time grind in powder from rocks and minerals. But will Hazen's beloved rocks do the trick?\n\nThey run the experiment again, and this time the atoms reform into new organic molecules, including amino acids.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: As soon as you put powdered rocks and minerals into the gold capsules, all sorts of amazing things started happening. You made organic molecules, they became more stable, they lasted longer, and it really pointed us in the directions. \"Ah ha. This has got to be part of the story.\"\n\nNARRATOR: While scientists still argue if life began in shallow ponds or deep-sea vents, both sides wonder, \"What part of the story did rocks and minerals play?\"\n\nOne possible answer may be found in London, in the powerful properties of mud.\n\nPETER COVENEY (University College London): Most people will be familiar with the material. It's very gungy. That's, perhaps, a British word that refers to something which is soft and unpleasant, generally.\n\nNARRATOR: Peter Coveney, of University College London, is busy playing in mud, at a very sophisticated level. He has created powerful computer simulations that can track the precise movement of up to 10-million atoms.\n\nMud can contain clay, which is made up of some of Earth's most common minerals. What makes it so ‘gungy,' and perhaps essential in the origin of life, can be seen deep in its atomic makeup.\n\nPETER COVENEY: You can see here the basic structure of any clay. It's comprised of a large number of stacked sheets like a deck of cards.\n\nNARRATOR: Sheets of clay have spaces between them that fill up with water and other molecules. These extensive surface areas can help create more complex molecules, potentially even R.N.A., an essential part of life's genetic code.\n\nPETER COVENEY: One of the most challenging questions in the origin of life is how we get from the simple building blocks to the complicated structures we know are fundamental to living systems. Clays provide a clear mechanism for achieving that.\n\nNARRATOR: These simulations show that the secret to clay lies in its surfaces.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: The surfaces of these minerals are incredible. They do all sorts of chemical tricks.\n\nNARRATOR: Hazen says minerals, like clays, illustrate a fascinating aspect of chemistry, because the surface where reactions take place can be as important as the ingredients themselves.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: The most exquisite chemistry occurs at surfaces. Your body, your cells are almost entirely surfaces on which chemistry takes place. And so, when we think about the origin of life, the minerals, sort of, replace surfaces you have in your body that do that chemical work.\n\nNARRATOR: We are finally beginning to understand the secret role minerals could have played in life's origin. They provided some of the ingredients and surfaces where important chemical reactions take place.\n\nSo, when in Hazen's color phases did all this happen? One of the best places to figure that out is back in Australia, where Hazen and team are now searching for signs of Earth's earliest life.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: I can't believe these rocks are three-and-a-half-billion years old. They look like they formed last week.\n\nNARRATOR: Martin Van Kranendonk leads the team to a very unusual rock formation.\n\nMARTIN VAN KRANENDONK: As you get your eye casting up, you see them…\n\nROBERT HAZEN: Oh, my gosh!\n\nMARTIN VAN KRANENDONK: …all wrinkly, laminated black.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: Yeah.\n\nMARTIN VAN KRANENDONK: And then, if you look a bit further back, you see a very large domical structure.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: There's no obvious way that just a chemical, a physical process would form that.\n\nMARTIN VAN KRANENDONK: Exactly.\n\nNARRATOR: These strange shapes are fossilized remnants of life, called \"stromatolites,\" beautifully preserved in these ancient rocks.\n\nMARTIN VAN KRANENDONK: This is an amazing spot. We are actually looking down on the surface of the ancient earth here. This was the seafloor, 3.4-billion years ago, and I can see it in action. It's like a snap-frozen instance of time.\n\nNARRATOR: But billions of years have taken their toll. To really understand stromatolites, we have to go nearly 800 miles away. David Flannery, a geologist, has come to Shark Bay in search of their very distant descendants.\n\nJust below the surface, he finds a series of round, black mounds: living stromatolites.\n\nDAVID FLANNERY (NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory): Modern environments, like these, they're very rare, but they are really the key to interpreting what we see in the very early fossil record. Without environments like these, we wouldn't know how stromatolites were built.\n\nNARRATOR: Stromatolites are something like coral: a hard mineral structure that has been built layer by layer. A closer look reveals the builders: microbes, single-celled life.\n\nDAVID FLANNERY: The living part of the stromatolite is only the surface, where the living microbial mat is building up the structure, layer by layer, at less than a millimeter per year.\n\nNARRATOR: The top layer of these stromatolites is alive with microbes that perform a remarkable trick. They capture minerals and sand in the water and biologically cement them, layer by layer, into the solid mounds.\n\nThe results can be seen in Shark Bay, today, and in the ancient fossils.\n\nMARTIN VAN KRANENDONK: Yeah, let me introduce you to this outcrop. It's just spectacular to be able to see this.\n\nNARRATOR: And this outcrop is unique.\n\nVan Kranendonk has dated this stromatolite to 3.5-billion years ago.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: It's beautiful.\n\nNARRATOR: This is the very oldest fossil of life on Earth.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: We all want to know where we come from, where life originated, how long ago, in what form, and this is the oldest direct evidence we have for life on Earth.\n\nNARRATOR: But while stromatolites are the earliest fossil of life we've found, that does not make them the first living thing. In fact, Van Kranendonk thinks, by the time stromatolites appeared, life's party was already in full swing.\n\nMARTIN VAN KRANENDONK: There are whole communities and colonies that are building fantastically complex structures, so we have actually come in pretty late to the game. There is a lot that's going on before us, to get to this stage, and it is this complexity that tell us that life probably originated on Earth very early.\n\nNARRATOR: So if these very early fossils are too complex to be the oldest form of life, is it possible to find something earlier?\n\nThat is what Ruth Blake, a geologist at Yale University, is trying to figure out, by turning to the geological equivalent of a crime scene investigation.\n\nRUTH BLAKE: The crime has been committed. The criminal is gone, but they've left behind some indicator, because they've changed their environment.\n\nNARRATOR: Blake is analyzing some of the oldest rocks on Earth, like this ground up one, from Greenland, that formed at the bottom of an ocean. She is looking for a chemical signature of life left by microbes, including bacteria.\n\nRUTH BLAKE: What we start with is our ocean, trapped in a rock, and our bio-signature is somewhere in here. We have to get it out.\n\nNARRATOR: In the lab, Blake and her team dissolve these rocks and extract molecules left behind by ancient microbes.\n\nAll life, like these microbes, consumes nutrients to produce energy, and they excrete what's left over. The leftovers carry the chemical footprint of life. Even today, we humans leave behind chemical footprints.\n\nRUTH BLAKE: When we breathe, for example, we're taking in oxygen, and we are exhaling CO2 and water vapor. That water vapor interacts with our environment.\n\nNARRATOR: Amazingly, rocks from 3.5-billion years ago, at the time of the stromatolites in Australia, also carry a strong chemical footprint of life. But when Blake analyzes the Greenland rocks from 300-million years earlier, she makes a tantalizing discovery.\n\nRUTH BLAKE: As far back as 3.5-billion years, we see a strong biological signature. And the older rocks are approaching that, but not quite there. But we do believe that we see something there.\n\nNARRATOR: Blake believes she has detected the faint signal of life at 3.8-billion years ago, only 700-million years after Earth was created, early in the Blue phase.\n\nThere is still much that we don't know about our early planet, but some things are becoming clearer. If you could transport yourself back in time, about four-billion years, parts of our Earth might not look too different than this southern California beach, minus the surfers and poodle.\n\nYou could stand on cliffs, probably of granite, overlooking oceans that were increasingly rich with minerals and early microbial life. But you would quickly die in a great deal of pain, suffocating in the heavy atmosphere, rich in nitrogen and carbon dioxide, but lacking in life-giving free oxygen.\n\nThen something truly astonishing happened. Those harmless looking microbes, floating in the water or on stromatolites, started to change everything, turning Earth red.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: Wow. Oh, my god, this is amazing! There aren't many places on Earth you can see something like this.\n\nNARRATOR: A remnant of Red Earth can be seen in Australia, at the Hamersley Basin, in Karinjini National Park.\n\nIn these rocks, Hazen finds a startling consequence of early life as it began to thrive and evolve.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: What we're seeing here is one of the greatest tricks that life ever figured out. And that was how to take sunlight and convert it to energy.\n\nNARRATOR: Microbes, like those in the stromatolites at Shark Bay, eventually began to live off the sun's energy through photosynthesis. That led to a dramatic rise in a gas that Earth was not accustomed to: oxygen. While, to us, oxygen is a life-giving benign gas, to a world not accustomed to it, oxygen created a dangerously corrosive cocktail. The early oceans were filled with dissolved iron. The new oxygen reacted with that iron, and it began to rust and sank to the bottom of the sea.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: These little microbes, they're microscopic things, and you wouldn't think they could do all that much. But when they produce that oxygen and the oxygen reacts with the iron in the oceans, you get the world's largest deposits of iron, thousands of feet, covering hundreds of square miles.\n\nNARRATOR: These formations cover a vast geographic area with trillions of tons of iron ore. That is an unimaginable consequence of trillions upon trillions of microbes breathing.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: It's a fundamental change in the chemistry of Earth. It's a consequence of the rise of oxygen. The rise in oxygen that rusted iron and sent Earth into the Red Phase also created many new minerals.\n\nAs a mineralogist, when I look at Earth history, I see big new transitions. I see the moon-forming impact. I see the formation of oceans and so forth. But nothing, nothing matches what life and oxygen did to create new minerals.\n\nNARRATOR: Some estimate that the meteorites that formed Earth began with only about 250 minerals. Today, there are more than 5,000. Hazen believes that two-thirds of all the minerals that now make up our planet were created by the introduction of oxygen, and most of that was, in turn, created by life.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: It's mindboggling. Rocks create life and life creates rocks. They're intertwined in ways that are just now coming into focus.\n\nNARRATOR: But the road ahead for life and for rocks would not be easy. As we headed into the next phase of Earth, new continents formed and broke apart, which may have created dramatic extremes in the climate. Earth plunged into an icy freeze, turning it white. In these frozen conditions, life was nearly wiped out.\n\nFortunately, active volcanoes still poked through the icy veneer, billowing out carbon dioxide, or CO2. Like a thermal blanket around our Earth, this kept heat in and rescued life.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: Life all but shut down, and then the CO2 rises and rises, and the greenhouse effect gets hotter and hotter, and suddenly the planet melts.\n\nNARRATOR: Cycles of these snowball/hothouse conditions had profound consequences for life. One result was more oxygen, which eventually allowed for bigger animals. The dramatic changes during White Earth would bring us to the present phase, starting about 540-million years ago, a living planet filled with diverse plants and spectacular creatures.\n\nBut those life forms are pitted against each other in a survival of the fittest, and rocks can make the difference between life and death.\n\nThat struggle can be seen, back in Morocco, at the edge of the Anti-Atlas Mountains. Here, Bob Hazen is looking for evidence of an evolutionary trick that shows, once again, how life and rocks took a big leap forward together.\n\nFive-hundred-twenty-million years ago, this valley was a shallow ocean, filled with new forms of life. This is when the diversity of life on Earth exploded, all thriving in a living sea.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: So, if you were a scuba diver and you dove down to this reef, you'd see all kinds of life swimming around, really amazing, probably very colorful, too.\n\nNARRATOR: There is one creature that dominates this ancient reef that Hazen wants to find.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: Nothing there, nothing there and nothing there.\n\nNARRATOR: Fossil hunting is a game of luck and persistence, but it doesn't take long for Hazen to strike geologic gold…\n\nROBERT HAZEN: Whoa! Jeez, look at that.\n\nADAM ARONSON: That's amazing.\n\nNARRATOR: …the trilobite.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: Hey, look. There's another head there and the head there, two more. Boy, this is rich rock.\n\nThe trilobites here are amazing, because these are the oldest animals that you can find that are preserved as what you think of as the fossil that you can hold in your hand.\n\nNARRATOR: Some trilobites were like horseshoe crabs, scurrying about the ocean floor. The reason they are found as fossils today is because they developed an astonishing evolutionary trick: shells. Trilobite shells were made of calcium carbonate, the same mineral found in limestone, the rock that built the pyramids.\n\nIn effect, life itself began to make rocks for its own advantage. And the idea went viral.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: If you had a shell, you are going to survive a lot longer than that soft-bodied animal that doesn't have a shell. The trilobite had an advantage. It's survival of the fittest.\n\nNARRATOR: The trilobite's mineral shell heralded a new phase in the evolution of animals, catapulting our planet into the present stage: Green Earth, one that is rich in diverse life.\n\nFrom humans back to trilobites, we owe our evolution and survival to the world of minerals, with shells, then eventually with bones and teeth that paved the way for life to grow taller and stronger. All are evidence of life co-opting minerals for its own evolutionary advantage.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: We've thought for centuries, animals, minerals, they are separate kingdoms, right? But it turns out they overlap, they are intertwined, they co-evolved, that life makes minerals and minerals has led to new life forms. You can't separate the two. Life and rocks are totally intertwined through billions of years of Earth history.\n\nNARRATOR: One of Hazen's favorite places to see this intertwined history of life and minerals is at the Calvert Cliffs along the Chesapeake Bay. He and his wife, Margee, pick up shells and shark teeth from a time, 18-million years ago, when massive sea creatures swam here.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: You find teeth along the beach that are five, six, sometimes seven inches long with serrated edges; razor-sharp teeth. These were immense creatures, sharks that may have been 50 or 60 feet long.\n\nNARRATOR: These giants of the sea would have dwarfed today's great whites. And it was the bones and teeth created with minerals that enabled them to grow so large and powerful.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: They were feeding on whales. Dolphins would have been a snack.\n\nNARRATOR: They are just one small part of a story of co-evolution stretching back to Earth's beginning.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: The life, the rocks, it's all part of the same story.\n\nNARRATOR: Step by step, throughout Earth's evolution, minerals and life have sparked chemical reactions that sculpted the planet into what we see today and helped create the life we know.\n\nROBERT HAZEN: At this place, you get a sense of the immensity of time and the constancy of change. Life is creating and sculpting our surroundings in ways that are quite wonderful. And just to recognize the power of life to transform a planet…\n\nOf course, humans transform the planet too. We build cities, we build roads, we change the composition, the atmosphere and change the composition of the oceans. There are going to be global changes.\n\nNARRATOR: These changes, whose consequences are now beginning to unfold, are the latest chapter in Earth's epic story, a story that began four- and-a-half-billion years ago, with a rock.",

Johnston has more than 30 years of experience working for Top 10 automakers and suppliers in the international automotive arena.\n\nFounder and CEO of Elio, Paul Elio stated:\n\n“Johnston’s personal values of high product quality, exceptional value and on-time delivery perfectly align with those of Elio Motors, making him a natural choice as our vice president of Engineering. His industry experience and successes with other automakers and top suppliers in the areas of product development and engineering has raised him to rock star status and has prepared him well to help make the Elio an affordable vehicle of enviable quality that’s fun to drive.”\n\nLast month, Elio presented details about the company’s new ePlus Business Model during the 2016 New York International Auto Show. The process will allow consumers to pick the options they want and have a personalized vehicle delivered within 24 hours after ordering. The company noted that the customer will be able to add to their vehicle through the website, myelio.me, as new options are brought to market by Elio Motors’ supplier network.\n\nHe shared:\n\n“The current options system is broken at many levels. Traditionally if a customer wants one particular option, they have to accept three or four other options as part of the package, and that seriously limits customer choice and drives up cost to the customer. Much of the technology forced on customers, such as navigation or media equipment becomes antiquated in six months or less. “Suppliers all over the globe have created really cool content for vehicles that never see the light of day because of an antiquated packaging system and we want to change that,” Elio said. “Our ePlus system will help our suppliers unleash their entrepreneurial capabilities, which are often stifled under the current system.”\n\nhe then added:\n\n“Our ePlus system connects the entire supply chain to the end consumer, which is a tremendous value to our customers and our supplier partners, plus it is a continuous revenue stream for the entire network.

  "latent_18254": "On June 5 of this year, the Guardian began publishing reports of the U.S. National Security Agency’s massive online spying operations. As the world would soon find out, the classified documents were given to the paper by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, who is now a fugitive living under asylum in Russia. In the past seven months, the Guardian, as well as the Washington Post, Der Spiegel, the New York Times, O Globo, and other outlets have been publishing details of the NSA’s various spy programs, most based on Snowden’s files. The leaks have sparked a global debate about the nature of privacy on the Internet and have forced the world articulate the type of future we want for our digital selves.\n\nTo place these leaks in any absolute ranking from most to least importance is, of course, futile (even after setting aside the fact that the true scope of many of these operations may have yet to come to light). As former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald put it to the Daily Dot, “their effect has been cumulative and it all depends on what metric you use.”\n\nWith that in mind, the leaks on this list were chosen (and to some extent ordered) for their contribution in conveying to the public the current character of the NSA’s surveillance program: its scope, its mentality, its motives, its operations.\n\nThese are, in other words, the leaks most important for forming a clear and complete picture of the highly secretive spy agency.\n\n1) Metadata collection from Verizon: NSA collects the phone records of millions of Americans\n\nDespite the general ambiguity surrounding any attempt to rank these programs definitively, the NSA’s dragnet collection of Americans’ telephony metadata—the who, when, and where of their calls—is decidedly number one with a bullet.\n\nThis was the very first leak published from Snowden’s trove of stolen documents. Posted by the Guardian on June 5, it revealed to the world that the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court issued an order for the telecom giant Verizon to turn over the phone records of millions of Americans. The story would set the tenor for seven subsequent months of NSA spying revelations: It introduced Americans to the FISC, which, despite being charged with protecting their privacy from government surveillance, has denied only a handful of the thousands of state requests for (often bulk) data collection since it was created in 1978. The leak also raised questions about previous statements made by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who months earlier denied that the NSA collected bulk data on millions of U.S. citizens. In December, a federal judge ruled that the collection program may in fact be unconstitutional, making it the first NSA program successfully challenged in federal court.\n\nAlso in December, Greenwald testified before an E.U. committee inquiring into U.S. surveillance. In the hearing he stated that according to Snowden’s trove of secret documents, metadata collection was the “supreme priority” of the NSA. “It isn’t just surveillance experts that think that way,” he told the committee. “It’s the NSA itself.” When the Daily Dot asked Greenwald about which program should occupy the top spot on this list, he echoed those sentiments: “If forced to choose,” Greenwald said, “I’d say it was that Verizon story, because it was first, implicated all Americans, was so clear in its content, destroyed the credibility of NSA officials, and infuriated Congress.”\n\n2) XKeyscore: NSA monitors browsing histories, emails, chats\n\nSnowden disclosed the existence of a handful of different NSA monitoring programs. But XKeyscore stands out for several reasons: First, according to a report on the program published in late July by the Guardian, the NSA considers it to be the “widest-reaching” surveillance tool in its arsenal. Connected to a massive searchable database of chats, emails, browsing histories and login information, the program, by the agency’s own reckoning, allows agents to monitor “nearly everything a typical user does on the Internet.”\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of the leak was how it illuminated the shortcomings of the agency’s so-called minimization procedures. Legally, under the legislation such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act which was designed to protect Americans from foreign surveillance operations, the NSA can only perform warrantless surveillance on Americans if they are communicating with a known target, a person outside the U.S., or are themselves outside the country. As the XKeyscore leak revealed, all agents had to do to satisfy this standard was to select from a dropdown menu which of the above justifications they believed qualified a person for online surveillance.\n\nXKeyscore was the first program to suggest the extent of the NSA’s partnerships with other intelligence agencies around the globe. As Der Spiegel reported, the U.S. shared access to XKeyscore with Germany’s domestic and international intelligence agencies. The close relationship, ostensibly justified by the high level of terrorist activity in Germany, began to suggest that the NSA’s embrace of surveillance had spread to countries in Europe and beyond.\n\n3) PRISM: NSA uses secret court orders to obtain Americans’ social media data\n\nRevealed jointly by the Guardian and the Washington Post on June 6, the NSA’s PRISM program collects citizens’ social media data from Silicon Valley companies like Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Apple and Microsoft. PRISM is far from the most damning of Snowden’s leaks, but it is arguably the most widely publicized as it was the first to suggest the NSA was engaged in extensive online surveillance operations.\n\nPRISM functions by obtaining warrants for Americans’ private online data through the secretive FISC. For Silicon Valley, the leak was devastating. Email and social media companies have long grappled with the issue of user privacy. Although they were forced to disclose their customers’ information under a gag order, the leak nonetheless caused Americans to question how wise it is to entrust their personal information to Internet corporations. Around the world, the response was similar. International email clients saw a boon in new customers and countries began discussing ways of softening the U.S.’s grip on Internet infrastructure. It is estimated that PRISM cost technology companies as much as $35 billion.\n\nThe financial losses may in fact run much higher in the future. A more recent disclosure revealed that the NSA tapped directly into Google and Yahoo’s offshore cloud servers to directly monitor traffic. Neither company was aware the infiltration had taken place.\n\n4) The identity of Edward Snowden\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Verizon metadata and PRISM leaks in early June, the world still didn’t know who had turned the documents over. On June 9, from a hotel in Hong Kong, 29-year-old Edward Snowden came forward.\n\nIn the videotaped interview with Greenwald, Snowden explained himself: “When you’re in positions of privileged access like a systems administrator for the sort of intelligence community agencies,” he said, “you’re exposed to a lot more information on a broader scale than the average employee, and because of that you see things that may be disturbing but over the course of a normal person’s career you’d only see one or two of these instances.”\n\nSnowden’s point, in other words, was that it wasn’t so much any individual at the NSA who had acted illegally—it was the institution as a whole that had strayed from its Signals Intelligence roots (somewhat without the knowledge of individual actors). This phenomenon of 20th century bureaucracies was popularized in the 1960s by journalist Hannah Arendt, who dubbed it “the banality of evil.” By diagnosing the systemic overreach of the NSA, Snowden was able to add a broader framework to the seven subsequent months of reports his massive trove of documents would produce.\n\nBy making his identity public, Snowden also effectively made public the complicated political relationship of countries around the world on issues of privacy rights: He fled to Russia, where he was granted asylum in large part no doubt because of the Cold War-era animosity that still exists between the U.S. and Russia. While Snowden’s leaks would reveal many spying programs in European countries, no nation offered him protection, as many are nurturing close, economically beneficial ties with the U.S., notably right now through the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership for example. Meanwhile, a group of South American nations indicated a willingness to assist the fugitive leaker. In large part, this willingness reveals the ways in which South America has had less influence over the growing Internet economy.\n\n5) Bullrun: NSA has sewed encryption backdoors into the Internet\n\nThe NSA’s interest in breaking the encryption schemes that protect much of the communications moving across the Internet was revealed by the New York Times in early September. On some level, the efforts aren’t surprising. Any national security-minded outfit focused on intelligence would certainly prioritize cracking cryptic communication. However, the Agency had taken the operation much further, attacking the schemes that protect medical records, banking transactions, and everyday communications on the Web.\n\nPerhaps the most notable aspect of the leaked program, known as Bullrun, is that the agency spent billions in the past decade to insert backdoors into the world’s encryption schemes. Essentially, the agency helped sew deliberate weaknesses into the techniques that protect the most sensitive and personal communications online. One might argue that as long as the agency is the only outfit with access to these holes, there is little to worry about. Regardless of your opinion on that notion, many programmers have pointed out that theoretically, anyone can access these encryption loopholes. In other words, in its mission creep, the agency has made Internet encryption fundamentally weaker and more vulnerable to attack by malicious third-party hackers.\n\n6) Parallel construction: NSA shares data with the DEA\n\nIn early August, the only leak on this list not to come from Edward Snowden was revealed by Reuters. According to anonymous sources and documents reviewed by the news agency, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency uses data obtained by the NSA to investigate domestic drug cases which are out of the jurisdiction of the spy agency.\n\nThe leak was problematic because the U.S. government had, up until August, argued that while Americans’ information may have been swept up in the NSA’s various collection programs, it was not put to use because this would be a violation of citizens’ Fourth Amendment rights to privacy. Counter to this claim, the Reuters story revealed that in fact the agency did share its information with domestic law enforcement agents. In short, that opened up the door for data illegally obtained under the justification of national security to be used in domestic criminal trials. It was later revealed that NSA data was also shared with the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation called this leak “one of the biggest dangers of the surveillance state.” Not only was the DEA using NSA data to prosecute citizens, but it was doing so in secret. Through a method disclosed by Reuters known as parallel construction, DEA agents arrest criminals identified through NSA data but then report that they came across the criminal activity through other means than surveillance. The logic here is that the use of NSA data must be hidden or it would jeopardize the effectiveness of surveillance programs abroad. The end result, however, is that one could find themselves on trial based on evidence that was illegal obtained by the NSA and neither they, nor their lawyer nor the judge would ever know it. The constitutionality of this parallel construction is an open question.\n\n7) The U.S. shares raw intelligence collected on Americans with Israel\n\nWhen the Guardian revealed that U.S. shares raw signals intelligence on its citizens with Israel, the leak was comparatively ignored by the media. For this reason alone, it earns a spot on this list. The leak revealed that, according to a five-page document viewed by the Guardian, the NSA shares “unevaluated and unminimized transcripts, gists, facsimiles, telex, voice and Digital Network Intelligence metadata and content” of Americans’ communications.\n\nWhile the document urged that the Israeli government respect the constitutionally guaranteed privacy rights of U.S. citizens, it appears to take no provision to ensure such urgings are heeded. In fact, it goes so far as to state, “This agreement is not intended to create any legally enforceable rights and shall not be construed to be either an international agreement or a legally binding instrument according to international law.” Further, provided the Israeli government conceal the identity of particular U.S. persons, it is free to circulate the NSA data. In sum, Americans’ private data, questionably obtained, is passed on to Israel with no enforcable restrictions on the use of that information.\n\n8) NSA spied on U.N. video conferences\n\nIn August, Der Spiegel revealed that the U.S. spied on U.N. video conferences, decrypting some 450 conversations between international diplomats in the summer of 2012 alone. By any measure of scope, in comparison to most of the other surveillance leaks, this one is relatively minor. However, several factors make this revelation stand out: First, the surveillance runs counter to international law. Specifically, it violates the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which bars member states from spying on one another during diplomatic missions. The reason for this law is that diplomatic missions are held sacred, as they are gestures toward peaceful resolutions between countries. By spying on the U.N., the NSA undermines this sanctity.\n\nThe leak also lead to the Obama administration’s suspension of U.N. surveillance in October. While Snowden’s files had up to this point provoked much international conversation about the boundaries of spying, this was one of the first instances where surveillance activites were actually suspended.\n\nIt should be noted that the leak revealed that diplomatic spying was not simply a U.S. problem. China too was engaged in similar activities, which gave credence to the NSA’s claims that its practices were not out of character with those of other countries.\n\n9) NSA tapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s private cellphone\n\nWhen it was revealed in October that the NSA tapped into German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s private cellphone, the story received top billing from media outlets around the world. It is included here not for its significance but for the questions it raised about whether or not the spying it revealed warranted the popular outrage that greeted it.\n\nUnlike many of the leaks that showed how the U.S., U.K., Germany, Canada, and other nations spied on citizens of the world, particularly through the Internet, this leak was a case of one superpower spying on another’s leader. The outrage surrounding the leak suggested that the world (or at least the media) had decided that state-sponsored spying of any form was no longer acceptable. Short of this view, the tapping of Merkel’s phone certainly seems within the jurisdiction of an national security surveillance outfit. In the end, the reaction to the leak raises more questions than answered: Are we striving for a world where all surveillance of any form should be outlawed? Is Merkel’s anger at the U.S. justified or is Germany engaged in similar spying?\n\n10) The Black Budget: How much the U.S. spends on spying\n\nThe list ends with a relatively straightforward revelation from the Washington Post: The U.S. spent $52.6 billion across 16 spy agencies and more than 100,000 employees in the fiscal year 2013. The NSA alone spent more than $10 billion in 2013, a 53 percent increase from 2004. Here’s how that money was spent:\n\nFurther, the report revealed that the government has put half a trillion dollars into intelligence collection and surveillance since the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. The massive injection of funds reflects the fundamental ideological shift that occurred inside the NSA after 9/11. As Thomas Drake, a former NSA senior executive who blew the whistle on the agency in 2006 told the Daily Dot that after the attacks the NSA’s priority became “to own the Internet.” The black budget reflects this decision.\n\n•••\n\nIn his testimony before E.U.’s investigatory committee in mid December, Greenwald commented that, after viewing the trove of top secret documents leaked this year by Snowden, he was convinced that the NSA’s goal was the “elimination of privacy worldwide.” This, he assured the committee, was not hyperbole but a “literal description of what the NSA and its closest surveillance partners are attempting to achieve.” He went on to add that the philosophy of collecting everything was “repeatedly said in their private documents.”\n\nWhile the vast majority of these documents will no doubt never be viewed by the public, the sentiment of the agency that created them has been fleshed out throughout 2013, and a clear picture of the world’s most powerful Internet surveillance outfit has begun to emerge.\n\nBack when the NSA leaks started, in early June 2013, Snowden told Greenwald, “I’m just another guy who sits there day to day in the office, watches what’s happening and goes, ‘This is something that’s not our place to decide, the public needs to decide whether these programs and policies are right or wrong.’ And I’m willing to go on the record to defend the authenticity of them and say, ‘I didn’t change these, I didn’t modify the story. This is the truth; this is what’s happening. You should decide whether we need to be doing this.’ “\n\nWhat we’ll ultimately decide remains to be seen—a different story for another year.\n\nIllustration by Jason Reed",
  "latent_18258": "A funny thing happened on the way to the endangered species list.\n\nFive years ago the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) petitioned to protect an Appalachian crayfish species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. This week the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) concurred and agreed that the Big Sandy crayfish of Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia probably deserves that protection.\n\nBut the CBD actually got more than they asked for. Shortly after they submitted their petition new evidence emerged that the Big Sandy crayfish is actually two different species.\n\nOh yeah, and they’re both endangered. And the FWS is proposing to protect them both.\n\nHere’s what happened. What is now called the Big Sandy crayfish was first described 101 years ago from a specimen collected in West Virginia’s Upper Guyandotte Basin. Scientists renamed and re-described the crayfish a few times over the years but by 1969 they finally settled on the taxonomic name of Cambarus veteranus.\n\nFlash forward to 1989. That’s when C. veteranus was also located in the tributaries of the Big Sandy Basin, which includes all three states. It was only then that the name Big Sandy crayfish was attached to the taxonomic name.\n\nBut wait, there’s more. In 2011 researchers conducted genetic tests on the crayfishes in the Upper Guyandotte and Big Sandy basins. The crayfish in Big Sandy not only had different DNA, they also had at least four major morphological differences from the crays in Guyandotte.\n\nAnd so we ended up with two species. The crayfish in Big Sandy got a new taxonomic designation (C. callainus) while keeping the common name. The newly discovered species was dubbed the Guyandotte River crayfish, and retained the old C. veteranus designation in deference to the original 1914 samples.\n\nOkay, so now that we have two species instead of one, something else has emerged. The Big Sandy crayfish is probably endangered but the Guyandotte River crayfish is likely critically endangered—it only exists at a single site in West Virginia.\n\nWhat’s killing these little guys off? Well, the CBD places the blame pretty heavily on pollution from mountaintop-removal coal mining. In a prepared statement CBD senior scientist Tierra Curry called the proposal to protect the two crayfishes “historic,” noting that “these are the first species to be proposed for protection under the Endangered Species Act because of harm caused by mountaintop-removal coal mining.”\n\nFWS considers the threats to be a bit broader. They agree that coal mining is a major threat—the shell of the crayfish in the photo accompanying this article is embedded with manganese and iron from coal-mining runoff—but they also cite ongoing erosion and sedimentation in the crayfish streams. They link these problems to the timber industry in the first half of the last century and ongoing development today.\n\nIt’s not just crayfishes that have suffered in the process. FWS cites numerous state agency reports that found the waterways in which the crayfishes swim violate all kinds of water safety and health standards—they contain feces, bacteria, selenium, Escherichia coli and chemical contaminants. At least one stream contains fishes that aren’t safe for human consumption, and you probably wouldn’t want to swim in all that many others. The reports link all of this to coal mining, urban runoff and related factors.\n\nWater quality in particular seems to be correlated with the crash in Guyandotte River crayfish populations over the past few years. In addition to pollution the river had also been highly channelized, making it easier for boats to pass through by removing the boulders and other large rocks under which crayfish like to hide.\n\nIn a prepared statement, FWS Southeast Regional Director Cindy Dohner said “we are concerned about the future of both species. We base our decisions on the best available science, so we are asking people who may have information about the condition of these crayfishes to contact us to help us make the right decision about their status.”\n\nFWS will now collect data and comments from the public through June 8, after which they will make a final decision on the fate of these two crayfishes. Hopefully the final results won’t contain any additional surprises.\n\nPhoto: Zachary Loughman, West Liberty University, courtesy of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service",

However, it’s been proved time and again that people who cook at home tend to consume fewer calories, fewer carbohydrates, less sugar and less fat, than those who cook less or don’t cook at all.\n\nCookpad is on a very similar mission here in India – to improve people’s lives by making everyday home cooking more fun. Cookpad provides a free online recipe-sharing platform open to everybody, worldwide. You can search for recipes published by users near you, share recipes with friends and family, chat about cooking in real-time and share questions or advice with your loved ones.\n\nCookpad Inc. is the world’s largest online recipe-sharing platform. Though it is relatively new to India (started December 2016), Cookpad began in 1998 in Japan. In 2014, Cookpad went global and today hosts over 2.5 million homemade recipes available in Japanese, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Indonesian, Arabic, Vietnamese and is adding new languages and countries on a regular basis. The company went public in 2009 and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\n\nCookpad global head Tomoya Yasuda took time out from his busy schedule to talk to TNM on a range of issues including how the company began, its objectives in entering the Indian market and its growth prospects.\n\nWhat is Cookpad all about and how did it start?\n\nCookpad started 20 years ago with a mission of making every day cooking fun. We believe that by making everyday cooking fun, we can positively impact people’s lives because if you cook every day at home, you will naturally eat healthier and also you will understand where the ingredients come from. Naturally, you will be aware of the food security issues, environmental issues. So that’s the reason why we set up the company.\n\nAt the moment, we have one product which is a recipe sharing community online. By now, audience wise, we have roughly 90 million monthly unique users globally - roughly 60 million in Japan and 30 million internationally.\n\nWe went global almost four years back. We are now present in 18 countries, including India, Spain, Lebanon, Indonesia, Hungary, Russia, Greece and many other countries. Now our global headquarters has been set up in Bristol, UK last year.\n\nWhen did you begin and how did the concept come about?\n\nWe started in 1998 and the founder was Aki Sano, who was a software engineer. He wanted to help local farmers to sell their produce. A farmer was selling the vegetables but he identified that in peak season, there is so much excess produce that the farmer cannot sell all of it. He identified that the farmers have knowledge to eat the food in the best way because they know the recipe while the consumer doesn’t know how to eat it in the best manner. So, he could see the gap and that’s how he started the recipe sharing platform for sharing knowledge.\n\nSo, how does the concept work?\n\nIt’s all user-generated content. It’s a recipe format. We provide the simplest platform which is available out there to create any recipes for e.g. chicken tikka. So, you add a title, add ingredients and then how to make it. It’s as simple as that. Users have to sign up and write the recipe.\n\nOnce the recipe is there on the website, the recipe becomes available not only to them but others also since they are stored in a digital format. We have seen housewives scribbling notes, referring to recipe books and trying to remember the steps for a particular recipe. But we provide them with a digital platform to store recipes forever. It always helps if you store in digital form because you can pass on to the next generation. So that’s the trend which we are seeing.\n\nYour intention of entering the Indian market?\n\nOne of our mid-term goals as per our five-year plan till 2021, is to be number one in 100 countries. This is one very important KPI (key performance indicator) but at the same time India is one of the most important markets for us which we have not invested in yet. So, it’s still very early stages, I would say in India. And this time I am here to discuss how efficiently or how impactful we can be, by entering into this market together with the current members here in Bengaluru as well as the operations crew globally.\n\nOur goal is to capture as diverse recipes as possible. So, we want to cover as many regions as possible in India. Basically, what we see globally is that we aim for local people because every recipe is user generated. So sometimes, the knowledge or expertise of home cooks doesn’t get appreciated by other people whereas on our platform, their knowledge or expertise will be appreciated not just within the country but outside as well. This is something we want to encourage more.\n\nAre you working with the government in any way?\n\nNot as of now, but probably if there is an interesting opportunity where the mission of the company and the government’s mission align, then we may enter into a partnership. At the moment, our mission is to make everyday cooking fun.\n\nThe goal is by making everyday cooking fun, we want to raise awareness of the food security, food scarcity, environmental or healthcare issues. So, I think naturally, one day we might be able to work with those authorities.\n\nIn order to make everyday cooking fun, you need to have fresh products, great ingredients which inspire to create something new. To make that happen, is something we are inclined to, as a market.\n\nDo you have any CSR initiatives?\n\nNo, but we may enter depending on the alignment of mission objectives. The company follows a certain mission and if it aligns with what CSR brings in, probably we will do something.\n\nWhat kind of growth are you looking at in the Indian market?\n\nIn terms of growth, we definitely want to be the largest cooking community in India, that is our ultimate target. We started in December 2016 and the numbers are pretty encouraging. The Q-o-Q (quarter-on-quarter) growth in terms of user signups and addition of recipes has been more than 100%. Even the traffic is increasing at a commensurate rate but we want to get into more regional languages.\n\nThe growth numbers are very small at the moment. As I said, we have not invested in the Indian market yet. We just migrated the different platform into the new platform. So, we hope to make growth but our KPI is not just in the growth of the users. We want more people to cook, that’s what we are striving for.\n\nLooking at India, I think the maximum growth can come from the number of households there are. We believe that there should be at least one recipe per household per year. So that’s something we would like to capture as fast as possible.\n\nWhich are you biggest markets, outside of Japan?\n\nAt the moment, our largest market overseas is Indonesia followed by Spain and Spanish speaking countries like Argentina, Spain, Chile. We are also big in Arabic speaking countries like Saudi Arabia.\n\nWho are your competitors?\n\nGlobally speaking, there are many small recipe-sharing websites or applications but we don’t see it as competition. May be, there are other platforms where people can easily share their knowledge but on a specific agenda, we do not see any competition.\n\nWe focus on building the local communities in cities across India. There is no single application or platform which focusses on this particular target group i.e. housewives, home cooks. So, we are going to give a chance to every food enthusiast to come and share their creation and get learning as well as share their knowledge with the community.\n\nWhat is your revenue model?\n\nCurrently, India business is not focussed on revenue and monetisation. The revenue model in Japan is more stabilised. So, we currently generate profit only from Japan. Internationally speaking, we don’t have any monetising at all. We still believe that building a community or building a platform is first priority. We invest a lot on that aspect and once it becomes a solid community, only then we think of monetising.\n\nBack in Japan, we have two revenue sources. One is the subscription business where 60% of the revenue comes from the users while 40% of revenue comes from advertisements.\n\nWe are experimenting the subscription business in Indonesia and Spain a little bit.\n\nHow big an opportunity does India represent?\n\nIndia represents a big opportunity for Cookpad and its a complex market. This is because recipes are more local here unlike other countries and cuisines are different. Say for example Gujarat vs Bengal, the recipes, the kind of food they eat, the kind of ingredients they use is completely different.\n\nSo, India in itself is a very big, diverse market and it will take time to grow. That’s why the focus has been on building the local communities. We want local communities in every city.\n\nAnd, it’s about building those local communities and then all of them converging to make India most diverse in terms of the quality as well as variety of recipes.\n\nThe largest influx of users has in fact been seen from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. For example, places like Dehradun, Allahabad, there are housewives, home cooks who are really passionate about cooking.\n\nWhat is your prime agenda in India?\n\nThe current biggest agenda for us in India is to find talent. We are looking for talent. To make the initiatives happen all across the country, we need people. And it’s not just number of people, we need top-notch talents. We would like to hire as many as possible to make it happen at the fastest pace.\n\nWe see huge growth in this market. To capture the diversity in the market, we need a range of people like engineers. We need talents to manage leadership, those are the people we are specifically looking for. That’s the first step for us and then building a team, building a community and eventually a business.\n\nYour future plans?\n\nAs of now, the platform is available only in English. So next immediate target is to launch in Hindi and to target a major segment in North India which is comfortable in the local language. Hindi will not suffice, so we have three other languages in the pipeline but for each language, the timelines have been scattered till 2018.\n\n(If you have a recipe in mind which you wish to share, just visit https://cookpad.com/in.)",

This remains a core strategy of IS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, who refers to Saudi Arabia as Wilayat al Haramayn, or Province of the Two Holy Places, a reference to the Islamic holy sites of Mecca and Medina.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia has religious significance for al Baghdadi's pretensions to rule over the Islamic caliphate,\" Philip Stack, principal analyst for the Middle East and North Africa at Verisk Maplecroft, a global risk analytics firm, told VICE News. \"[He] claimed jurisdiction over what he termed Wilayat al Haramayn in November 2014, [asserting] his direction over jihadists in Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nThis would not be the first time Saudi Arabia has had to combat a domestic jihadist uprising. In 1979, militants seized the Grand Mosque of Mecca, calling for the overthrow of the Saudi government. More recently, and coinciding with the invasion of Iraq by US forces in 2003, al Qaeda launched a violent three-year insurrection that targeted security forces, Westerners, and government officials.\n\nSaudi Arabia's security services were eventually able to defeat the al Qaeda-led insurgency through a mixture of innovative counter-terrorism operations, such as printing the names of al Qaeda operatives in the press, and trying to rehabilitate jihadists through extensive religious re-education.\n\nWatch the VICE News Documentary: Escape to the Islamic State\n\nBut IS isn't al Qaeda, and the number of Saudis now involved with IS and the resources available to them — in terms of both financing and personal appeal — has exceeded anything that was ever available to al Qaeda. The presence of IS across the border in Iraq, and to a lesser degree in Yemen, is also posing a unique challenge in containing the spread of extremism within Saudi Arabia.\n\nAnd even though the objective of overthrowing the Saudi government has remained the same, the strategies being used by IS are evolving. They are now focused on the same kinds of sectarian attacks being used in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen — such as the targeting of Shia mosques.\n\n\"In Saudi, IS is most certainly in the beginning of the first stage: spite and burnout,\" Ghaidaa Hetou, of i-Strategic, a political risk consulting firm, told VICE News, referring to one of the two stages of IS's operational doctrine. \"In this stage, one particular incident of [terror] will not capture a specific aim, but the aggregate of several incidents … will gradually, in their view, lead to a collapse of the system.\"\n\nBy engaging in these kinds of sectarian attacks, IS conforms to a well-known approach, one that will attempt to drive a wedge between the people they are attacking and the government that is supposed to protect them. By doing so, IS hopes to promote instability within Saudi Arabia by making the government appear weak and ineffectual.\n\nAnd given the scope of the arrest operation on July 18, there is clearly a widening apprehension over IS penetration within Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"The support for IS is rising in [Saudi Arabia],\" Hetou said.\n\nThis support originates from more than just social and political conditions, however, and is far more troublesome for long-term stability. Core tenets of the IS belief system, which include a hatred of Shia and executions for apostasy and adultery, all originate with Wahhabi religious teachings that have legitimized the Saudi government. More specifically, IS has taken the idea that apostates and heretics should be killed and combined that with the notion that just about any devout Muslim can deem someone else insufficiently pure or Islamic, and therefore apostate, and therefore subject to on-the-spot execution.\n\nFor people who have received their religious indoctrination in these Saudi schools and mosques, the next step into the extreme doctrines embraced by IS is not a huge one.\n\nThis has put the Saudi government in a precarious position.\n\n\"You look at the core tenets of Wahhabism and you look at the core tenets that have been espoused by IS and they are exactly the same,\" Akhil Shah, a counterterrorism and foreign policy analyst at the Institute for Gulf Affairs, told VICE News. \"Groups like the Islamic State give young Saudis an identity. It takes place within the same ecosystem, ideology, and religious outlook.\"\n\nTherefore, to fully undermine the ideological basis of IS, the Saudi religious establishment would have to subvert the doctrines that are nearly identical to those that support their own authority. Thus, theologically undermining IS risks undermining the legitimacy of the entire Saudi government.\n\nThis has left the Saudis with only a few options, such as reconciling with the minority Shia population or limiting the influence of religious ideologies that might resemble those of IS. Both of these choices inevitably support the narrative of IS, who claim that the Saudi government is not only corrupt, but also religiously compromised.\n\nRelated: The Only Thing Iraq's Sunnis and Shias Hate More Than Each Other Is the Islamic State\n\n\"They [IS] are revisionists with a clear political aim,\"Hetou said. \"They are motivated to 'correct the humiliating past … on the hands of the infidels and their puppets.' The Saudi authority is regarded as an American puppet.\"\n\nFor some in Saudi Arabia, this is all the incentive needed to seek out and support IS.\n\nThe circumstances required for IS to thrive in Saudi Arabia are currently sub-optimal. IS tends to mature in ungoverned spaces and failed states like Syria, Iraq, and Yemen, and the Saudi government is far from collapse. Nevertheless, for IS's vision of the caliphate to become fully realized, IS must be seen struggling for control of the spiritual capital of Islam, or the Wilayat al Haramayn. This means the terrorism and insurgency that is currently plaguing the Middle East is far from over in Saudi Arabia.\n\nFollow Landon Shroder on Twitter: @LandonShroder",
  "latent_18694": "Creating a Movie Database Application¶\n\nIn this tutorial we will create a fully functional movie database application with Camelot. We assume Camelot is properly installed. An all in one installer for Windows is available as an SDK to develop Camelot applications (Python SDK).\n\nSetup Spyder¶ In this section, we will explain how to setup the Spyder IDE for developing a Camelot project. If you are not using Spyder, you can skip this and jump to the next section. Start ‣ All Programs ‣ Python SDK ‣ Spyder Within Spyder, open the Project Explorer : View ‣ Windows and toolbars ‣ Project explorer In the Project Explorer change the workspace directory, to the directory where you want to put your Camelot Projects. Next, still in the Project Explorer, right click to create a new project using : New Project Enter Videostore as the project name.\n\nStarting a new Camelot project¶ We begin with the creation of a new Camelot project, using the camelot_admin tool : Start ‣ All Programs ‣ Python SDK ‣ New Camelot Application Note From the command prompt (or shell), go to the directory in which the new project should be created. Type the following command: python -m camelot.bin.camelot_admin A dialog appears where the basic information of the application can be filled in. Select the newly created Videostore directory as the location of the source code. Press OK to generate the source code of the project. The source code should now appear in the selected directory.\n\nMain Window and Views¶ To run the application, double click on the main.py file in Spyder, which contains the entry point of your Camelot application and run this file. Run ‣ Run ‣ Ok Note From the command prompt, simply start the script python main.py your Qt GUI should look like the one we show in the picture below: The application has a customizable menu and toolbar, a left navigation pane, and a central area, where default the Home tab is opened, on which nothing is currently displayed. The navigation pane has its first section expanded. The navigation pane uses Sections to group Actions . Each button in the navigation pane represents a Section , and each entry of the navigation tree is an Action . Most standard Actions open a single table view of an Entity in a new tab. Notice that the application disables most of the menus and the toolbar buttons. When we open a table view, more options become available. Entities are opened in the active tab, unless they are opened by selecting Open in New Tab from the context menu (right click) of the entity link, which will obviously open a new tab to right. Tabs can be closed by clicking the X in the tab itself. Each row is a record with some fields that we can edit (others might not be editable). Let’s now add a new row by clicking on the new icon (icon farthest the the left in the toolbar above the navigation pane). We now see a new window, containing a form view with additional fields. Forms label required fields in bold. Fill in a first and last name, and close the form. Camelot will automatically validate and echo the changes to the database. We can reopen the form by clicking on the blue folder icon in the first column of each row of the table. Notice also that there is now an entry in our table. That’s it for basic usages of the interface. Next we will write code for our database model.\n\nCreating the Movie Model¶ Let’s first take a look at the main.py in our project directory. It contains a my_settings object which is appended to the global settings . The Global settings object contains the global configuration for things such as database and file location. class MySettings ( SimpleSettings ): # add an ENGINE or a CAMELOT_MEDIA_ROOT method here to connect # to another database or change the location where files are stored # # def ENGINE( self ): # from sqlalchemy import create_engine # return create_engine( 'postgresql://user:passwd@127.0.0.1/database' ) def setup_model ( self ): \"\"\"This function will be called at application startup, it is used to setup the model\"\"\" from camelot.core.sql import metadata from camelot.core.orm import setup_all metadata . bind = self . ENGINE () import camelot.model.authentication import camelot.model.i18n import camelot.model.memento import myapplication.model setup_all () metadata . create_all () my_settings = MySettings ( 'My Company' , 'My Application' ) settings . append ( my_settings ) Now we can look at model.py . Camelot has already imported some classes for us. They are used to create our entities. Let’s say we want a movie entity with a title , a short description , a release date , and a genre . The aforementioned specifications translate into the following Python code, that we add to our model.py module: from sqlalchemy import Unicode , Date from sqlalchemy.schema import Column from camelot.core.orm import Entity from camelot.admin.entity_admin import EntityAdmin class Movie ( Entity ): __tablename__ = 'movie' title = Column ( Unicode ( 60 ), nullable = False ) short_description = Column ( Unicode ( 512 ) ) release_date = Column ( Date () ) genre = Column ( Unicode ( 15 ) ) Note The complete source code of this tutorial can be found in the camelot_example folder of the Camelot source code. Movie inherits camelot.core.orm.Entity , which is the declarative base class for all objects that should be stored in the database. We use the __tablename__ attribute to to name the table ourselves in which the data will be stored, otherwise a default tablename would have been used. Our entity holds four fields that are stored in columns in the table. title = Column ( Unicode ( 60 ), nullable = False ) title holds up to 60 unicode characters, and cannot be left empty: short_description = Column ( Unicode ( 512 ) ) short_description can hold up to 512 characters: release_date = Column ( Date () ) genre = Column ( Unicode ( 15 ) ) release_date holds a date, and genre up to 15 unicode characters: For more information about defining models, refer to the SQLAlchemy Declarative extension. The different SQLAlchemy column types used are described here. Finally, custom Camelot fields are documented in the section camelot-column-types. Let’s now create an EntityAdmin subclass\n\nThe EntityAdmin Subclass¶ We have to tell Camelot about our entities, so they show up in the GUI . This is one of the purposes of camelot.admin.entity_admin.EntityAdmin subclasses. After adding the EntityAdmin subclass, our Movie class now looks like this: class Movie ( Entity ): __tablename__ = 'movie' title = Column ( Unicode ( 60 ), nullable = False ) short_description = Column ( Unicode ( 512 ) ) release_date = Column ( Date () ) genre = Column ( Unicode ( 15 ) ) def __unicode__ ( self ): return self . title or 'Untitled movie' class Admin ( EntityAdmin ): verbose_name = 'Movie' list_display = [ 'title' , 'short_description' , 'release_date' , 'genre' ] We made Admin an inner class to strengthen the link between it and the Entity subclass. Camelot does not force us. Assign your EntityAdmin class to the Admin Entity member to put it somewhere else. verbose_name will be the label used in navigation trees. The last attribute is interesting; it holds a list containing the fields we have defined above. As the name suggests, list_display tells Camelot to only show the fields specified in the list. list_display fields are also taken as the default fields to show on a form. In our case we want to display four fields: title , short_description , release_date , and genre (that is, all of them.) The fields displayed on the form can optionally be specified too in the form_display attribute. We also add a __unicode__() method that will return either the title of the movie entity or 'Untitled movie' if title is empty. The __unicode__() method will be called in case Camelot needs a textual representation of an object, such as in a window title. Let’s move onto the last piece of the puzzle.\n\nConfiguring the Application¶ We are now working with application_admin.py . One of the tasks of application_admin.py is to specify the sections in the left pane of the main window. The created application has a class, MyApplicationAdmin . This class is a subclass of camelot.admin.application_admin.ApplicationAdmin , which is used to control the overall look and feel of every Camelot application. To change sections in the left pane of the main window, simply overwrite the get_sections method, to return a list of the desired sections. By default this method contains: def get_sections ( self ): from camelot.model.memento import Memento from camelot.model.i18n import Translation return [ Section ( _ ( 'My classes' ), self , Icon ( 'tango/22x22/apps/system-users.png' ), items = [] ), Section ( _ ( 'Configuration' ), self , Icon ( 'tango/22x22/categories/preferences-system.png' ), items = [ Memento , Translation ] ) ] which will display two buttons in the navigation pane, labelled 'My classes' and 'Configurations' , with the specified icon next to each label. And yes, the order matters. We need to add a new section for our Movie entity, this is done by extending the list of sections returned by the get_sections method with a Movie section: from videostore.model import Movie return [ Section ( _ ( 'Movie' ), self , Icon ( 'tango/22x22/apps/system-users.png' ), items = [ Movie ] ), Section ( _ ( 'Configuration' ), self , Icon ( 'tango/22x22/categories/preferences-system.png' ), items = [ Memento , Translation ] ) ] The constructor of a section object takes the name of the section, a reference to the application admin object, the icon to be used and the items in the section. The items is a list of the entities for which a table view should shown. Camelot comes with the Tango icon collection; we use a suitable icon for our movie section. We can now try our application. We see a new button the navigation pane labelled ‘Movies’ . Clicking on it fills the navigation tree with the only entity in the movies’s section. Clicking on this tree entry opens the table view. And if we click on the blue folder of each record, a form view appears as shown below. That’s it for the basics of defining an entity and setting it for display in Camelot. Next we look at relationships between entities.",
  "latent_18965": "North Korea carried out a sixth nuclear test on Sunday morning, triggering a 5.7 magnitude tremor in the northeast of the country, which the rogue state claimed was caused by the detonation of a hydrogen bomb that could be fitted to a ballistic missile.\n\nAlthough such claims should be treated with caution, as the regime also bragged that its fifth test in September 2016 was a hydrogen bomb — an assertion largely dismissed by experts — Sunday’s estimated 120 kiloton explosion is around ten times the magnitude of its previous test, and clearly shows the Kim Jong Un regime’s technical capabilities are advancing.\n\n“If it’s a hydrogen bomb, it’s a very small one,” says Ryan Barenklau, the CEO of Washington, D.C.–based think-tank Strategic Sentinel.\n\nIn a tweet, U.S. President Donald Trump condemned the test: “North Korea has conducted a major nuclear test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.”\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nNorth Korea’s state media confirmed the test, which it hailed as a “perfect success,” just an hour before Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered his keynote speech to world leaders the opening of a BRICS summit in China’s southern city of Xiamen. Xi did not mention the test in his speech, though China’s Foreign Ministry released a statement that “strongly condemned” it. Tremors were felt as far away as the Chinese city of Changchun, some 250 miles north-west of North Korea’s Punggye-ri test site.\n\nNorth Korea typically times missile and nuclear tests to coincide with important holidays and events in China in a sign of fraying relations between the historic allies. China remains North Korea’s largest trading partner though its government is increasingly perturbed by Kim’s relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons and has signed onto stiff new U.N. sanctions.\n\n“The timing is a slap to China,” says Barenklau. “North Korea is saying that it doesn’t care what China thinks or does.”\n\nDespite the international pressure, missile and nuclear tests have continued unabated. North Korea is intent on developing a nuclear-armed ballistic missile capable of reaching the continental U.S., and recent missile launches indicate it is close to that goal. The regime is believed to have more than a dozen nuclear weapons, and on Sunday morning before the test released pictures of Kim examining what appeared to be a miniaturized nuclear weapon capable of fitting on a ballistic missile.\n\n“It shows that the state has the long-term will and determination to do it despite the costs,” says Daniel Pinkston, a Korea expert at Troy University in South Korea, referring to the sanctions. “But the North Korean people pay a very high price for this.”\n\nSouth Korea immediately convened a national security council meeting after the test, which U.S. seismologists say was recorded at a depth of six miles (10 km). China’s Earthquake Administration said the quake was caused by a “suspected explosion.” Yukiya Amano, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, called the test “a matter of grave concern.”\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry released a statement condemning the test, and calling on “all interested parties to immediately return to dialogue and negotiations as the only possible way for an overall settlement of the problems of the Korean peninsula.” Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the test “absolutely unacceptable.”\n\nDuring an emergency telephone call after the test, U.S. national security adviser HR McMaster reassured his Japanese counterpart, Shotarou Taniuchi, the director-general of the Japanese national security council, that Washington was steadfastly committed to defending Japan — including with its nuclear deterrent.\n\nSunday’s test is another headache for Trump, who has made disarming North Korea of its nuclear arsenal a foreign policy priority. Trump said that “all options remain on the table” after North Korea fired a missile over Japan last week, though military strikes would be a last resort given that U.S. allies South Korea and Japan could be devastated by North Korea’s conventional and possibly also nuclear retaliation.\n\nTrump has therefore resorted to pressurizing China to tighten financial restrictions on North Korea, like former President Barack Obama did before him. In a tweet, Trump said: “North Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success.”\n\nHowever, analysts say Beijing will never squeeze so hard as to foment the collapse of the regime, fearful of an influx of refugees and a unified, U.S.-allied Korean peninsular ruled from Seoul, possibly putting American troops on its doorstep.\n\nOn Friday, Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to ramp up U.S. missile defenses in South Korea, where one American THAAD anti-missile battery is currently deployed. China is vehemently opposed to THAAD, believing its exceptional surveillance capabilities pose a security threat, and has targeted South Korean businesses in response.\n\nWrite to Charlie Campbell at charlie.campbell@time.com.",

  "latent_19445": "An ad by a political action committee supporting Hillary Clinton spotlights Donald Trump’s comments on deporting undocumented immigrant families.\n\nThe ad, launched by Priorities USA Action on Sept. 28, is narrated in Spanish and includes snippets of media interviews in which the Republican presidential candidate firmly said he would deport people in the country illegally.\n\nIt starts with Trump’s voice saying \"this is a country where we speak English, not Spanish\" over an image of a woman and two children sitting at a dining table.\n\n\"Donald Trump wants to see us disappear,\" a female voice says in Spanish. It then cuts to a November 2015 MSNBC interview where Trump said \"you are going to have a deportation force.\"\n\n\"Trump will capture and deport millions, even our Dreamers,\" the narrator says in Spanish as images of a family and what appears to be a student fade away.\n\nTrump has not been consistent on his deportation plans. But in his immigration speech in Arizona on Aug. 31, Trump emphasized deportation priorities and the removal of \"at least 2 million\" \"criminal aliens.\"\n\nHe also said those who are here illegally and want lawful status, \"will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry.\"\n\nThere’s an estimated 11 million people living illegally in the United States.\n\nFor this fact-check, we focused on whether or not Trump wants to deport people in the country illegally who arrived in the United States as children, a subset of the undocumented population referred to as Dreamers.\n\nWho are Dreamers?\n\n\"Dreamers\" is a term used by advocates for potential beneficiaries of the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, or the DREAM Act, which has stalled in Congress.\n\nPresident Barack Obama’s administration in 2012 announced a program to help this group of undocumented immigrants, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It allowed those who met certain guidelines to apply for work permits and for deportation reprieve for two years, subject to renewal.\n\nPew Research Center in 2012 estimated there were 4.4 million unauthorized immigrants ages 30 and under, and that up to 1.7 million were potentially eligible for DACA.\n\nData through June 2016 shows 741,546 individuals nationwide have been approved for DACA.\n\nObama in 2014 sought to offer deportation relief to more people through two more programs: an expanded version of DACA, and a new program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA.\n\nWhile the initial deferred-action program is still active, the expansions are on hold after a Supreme Court deadlock. About 5 million people might be eligible for the halted initiatives, or just less than half of the nation’s undocumented population.\n\nTrump’s position\n\nTrump would \"immediately terminate President Obama’s two illegal executive amnesties,\" according to his 10-point immigration plan.\n\n(Neither program granted citizenship, but deferred deportation and allowed immigrants to apply for permission to work.)\n\nTrump’s plan says his administration would enforce all immigration laws and set priorities — including the removal of criminals, gang members and visa overstays.\n\n\"Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation — that is what it means to have laws and to have a country,\" his plan says.\n\nIt is not clear if Trump would cancel the existing deferred-action program or just not issue any new ones, said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors stricter immigration policies.\n\nToward the end of his immigration speech, Trump also said that after building a wall, ending illegal immigration, and accomplishing enforcement and deportation goals, \"then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.\"\n\nPriorities USA led us to a July 2015 CNN interview between Trump and Dana Bash, where she asked him specifically whether or not he would deport Dreamers. Trump responded with a mixed message.\n\n\"It's a tough situation,\" Trump said. \"We're going to do something. And one of the things we're going to do is expedite. When somebody is terrific, we want them back here. They have to be legally.\"\n\nBash asked if they have to leave.\n\n\"They're with their parents. It depends. But look, it sounds cold, and it sounds hard,\" Trump said. \"We have a country. Our country is going to hell. We have to have a system where people are legally in our country.\"\n\nA Priorities spokesperson noted other media reports saying Trump would deport all immigrants in the country illegally, including Dreamers, that he would rescind Obama’s deferred action programs, and that undocumented immigrants seeking relief from Obama’s executive actions \"could expose themselves to Trump’s mass deportation plan.\"\n\nHypothetically, Trump could revoke the deferred action status of DACA recipients, which in turn would terminate their employment authorization and render them subject to removal, said Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, an immigration law expert and professor at Pennsylvania State University.\n\n\"However the biggest impediment to deporting this cohort of immigrants would be the resources it would take to apprehend, detain, charge, try and remove so-called Dreamers,\" Wadhia said. \"If he wanted to, he could target the vast majority of Dreamers for removal but it would not be easy or quick — it would likely take years to implement.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nA Priorities USA Action ad said, \"Trump wants to deport millions, even our Dreamers.\"\n\nTrump has made clear he would deport millions. More recently in the campaign, Trump said he would set priorities, starting with at least 2 million \"criminal aliens.\" He has given mixed messages on the timeline of deportations for people who don’t pose safety threats.\n\nTrump has also said he would terminate Obama administration programs that defer deportation for undocumented people who arrived in the United States as children. If that happens, Dreamers may be subject to deportation.\n\nIn interviews, Trump has been slightly more sympathetic to this group, calling their situation \"tough.\" At the same time, he has consistently said all immigrants here illegally will have to go, but \"terrific\" ones could have their return expedited.\n\nWe rate the ad’s statement Mostly True.",
  "latent_19558": "A sociology professor at Pennsylvania State University recently argued in an academic journal that eating meat perpetuates “patriarchy.”\n\nAccording to Campus Reform, Penn State Professor Anne DeLessio-Parson believes that “hegemonic masculinity implies an imperative to eat meat.” She argued just that in a recent academic article in the Journal of Feminist Geography.\n\nDeLessio-Parson came to this conclusion after interviewing 23 vegetarians in Argentina. She asked them how they cope with the country’s “meat-centric” culture and if they view vegetarianism itself as a political act.\n\n“The decision to become vegetarian does not itself destabilize gender, but the subsequent social interactions between vegetarian and meat-eater demand gender enactment — or resistance,” she explains in her article. “Refusing meat therefore presents opportunities, in each social interaction, for the binary to be called into question.” She suggests that such a decision to forego meat consumption in a social setting may be a political act of resistance against the gender binary.\n\nIn an interview with Campus Reform, DeLessio-Parson argued that vegetarianism is a mode of resistance for women against the patriarchy. “Women, one of the ways they push back against patriarchy, they say, ‘This is my body. You don’t get to tell me what comes in and out,’” she argued.\n\nShe echoed this sentiment in her article, writing that women can assert authority over their diets as a mean of claiming autonomy over their bodies. “Women, for example, assert authority over their diets; men embody rejection of the meat-masculinity nexus by adopting a worldview that also rejects sexism and racism,” she wrote. “I contend that in such a context, we cannot separate the ways people ‘do vegetarianism’ from how they ‘do gender.’ Doing vegetarianism in interactions drives social change, contributing to the de-linking of meat from gender hegemony and revealing the resisting and reworking of gender in food spaces.”\n\nDeLessio-Parson praised male vegetarians and argued that they seemed more open to acknowledging issues of sexism. Male vegetarians “seem more egalitarian and respectful,” she claimed.",

  "latent_19660": "(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nAfter Andre Burakovsky had stayed on the ice longer than his teammates, again informed he would be scratched for Monday night’s game against the Edmonton Oilers, Capitals Coach Barry Trotz had a talk with his 20-year-old winger.\n\n“He’s just got to clear his mind,” Trotz said. “He’s a young guy who’s thinking about a lot of things. I just talked to him about just worrying about his own game and not worrying about all the other stuff. He’s getting frustrated over things he doesn’t need to get frustrated over. He’s over-thinking things, and what he needs to do is just concentrate on his own game.”\n\nWith Stanislav Galiev having not played in an NHL game since the first week of the regular season, Trotz acknowledged that he needed to get him into the lineup. Burakovsky was surprised that he was the player forced out because he thought his play had started to turn around recently. But Trotz had pointed to his point production, or lack thereof: one point in his last 11 games.\n\nTrotz said Burakovsky’s press box visits will be limited, as he expects him to be in the lineup again “shortly.”\n\n“But I want him to do a couple things today and tomorrow to sort of get his head in the right spot,” Trotz said. “We had a good talk, and he should be ready to go. He’s a good player for us and he’s a long-term future player for us. We’re just going to make sure we do all of the right things, so he’s not taking a step back because we sort of plateaued here.”\n\nBurakovsky had five points in the first seven games, but then he endured an eight-game stretch without a point. In the midst of that, Trotz moved him up to the second line, gifting him with more minutes and more skilled linemates to snap out of the slump.\n\n“The one thing players, especially young players, don’t understand is that it is a privilege to play in the National Hockey League,” Trotz said. “It’s a privilege to be in the lineup. It’s not a right. Sometimes, they feel it’s a right, and I’m not saying Andre does, but I’m just saying young players do.”\n\nTrotz said he was happy with how Galiev played against the Colorado Avalanche on Saturday night, his first NHL game since Oct. 15, which is in part why he rewarded him with a second game.\n\n“I thought he was pretty productive,” Trotz said. “He had some good looks.

  "latent_19681": "The modern pentathlon is an Olympic sport that comprises five different events; fencing (one-touch épée), freestyle swimming (200m), equestrian show jumping (15 jumps), and a final combined event of pistol shooting and cross country running (3200m). This last event is now referred to as the laser-run, since it alternates four legs of laser pistol shooting followed by an 800m run (for 3200m in total). The event is inspired by the traditional pentathlon held during the ancient Olympics; as the original events were patterned on the skills needed by an ideal Greek soldier of the era, the modern pentathlon is similarly patterned on events representing the skills needed by cavalry behind enemy lines.\n\nThe sport has been a core sport of the Olympic Games since 1912 despite attempts to remove it.[1] A world championships for modern pentathlon has been held annually since 1949.\n\nOriginally the competition took place over four or five days; in 1996 a one-day format was adopted in an effort to be more audience-friendly.[2] Modern pentathlon, despite its long Olympic history, has had to justify its inclusion in the modern Olympic Games several times. On February 11, 2013 in Lausanne, the IOC confirmed modern pentathlon once again as one of the 25 core sports of the Olympic program through to 2020. The governing body, Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM), administers the international sport in more than 90 countries in all the continents of the world.[1]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nThe foundation of the modern pentathlon is disputed. On the one hand, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games, claimed authorship.[2] On the other hand, Viktor Balck, the President of the Organizing Committee for the 1912 Games, showed that he made use of the long tradition of Swedish military multi-sports events, to create a manageable modern pentathlon.[3]\n\nThe name derives from the Greek péntathlon \"contest of five events\".[2] The addition of modern to the name distinguishes it from the original pentathlon of the ancient Olympic Games, which consisted of the stadion foot race, wrestling, long jump, javelin, and discus. As the events of the ancient pentathlon were modeled after the skills of the ideal soldier to defend a castle of that time, Coubertin created the contest to simulate the experience of a 19th-century cavalry soldier behind enemy lines: he must ride an unfamiliar horse, fight enemies with pistol and sword, swim, and run to return to his own soldiers.[2] In the 1912 Games, with only officers competing, they were, however, permitted to use their own horses. Up to the 1952 Olympics the ordinary cavalry soldier was considered a professional athlete, as he was riding and training horses for a living, while the officer was the amateur. As long as there was no official international federation for Modern Pentathlon an IOC committee was set up for the sport making use of the expertise of IOC members.[4]\n\nThe event was first held at the 1912 Olympic Games, and was won by Swedish athlete Gösta Lilliehöök. The modern pentathlon has been on the Olympic program continuously since 1912. A team event was added to the Olympic Games in 1952 and discontinued in 1992. After much lobby work of the President of the German Modern Pentathlon Federation Prof. Wilhelm Henze, women were for the first time admitted on a trial basis at the World Championships in San Antonio in 1977, and at the official world championships in 1981.[5] An event for women was added in 2000.[2] A World Championship is held every year. The competitions include Men and Women's Individual and Team event together with relay events for Men and Women and, since 2010, a mixed relay event.\n\nCompetition format [ edit ]\n\nAthletes gain points for their performance in each event and scores are combined to give the overall total. This is similar to the procedure for the decathlon in track and field athletics. However, in the modern pentathlon, starting times for the last event (cross country running before 2009; combined laser pistol shooting and cross-country running since 2009),[6] are staggered so that the first person to cross the finish line is the winner. Before the last event competitors are ranked according to their score from the other disciplines and given start times accordingly, with the leader going first, and other starting times being dependent on the number of points already scored. The first person to cross the finish line, therefore, will be the overall points leader and win the pentathlon.

The competition is a round-robin, meaning each competitor will face all the other competitors once. Each match lasts up to one minute; the first fencer to score a hit wins instantly. Double hits are not counted. If neither scores within one minute, they both lose the match.\n\nThe swimming discipline is a 200 m freestyle race. Until the 2000 Olympics, the distance was 300 metres.

The riding discipline involves show jumping over a 350–450 m course with 12 to 15 obstacles. Competitors are paired with horses in a draw 20 minutes before the start of the event. [Note 1] Currently, this is the only Olympic sport that awards a medal to the participating horse [ citation needed ] .\n\nCurrently, this is the only Olympic sport that awards a medal to the participating horse . Until 2009, the shooting discipline involved using a 4.5 mm (.177 cal) air pistol in the standing position from 10 metres distance at a stationary target. The format was that of the 10 metre air pistol competition: each competitor had 20 shots, with 40 seconds allowed for each shot. In 2009, the combined event, now referred to as the laser-run, was born. This involved a combination of the running and shooting events so that each competitor ran three 1000 m laps, each prefaced by hitting five targets with a pistol. Beginning with the Rancho Mirage World Cup (Feb 2011), the pistols changed to a laser instead of an actual projectile. There is a slight delay between the trigger pull and the laser firing, simulating the time it would take for a pellet to clear the muzzle. [8]\n\nThe running discipline involved a 3 km cross-country race until 2009 when it combined with the shooting event. From the start of the 2013 season, the laser-run has changed again to consist of four 800m laps each prefaced by laser shooting at five targets. This change is intended to restore some of the importance of the shooting skill felt to have been lost in the original 2009 combined event. Until the 2000 Olympics, the distance was 4 kilometres.[7]\n\nThe laser-run is similar to the biathlon at the Winter Olympic Games, which combines cross-country skiing with rifle shooting. However, whereas biathletes carry their rifles while skiing, pentathletes do not carry their pistols while running.\n\nThe laser-run has been criticized as altering too radically the nature of the skills required. The New York Times asked whether the name ought to be changed to \"tetrathlon\" given that two of the five disciplines had been combined into a single event.[2]\n\nIn the new format, in each of the four rounds of firing, athletes have to successfully shoot five targets, loading the laser gun after each shot. They resume running once they have five successful hits, or once the maximum shooting time of 50 seconds has expired. Misses are not penalised.[2][9] The new format maintains the principle that the overall winner will be the first to cross the finish line.[2]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nNotes\n\n^ This unusual skill—the riding of a random horse is also used in the US for college equestrian team competitions and in club IEA horse back riding.\n\nMedia related to Modern pentathlon at Wikimedia Commons\n\nthumb",
  "latent_19723": "Many senators are doing everything possible to pretend there would be no price tag for making some 80 federal welfare programs plus all entitlements available to millions of mostly low-education, low-skill illegal aliens.\n\nThe Senators have heard from lots of billionaires and special-interest lobbyists who stand to make money off the cheap-labor aspect of the amnesty.\n\nNow, each Senator needs to hear from thousands of taxpayers who say NO to subsidizing that \"cheap\" labor with $6.3 trillion of taxpayer funds.\n\nWe hope citizens are making sure that their Senators' fax machines are full of messages of urgency to stop an amnesty that is sure to plunge the nation deeper into a debt crisis.\n\nChief researcher Robert Rector at his press conference this morning noted that the costs are predicted primarily by the education level of the illegal aliens. The study assumes, for example, that amnestied illegal aliens with only a high school degree will have roughly the same net costs to government as American citizens with only a high school degree.\n\nRector said:\n\n75% of illegal aliens have no more than a high school degree.\n\nThe average education level of illegal aliens is 10th grade\n\nRector said U.S. citizens with those kinds of education levels are immensely costly to the government because they take so much more in services than they pay in taxes. He indicated that it is preposterous for supporters of amnesty to claim that amnestied illegal aliens with a 10th grade education will somehow cost less than U.S. citizens with a 10th grade education.\n\nThe $6.3 trillion number is so high that it may be difficult to contemplate the extraordinary magnitude of it. But it amounts to an incredible financial liability that this Congress would hang around the necks of our children and grandchildren to pay for this amnesty the rest of their lives.\n\nFormer Sen. Jim De-Mint, President of Heritage, said Senators who support the amnesty will hide behind the accounting trick of putting off most costs until after 10 years. They tend to talk about the first 10 years when the bill forbids use of most welfare and entitlements. In fact, Rector says, the net costs will go down to about $50 billion a year the first decade as many illegal aliens start working ON the books.\n\nBut Rector says the costs will explode around the 13th or 14th year of the amnesty and grow worse over the decades, especially as the amnestied illegal aliens start collecting medicare and Social Security.\n\nRector says he used the methodology developed by the National Academy of Sciences and that all the variable costs are pulled from official government studies.\n\nSome critics of the Heritage numbers claim that maybe the amnestied illegal aliens will cost a lot of money but that all of their kids will make a lot more money and pay taxes to cover the costs of their parents.\n\nRector says he studied that and found that the children are likely to have better education and be less costly to the government.\n\nBut he says all data suggests that the children of illegal aliens will also be a net cost to government over their lifetimes.\n\nThose costs, however, are not included in the $6.3 trillion figure.\n\nIn fact, he says, only if every single child of an amnestied illegal alien were to get a college degree, would they not be a cost to the government. Even then, though, their net tax additions still would not come close to paying back the $6.3 trillion price tag for their parents.\n\nROY BECK is Founder & President of NumbersUSA",

This name comes with certain responsibilities though, and according to our lawyers, if we don't do at least one thing a year to actually address scholastic achievement, we will all go to prison. Our lawyers then pointed out that we will not do well in prison, and made several uncomfortable hand gestures to illustrate this fact. Upon hearing this, we immediately agreed to \"address scholastic achievement, and then sprinted from the room before the lawyers could tell us what they meant by \"address.\" Which should make everything that happens next in this article nice and legal. So, with final exams just around the corner for millions of college students, Cracked has slapped together what we believe to be the most exam-tacular preparation tips those spoon-fed ivory tower eggheads will have ever seen. If you are one of those sneering liberal elites, choose to follow this advice to the letter, and don't get seven A's and a handshake from the mayor, we at Cracked promise to all feeljust awful.For every subject you're studying, write down key facts and figures on a set of index cards. By carrying these cards around with you, you'll be able to refer to them during spare minutes and other down time, enabling you to study on the bus, on the toilet, or while going to the toilet on the bus.Use a highlighter to color words in your books. This will make it feel like you're actually studying. Actually studying involves reading the words, which is also good, but much more time consuming, and frankly discriminatory against people who don't want to read.Try joining a study group to help you prepare for exams. Assign sections of the material to each person in the group, then make that person provide a summary of the key information in that section to the rest of the group. Because the effectiveness of this technique depends on the people involved, finding the right study group is important. An easy trick for this: if you can't tell which one of your study friends is the dumb one, then it's probably you. This is thus an excellent study group for you.\n\nIn exam-mad Japan, study groups have complicated rituals.\n\nTip #4: Not Kidding Anyone\n\nTip #5: The Shame\n\nContinue Reading Below Advertisement\n\nTip #6: Hot For Teacher (for the right price)\n\nIt's time to just admit that you're hosed. There is no chance at all that you'll be able to pull this off, and if we're being honest, you'd probably be better off smacking yourself in the crotch with a hammer labeled \"Self-Deception\" then you would be by studying. With that taken as fact, the smartest thing you could do right now is just give up and stop wasting your time. Congratulations on making a very grown up decision.But having come to that very mature decision, you can just picture your dad. And he's not one of the \"I'm just disappointed in you\" types. FATHER: -angry- You spent twenty eight thousand dollars to jerk off and play video games? Don't answer me. I don't want to know the truth. I doubt it's better. In fact I think I'm actually being pretty charitable describing your life. Yeah, you honestly can't live through several decades of that. So maybe it's time to buck up and find an alternative solution. Study-Ho!You honestly have very little to lose from at least asking to nail your professor in exchange for a better grade. If the professor isn't agreeable to it, offer to pleasure their spouse, thus freeing up your professor's valuable time for more research.

Many authorities won't even delay exams upon receiving a threat now, unless they perceive the threat is in some way credible. So, make your threat credible by blowing up a smaller, less important building earlier in the week. The drama building for example.Browse your local dating website looking for people with pictures that look somewhat like you. Pretending to be someone else, Wink/Whisper/Poke/Diddle them to start a dialog, and over the course of a few private messages, see how smart they are. Eventually work the conversation around to them writing an exam under a false name in exchange for some sort of sexual favor. The success rate of this will depend sharply on how desperate people who look like you are for companionship.Use computers in some way to cheat. Cell phones and such are usually strictly forbidden during exams, but there are ways to use technology to get an edge. Try wrapping some C4 to a computer monitor, and pushing it into the elevator shaft of your chemistry building. Poof, instant delayed exam.\n\nTip #10: An Offer They Can't Refuse\n\nTip #11: Illness\n\nAfter writing your exam, loiter around the exam room, attempting to be the last one to hand it in. When you do, shake the professors hand, thanking her for teaching a good class. Use this opportunity to slip her some cash, or a note threatening her cat's life. \"Why did you write this using cut out magazine letters?\" she asks. \"I clearly know it was you who wrote it.\" Sprint out of there before she can find any more holes in your plan, and hide under a picnic table until everything blows over.If you think you actually have a chance to pass this exam, but only if you had more time to study, please refer to the \"Not Kidding Anyone\" tip above. If you still think that way, consider becoming legally ill prior to the exam in order to obtain a doctor's note. Eating uncooked chicken is a pretty good way to do this, but also consider entering an emergency room by dragging your rear end across the floor - the universal sign of irreversible intestinal distress.\n\n________________________________\n\nBucholz has gotten less terrified of human contact!

  "latent_20153": "SEATTLE – Seattle striker Fredy Montero is MLS’ onion. Peel back a layer and you get the cocksure individualist capable of hitting a conscience-free 40-yard bomb. Peel back another and there’s the reserved, almost shy kid who doesn’t seem to know where or when to mix it up on the pitch.\n\nPeel back a third, and you get the Montero that was on display Wednesday night in the Sounders’ 4-2 loss to Chelsea: a ruthless, goal-hungry sniper who never stops working on either side of the ball.\n\nIt’s the best layer, the version that attracted the interest of myriad European clubs who are always in search of some new goal-scoring talent. Montero wants those clubs to know that’s the real him – and that he’d listen if an offer were made.\n\n“Yes, I would love to play there,” Montero said afterward when asked if he still has European aspirations. “I’m waiting for the right opportunity to come. Yeah, I’m ready to play in one of those leagues, I think so.”\n\nIt was a candid moment from the mercurial forward, who’s been known to run hot and cold in his three-plus years in MLS. On Wednesday, of course, he ran hot, scoring both of Seattle’s goals and setting up several other opportunities.\n\nWATCH: Montero's beauty to equalize at 2-2\n\nIt caught the attention of both coaches. Chelsea’s Roberto Di Matteo called Montero “obviously very technical, able to operate between the lines, and I thought he caused us some problems.”\n\nSigi Schmid, meanwhile, said he liked to hear that Montero still has an eye on a move to one of Europe's biggest leagues. Yes, that means the Sounders coach would stand to lose his star striker, but it would also mean that said striker still has the hunger and desire to improve.\n\n“I think you want every player to want to play at the highest level that they can possibly play,” Schmid explained. “I want each and every one of our players to achieve as much as they can possibly achieve. If they’re not hungry to get to the next level, and they’re just very content and satisfied, then maybe they lose a little bit of that edge.”\n\nThere were some questions about exactly that with Montero, who’d been off to a slow start numbers-wise this season. But he scored a crucial goal last weekend against New York, bringing his MLS career total to 39 over the past three and a half years.\n\n“He’s ready to play at another level,” Schmid said. “It’s gotta be the right situation, it’s gotta be the right opportunity for him, and then you’ve gotta take advantage of it.”\n\nThere’s nothing on the docket immediately for Montero – “I wish” was his response when asked if there are any current suitors – but he has no doubt that he can make the leap to, say, the English Premier League.\n\n“For sure, I think so,” Montero said. “MLS is a league that has some things similar to the Premier League … every single day in training, you see the speed of the game. I think you see the same in the Premier League.”",
  "latent_20202": "An Emergency Committee for Israel attack on Chuck Hagel, above. The American Jewish Committee was the latest Jewish organization to enlist in the battle to prevent President Barack Obama from naming former Nebraska senator Chuck Hagel to be Secretary of Defense. The onslaught is unprecedented. Never before has virtually the entire organized Jewish community combined to stop a presidential cabinet appointment because it deems the potential nominee insufficiently devoted to Israel. Of course, below the cabinet level, the lobby has been manning the barricades against critics of any Israeli government policies for decades.\n\nThe onslaught against Hagel is unique however because the reason for it is not merely that he opposes the rush to war with Iran and favors negotiating an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe reason is because he dared to refer to the existence of the Israel lobby. He said this in 2008 in an interview with former State Department official, Aaron Miller.\n\nThis [Congress] is an institution that does not inherently bring out a great deal of courage,” Hagel continued. “Most of the time members play it safe and adopt an ‘I’ll support Israel’ attitude. AIPAC comes knocking with a pro-Israel letter, and ‘then you’ll get 80 to 90 senators on it. I don’t think I’ve ever signed one of the letters.’ When someone would accuse him of not being pro-Israel because he didn’t sign the letter, Hagel told me he responds: “‘I didn’t sign the letter because it was a stupid letter.” Few legislators talk this way on the Hill. Hagel is a strong supporter of Israel and a believer in shared values. “The Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here,” but as he put it, “I’m a United States senator. I’m not an Israeli senator.”\n\nThat quote will likely doom Hagel’s candidacy because, if there is one institution that is considered untouchable, it is the Israel lobby and its power.\n\nHere is Wall Street Journal columnist Brett Stephens, a major neocon and Netanyahu supporter, on the implications of Hagel’s remarks.\n\nPrejudice – like cooking, wine-tasting and other consummations – has an olfactory element. When Chuck Hagel, the former GOP senator from Nebraska who is now a front-runner to be the next secretary of Defense, carries on about how “the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here,” the odor is especially ripe. Ripe because a “Jewish lobby,” as far as I’m aware, doesn’t exist. No lesser authorities on the subject than John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, authors of “The Israel Lobby,” have insisted the term Jewish lobby is “inaccurate and misleading, both because the [Israel] lobby includes non-Jews like Christian Zionists and because many Jewish Americans do not support the hard-line policies favored by its most powerful elements.”…. Ripe because the word “intimidates” ascribes to the so-called Jewish lobby powers that are at once vast, invisible and malevolent; and because it suggests that legislators who adopt positions friendly to that lobby are doing so not from political conviction but out of personal fear. Just what does that Jewish Lobby have on them?\n\nIn short, Hagel is an anti-Semite because he stated that the “Jewish lobby” both exists and “intimidates…”\n\nIt is true that it is impolitic to use the term “Jewish lobby” rather than “Israel lobby” although the very same people criticizing Hagel for using the former term objected just as vehemently when Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer used the latter in their book on the subject. In any case, the term Jewish lobby is accurate when one refers to organizations like the American Jewish Committee or the Anti-Defamation League, etc. They are Jewish organizations and not AIPAC, the registered Israel lobby.\n\nAs for the non-Jews and Christian Zionists that are supposedly part of the lobby, that is just silly. Having worked on Capitol Hill for 20 years, I can attest to the fact that the only voices that matter in Washington on this issue comes from Jews. The lobby contributes millions of dollars to candidates based on its determination of his or her devotion to Israel. No non-Jewish organization does that. The whole “Christian Zionist” thing is a joke and will be until John Hagee’s Christians United For Israel starts pouring money into our campaigns. And to BOTH parties.\n\nOf course, the irony about the war on Hagel is that it has been launched against him because he says that the lobby acts as one to intimidate policymakers and legislators and the lobby screams that there is no such thing as an organized lobby that does these things.\n\nHere is a list (not comprehensive) of those who have enlisted in the campaign against Chuck Hagel:\n\nAmerican Jewish Committee\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League\n\nAIPAC\n\nCommentary\n\nRepublican Jewish Coalition\n\nNational Jewish Democratic Council\n\nThe Israel Project\n\nThe Zionist Organization of America\n\nPlus, Bill Kristol, Jennifer Rubin, Fred Hiatt of the Washington Post, Ed Koch\n\nThis list is only partial. Virtually all Jewish organizations, politicians and media figures are under pressure to condemn Hagel and many of them will. To its credit J Street is supporting Hagel and Israel Policy Forum has long been in the Hagel camp (it honored him for his support for Israel’s security in 2008).\n\nBut the others are all marching in lockstep to destroy a senator, a war hero (highly decorated Army infantryman) and one of the most thoughtful public officials on foreign policy matters. I say “destroy” because the charge of anti-Semitism can and does destroy. If Obama decides not to pick Hagel (and he probably will so decide), this great American will be tarred forever by the charge.\n\nThe good news is that the lobby will be shown to be precisely what its critics say it is. It is an organized machine, dedicated to the interests of the Israeli right that uses its power to ensure that no one in our government ever challenges Israel’s government on anything. Of course, it is unlikely that the media will even report the story.\n\nIn the wake of last week’s horrors in Connecticut, the media is talking almost endlessly about the sickening power of the gun lobby. But the gun lobby doesn’t come close to AIPAC’s power to intimidate. After all, as I said, everyone discusses the NRA and what should be done about it. Virtually no one in the media discusses the Israel lobby. If Hagel is rejected by Obama, don’t expect David Gregory, Rachel Maddow, or any of the rest of them to explain why. They can’t. They are afraid. But they are not afraid of the NRA. Doesn’t that tell you something?\n\nFortunately, there is the blogosphere (again, most of the major bloggers are intimidated into silence on the lobby but not all) where the most prominent voice of all, former New Republic editor Andrew Sullivan does have the guts to speak out. He says:\n\nLike a kabuki dance,here it comes: the usual vile insinuations; the usual call for the Greater Israel Lobby to kill a nomination because a US Senator actually believe his job is to care first about the security and interests of the US, not Greater Israel; the reflexive equation of opposition to the Netanyahu administration or the settlements or the Gaza wars with pure bigotry. The phrases – “the odor is especially ripe” – are as preeningly self-righteous as they are toxic. You are not allowed, for example, to note that well-financed organized Washington lobbies “intimidate” lawmakers: the word “intimidates” ascribes to the so-called Jewish lobby powers that are at once vast, invisible and malevolent; and because it suggests that legislators who adopt positions friendly to that lobby are doing so not from political conviction but out of personal fear. It’s interesting to read this familiar, exhausted, ridiculous whine in the context of our current discussion about the NRA. The NRA is routinely called the gun lobby and it is described in exactly the same terms as AIPAC: “vast, invisible and malevolent” – because it is precisely as effective and relentless and as fanatical as AIPAC in wielding money, networking and political pressure in attaining its legislative goals. But we are forbidden from calling AIPAC what it is the way we call the NRA what it is – because telling the truth about it has been stigmatized as anti-Semitism. It’s a useful ruse for bullies like the Greater Israel Lobby. It’s also an insult to those who have suffered and been murdered by actual anti-Semites. But for utopian fanatics, if casually calling honorable public servants anti-Semites helps them retain their dream of a Greater Israel, so be it. Which is why the president, if indeed he is contemplating an appointment for the Nebraska Republican, should not listen to the AIPAC thugs. He should what is right for this country, and not any other’s.\n\nSullivan leaves out one thing. The Israel Lobby is bad for the Jews. It suggests that Jewish Americans put the interests of a foreign country first which is a damnable lie. As every poll shows, Jewish Americans not only don’t vote based on Israel, they are not overly Israel centered at all. Moreover, those of us who do deeply care about Israel (although not more than we care about our own country) believe that the best way to support Israel is to work for peace with the Palestinians and to oppose war with Iran just as Hagel does. The lobby knows that but it has higher goals: making our government tremble, supporting Binyamin Netanyahu, and scaring Jews into donating more money to their respective organizations.\n\nIn short, the lobby is bad for America. But it’s worse for Jews.\n\nHow dare these hacks and lobbyists jeopardize our future in the best home Jews have ever had?\n\nThis piece first appeared at MJ Rosenberg’s site.",
  "latent_20269": "The National Assembly of Quebec (French: Assemblée nationale du Québec) is the legislative body of the province of Quebec in Canada. Legislators are called MNAs (Members of the National Assembly; French: députés). The Queen in Right of Quebec, represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec[1] and the National Assembly compose the Legislature of Quebec, which operates in a fashion similar to those of other Westminster-style parliamentary systems.\n\nThe National Assembly was formerly the lower house of Quebec's legislature and was then called the Legislative Assembly of Quebec. In 1968, the upper house, the Legislative Council, was abolished and the remaining house was renamed.\n\nThe office of President of the National Assembly (equivalent to speaker in other legislatures) is currently vacant after the dissolution of the 41st Legislature. The Coalition Avenir Québec has the most seats in the Assembly following the Quebec general election, 2018.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nThe Legislative Assembly was created in Lower Canada by the Constitutional Act of 1791. It was abolished from 1841 to 1867 under the 1840 Act of Union, which merged Upper Canada and Lower Canada into a single colony named the Province of Canada.\n\nThe Constitution Act, 1867 (formerly the British North America Act), which created Canada, split the Province of Canada into the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada was thus restored as the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec.\n\nThe original Quebec legislature was bicameral, consisting of the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly.\n\nIn 1968, Bill 90 was passed by the government of Premier Jean-Jacques Bertrand, abolishing the Legislative Council and renaming the Legislative Assembly the \"National Assembly\", in line with the more strident nationalism of the Quiet Revolution. Before 1968, there had been various unsuccessful attempts at abolishing the Legislative Council, which was analogous to the Senate of Canada.\n\nIn 1978, television cameras were brought in for the first time to televise parliamentary debates. The colour of the walls was changed to suit the needs of television and the salon vert (green hall) became the salon bleu (blue hall).\n\nParliament Building [ edit ]\n\nFontaine de Tourny east of the Parliament Building Theeast of the Parliament Building\n\nConstructed between 1877 and 1886, the Parliament Building features the Second Empire architectural style[2] that was popular for prestigious buildings both in Europe (especially France where the style originated) and the United States during the latter 19th century.\n\nAlthough somewhat more sober in appearance and lacking a towering central belfry, Quebec City's Parliament Building bears a definite likeness to the Philadelphia City Hall, another Second Empire edifice in North America which was built during the same period. Even though the building's symmetrical layout with a frontal clock tower in the middle is typical of legislative institutions of British heritage, the architectural style is believed to be unique among parliament buildings found in other Canadian provincial capitals.[citation needed] Its facade presents a pantheon representing significant events and people of the history of Quebec.\n\nAdditional buildings were added next to the Parliament Buildings:\n\nÉdifice André-Laurendeau was added from 1935 to 1937 to house the Ministry of Transport.\n\nÉdifice Honoré-Mercier was added from 1922 to 1925 to house the Ministries of the Treasury (Finances), the Attorney General and the Secretary General of the National Assembly.\n\nÉdifice Jean-Antoine-Panet was added from 1931 to 1932 for the Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nÉdifice Pamphile-Le May added from 1910 to 1915 for the Library of the National Assembly, various other government offices and for the Executive Council.\n\nElections [ edit ]\n\nGeneral elections are held every five years or less. Any person holding Canadian citizenship and who has resided in Quebec for at least six months qualifies to be on the electoral list.\n\nNormally, the leader of the political party with the largest number of elected candidates is asked by the Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec to form the government as premier. (In French, it is rendered as premier ministre. The term \"prime minister\" is commonly used by the government as a literal translation of the French term. In the other Canadian Provinces, the head of government are referred to in English as \"premier\". The title is similarly rendered \"premier ministre\" in French, too. The term literally means \"First Minister\". When used in the plural, \"First Ministers\" in Canada refers collectively to the Provincial Premiers and the Prime Minister of Canada).\n\nQuebec's territory is divided into 125 electoral districts (ridings). In each riding, the candidate who receives the most votes is elected and becomes a Member of the National Assembly (MNA). This is known as the first-past-the-post voting system. It tends to produce strong disparities in the number of seats won compared to the popular vote, perhaps best exemplified by the 1966, 1970, 1973, and 1998 elections.\n\nQuebec elections have also tended to be volatile since the 1970s, producing a large turnover in Assembly seats. Consequently, existing political parties often lose more than half their seats with the rise of new or opposition political parties. For instance, the 1970 and 1973 saw the demise of the Union Nationale and rise of the Parti Québécois which managed to take power in 1976.

Steve Bannon is registered to vote in both New York and Florida. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images; Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/Getty Images; Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Donald Trump called for an investigation into alleged voter fraud, including whether citizens are registered to vote in more than one state, but least one member of his family, one of his senior aides, and a Cabinet nominee have been found to be registered in at least two states.\n\n\"I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time),\" Trump tweeted Wednesday. \"Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedure.\"\n\nTrump's nominee to be the secretary of the Treasury, former Goldman Sachs partner Steven Mnuchin, is registered to vote in both New York and California, according to a review of documents by CNN .\n\nSteve Bannon, a senior adviser to the president and the former executive director of Breitbart News, a media outlet the Southern Poverty Law Center has described as \"embracing ideas on the extremist fringe of the conservative right,\" registered to vote in New York before the election last year at the same time as he was registered to vote in Florida. Bannon is still registered to vote in Florida.\n\nAnd Tiffany Trump, the president's younger daughter with his second wife, Marla Maples, is registered to vote in both Pennsylvania and New York.\n\nAlthough it is not illegal to be registered to vote in multiple places – unlike voting twice in the same election, which is against the law – proponents of theories of voter fraud point to multiple registrations as proof that illegal voting takes place.\n\nMnuchin is registered at a Park Avenue home in Manhattan, where he last voted in 2008. Records in California show he is registered at an address in Bel Air, and he voted in\n\nCalifornia's Republican primary last year. A Los Angeles county election official told CNN that files have not been updated for November's general election.\n\nDuring the election, it was revealed by The Guardian that Bannon was registered in Florida at a vacant house in Miami-Dade County . The owner of the property said at the time he had never lived at the address where he was registered, a possible violation of Florida election law that prohibits \"willful misrepresentation\" of residency and bars registering some place that is not a primary residence. Bannon changed his Florida registration to the home of a friend after The Guardian's report in August; it's not clear if he ever lived at that home either.\n\nTiffany Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in May. Public records reviewed by Heat Street confirmed that she voted in New York but not in Pennsylvania in November.",

I advice you to go to the strategy section and start playing your first city a bit then return here to read. It will be easier to read if you are somewhat familiar with the game. Perhaps a short glance at PART 2, General Gameplay Concept, should be done. However, there are also some very extensive and intensive discussions and debate in this area that you might not truly appreciate until you are more familiar with the game. These can mostly be found in those topics marked with the little star (*). This Online Manual (OM) was created because the one provided seems to be quite inadequate, at least in comparison with the previous SimCity series. _______________________________________________________________________2______ /\\___/\\ /\\___/\\ /() ()\\ /() ()\\ S~~| o |~~P SECTION A: ONLINE MANUAL S~~| o |~~P ~~~| START |~~~ PART 1: BASIC GAME MECHANICS ~~~| START |~~~ A~~\\_____/~~1 A~~\\_____/~~1 ______________________________________________________________________________ There is less strategies in PART 1, so if you are clear on how the game works, you can simply proceed on to the later sections in the guide. I will be dealing with the basic game play issues at this section. They will mostly relate to options available, technical game data and generally how things operate in the game. =======================================================================[3]==== A1.01: Basics and Technical Issues \"One small step for Mayor, One giant leap for Sims-Kind.\" Sim Mayor. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[4]><>< A1.01.1: Query the Hottest Keys The query option is one of the most important tools in the game. Use it to determine a whole host of information. You can also use it to click on any building and then change the name of it. Although that does not make the building historical or unalterable. It can still be destroyed by the computer when redeveloping. And if you want to follow a MySims or a car or change the traffic lights, simply do this: [Query] + [shift] + [click on object] You can check out the list of hot keys at the back of the provided manual although most of them seem quite useless and superfluous to me and seems only to appear there to fill up the back of the manual. For example there is a hot key of obliterating the city. I do not know how you play your city but this is not C&C, there is little violence and you would definitely not need a hot key for obliteration. The following are the more useful hot keys, the hottest of the hot. 1) [Home or End] Turn the building around for placement. 2) [Shift] Turns off auto roads. Simply press shift after dragging the zone but before releasing the mouse button. Make sure that you have the patch installed. 3) [Alt] Switch the layout of the zoning before laying it. 4) [Esc] Undo, sort of. Cancels zones, roads, etc, only if you have not released the mouse button. 5) [G] Shows the grid. This is great for counting and planning. 6) [/] Query. Use it with bulldoze to prevent accidental demolition. 7) [B] Bulldoze / Demolish. 8) [Control] [F] Dispatch fire fighters. 9) [Control] [P] Dispatch police. 10) [Control] + [Shift] + [S] Takes a picture of your city as it is appearing on the screen at this moment. This is a very useful hot key as it allows pictures which may not be possible if you went through the clicking on all picture button process. 11) [Spacebar] Centre on Cursor. 12) [Control] + [Shift] + [C] Toggle terrain contours. 13) [Control] + [S] Save City. 14) [F12] Exit 15) [Control] + [Shift] + [Alt] + [R] This is to record a clip of your city. 16) [Control] + [Shift] + [O] Just in case you are wondering, this is the obliterate hotkey. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[5]><>< A1.01.2: Multiple City Save Games and file locations 1) Save Games For those of you who complain about the lack of save games slots, you could always just copy the region to another folder. Go to: MyDocuments > SimCity 4 > Regions This is also the place to put any cities you download. You have to place the city in the region in want it to be. 2) File locations A) Album: MyDocuments > SimCity 4 > Album B) Bug Report: MyDocuments > SimCity 4 > Exception Reports C) Recorded Animation: MyDocuments > SimCity 4 > Recorded Animation D) Original Regions: C:\\(or wherever you installed the game) SimCity 4 > Regions This is for if you messed up the original regions and want the original back. E) Music for the game / Custom Tunes: SimCity 4> Radio > Stations > Region > Music SimCity 4> Radio > Stations > Mayor > Music <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[6]><>< A1.01.3: Custom Tunes & Animation 1) Tunes You can play your own music simply by placing the music (MP3) into this folder: For Region Music: SimCity 4> Radio > Stations > Region > Music For City Music: SimCity 4> Radio > Stations > Mayor > Music Then when you play the game open up the Audio Option and select the custom tunes. 2) Animation Simply hit [Control] + [Shift] + [O] to begin. Enter in the various information such as file name, rate, time, output and frame count. The clip will be stored in your Recorded Animation folder. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[7]><>< A1.01.4: Technical Issues Firstly, I should state that I am NOT a technical expert or even a technical person at all. However, these problems occurred frequent enough for me to pick some things up. 1) Game Requirements: You can easily check the requirements on the box although the game really requires a lot of power such that even if you are above the recommended your cities if they are huge may encounter lag. There is a good test program to test your computer systems vis-a-vis the game requirements. It is found in the game folder itself: SimCity4 > Support > SimCity 4_EZ.exe 2) GDriverWindow--DirectX Error (1) This is one of the most common problems I see. The error you will most probably see is \"The configuration file (Graphics Rules.sgr) cannot be parsed using built-in rules.\" There are two plugin folders. The one I am talking about is the one in your MyDocuments folder. MyDocuments > SimCity 4 > Plugins Do not place any of the downloaded things into this folder if not the game will not start. I suggest that after installation of the game and the patch you go and check this folder out to see what should remain in there. Nothing. The reason why an uninstall does not work is because the game does not delete the SimCity 4 folder under MyDocuments unless you actively specify it. Delete what ever you have placed there. 3) GDriverWindow--DirectX Error (2) However, there is another more drastic method. Since I am not well-versed in computers, I am unsure as to whether is this message a generic type for multiple problems or not. If above solution does not work then you may attempt to try this but do it at your own risk and discretion. A) Uninstall SimCity 4 including the SimCity 4 folder in MyDocuments. B) Reinstall: After that do the following: i) Double-click on My Computer. ii) Double-click on C: drive (also labelled local disk) iii) Double-click on Program Files. iv) Double-click on Maxis. v) Double-click on Sim City 4. vi) Double-click on Apps. C) Open SimCity 4.ini file i) Right-click on the SimCity 4.ini file and a menu will appear. Select \"open\" and left-click to open the file. The found is found in: C:\\(or wherever you installed the game) > Apps ii) You will now see notepad open the file up. It will look similar to this: [Directories] Data=..\\ PlugIn=..\\Plugins\\ [Graphics Drivers] OpenGL =SimGLRef.dll, C4554841 Software=SimGLSoft.dll, 7ACA35C6 D3D7 =SimGLDx7.dll, BADB6906 [Current Graphics Driver] ;Driver = C4554841 ;OpenGL Hardware ;Driver = 7ACA35C6 ;GRPoly Software Driver = BADB6906 ;DX7 Hardware D) Editing You will need to make edits to the [Graphics Drivers] and [Current Graphics Driver] sections so that they appear as follows: [Directories] Data=..\\ PlugIn=..\\Plugins\\ [Graphics Drivers] ;OpenGL =SimGLRef.dll, C4554841 Software=SimGLSoft.dll, 7ACA35C6 ;D3D7 =SimGLDx7.dll, BADB6906 [Current Graphics Driver] ;Driver = C4554841 ;OpenGL Hardware Driver = 7ACA35C6 ;GRPoly Software ;Driver = BADB6906 ;DX7 Hardware E) Hopefully that will help you but I make no promises. 4) Graphics options As usual there is a trade-off between speed of the game and quality of it. Patch 2 will automatically set the options rather low, at least in my opinion. So if the graphics look bad, simply change the quality and determine if you can stand the lag in the game. 5) EA Technical help If you have problem operating the game simply send them a message. It is under their technical support, Ask a question tab. You do not need actually need to know their address. This is their main support site. http://techsupport.ea.com Although it should be noted that, often your first reply will be an automated one but do not despair and persist. I did once think of sending in multiple mails just to determine the various sets of automated response and trigger words but I think that sort of would be frowned upon. 6) Permanent Green Highlight Bug If, you see your hospitals or education highlighted as green even if they are not selected, do not worry. Simply go to the data view, and select the respective health, education, etc view. Then after selected, click on the all off. They will no longer have the green glow. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[8]><>< A1.01.5: Registration The registration process I recalled was quite complicated. If I remember it correctly, this is the process: 1) Register once on your computer by filling up the form after installation, which will then send a signal to the main site. Or go to the Support folder and click on SimCity 4_eReg.exe to register. 2) Then you have to register a second time also with the same key, which is at the back of your CD case at their official site. 3) Failure to do the first registration before the second will give you a error or invalid key message 4) Enter your email correctly and make sure it does not get directed to your junk folder. Click on the activation and you are done. Again if you have problems send an message to them. They solved, my problem within hours. http://techsupport.ea.com This I must say is one of the most complicated registration process ever. However, it is a good effort against piracy. So if you see anyone or if anyone asks you for your key, do NOT give away your key. And also report all piracy regarding the game to this EA email address: piracy@ea.com For online piracy email contact: piracy2@ea.com <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[9]><>< A1.01.6: Updates 1) Check all files updated The patch update is problematic. Whether you patch automatically or do it manually, make sure you check that all the relevant files are indeed updated. The list of files can be found on the patch page. Although, I personally seem to have a problem with the 'dbghelp.dll' file as it not only did not take the 2003 stamp date but it seems to have taken a 2001 stamp date. 2) Patch Log You will have a patch log called: sc4_patchlog.txt It is found in the same folder as the patch file you downloaded if you used the automatic patch. Not too sure where it would be if it was done automatically. This lists what files were patched and whether was it successful at the patch. 3) Region Identification The second problem is for those who has problem with the automatic patch and have to do it manually. Make sure your region is correct. The problematic is the Asian edition. Just because, you live in Asia and bought the game there does not mean that the game is an Asian edition one. If it is English, there is a high chance that your edition could be the North America one. I do not think there is a way to actually determine your region by looking at the files or game itself. The things that could your is an American edition are: (i) Right hand drive and (ii) American spelling. However with regards to American spelling, I am unsure whether is it similar for all the English games. If it is not then look for words such as \"harbor\" v \"harbour\" or \"color\" v \"colour.\" The spelling without the \"u\" is the American spelling. These words will sometimes appear as park of the message in the news ticker. 4) Failed patch Finally, if you game did not patch properly as in the files were not fully updated, the only way to resolve it is to reinstall everything. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[10]><> A1.01.7: Online Play: SimCityScape You can find more information at the site but this is a brief overview. This online gameplay is available at the official website: http://simcity.ea.com/scape/ http://simcity.ea.com/ 1) Requirements Microsoft's Internet Explorer version 6 or better. ActiveX Java Registered user Game updated with Patch 2 2) 9 Regions Available Amarica (Large City size: 20 Cities) Discovered in 2003, Amarica is the new world. Griffinland (Large City size: 42 Cities) In a world where water reigns, Griffinland springs to life. Dan's Grove (Small City Size: 43 Cities) Farmer Dan ran a pistachio orchard on this soil, until approached by a developer. The region has been growing ever since. Emlee Valley (Medium City Size: 18 Cities) Pioneered by Maxoids, additional settlers have been moving in ever since. Molon Island (Small City Size: 47 Cities) Islands rise from the oceans forming this vast archipelago. Sea Shaw (Medium City Size: 47 Cities) With recent development interest, Sea Shaw promises to undergo a real estate boom. Lake Lucky (Medium City Size: 41 Cities) Formed by a giant asteroid 3 million years ago, Lake Lucky is now a vacation haven. Big Ben Basi (Medium City Size: 47 Cities) The lands have been shifting beneath these shallow waters, making it prime realestate for developers. Wee Burg (Small City Size: 45 Cities) In the wee county of Wee Burg, little cities populate the quaint countryside. Cook County (Large City Size: 24 Cities) The wind sweeps across vast stretches of plains, as if whispering “develop me.” Templinton (Medium City Size: 18 Cities) Civilizations have always grown from the fertile river valleys, Templinton is no exception. Annarondacks (Large City Size: 15 Cities) Lakes, forests, and numerous winter sports resorts, attract many tourists, and was once the site of the 1964 Winter SimOlympics. Spider Mountain (Medium City Size: 38 Cities) Once inhabited by a spider so large, no one dared move into the area. Nowadays the spider has taken up a career in a travelling sideshow act, leaving the region spider free. 3) Game Play concept It is quite simple. You get to pick one region and you have up to 48 hours to play with it and to end your turn. You may upload it and make as many changes as you want. But after 48 hours or if you choose to end your turn early your turn is up then another person can take over. You may not play the same city consecutively although you may play a city multiple times. After certain amount of time, Maxis will reset the region and the good ones I suppose will get into their hall of fame. 3) Download Region You can download their \"premade region configuration folder\" and place it at My Documents\\SimCity 4\\Regions\\ to extract and create your city. It is a 2k zip file. Yes, 2k I did not have a typing error. It is small. This is not required for playing the online game and download it only if you want to duplicate their region for your own play. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[11]><> A1.01.8: Simtropolis Patch This is not an official patch at all. It is put together by fans of the game. It is located at the Simtropolis site: Www.simtropolis.com The following is one of the official words by Maxis on it: 'Users install, run and download those \"mods\" from Simtropolis completely at their own risk. Maxis is NOT responsible for ANY errors, crashes, problems or any other issue that you may have if you have downloaded and applied any unofficially supported mod files to your game. Nor is Maxis required to help anyone who has altered their game with any patches/mods/downloads that are not from Maxis themself. Players should also expect that any future patches and/or expansion packs and SimCityscape \"may\" NOT function properly with the game if you have downloaded any unofficial mods/patches/files and applied them to your game.' <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[12]><> A1.01.9: City Size There are three city size that you can select. And each tile is 16 by 16 metres. A) Small: 64 by 64 tiles = 1024 metres / 1Km B) Medium: 128 by 128 tiles = 2048 metres / 2Km C) Large: 256 by 256 tiles = 4096 metres / 4km =======================================================================[13]=== A1.02: God Mode \"God created the world, except Netherlands which we had to create ourselves.\" Popular Dutch Saying. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[14]><> A1.02.1: Terraform 1) Automatic Reconcile: I recommend that you turn off the reconcile option. Use it only in a city that has yet to build anything, unless you wish to lose your buildings at the edge. 2) Map Creation: Personally, I prefer creating maps one by one rather than doing the entire region. Firstly, it is so much easier and you get to start playing the game faster. Gives you greater flexibility to get the terrain to suit the cities that are sprouting up. Of course even if you do the entire region you can still change the landscape of the city. But from my experience, you would be extremely reluctant to do so. And furthermore if the changes are huge it may impact other maps. Even if that is not so, you will have wasted time altering the map twice. 3) Size and intensity of terra forming: Shift F1 - F10: Intensity from less (F1) to most (F10) Shift 1 > 2 > ... > 9 > 0: Size of brush from small (1) to large (0). The size of the circle remains the same whatever zoom you are at. So zoom in to the maximum zoom if you wish to have a smaller effect. 4) Reconcile Once in a while I hear people complain bitterly that the reconcile destroys their city. The answer is simple. If it destroys your city then just do not hit the reconcile button. Go to the options and turn it off. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[15]><> A1.02.2: Changing region & city size A) Introduction to Items: Program: MS Paint I used this but believe that any graphics program can be used. File: Config.bmp Location: My Documents\\SimCity4\\Regions\\(Any original region. Such as Berlin or Maxisland) Note: I mentioned the file so for you to get an idea about it. It does NOT mean that you use this files for your map. Please create a new bitmap. B) Region Size: The pixels of the bitmap determine the size of the region. For Example Maxisland is 16 x 16 pixels C) City Size Colour Coding: 1x1: Red : Small city. 2x2: Green: Medium city. 4x4: Blue : Large city. The colour's value must be 255. And in the event that you are unfamiliar with MS paint, here is a step-by-step guide. 1) Select \"Colours\" then \"Edit Colours.\" 2) Press \"Define Custom Colours.\" 3) Make sure the value of the colour is 255. - Colour Red : Red 255 / Green 0 / Blue 0 - Colour Green: Red 0 / Green 255 / Blue 0 - Colour Blue : Red 0 / Green 0 / Blue 255 D) Steps: 1) Create new region. (In the game, obviously but just in case) 2) Create bitmap in MS Paint. (Out of the game) For those who do not know: - Ctrl E / Or Under \"Image\", Select \"Attributes...\" - Set the width and height. Units are to be in Pixels. Select Colours. - Remember create a new picture do not use any of the pictures that are provided in the other regions 3) Based on the colour coding as stated above, create your desired region. - Do a maximum zoom for easier viewing. 4) Save as Config.bmp and place it in the folder of the new region that you created in step (1). 5) Congratulations, you now have your very own map. E) Further Illustration If you wish to make a 6 x 4 small region here is an example. Each letter, S, M, or L represents one pixel. Diagram A1.02.2 S: Small M: Medium L: Large 1234 1MMSS 2MMSS 3LLLL 4LLLL 5LLLL 6LLLL Therefore in this map you will have 1 large city, 1 medium city and 4 small cities. If for example your bit map is only 4 x 4 and you attempt this 1234 1MMSS 2MMSS 3LLLL 4LLLL Then it will result in only the medium and small city appearing. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[16]><> A1.02.3: Obliterate, Animals, Disasters and Trees 1) Obliterate Using obliterate auto-saves thus there is no reload. 2) Disappearing Animals They need forest cover to survive and further, it is more of a gimmick than anything. Do not be too perturbed by the mass suicides. 3) Disasters Fire disaster cannot be turned off. The rest of the disasters do not occur randomly and requires you to actively use them. The only exception is the riot disaster which occurs under certain circumstances. REFER: A1.06.3 for how to create a riot These are the list of disasters. A) Tornado B) Earthquake C) Fire D) Lightning E) Servo the Robot Attack. From the Sims. 4) Trees type and growth Each tree costs $3. How fast the trees grow depends on whether is it suitable for the climate. Climate is determined by the height of the city. It should be noted that the trees even of the same type planted in the same location do not have the same growth rate although their growth rate in general is similar. Table A1.02.3 GR: This is the growth rate rankings based on the default ground level. The earliest two started reaching its maximum size within 2 years while the longer ones took up to 3 over years. ------------------------- | Tree Type | GR | ------------------------- | Blue Spruce Pine | 3 | | Noble Fir Pine | 1 | | Maple | 1 | | Palm | 4 | | Oak | 2 | ------------------------- <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[17]><> A1.02.4: * Treatise on God & Natural Trees and Pollution There is a debate as to whether is there a difference with respect to effect on pollution between natural trees, those planted after the city was founded and God mode trees, those planted before the city was founded. Let me deal with the easy part. Both type of trees do actually remove pollution. An experiment that you could try is this. A) Simply start a new city with thickly planted God mode trees. B) Then build a coal power plant in the midst of the trees. C) Observe the level of pollution through the data map. D) Start demolishing the trees and you would see the pollution expanding Therefore one can conclude that God mode tree do also remove pollution. However, pollution can seep through if the pollution itself is very strong and that the tree cover is not thick enough. An experiment which I tried and which shows that there is no difference at least after Patch 2 is this: A) Start a city and plant God Mode trees B) Establish the City and plant Natural trees C) Wait for the natural trees to mature D) Place a coal power plant in each of the different forests, making sure that they line up E) Start demolishing roll by roll of trees and see in which area the pollution first seeps through. It is my conclusion that they both seep through at around the same area. Therefore at least with Patch 2, there is no difference between God mode trees and Natural trees. And even if there is a difference it is minute and insignificant. =======================================================================[18]=== A1.03: Zones \"I found Rome a city of bricks and left it a city of marble.\" Caesar Augustus. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[19]><> A1.03.1: Options: Zone Types The cost is similar for the zones with the same type of density. Also agriculture is low density industry. Commerce incorporates both services and offices thus there is no way to actively just select one for construction. You can select from residential, commercial and industrial zoning.

In other words low density housing does not mean low wealth residence. The only exception, to a certain extent is low density industry, which should really be called agriculture. The following table gives an explanation of density and types wealth levels since this is the part that some are confused about. Table A1.03.2 L: Low density zoning M: Medium Density zoning H: HIgh density zoning The key is the abbreviation used by the games in the game charts. ----------------------------------------------- Residential / Key | Tax | Zone Density | ----------------------------------------------- Poor (R$) | $ | L / M / H | Middle Class (R$$) | $$ | L / M / H | Rich (R$$$) | $$$ | L / M / H | ----------------------------------------------- Commercial | | ----------------------------------------------- Services (Cs$/$$/$$$) |$/$$/$$$| L / M / H | Offices (Co$$/$$$) |$$/$$$ | L / M / H | ----------------------------------------------- Industrial | | ----------------------------------------------- Farms (I-Ag | No Tax | L | Dirty (I-D) | $ | M / H | Manufacturing (I-M) | $$ | M / H | High Tech (I-HT) | $$$ | M / H | ----------------------------------------------- Changing density: Even after buildings are constructed, you can zone a denser zone without destroying the buildings that are built. If you are zoning a lower density zone than the building, then a smaller density building will soon take the place of its former higher density counterpart. There should be no use of the demolition button when changing zone density. It is only when the demand is satisfied after the denser zoning that the new denser buildings will appear. Thus you may have to wait quite a bit before seeing the effects of the denser zoning. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[21]><> A1.03.3: Zoning desirability The following table simply reflects what is required for construction of the various zones. I have not included all the factors. I have heard that the gradient of the land, location with relation to other zones also play a part but personally I find actually using them in the game to be quite difficult unless of course you have in your mind the layout of the entire city right at the start.

While I have yet to experience a meltdown, I did try using the toxic waste dump and the area that was irradiated was quickly abandoned. Customer and Traffic Volume: #: If you view the building you will see on information called customer. This translates to traffic volume or traffic congestion. Looking at the data map, I realised that the areas of commercial with red traffic has high customers. However, customers are also created by having more Sims in your city and region and also in having rich Sims. This is simply because the richer they are the more they can purchase. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[22]><> A1.03.4: Road Zots and Flood Filling 1) Actual Lack of connections Each building needs to have road access. Thus make sure that the arrows (<) in the lots face the roads, if not you will get the no connection sign. If a particular lot is not facing the road then you should zone in parts rather than zoning the entire area with one click and drag, thus making sure all of the (<) also face the roads. Alternatively, you could hit the [alt] key to change the layout of the lots. 2) Transitional lack of connection Sometimes when the area is being redeveloped, a no road zot will appear. It should usually disappear within a few months if not you may for to de-zone and rezone those affected tiles. 3) Flood filling To flood-fill, create the roads surrounding the zones, select the desired zone then click and hold it at one tile and the zone will fill up. Best used for irregular shaped zones. But because of the problem in (1), I not really recommend flood filling an area. After all you can easily fill up an irregular shaped area by doing it over different phases. 4) Undeveloped interior Sometimes even with auto roads on the interior does not get developed. This is especially so for industry which can easily zone up to 7x7 without auto-roads appearing. The reason for it being undeveloped is that the tiles touching the road develops small-single tile buildings leaving the interior without roads. The interior will only develop later in the game when either (i) huge multi-tile buildings appear or (2) when the single-tile industry expands into the interior. I do not really recommend huge zones especially for industries. While everything might work out in the long run, as John Maynard Keynes once said, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[23]><> A1.03.5: Agriculture 1) Amount of jobs Even if you see that the barn stating that there is only two jobs, that is under-reflective of the amount of jobs at that farm. I believe that is per tile. This is because I got a farmers market with only two large farms. After creating a large farm, pause your game and wait until about 5pm then you will see many cars leaving the farm and going home. Therefore logically the farm must employ more than just those few persons at the barn. 2) No farming taxes Farms only bring in jobs and do not add to your taxes. By the way if you are wandering why agriculture does not produce taxes, think of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and also countries like the US, Canada or Japan. You should be happy that the farms in your city do not demand massive subsidies from you or create inter-regional tensions by asking you to tax other farm goods to protect them. 3) Connections required Only roads and electricity is needed. Water is not needed. You should not even connect your pipes even if you wanted too unless you do not mind your Sims suffering from the indignity of drinking kiwi chocolate colour looking water. 4) Agriculture and pollution. While agriculture abhors pollution air pollution, it is nonchalant with regards to water pollution since they too produces water pollution. Of course this is not realistic as there are many types of water pollution. I mean I would not want to eat vegetables coming from a farm next to a LED factory that dumps its arsenic waste into the water table. 5) Reasons for agriculture There are several reasons for although I do not find them convincing in terms of actual benefits. (A) It is more for atmosphere rather than a means to make money. (B) It generates jobs, which bring in people and the demand for agriculture unlike other sectors is usually very high. But I prefer using non-agricultural industries to generate jobs at the start. (C) However, while agriculture does pollute the water it does have less air pollution as compared to the dirty industry. (D) The best argument from a beneficial point of view is so as to be able to build the farmer's market. However, since keeping them around is not necessary after you get the farm this means that agriculture is only good at the start of the game and should not be a permanent feature of the city unless you wish to keep the 'farming look' in your city. 6) Unable to convert land back to farms. Once the city begins getting quite developed, it is very unlikely that farms will be rebuilt on previously zoned land even if there is no pollution. One reason is because of the negative demand cap. This is since the more industries you have the demand cap of the farm becomes lower. REFER: A2.02: Demand Caps <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[24]><> A1.03.6 : Industrial Pollution 1) Industrial pollution The following table is a ROUGH guide to the length of the extension of the pollution. With the exception of the farms, which relates to water pollution the rest refers to air pollution. The figures refer to the total number of tiles the pollution extends. The level of pollution decreases as you move further. But I have included all level of pollution into the one figure. All these figures operate on the assumption that you have no trees or anything reducing pollution. Table A1.03.6 ---------------------------- Industry | Air | Water| ---------------------------- Farms | 0 | 12 | Dirty | 22 | 27 | Manufacturing | 8 | 14 | Hi-tech | 0 | 0 | ---------------------------- 3) Abandoned buildings These still produce pollution and on top of that attract crime and are prone to fires. Therefore even if your entire dirty industry is abandoned and all the buildings lie vacant, the air pollution will still be as bad as ever. =======================================================================[25]=== A1.04: Transportation <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[26]><> A1.04.1: Options: Transport Types 1) Road Vehicle Transport: Streets, Road and Highway This is the most basic form of transportation around. Streets have a very much smaller capacity about a tenth than roads while highway offers about four times more capacity than a road. They too have differing speeds with the streets being the lowest and the highway being the highest. Even buses add to the traffic of the roads. You can build diagonal roads but no diagonal streets. I have simply no idea why this is so. Because of the possibility of potholes you have the ability to repair it by building roads on top of it. But if you do lay a road over an existing one and even if the road is in perfect condition it will cost money. So do not waste money by laying roads over existing roads when you are happy dragging the road tool. Also if what the MySims state is correct, people do not like to live next to one of them. 2) Train Transport: Trains and Subway Both rails and subway have about the same capacity, the difference being that one operates underground and the other do not. The less obvious difference is that rails have the capacity for transporting factory goods. 3) Ports: Airport and Seaport These are primarily demand cap busters. The seaport serves the industry while the airport serves the commercial areas. It is often asked as to whether are the effects of an airport city wide or region wide. Its effect is only city wide. However, there is an indirect effect on the region. This is because after placement it will improve the demand, growth and economy of that city and as a result of that, the better city will have a stronger positive effect on neighbouring cities and such. Remember, these ports must be connected to the thing they serve, commercial areas for airports and industry for ports. And with relation to the airport, they can be upgraded. When your usage is close to the maximum, an offer of an upgrade will be made. An upgraded airport still takes up the small amount of space. REFER: A2.02: Demand Caps 4) Cost and Capacity Table A1.04.2: Transport $C: Cost to build / In the case of medium and large airports, this figure represents the upgrade cost. $M: Monthly maintenance cost CA: Capacity P: Passenger G: Goods in tons %: Treat this as a percentage when contrasted with the rest in that category -------------------------------------- Structure | $C | $M | CA | -------------------------------------- Cars | | -------------------------------------- Roads | 10 | 0.10|100% | Streets | 5 | 0.05|1000% | Bus Stops | 150 | 5 |1000P | High way | 600 | 1 |4000% | Cloverleaf | 3000| 26 |4000% | -------------------------------------- Trains | | -------------------------------------- Railway track | 8 | 0.03|3000% | Passenger Sta. | 100 | 10 |2000P | Freight Sta. | 100 | 10 |2000G | Subway | 156 | 0.30|3000% | Subway Sta. | 500 | 20 |2000P | -------------------------------------- Airports | | -------------------------------------- Small Strip |20000| 700 |10200P| Med.

The first is when you drag the highway across another highway. The other is by placing a cloverleaf on an ALREADY EXISTING highway crossing. While diagonal highways are possible diagonal highways cannot create cloverleaf or even cross each other. The following is a diagram of a cloverleaf and on ramp. Please note the minimum length required for its placements Cloverleaf Requirements: A) Excluding the middle intersection there must at least be 6 tiles. Therefore the total length of each side must at least be 14 tiles. B) When using the cloverleaf option instead of the auto cloverleaf, there must already be an existing highway that satisfies requirement (A). Onramp Requirements A) Length of the on ramp is 6 tiles. Thus the highway must have 6 free tiles. B) If there is a intersection whether do you have a cloverleaf built there or not, you need to have at least a minimum distance of 6 tiles. C) The on ramp cannot be placed at the last tile of a highway. There must be at least one tile of highway free at the end of the highway that will not be used when you place the on ramp.

If it is possible the tunnel option will appear. Often for smaller size hills, it is the gradient that determines whether a tunnel option will appear. The steeper it is at the point of entry and exit the higher the chance of getting the tunnel option. 2) Underwater tunnels This seems to be a bug of sorts. The cost of building an underwater tunnel far outweighs any actual benefit if any. The steps are: A) Take a piece of land without water. B) Build a tunnel across. If the land to too flat, either raise all the land or just lower the entrance and exit. C) Now lower the land in between the entrance and the exit. D) Hey presto, the tunnel is still there yet there is nothing in between. A physical matter teleportation device? This also means that you can have a tunnel functioning even if the hill is removed and there is only land that is lower in between. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[29]><> A1.04.4: Bridges: Roads, Highways and Rails 1) Construction Just simply select the road or highway option and drag it across the water or if you have a steep chasm a bridge is also possible. Just drag until the bridge appears. If a bridge still does not appear try to move the starting point a bit further back away from the gap. If it still does not appear, then you may have to do some terrain adjustment at either the start or end point. It is impossible to build a bridge where the start and end points are very steep. 2) Golden Gate This appears if you use the highway as the basis of the bridge. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[30]><> A1.04.5: Trains, Turnings and Freight 1) Rail Turnings The tracks cannot turn 90 degrees and must be turned gradually over three tiles. The following diagram illustrates a 4 way crossing. You cannot place a road through any gradual railway turns. Diagram A1.04.5i R: Railway tracks. No road placement C: Railway tracks. Only at these areas can you build a road across like a rail crossing. 1234567 1 C 2 R 3 RRR 4CRRRRRC 5 RRR 6 R 7 C 2) Freight Stations Freight trains serve one purpose, that is to send industrial goods out of the city. Since they only send industrial goods, there is no need to connect rails that have only freight stations and are not transporting passengers to either a residential area or a commercial area. Secondly you need to connect the train tracks to a connection. Think of freight as a different kind of Sim. Instead of going from residential to his work, freight goes from industrial to a neighbour connection. Freight stations are somewhat like a transfer or transit point like a Sim walking to a subway and then taking the subway to work. There are two methods of sending goods out on track: A) Direct: If your train track runs through an industrial zone, it will automatically pick up goods even if there is no station B) Indirect: Freight station is used where goods are send by road to the station who then take it away. Therefore if all your industry already has a short freight trip there is no need to construct a freight station. Other than being superfluous the trucks going to your freight station will add to the road traffic. 3) No trains: Low passenger usage Personally I prefer using rails for inter rather than intra city travel. But that is just my preference and that rails can perfectly well be used for intra city travel. If you are unable to see the train it means that either you have a bad rail line which is not properly linked up. Or that since the trains like the cars are a mere representation of the usage of the transport, the usage could be so low that trains do not even appear. If you see a train, just follow it and if the usage is not too high it will disappear somewhere along the line. You can see trains appearing out of nowhere like a ghost train. Like a road, just because you do not see cars there does not mean that the road is faulty. Furthermore, this reflects the usage on the tracks not the station. It measures track congestion and usage. 4) Rail-Station placement It has been suggested that you should place the track at the back of the train station. However, I do have success in placing the tracks at the side of the train station. Make sure that there a road linking to it also. Diagram A1.04.5ii >: Train Station and direction of the arrow. Thus it is point away to the back of the station. =: Rail -: Road === --- =>>>- >>> >>> ->>>= =>>>- >>> >>> ->>>= --- === (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) I have had success with all of the above formations. As long as the road also touches the station it is perfectly fine to put it on any side. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[31]><> A1.04.6: Junctions, Roundabouts, Diagonal and Subway bug 1) Junctions and traffic Traffic increases at each junction not simply because more people arrive there but also because the amount of cars it can take is much less than normal roads. So try not to build too much junctions 2) Streets are not Solution A street is not a solution to heavy traffic. Using a street to resolve traffic jams is somewhat like a person stating that the way to reduce traffic is to narrow the road. And then stating it is a success because there are less cars on that road now. Of course there are less cars, since one had reduce the capacity of the road. But that does not mean that the traffic situation had improved. One may claim that as a result of it the junction is question is now green thus stating that it is a success. But the reason it is green is because all the traffic is stuck behind the street. The street acts as a filter allowing some to pass but all needs to pass. Hence a green junction does not necessarily mean that your experiment with streets is working. Therefore do not build a street on the tile leading up to a junction so that the traffic lights will not appear. Traffic lights are not prima facie bad. Also if your roundabout is based on this street design it will not work to ease traffic. 3) Roundabouts One may not create a proper roundabout without any traffic unless one goes through a whole host of building and demolishing or using a street. The effect is that a proper roundabout cannot be created. Thus they are merely eye candy and do not really serve to ease your traffic. Note that my definition of a roundabout is a road junctions type that has no traffic lights. 4) Diagonal Roads and highway As stated earlier, there is no diagonal streets. For the most part diagonal construction just add to the variety of your city. It however does have several detriments: A) Diagonal highways cannot have cloverleaf B) It waste space. C) It constricts the buildings around it. 5) Subway infinite loop bug Patch 2 resolved this problem. But for those without the patch for some reason or other. this here is the problem Setting up a subway network as in the diagram simply loops the passengers through each station without actually sending them anywhere. Therefore while it may be profitable the subway system is not working. Diagram A1.04.6 -: Subway Tracks S: Subway Station - - - - ---S----S----S---S- - - - - - - - - ---S----S----S---S- - - - - - - - - ---S----S----S---S- - - - - Therefore do not create junctions under your subway stations. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[32]><> A1.04.7: Maintenance, Income and Distress 1) Potholes You have reduced your funding for the roads, which you should not have done. You have to replace the roads rather than raising funding and waiting for repairs which will not be done automatically. Make sure you do not build roads on roads that are in good condition as that will cost you money too. 2) Income You can make money from your mass transit. The best case scenario would be for it not just to fund itself but also provide you with an income. You can check your income under the budget. 3) Ports under distress Often I hear of people complaining that their ports seem to be distressed even if they had a full maintenance. This I believe was resolved in Patch 2. It is stated in the fix list that they have \"Addressed issue for airports and seaports initially showing up distressed.\" <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[33]><> A1.04.8: * Coverage and Travelling Time 1) Station \"Coverage\" It was stated in an official Sim City 4 article, 'Tips & Tricks - Transportation' that \"your Sims are USUALLY only willing to walk about 6 to 8 tiles to and from bus stops.\" I have added to capitalization by myself. Therefore what many people as the “range” or “coverage” of a station commonly actually refers to the distance that people can walk and travel before the time runs out. Before interpreting that sentence it is best to clearly define and explain some basic concepts and terms i) Trip The basis of calculation. The time one takes to go from one's residence to one's place of work. ii) Walking Time This refers to the time one takes to walk to and from the mass transit. iii) Mass Travel Time This refers to the time taken to move by mass transit from one place to another. iv) Transfer Time The time taken to change modes of transport REFER: A1.04.9: Transit Mode v) Total Trip Time = Walking + Mass + Transfer vi) Maximum Trip Time > Total Trip Time The maximum trip time I believe is 150 minutes. This is the time one must reach one's work place. vii) Actual maximum trip time It is my opinion that while 150 minutes is the cut off, not all class of residence will have 150 minutes. As commute time is a huge part of determining desirability, it means that for the richer Sims they do not like a high commute. Thus they may move out of their house even before reaching 150 minutes. The effect is thus that the house will be downgraded. Thus 150 minutes is the time limit for poor ($) Sims but not the richer Sims. A) Restrictive Interpretation This interpretation operates restrictively downwards such that 8 tiles is the maximum range one would walk. It means that Sims will only use the mass transit if it is in within an 8 tile radius. The basis of this is that walking, as compared to other modes of transport takes a lot of time. Therefore people who walked 8 tiles to the station will have less time left in his total trip time hence they will not be able to walk another 8 tiles to their workplace. Therefore the result of this interpretation means that you should not space out your stations too much if you want an effective mass transit system. In fact the proponents of this interpretation believe that 6 tiles is the optimum range. B) Liberal Interpretation This interpretation operates liberally upwards such that 6 to 8 is just the mean range. And as such you can travel more than 8 tiles to and from a station and there is no cap on the distance one is from a station. All that matters is that the total trip time is less than the maximum trip time. The basis of this is based on the later part of the sentence \"... 8 tiles to and from bus stops.\" That suggests that people can walk further than 8 tiles but that generally they only walk 8 tiles to a station. In other words like the restrictive interpretation it focuses on the total trip time but gives a more liberal interpretation such that one could perhaps walk 12 tiles to the station and then walk another 1 tile after alighting to reach the office. Therefore the result of this interpretation means that you can space your stations further apart although placing more closer together would still always be a boost. C) Combined Interpretation This interpretation takes into account the fact that walking do indeed take a large part of the travelling time but it also acknowledges that there is no cap on the number of tiles one would walk. Therefore the result of this interpretation is that while you can space the stations further apart as your city expands and there is more strain on traffic, the mass transit time will become longer thereby reducing the amount of time remaining for the walking time. In other words while the liberal approach is right theoretically, practically one must adopt the closer station placement supported by the restrictive approach. 2) Single maximum trip time theory Central to the discussion relating to station coverage is the assumption that people can indeed walk more than 8 tiles and that all that matters is that the total trip time does not exceed the maximum trip time. There are multiple experiments you can do to test this out. One of them is: A) Start a new city. B) Build a Residential and an Industrial zone separated from each other without any road connections between them. C) Build a subway station in each of the zones and connect them up but make no road connections. D) Make the distance from your residential area to the subway more than 8 tiles and make the subway directly in the midst of the industrial zone. E) The length of the subway should be short, one tile. F) As long as ANY one of the people reaches work it will show that people can walk more than 8 tiles in general and in using a mass transit I stated ANY because even if only one building has work it is proof that people can transfer. Because if it is impossible all will have no work. The rest of the people without work can thus be attributed to this particular bad transport network and not the impossibility of Sims being able to transfer to stations side by side. The conclusion is that people can indeed walk more than 8 tiles. 3) Travelling Time and the Heuristic coefficient Somebody called \"the7trumpets\" at Simtropolis found out and determined how travel time is actually specifically calculated taking into account traffic and other things. But it is really complicated and extremely mathematical with the use of the Heuristic coefficient. Suffice to say I am not posting it here as this is a SimCity 4 FAQ not a mathematical text. If you are interested simply go to the site and search for it. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[34]><> A1.04.9: Transit Mode People can change their mode of transportation such as from walking to bus. But not all types of transportation are mutually compatible with another. Table A1.04.9 W : Walking. This is only on roads and streets. No walking allowed on highway and tunnels. B : Bus. This building has negative residential effect. T : Trains / Railway S : Subway Y/N: Yes / No WA : This means that connection to this mode of transport is possible but it is done indirectly through the use of walking again. Thus for example a bus passenger connects to a train by walking out of the bus station and into the train station. ------------------------- Type of |Connects To: | Movement |W |C |B |T |S | ------------------------- Walking |--|N |Y |Y |Y | Car |N |--|N |Y |N | Bus |Y |N |--|WA|WA| Trains |Y |Y |WA|--|WA| Subway |Y |N |WA|WA|--| ------------------------- For indirect walking connection, simply place both the stations side by side. Take note that walking takes up the longest time so try not to have that many connections. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[35]><> A1.04.10: * Transit Station The big debate in this is whether does one need to leave a tile in between two stations for the Sims to switch transport mode. Thus it means having a bus stop beside a train station. This is because in the Prima Guide it is stated that \"To change transportation modes, there must be at least one tile of road between the stations.\" However, if you look at the official Sim City site under the 'About > Inside Scope' you will see an article call \"Building a better Transit System\" by Alex Peck, Software Engineer. Look at the second page of the article: http://simcity.ea.com/about/inside_scoop/transit2.php Figure 4 shows a Train station connected to a Bus station. This thus means that there is a conflicting reports from two official sources. It is my opinion that the latter argument at the website is the correct one. It should be noted that the Prima Guide was done months before the release of the game and there are multiple errors in it that have been confirmed. But I will prove it to you with an experiment. 1) Experiment This experiment is done in a similar fashion to the Single maximum trip time theory experiment in (A1.04.8). A) Simply create a residential and a work place in a new city that is only connected by rail or subway. B) Stop the rail or subway before the work zone and place another station such as the bus stop right next to the rail/subway. See if they manage to get to work. C) Make sure that you place a tunnel between the station and the work place because Sims cannot walk into a tunnel. This is to prevent people from walking to work. Thus their only option is to take the bus. D) As long as ANY one of the people reaches work it will show that people can transfer even if the stations are beside each other. I stated ANY because even if only one building has work it is proof that people can transfer. Because if it is impossible all will have no work. The rest of the people without work can thus be attributed to this particular bad transport network and not the impossibility of Sims being able to transfer to stations side by side. 2) Graphics and Tunnel Central to this argument is the one that Sims cannot walk through a tunnel. It was stated by the makers that the graphics are mere representation of the simulation and are not exactly accurate. If you look closely at the tunnel you may see people walking into or out of the tunnel. However, it is my opinion that this is just a graphic. It does not actually represent people moving in and out of the tunnel. Think of the situation where we put in one reward type building in a city with 0 population (Industrial cities) yet there are people cheering it. Alternatively you can see people walking about in a large plaza and yet there is no people in the city. If you are not convinced, you could perhaps lengthen the distance between the bus station and the industrial zone. 3) Combination Argument It is possible that both arguments are correct. Let us at the prima guide statement again. \"To change transportation modes, there must be at least one tile of road BETWEEN the stations.\" (My emphasis) To interpret this, we have to give a liberal reading to the word 'between.' Between does not simply mean sandwiched and in the middle. The prima guide could simply be stating that there must be a road leading from one station to the other. The idea they are trying to convey is that while the stations may be built side by side, unlike actual transit hubs they are not linked internally and thus the people have to exit it and walk on the roads and then re-enter the other station. 4) Directional explanations Since Sims travel in the direction to their destination and would not deviate too much to take advantage of a mass transit or a less congested road the reason for the seeming failure of these transit stations, if you do have a failure, can be attributed to them. This is because, If the Sim exit the station and his work place is to the south but the bus station is to the north, then he will not use the bus station as moving there means moving further away from his destination. 5) Entrance / Exit explanations Prior to placement you can see the (<) of the station. Make sure that it faces the road and also the road that the other station faces. If they are pointing in opposite directions, it may account for the failure of these transit stations, if you do have a failure. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[36]><> A1.04.11: Choice of Transportation While everyone in your city has the ability to take all the types of transportation, whether do they actually take it is dependant on how rich they are. Classified broadly there are three means people get around the city. They are, public, private or flexible. Flexible means that the people will have no qualms about using either public mass transit or private cars to get around as long as they reach their destination in the shortest possible time. Table A1.04.11 LW : Low wealth residents MW : Medium wealth residents HW : High wealth residents PR : Private PU : Public FS : Flexible short approach * : Least desire ** : Moderate desire ***: Greatest desire --------------------- Type | PR | FS | PU | --------------------- HW |*** |* |* | MW |* |*** |** | LW |** |* |*** | --------------------- What this means is that even if you have the best mass transit system any mayor can offer if the rich populate your city then very few people will use the mass transit. This is even if taking their cars to work will be longer or even to the extent that they cannot reach their work place. Therefore the only means to deal with them is to do build your road network such that it forces them to use the type of transport you want them to use. This is especially so when building a highway since Sims always use the \"shortest\" possible route to work even if that route is completely congested. REFER: B7.08.3: Paternalistic Approach to traffic <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[37]><> A1.04.12: Overcapacity 1) Theory The effect of overcapacity is simple. It reduces speed. Overcapacity does not only apply to roads but also to subway tracks and train tracks. This is different from station efficiency and capacity when you query the station. -- I will quote an email Chris McFadyen sent me for it explains the capacity of tracks excellently. I have changed edited some of the wording and the illustration but the words are still his: Traffic at stations are cumulative. Say we have 5 stations: A >>>>> B >>>>> C >>>>> D >>>>> E If we have a 1000 people each at A, B, C and D that want to get to E. Train leaves Station 'A' with 1000 passengers, gets to 'B' and picks up another 1000, gets to 'C', etc... When they get to E they would be dropping off 4000 passengers. Adding more subway stops between, such as: A >>>>> B >>>>> C >> F >> D >>>>> E Station 'F' would not increase the capacity of the tracks if nobody got off at 'F'. Therefore all 'F' does is to add to the capacity if nobody or if less people got off then those who got on. End Quote. Thanks to Chris McFadyen. -- You should note that just because when you place station 'F' the usage of C and D falls, it does not mean that this does not hold true. Usage at the station is different from usage at the tracks. An analogy may help you to better understand. Let us say there is a huge train station which can handle hundreds of trains at any given time. But if there is only one single track leading out of that station, it means that all hundred of trains will have to use that one single line. Therefore the solution is not to build bigger train stations but to build more lines. 2) Effect The effect of overcapacity is simple. You will have a jam and the speed will slow down. You can slow down up to 70% of the optimum travelling speed in the tiles that are overcapacity. 3) Distinguishing Track and Station overcapacity As stated above these track and station have different overcapacity levels. However the method to determine track overcapacity is useful only for rails. Track Overcapacity: Look at the rail line. The longer or the more number of train the more congested the line. Station Overcapacity: Query the station, to see its usage. =======================================================================[38]=== A1.05: Utilities \"There once was a nightclub called Jaks, Where people went in their stacks. They queued out the door, To get on the floor, All dressed in their coats and their hats. But, on this one fateful night, Our crew, they had quite a fright. They were getting on down, To Lee’s funky sounds, When someone looked up and said “shite!” The crew all stopped and looked up, Someone shrieked as it dripped in their cup. The roof made a rumble, The pipe took a tumble, The crowd were all covered in muck! How strange were the looks on their faces, All covered in paper and wastage. One girl, she threw up, Her boyfriend did duck, As he knelt down to tie his shoelaces. Lee and the crew were in shock, It was barely past ten O’clock. People were wailing, Cleaning methods were failing. When would the sewage flow stop? The bouncers all knew what to do, But first they shut off the loo! The crowd, they went mad, For they all smelled so bad! So they called for our heroes, two. The crowd were assembled outside, In the LeisureWorld foyer so wide. They all left their drinks, Exclaiming “This stinks!” But Shaun took it all in his stride. Teamed up with his deputy Dom, They needed to right this wrong. For such a huge task, They never would ask. But, for their crew, they had to be strong. There seemed so much to do, Luminar concerned that people may sue. The plumbers were called, New pipes were installed And soon the place was like new. So Jaks, they made the front pages Their best publicity in ages. With the clean-up complete, And profits now sweet, The crew all deserved higher wages! But what did we learn from this night? ... that things don’t always go right! Try as hard as we may, You just have to say. That sometimes reality does bite. Back at Jaks, beer was again flowing, The crowd was positively growing. So, back in his place, With that look on his face, No chance of Lee’s music now slowing. So this brings an end to our tale, Of music, heartache and ale. Of his crew, Shaun should be proud, For no others could have handled that crowd. They proved to the rest, That they were surely the best, And all lived to make another sale!\" Samantha, \"Music, Heartache & Ale.\" <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[39]><> A1.05.1: Options: Utilities Type 1) Electricity They obviously produce electricity for your city, without which the city will not grow and Yogi bear and Keiko the whale from Free willy will roam the area in peace.

The water coverage extends 6 tiles. So you should have 12 tiles between pipes and 6 to the edge of the map. Electrical coverage extends to 4 tiles. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[41]><> A1.05.3: Maintenance, Decay and Overcapacity If your pipes are leaking, your poles are sparking then your funding is too low. Raise them and replace the broken pipes. 1) Life span Even if you fully fund your utilities, after a certain amount of years they will be moribund. Also as your utility reaches its end life, its capacity falls drastically such that it is more cost efficient to replace the utility in question. 2) Rate of decay The rate of decay or deterioration increases both when you are operating close to capacity. Therefore keep it at 70% capacity for the power plants. But leave the water funding alone as lowering it does not save that much and it will cause even greater problems with burst pipes and damaged property. However I recommend reduce power as you can save quite a bit of money and can avoid sparking poles which increase the probability of fire. The rate of decay also increase when you lower funding from the 100%. And it increase greatly if funding is below 50%. 3) Sparking Poles Changing the individual power station funding affects the global funding. Therefore it might be impossible to prevent sparking lines short of keeping funding full, which I do not recommend. Furthermore if too much power is channelled through one line, it too will spark. Hence try to arrange you city such that you do not need that much electricity lines. Since electricity can be transferred four tiles, you can zone one tile every four tiles to prevent the use of poles. Sometimes for some odd reason, the electricity does not travel 4 tiles in one area. To search for the break in the chain, simply place the query button over the tiles to see which one has power or not. Just place another zone in between the area of the break. Diagram: A1.05.3 P: Power Plant Z: Zones. It can be residential, commercial or industrial .: Empty tiles P....Z....Z....Z Because deterioration occurs much faster when global funding is below 50%, I recommend that you should not build a new power plant until the present one is close to full capacity. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[42]><> A1.05.4: Negative Environmental Degradation (NED) Yes, I do know I am using a double negative in this title. But NED sounds good to me. 1) Water Pollution This has the effect if it is high enough to cause a shut down of your water pumping system. To reduce that probability simply build the pumps and towers away from polluted water areas. And also to refrain from making connections to landfills or agricultural areas. 2) Water treatment By right you should not need to use this building. This is required if the water pollution is so bad that your water pumps cannot work. Place at the source of the water although there is an argument out there that one should place it at the source of the pollution. As long as your water pump does not stop for reason of pollution, I do not think this is needed even if your \"city is full of filth\" and that your Sims are drinking chocolate kiwi coloured water. 3) Landfill Connection Bug All landfill requires connection even if you new landfill is connected to your old landfill that has road connections. There is a bug that has yet to be completely resolved by Patch 2. It is stated in the patch that they: \"Addressed landfills to combine easier if drawn adjacent to each other. Still problematical if drawn between two landfills, so try adding them one at a time.\" Remember that the roads must not only just touch one point of the landfill but must at least cover the entire one side of a landfill. 4) Recycling Centre The 20% is not cumulative. This due to its costs can only have a limited impact on garbage disposal. <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><[43]><> A1.05.5: * Bio degradable landfills Landfills decompose over time in this game. Of course this does not make much sense unless everything in SimWorld is bio degradable. 1) Decommission Only if you actually removed road access can it be possible to determine whether is a landfill actually decommissioned. A landfill not connected would display a no road zot sign. Also if you look at the garbage chart you will see a drop in the total garbage capacity. 2) Rate of decay The formula for the rate of decay is simple. Trash degrades at 7% a month, however, the upper limit is set at 15 tons. Thus even if 7% of your total trash is more than 15 tons, only 15 tons will decay that month. There are thus two time frame of decay. the (1) being the time when 15 tons are being degraded each month. The (2) is when less than 15 tons are degraded each month. In my opinion the turning point occurs when you have about 215 tons of trash left. It is because after that, the 7% rate would only yield less than 15 tons. Therefore to calculate the rate of decay of the first phase, all you have to do is this: A) Base - 215 Time 1 = __________ 15 Base: Current amount of waste in the landfill B) log (Y / Base) Time 2 = ______________ log 0.93 Y: Amount waste must decompose to for all to disappear Base: Current amount of waste left in the landfill (215) log 0.93: Rate of decay at 7% C) Amount of time to decompose in months = Time 1 + Time 2 The landfill total is simply calculated by counting the number of tiles in that landfill and multiplying it with the capacity of each tile, which is 300 tons. Alternatively, you could cut off road access and then check the garbage chart to see how much total capacity has fallen. That amount would thus be that landfill's capacity. Obviously this operates on the assumption that the landfill is filled to capacity. Generally a 4x3 landfill will take 10 years 11 months to decay. A 2x2 landfill will take 14 years 4 months. 2) Rate of decay cannot be increased Until I did the experiment on landfills, I was operating under the notion that a waste to power plant, exporting or trees help increase the rate of decomposition. There is a belief that if you have a road connected from your landfill to your waste to power plant, the garbage will be transferred to the waste to power plant. Therefore increasing the rate of decay. A similar argument is also made when you have a neighbour deal. Also there is a belief albeit held less widely that planting trees around a landfill will increase the rate of decay. Let me show that after an experiment, all the above hypothesis no longer holds true. This is the experiment: A) Build three landfills of equal sizes apart from each other. B) Wait for all of them to fill up. Check your garbage chart to make sure that total garbage exceeds total garbage capacity such that the Sims are wallowing in there own filth. C) Pause the game. D) Build a waste to power plant beside one landfill. E) Demolish the roads leading to the other two landfills. F) Select one landfill without the road connections and surround it completely and utterly with trees. G) Make sure that the waste to power plant can sufficiently handle all the trash in your city. H) Take note of the date, unpause and wait for the landfill to be cleared. The conclusion is that both those landfills without road connections was cleared at the same time. Hence trees have no effect. Secondly, the landfill that was connected took a bit longer, about a month. Therefore a waste to power plant does help increase the rate of decay. You can try the same experiment with an export deal. However, because the difference between the decommissioned landfill and the one that is still linked up to the road, I believe that there really is no need to demolish the road leading up to it. By the way if you are interested it took 14 years 4 months to clear a 4 tile landfill. =======================================================================[44]=== A1.06: Public Service Commission \"Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country.\" John F.

R. 648 To protect the right to obtain firearms for security, and to use firearms in defense of self, family, or home, and to provide for the enforcement of such right. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES February 5, 2003 Mr. Wilson of South Carolina introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To protect the right to obtain firearms for security, and to use firearms in defense of self, family, or home, and to provide for the enforcement of such right. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Citizens' Self-Defense Act of 2003''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) Police cannot protect, and are not legally liable for failing to protect, individual citizens, as evidenced by the following: (A) The courts have consistently ruled that the police do not have an obligation to protect individuals, only the public in general. For example, in Warren v. District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, 444 A.2d 1 (D.C. App. 1981), the court stated: ``[C]ourts have without exception concluded that when a municipality or other governmental entity undertakes to furnish police services, it assumes a duty only to the public at large and not to individual members of the community.''. (B) Former Florida Attorney General Jim Smith told Florida legislators that police responded to only 200,000 of 700,000 calls for help to Dade County authorities. (C) The United States Department of Justice found that, in 1989, there were 168,881 crimes of violence for which police had not responded within 1 hour. (2) Citizens frequently must use firearms to defend themselves, as evidenced by the following: (A) Every year, more than 2,400,000 people in the United States use a gun to defend themselves against criminals--or more than 6,500 people a day. This means that, each year, firearms are used 60 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives. (B) Of the 2,400,000 self-defense cases, more than 192,000 are by women defending themselves against sexual abuse. (C) Of the 2,400,000 times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year, 92 percent merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers. Less than 8 percent of the time, does a citizen kill or wound his or her attacker. (3) Law-abiding citizens, seeking only to provide for their families' defense, are routinely prosecuted for brandishing or using a firearm in self- defense. For example: (A) In 1986, Don Bennett of Oak Park, Illinois, was shot at by 2 men who had just stolen $1,200 in cash and jewelry from his suburban Chicago service station. The police arrested Bennett for violating Oak Park's handgun ban. The police never caught the actual criminals. (B) Ronald Biggs, a resident of Goldsboro, North Carolina, was arrested for shooting an intruder in 1990. Four men broke into Biggs' residence one night, ransacked the home and then assaulted him with a baseball bat. When Biggs attempted to escape through the back door, the group chased him and Biggs turned and shot one of the assailants in the stomach. Biggs was arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon--a felony. His assailants were charged with misdemeanors. (C) Don Campbell of Port Huron, Michigan, was arrested, jailed, and criminally charged after he shot a criminal assailant in 1991. The thief had broken into Campbell's store and attacked him. The prosecutor plea- bargained with the assailant and planned to use him to testify against Campbell for felonious use of a firearm. Only after intense community pressure did the prosecutor finally drop the charges. (4) The courts have granted immunity from prosecution to police officers who use firearms in the line of duty. Similarly, law-abiding citizens who use firearms to protect themselves, their families, and their homes against violent felons should not be subject to lawsuits by the violent felons who sought to victimize them. SEC. 3. RIGHT TO OBTAIN FIREARMS FOR SECURITY, AND TO USE FIREARMS IN DEFENSE OF SELF, FAMILY, OR HOME; ENFORCEMENT. (a) Reaffirmation of Right.--A person not prohibited from receiving a firearm by Section 922(g) of title 18, United States Code, shall have the right to obtain firearms for security, and to use firearms-- (1) in defense of self or family against a reasonably perceived threat of imminent and unlawful infliction of serious bodily injury; (2) in defense of self or family in the course of the commission by another person of a violent felony against the person or a member of the person's family; and (3) in defense of the person's home in the course of the commission of a felony by another person. (b) Firearm Defined.--As used in subsection (a), the term ``firearm'' means-- (1) a shotgun (as defined in section 921(a)(5) of title 18, United States Code); (2) a rifle (as defined in section 921(a)(7) of title 18, United States Code); or (3) a handgun (as defined in section 10 of Public Law 99- 408). (c) Enforcement of Right.-- (1) In general.--A person whose right under subsection (a) is violated in any manner may bring an action in any United States district court against the United States, any State, or any person for damages, injunctive relief, and such other relief as the court deems appropriate. (2) Authority to award a reasonable attorney's fee.--In an action brought under paragraph (1), the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing plaintiff a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs. (3) Statute of limitations.--An action may not be brought under paragraph (1) after the 5-year period that begins with the date the violation described in paragraph (1) is discovered. <all>",

The agency obtained a search warrant for a TorMail account connected to a Florida man accused of stealing credit card numbers in order to search its own copy of the database. It appears that the FBI acquired the database while using malware to investigate Freedom Hosting last year. As Wired put it:\n\nThe tactic suggests the FBI is adapting to the age of big-data with an NSA-style collect-everything approach, gathering information into a virtual lock box, and leaving it there until it can obtain specific authority to tap it later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past six months, we've learned that the FBI's using malware to expose the anonymous internet and the NSA's been going after Tor for years. And now it seems that federal authorities have been successful in breaking down the wall of anonymity that kept the internet safe for a lot of users. We've also learned that despite his advisors' recommendations, President Obama is content continuing the bulk collection of data that drew scrutiny to the NSA in the first place, albeit in a different form. And so while Tor and its related services are still good for a lot of things, anonymity is apparently no longer one of them. [Wired]",

  "latent_20720": "One of the PS4's most useful features—in-home remote streaming over a high-speed router—will finally be widely available without the need for proprietary Sony hardware soon. Sony announced on Tuesday that PS4 System Update version 3.5 will bring Remote Play to Windows and Macintosh computers. While the system update will launch in beta tomorrow, the streaming feature won't be available until a full release expected later in the month.\n\nUntil now, Remote Play has only been available on Sony's own PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV hardware, as well as certain Sony Xperia phones (Update: we forgot about the phones when this was originally posted. Ars regrets the error). With the portable Vita all but dead in a tough mobile marketplace and the PlayStation TV in the process of being discontinued, Sony now seems willing to expand this useful feature to a much wider set of general computing devices.\n\nLast year, Microsoft introduced the ability to stream Xbox One games from an in-home network to any Windows 10 computer, a feature that we found surprisingly robust in tests . Sony's new Remote Play expansion goes a bit further than Microsoft's in also allowing Mac owners to get in on the streaming.\n\nSteam has allowed users to stream gameplay to and from any computer on the same in-home network since early 2014. Last year, Valve released the $50, streaming-focused Steam Link to help PC players stream games to the living room TV; we found that hardware a bit wanting in the quality department.\n\nPS4 system update version 3.5 also lets users go \"incognito\" to appear offline when they are playing and adds social features making it easier to gather friends together in an online party.",

  "latent_21252": "ISTANBUL — Three suspected Daesh suicide bombers targeted the international terminal of Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport Tuesday, killing at least 36 people and wounding many others, Turkish officials said. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said 36 were dead as well as the three suicide bombers. Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said 147 were wounded. Another senior government official told The Associated Press the death toll could climb much higher.\n\nSecurity officials block the road towards Turkey's largest airport, Istanbul Ataturk, Turkey, June 28.

( Defne Karadeniz / GETTY IMAGES )\n\nThe senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government protocol, at first said close to 50 people had already died, but later said that the figure was expected to rise to close to 50. Yildirim said three suicide bombers were responsible for the attack and all initial indications suggest the Daesh group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, was behind it. \"The findings of our security forces point at the Daesh organization as the perpetrators of this terror attack,\" Yildirim told reporters at the airport, using the Arabic name for the militant group. \"Even though the indications suggest Daesh, our investigations are continuing.\"\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nYildirim said the attackers arrived at the airport in a taxi and blew themselves up after opening fire. Asked whether a fourth attacker might have escaped, he said authorities have no such assessment but are considering every possibility. The victims included some foreigners, he said, adding that many of the wounded have minor injuries but others are more badly hurt. Another Turkish official said two of the attackers detonated explosives at the entrance of the international arrivals terminal after police fired at them, while the third blew himself up in the parking lot. The official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government regulations and cited interior ministry information, said none of the attackers managed to get past security checks at the terminal’s entrance. Turkish airports have security checks at both the entrance of terminal buildings and then later before entry to departure gates.\n\nRoads around the airport were sealed off for regular traffic after the attack and several ambulances could be seen driving back and forth. Hundreds of passengers were flooding out of the airport and others were sitting on the grass. Hevin Zini, 12, had just arrived from Duesseldorf, Germany, with her family and was in tears from the shock.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\n“There was blood on the ground,” she told The Associated Press. “Everything was blown up to bits ... if we had arrived two minutes earlier, it could have been us.” South African Judy Favish, who spent two days in Istanbul as a layover on her way home from Dublin, had just checked in when she heard an explosion followed by gunfire and a loud bang. She says she hid under the counter for some time.\n\nFavish says passengers were ushered to a cafeteria at the basement level where they were kept for more than an hour before being allowed outside. Two South African tourists, Paul and Susie Roos from Cape Town, were at the airport and due to fly home at the time of the explosions. “We came up from the arrivals to the departures, up the escalator when we heard these shots going off,” Paul Roos said. “There was this guy going roaming around, he was dressed in black and he had a hand gun.” Yildirim said air traffic at the airport, which was suspended after the attack, had resumed to normal. The prime minister called for national unity and “global co-operation” in combatting terrorism. “This (attack) has shown once again that terrorism is a global threat,” Yildirim said. “This is a heinous planned attack that targeted innocent people.” He suggested that the attack was linked to what he said was Turkey’s success against Kurdish rebels as well as steps Ankara took on Monday toward mending strained ties with Israel and Russia. “It is meaningful that this heinous attack came at a time when we have become successful in the fight against separatist terrorism ... and at a time when we started a process of normalizing ties with our neighbours,” Yildirim said. Yildirim insisted there was no security lapse at the airport but said the fact that the attackers were carrying weapons “increased the severity” of the attack. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Twitter that Canada “strongly comdemns tonight’s deadly attack in Turkey.” Trudeau added that his “thoughts and prayers” are with the victims as “we stand with our allies against terrorism.” Foreign Affairs Minister Stéphane Dion also issued a statement strongly condemning the “appalling” attack. Dion offered condolences to the family and friends of the victims and wished a speedy recovery to the wounded. “We stand with the Turkish people as they deal with this most recent and appalling terror attack,” Dion said. “We reaffirm our commitment to work tirelessly in the fight against terrorism.” The private DHA news agency said the wounded, among them police officers, were transferred to Bakirkoy State Hospital. Turkey has suffered several bombings in recent months linked to Kurdish or Daesh group militants. The bombings include two in Istanbul targeting tourists that authorities have blamed on the Daesh group. The attacks have increased in scale and frequency, scaring off tourists and hurting the economy, which relies heavily on tourism revenues. Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport was the 11th busiest airport in the world last year, with 61.8 million passengers, according to Airports Council International. It is also one of the fastest-growing airports in the world, seeing 9.2 per cent more passengers last year than in 2014. The largest carrier at the airport is Turkish Airlines, which operates a major hub there. Low-cost Turkish carrier Onur Air is the second-largest airline there.",

  "latent_21654": "Not since World War II have more human beings been at risk from disease and starvation than at this very moment. On March 10, Stephen O’Brien, undersecretary general of the United Nations for humanitarian affairs, informed the Security Council that 20 million people in three African countries—Nigeria, Somalia, and South Sudan—as well as in Yemen were likely to die if not provided with emergency food and medical aid. “We are at a critical point in history,” he declared. “Already at the beginning of the year we are facing the largest humanitarian crisis since the creation of the UN.” Without coordinated international action, he added, “people will simply starve to death [or] suffer and die from disease.” Ad Policy This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com. To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com.\n\nMajor famines have, of course, occurred before, but never in memory on such a scale in four places simultaneously. According to O’Brien, 7.3 million people are at risk in Yemen, 5.1 million in the Lake Chad area of northeastern Nigeria, 5 million in South Sudan, and 2.9 million in Somalia. In each of these countries, some lethal combination of war, persistent drought, and political instability is causing drastic cuts in essential food and water supplies. Of those 20 million people at risk of death, an estimated 1.4 million are young children.\n\nDespite the potential severity of the crisis, UN officials remain confident that many of those at risk can be saved if sufficient food and medical assistance is provided in time and the warring parties allow humanitarian aid workers to reach those in the greatest need. “We have strategic, coordinated, and prioritized plans in every country,” O’Brien said. “With sufficient and timely financial support, humanitarians can still help to prevent the worst-case scenario.”\n\nAll in all, the cost of such an intervention is not great: an estimated $4.4 billion to implement that UN action plan and save most of those 20 million lives.\n\nThe international response? Essentially, a giant shrug of indifference.\n\nTo have time to deliver sufficient supplies, UN officials indicated that the money would need to be in pocket by the end of March. It’s now April and international donors have given only a paltry $423 million—less than a tenth of what’s needed. While, for instance, President Donald Trump sought Congressional approval for a $54 billion increase in US military spending (bringing total defense expenditures in the coming year to $603 billion) and launched $89 million worth of Tomahawk missiles against a single Syrian air base, the US has offered precious little to allay the coming disaster in three countries in which it has taken military actions in recent years. As if to add insult to injury, on February 15, Trump told Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari that he was inclined to sell his country 12 Super-Tucano light-strike aircraft, potentially depleting Nigeria of $600 million it desperately needs for famine relief.\n\nMoreover, just as those UN officials were pleading fruitlessly for increased humanitarian funding and an end to the fierce and complex set of conflicts in South Sudan and Yemen (so that they could facilitate the safe delivery of emergency food supplies to those countries), the Trump administration was announcing plans to reduce American contributions to the United Nations by 40 percent. It was also preparing to send additional weaponry to Saudi Arabia, the country most responsible for devastating air strikes on Yemen’s food and water infrastructure. This goes beyond indifference. This is complicity in mass extermination.\n\nLike many people around the world, President Trump was horrified by images of young children suffocating from the nerve gas used by Syrian government forces in an April 4 raid on the rebel-held village of Khan Sheikhoun. “That attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me—big impact,” he told reporters. “That was a horrible, horrible thing. And I’ve been watching it and seeing it, and it doesn’t get any worse than that.” In reaction to those images, he ordered a barrage of cruise-missile strikes on a Syrian air base the following day. But Trump does not seem to have seen—or has ignored—equally heartrending images of young children dying from the spreading famines in Africa and Yemen. Those children evidently don’t merit White House sympathy.\n\nWho knows why not just Donald Trump but the world is proving so indifferent to the famines of 2017? It could simply be donor fatigue or a media focused on the daily psychodrama that is now Washington, or growing fears about the unprecedented global refugee crisis and, of course, terrorism. It’s a question worth a piece in itself, but I want to explore another one entirely.\n\nHere’s the question I think we all should be asking: Is this what a world battered by climate change will be like—one in which tens of millions, even hundreds of millions of people perish from disease, starvation, and heat prostration while the rest of us, living in less exposed areas, essentially do nothing to prevent their annihilation?\n\nFamine, Drought, and Climate Change\n\nFirst, though, let’s consider whether the famines of 2017 are even a valid indicator of what a climate-changed planet might look like. After all, severe famines accompanied by widespread starvation have occurred throughout human history. In addition, the brutal armed conflicts now under way in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen are at least in part responsible for the spreading famines. In all four countries, there are forces—Boko Haram in Nigeria, al-Shabaab in Somalia, assorted militias and the government in South Sudan, and Saudi-backed forces in Yemen—interfering with the delivery of aid supplies. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that pervasive water scarcity and prolonged drought (expected consequences of global warming) are contributing significantly to the disastrous conditions in most of them. The likelihood that droughts this severe would be occurring simultaneously in the absence of climate change is vanishingly small.\n\nIn fact, scientists generally agree that global warming will ensure diminished rainfall and ever more frequent droughts over much of Africa and the Middle East. This, in turn, will heighten conflicts of every sort and endanger basic survival in a myriad of ways. In their most recent 2014 assessment of global trends, the scientists of the prestigious Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that “agriculture in Africa will face significant challenges in adapting to climate changes projected to occur by mid-century, as negative effects of high temperatures become increasingly prominent.” Even in 2014, as that report suggested, climate change was already contributing to water scarcity and persistent drought conditions in large parts of Africa and the Middle East. Scientific studies had, for instance, revealed an “overall expansion of desert and contraction of vegetated areas” on that continent. With arable land in retreat and water supplies falling, crop yields were already in decline in many areas, while malnutrition rates were rising—precisely the conditions witnessed in more extreme forms in the famine-affected areas today.\n\nIt’s seldom possible to attribute any specific weather-induced event, including droughts or storms, to global warming with absolute certainty Such things happen with or without climate change. Nonetheless, scientists are becoming even more confident that severe storms and droughts (especially when occurring in tandem or in several parts of the world at once) are best explained as climate-change-related. If, for instance, a type of storm that might normally occur only once every hundred years occurs twice in one decade and four times in the next, you can be reasonably confident that you’re in a new climate era.\n\nIt will undoubtedly take more time for scientists to determine to what extent the current famines in Africa and Yemen are mainly climate-change-induced and to what extent they are the product of political and military mayhem and disarray. But doesn’t this already offer us a sense of just what kind of world we are now entering?\n\nHistory and social-science research indicate that, as environmental conditions deteriorate, people will naturally compete over access to vital materials and the opportunists in any society—warlords, militia leaders, demagogues, government officials, and the like—will exploit such clashes for their personal advantage. “The data suggests a definite link between food insecurity and conflict,” points out Ertharin Cousin, head of the UN’s World Food Program. “Climate is an added stress factor.” In this sense, the current famines in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen provide us with a perfect template for our future, one in which resource wars and climate mayhem team up as temperatures continue their steady rise.\n\nThe Selective Impact of Climate Change\n\nIn some popular accounts of the future depredations of climate change, there is a tendency to suggest that its effects will be felt more or less democratically around the globe—that we will all suffer to some degree, if not equally, from the bad things that happen as temperatures rise. And it’s certainly true that everyone on this planet will feel the effects of global warming in some fashion, but don’t for a second imagine that the harshest effects will be distributed anything but deeply inequitably. It won’t even be a complicated equation. As with so much else, those at the bottom rungs of society—the poor, the marginalized, and those in countries already at or near the edge—will suffer so much more (and so much earlier) than those at the top and in the most developed, wealthiest countries.\n\nAs a start, the geophysical dynamics of climate change dictate that, when it comes to soaring temperatures and reduced rainfall, the most severe effects are likely to be felt first and worst in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Latin America—home to hundreds of millions of people who depend on rain-fed agriculture to sustain themselves and their families. Research conducted by scientists in New Zealand, Switzerland, and Great Britain found that the rise in the number of extremely hot days is already more intense in tropical latitudes and disproportionately affects poor farmers.\n\nLiving at subsistence levels, such farmers and their communities are especially vulnerable to drought and desertification. In a future in which climate-change disasters are commonplace, they will undoubtedly be forced to choose ever more frequently between the unpalatable alternatives of starvation or flight. In other words, if you thought the global refugee crisis was bad today, just wait a few decades.\n\nClimate change is also intensifying the dangers faced by the poor and marginalized in another way. As interior croplands turn to dust, ever more farmers are migrating to cities, especially coastal ones. If you want a historical analogy, think of the great Dust Bowl migration of the “Okies” from the interior of the United States to the California coast in the 1930s. In today’s climate-change era, the only available housing such migrants are likely to find will be in vast and expanding shantytowns (or “informal settlements,” as they’re euphemistically called), often located in floodplains and low-lying coastal areas exposed to storm surges and sea-level rise. As global warming advances, the victims of water scarcity and desertification will be afflicted anew. Those storm surges will destroy the most exposed parts of the coastal mega-cities in which they will be clustered. In other words, for the uprooted and desperate, there will be no escaping climate change. As the latest IPCC report noted, “Poor people living in urban informal settlements, of which there are [already] about one billion worldwide, are particularly vulnerable to weather and climate effects.”\n\nThe scientific literature on climate change indicates that the lives of the poor, the marginalized, and the oppressed will be the first to be turned upside down by the effects of global warming. “The socially and economically disadvantaged and the marginalized are disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change and extreme events,” the IPCC indicated in 2014. “Vulnerability is often high among indigenous peoples, women, children, the elderly, and disabled people who experience multiple deprivations that inhibit them from managing daily risks and shocks.” It should go without saying that these are also the people least responsible for the greenhouse-gas emissions that cause global warming in the first place (something no less true of the countries most of them live in).\n\nInaction Equals Annihilation\n\nIn this context, consider the moral consequences of inaction on climate change. Once it seemed that the process of global warming would occur slowly enough to allow societies to adapt to higher temperatures without excessive disruption, and that the entire human family would somehow make this transition more or less simultaneously. That now looks more and more like a fairy tale. Climate change is occurring far too swiftly for all human societies to adapt to it successfully. Only the richest are likely to succeed in even the most tenuous way. Unless colossal efforts are undertaken now to halt the emission of greenhouse gases, those living in less affluent societies can expect to suffer from extremes of flooding, drought, starvation, disease, and death in potentially staggering numbers.\n\nAnd you don’t need a PhD in climatology to arrive at this conclusion either. The overwhelming majority of the world’s scientists agree that any increase in average world temperatures that exceeds 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above the preindustrial era—some opt for a rise of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius—will alter the global climate system drastically. In such a situation, a number of societies will simply disintegrate in the fashion of South Sudan today, producing staggering chaos and misery. So far, the world has heated up by at least one of those two degrees, and unless we stop burning fossil fuels in quantity soon, the 1.5 degree level will probably be reached in the not-too-distant future. Ready to Fight Back? Sign Up For Take Action Now\n\nWorse yet, on our present trajectory, it seems highly unlikely that the warming process will stop at 2 or even 3 degrees Celsius, meaning that later in this century many of the worst-case climate-change scenarios—the inundation of coastal cities, the desertification of vast interior regions, and the collapse of rain-fed agriculture in many areas—will become everyday reality.\n\nIn other words, think of the developments in those three African lands and Yemen as previews of what far larger parts of our world could look like in another quarter-century or so: a world in which hundreds of millions of people are at risk of annihilation from disease or starvation, or are on the march or at sea, crossing borders, heading for the shantytowns of major cities, looking for refugee camps or other places where survival appears even minimally possible. If the world’s response to the current famine catastrophe and the escalating fears of refugees in wealthy countries are any indication, people will die in vast numbers without hope of help.\n\nIn other words, failing to halt the advance of climate change—to the extent that halting it, at this point, remains within our power—means complicity with mass human annihilation. We know, or at this point should know, that such scenarios are already on the horizon. We still retain the power, if not to stop them, then to radically ameliorate what they will look like, so our failure to do all we can means that we become complicit in what—not to mince words—is clearly going to be a process of climate genocide. How can those of us in countries responsible for the majority of greenhouse-gas emissions escape such a verdict?\n\nAnd if such a conclusion is indeed inescapable, then each of us must do whatever we can to reduce our individual, community, and institutional contributions to global warming. Even if we are already doing a lot—as many of us are—more is needed. Unfortunately, we Americans are living not only in a time of climate crisis, but in the era of President Trump, which means the federal government and its partners in the fossil-fuel industry will be wielding their immense powers to obstruct all imaginable progress on limiting global warming. They will be the true perpetrators of climate genocide. As a result, the rest of us bear a moral responsibility not just to do what we can at the local level to slow the pace of climate change, but also to engage in political struggle to counteract or neutralize the acts of Trump and company. Only dramatic and concerted action on multiple fronts can prevent the human disasters now unfolding in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen from becoming the global norm.",
  "latent_21702": "Editor’s Note: Massive Spoilers. Read at your own risk.\n\nBreaking Bad is one of the most ethically complicated dramas on television today. The series explores themes of sin, guilt, forgiveness, and damantion through the transformation of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned meth kingpin. Calling the series’s thematic landscape a philosophy fails to fully appreciate its religious dimensions; in this essay, I will sketch a few tenets of what we might call the theology of Breaking Bad.\n\nIn the beginning, Walter could hardly be a more sympathetic character. He is passionate about his subject (if not about his frequently inattentive students). But one day, he receives a diagnosis of advanced lung cancer that forces him to confront his mortality. With a disabled son and pregnant wife, Walter worries that his death will leave his family impoverished. As he runs the numbers, he realizes that to keep his family comfortable after his death, he would need to make more than a million dollars in just a few months. When he sees a drug bust on television, Walter realizes his best option to make fast cash is to put his chemical expertise to use manufacturing methamphetamine.\n\nOver the course of five seasons, Walter descends deeper and deeper into evil, becoming the ultimate anti-hero. So how does one go from a common chemistry teacher to a murderous drug lord? Or as series creator Vince Gilligan puts it, “What if it was essentially me— in other words—a guy who has never broken a law, barely littered or jaywalked, who has never broken the law in any serious way suddenly finding himself being a meth cook, doing something reprehensible?” Gilligan’s answer takes three primary forms: Walter’s evil deeds are motivated by pride, rationalized with good intentions, and lead him slowly but surely into total depravity.",

  "latent_22059": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nOn Monday, it became official: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was charged with “use of a weapon of mass destruction” and “malicious destruction of property resulting in death” for his alleged role in last Monday’s bombing of the Boston marathon. The federal criminal complaint comes three days after police captured Tsarnaev in a boat in Watertown, Massachusetts, and four days after a manhunt for these specific suspects began in earnest. For the time being, law enforcement officials believe Dzhokhar and his older brother, Tamerlan, who was killed Friday, acted alone.\n\nDzhokhar and Tamerlan’s motive—or motives—is still unclear. But that’s not the only unknown. Many of the Tsarnaevs’ actions last week seem baffling in retrospect. Here are some of the most confounding things they did:\n\nWear a backwards hat and no sunglasses. Unlike his older brother, Dzhokhar made little effort to prevent cameras from capturing his face, making him easier to identify when the FBI released security camera photos on Thursday. Indeed, classmates at University of Massachusetts–Dartmouth did see him in the photos, but dismissed the similarity because it seemed so far-fetched. Not react to the explosions. For three days, investigators pored over all available photos and surveillance videos of the blast area searching for abnormal reactions. The complaint filed in federal court on Monday specifically cites Dzhokhar’s reaction to the first explosion as a giveaway; per the complaint, he glanced in the direction of the first blast only briefly. Leave the car in the shop. The Wall Street Journal reported that Dzhokhar stopped by an auto-body shop in Watertown on Tuesday to pick up the Mercedes he’d brought in for repairs. Stay in Boston. The second bomb exploded at 2:49 p.m. last Monday. Tamerlan carjacked a Mercedes at 10:39 p.m.* on Thursday. What did they do in the interim three days? Go to the gym, check in on their busted car, and, in Dzhokhar’s case, go to a party on the UMass–Dartmouth campus. During the three-day window in which their involvement was unknown, they made no attempt to flee. Kill an MIT police officer. Why did the brothers shoot 26-year-old Sean Collier? The murder at 10:30 p.m. on Thursday set in motion the events that would ultimately lead to their capture. Run out of cash. When Tamerlan carjacked a Mercedes on Thursday night, he and his brother had one thing in mind: Get cash, and fast. They emptied $800 from an ATM using their victim’s PIN number, before they reached the account limit. Holding up a stranger for money suggests a woeful lack of planning on their part (they hadn’t budgeted) that helped alert them to the authorities. Not understand how ATMs work. After reaching the daily withdrawal limit at one ATM, the Tsarnaevs, apparently not realizing that the machines are part of an interconnected system, decided to try their luck at two different machines. The quest to find a working ATM was how they ended up, coincidentally, at a 7/11 in Cambridge around the same time it was the scene of an armed robbery, and were spotted on the store security camera. Confess to the hostage. According to the complaint, when Dzhokhar got into the Mercedes, he immediately told the driver, “Did you hear about the Boston explosion? I did that.” That meant their cover would be immediately blown if the driver escaped. Which brings us to… Stop for snacks. The Los Angeles Times reported that the hostage escaped after the brothers stopped at a gas station on Memorial Drive to buy snacks. Keep the hostage’s phone. The Tsarnaevs continued on without their hostage—but they did have his phone, which allowed police to track their location via GPS. Bring a BB gun. The weapons used by the two suspects, according to police: a pressure-cooker bomb, seven IEDs, an M4 carbine, two handguns, and a BB gun. Why a BB gun?\n\nUpdate: This Boston Globe interview with the carjack victim goes a long way toward answering question nine.\n\n*Correction: This piece initially confused the timing of the bombing and carjackings, as well as the identity of the carjacker.",

  "latent_22236": "(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nThis past Saturday, in response to the violence out of Charlottesville, Va, President Trump first responded with a weakly worded tweet. Later, he remarked again by tweet, and it was so bad I can’t describe it, I can only transcribe it. “Am in Bedminster for meetings & press conference on V.A. & all that we have done, and are doing, to make it better-but Charlottesville sad!”\n\nEventually he remarked without his tiny fingers, vaguely talking about how hate is bad probably and whatever. He was rightly criticized for this and by Monday, gave a much more specific condemnation, mentioning the KKK, Nazis, and white supremacist movements as arbiters of an ideology incompatible with American ideals.\n\nMany said “too little, too late” while others were happy Trump had managed to cobble together the very least at the very last. You’d think saying “I hate Nazis” or even “Nazis. Sad.” would be about the lowest hanging fruit imaginable for a politician but for some reason, it took two days and nationwide pressure from all sides, including the loud voices of better GOP politicians, for Trump to give as much attention to these scumbags as he gives to Rosie O’Donnell.\n\nBut more notably, and as is the standard for Trump, one group managed to stay out of his sternly scripted, totally-not-written-by-someone-else disavowal: The Alt-Right.\n\nThis is despite the fact that the alt-right has been on everyone’s lips through the entire situation. They have been the ever-growing (if not in numbers at least in influence and profile) movement that claim they represent the future of the Republican Party.\n\nYoung. Hip. Meme-filled. Oh, and racist AF.\n\nSometimes they will give lip-service to it being a non-racial movement, claiming they are mere nationalists, but not WHITE nationalists. However, if you corner one long enough, eventually you’ll get them to refer to American black culture as “third world” or talk about how immigration (legal immigration) is the staging ground for “white genocide.” That last is one of their favorite topics and they find it irresistible.\n\nSo why does the alt-right continue to escape so much as a finger wag from this president?\n\nThe answer is Steve Bannon. Obviously.\n\nBannon has learned in the months since Trump’s inauguration to keep a low profile. One truth of this president is that if you steal the headlines from him, he’ll kick you right to the curb even if you worship the ground he walks on. No one is allowed to outshine the star of NBC’s “The Apprentice.”\n\nBut despite Bannon’s attempts to stay in the background, his past statements and activities remain available for all to see. And Steve Bannon made very clear over the years that the alt-right is desirable, important, and a necessary component of the Trump coalition. What’s more, that they see him as their leader.\n\nSince the Charlottesville situation exploded, Bannon has come up a lot once again and naturally, calls for firing him have increased. Why wouldn’t they?\n\nIf you are a Trump supporter and want him to do the best job he can, surely you want the giant puss-filled self-inflicted wound of Steve Bannon to be dropped into the dust heap with the rest of the recently-fired-by-Trump crew. So non-scumbag Trump supporters should want Bannon gone.\n\nIf you hate Trump, given that Bannon is the star and chief enabler of a white nationalist movement that aims to disrupt and overthrow and has already killed, you want him away from the White House. So Trump haters should want Bannon gone.\n\nNo matter how you feel about Trump, Bannon being fired is in your, our, America’s best interest.\n\nHere’s the problem: Trump doesn’t fire people because he should fire them. He doesn’t fire people because they did something wrong. He doesn’t fire people because he wants to do the right thing.\n\nTrump fires people only when he feels they have embarrassed him or he has embarrassed himself and needs to blame someone. If they’ve been disloyal, or if he’s decided to be disloyal.\n\nTrump fires people on a whim. Because he’s super angry and he wants to throw his toys and cross his arms and make an angry face.\n\nSo I feel it’s a waste of time to appeal to Trump to fire Steve Bannon, to make argument aimed at Trump’s ears. There’s no point. I know he won’t do it. Trump should fire Bannon. Trump haters and supporters should want Bannon gone. But it’s a waste of breath to tell him.\n\nInstead, I’m going to point out that Donald Trump is afraid of upsetting the alt-right at large, and Bannon in particular. Because Steve Bannon told him to worry about losing them. And because Donald Trump does what Steve Bannon tells him to. Donald Trump is afraid of Steven Bannon.\n\nMaybe if Trump wasn’t so incredibly weak, he could stand up to Steve. But as it stands, that’s just not the president we have.\n\nInstead, we have Donald Trump: Steve Bannon’s bitch.\n\nI hope you’ll join me in reminding the president of this as much as possible.",
  "latent_22293": "THANK YOU SO MUCH to all our wonderful supporters! :)\n\nI've always loved scary things, as far back as I can remember. As a child of the 80’s, I grew up on books like Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark and the works of Shel Silverstein (often quite dark), TV series like Jim Henson’s Storyteller, and movies like Labyrinth, Dark Crystal, and The Neverending Story.\n\nNow in my 30’s, I have a 6-year-old son who ADORES horror. Turn on Netflix and he’ll instantly search for Goosebumps, The Nightmare Before Christmas, or The Munsters (because it has \"a Frankenstein Daddy”). When it’s storytime before bed, he usually picks something like The Berenstain Bears and the Spooky Old Tree or Bears in the Night.\n\nBut as the father of a budding horror-aficionado, I’ve noticed something whenever we visit the local bookstores: nobody writes horror for kids anymore. There are plenty of 'spooky' books, but the genuine danger and creepiness of books like Scary Stories seems all but extinct in modern children’s literature.\n\nAnd I’d like to fix that. Teaming up with cartoonist Matthieu Cousin, I’m working on an original illustrated horror story collection entitled Afraid of Everything. The book is a collection of 26 single-page stories and poems, each accompanied by a character illustration, that tell a creepy story centered around one A-Z phobia (from Arachnophobia to Zoophobia).\n\nOf course it can be, when written with them in mind. These stories and poems aren’t gory or morose or mean-spirited. But as in Scary Stories and the other horror books I loved growing up, each of our 26 protagonists experiences actual risks and scares, and they don’t always make it out of their stories in one piece. Kids can handle stories about consequence, fears, and come-uppance, so long as it's written in a way that's appropriate for them to digest.\n\nThis book is targeted at kids 8 to 16, but could be appreciated by horror fans of any age. As part of this campaign, we’re debuting the first 5 stories right here, which should give you an idea of the tone, scares, humor, and writing style we have planned. Give them a read (or listen to the first story in our video) and see if you think this book might be right for you and your young ones. Matthieu and I can't wait to create more stories, and with your help we can put together a unique and haunting hardcover collection of horrific tales.\n\nIf the above link goes down, CLICK HERE or CLICK HERE.\n\nAnd here are some audiobook versions read by some of our voice actor friends:\n\n\"Sciophobia (Shadows)\" read by Takahata101\n\n\"Bibliophobia (Books)\" read by Cryaotic\n\n\"Necrophobia (Death)\" read by Arin Hanson\n\n\"Arachnophobia (Spiders)\" read by Sarah Anne Williams\n\n\"Electrophobia (Electricity)\" read by Erica Mendez\n\n\"Osteophobia (Skeletons)\" read by Jim Sterling\n\n\"Ranidaphobia (Frogs)\" read by Cristina Vee\n\n\"Technophobia (Technology)\" read by Lucien Dodge\n\nAfraid of Everything will be a roughly 64-page, 8” x 8” hardcover book with full-color glossy interior pages, full-color wraparound cover, table of contents, introduction, author bios, and Special Thanks section.\n\nI back a lot of Kickstarter campaigns and one of my favorites was Philip Reed’s book on unlicensed Transformers toys, Transforming Expectations.

I'm just about old enough to remember a time in which 2020 was the distant future of science fiction novels, too far away to be thinking about in concrete terms, a foreign and fantastical land in which anything might happen. Several anythings did in fact happen, such as the internet, and the ongoing revolution in biotechnology that has transformed the laboratory world but leaks into clinics only all too slowly. Here we are, however, close enough to be making plans and figuring out what we expect to be doing when the the third decade of the 21st century gets underway. The fantastical becomes the mundane. We don't yet have regeneration of organs and limbs, or therapies to greatly extend life, but for these and many other staples of golden age science fiction, the scientific community has come close enough to be able to talk in detail about the roads to achieving these goals.\n\nOf all the things that researchers might achieve with biotechnology in the near future, control over aging is by far the most important. Aging is the greatest cause of death and suffering in the world, and none of us are getting any younger. That may change, however. SENS, the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence, is a synthesis of the scientific view of aging as an accumulation of specific forms of cell and tissue damage, pulling in a century of evidence from many diverse areas of medical science to support this conclusion. Aging happens because the normal operation of our cellular biochemistry produces damage, wear and tear at the level of molecules and molecular structures, and some of that damage accumulates to cause failure of tissues and organs, and ultimately death. That explanation for aging is coupled to the SENS portfolio of research programs that aim to repair this damage: for every type of damage, the appropriate form of repair technology can be described in great detail. The only thing remaining is to build these repair therapies and test them, to see whether or not they produce the expected result of rejuvenation and longer healthy lives.\n\nIt has taken a long time, twenty years or so, to make the treatment of aging a mainstream idea in the research community, and for the public to start to catch up. It hasn't helped that the pursuit of rejuvenation has been a realm occupied only by frauds and the delusional for millennia. It has taken many years of hard work for the evidence and the results indicating that rejuvenation can be achieved to circulate and be more widely accepted. Still, the SENS approach to aging, to head straight for damage repair and rejuvenation, and none of this messing around with drugs to try to slightly slow the pace at which damage accumulates, remains a minority vision at this time. Nonetheless, SENS researchers and advocates have made great progress on very little funding, and as a result we now near the point at which the first results will emerge from the labs into the wider world.\n\nThe next five years are critical precisely because the first few startup companies to work on the first rejuvenation therapies following the SENS model of damage repair will succeed or fail in this short span of time. The most important of these companies are probably Oisin Biotechnologies and UNITY Biotechnology, both working on senescent cell clearance. They have what looks like the best chance of success given the present state of the science, and are already well underway. Technical success does not necessarily translate to rapid clinical availability in medicine, however. You only have to look at Pentraxin Therapeutics and their work on transthyretin amyloid clearance to see that: they have been locked into a development program with GlaxoSmithKline that took six years to get to a small clinical trial, and there is no sign that this will move any faster following the success of that trial, or that it will be made available for anyone other than late stage amyloidosis patients. Clearance of transthyretin amyloid should be undergone by every human being every few years after the age of 40, given that buildup of this form of amyloid contributes to heart disease and a range of other conditions - but that development group simply isn't heading in that direction. It is one thing to catch the interest of Big Pharma, another thing entirely to make them work rapidly, or to agree with the vision of treating aging as a medical condition.\n\nThus there is a very large difference between (a) a world in which companies conservatively sell to Big Pharma or raise funds themselves to creep through the regulatory process to gain approval for use with a tiny number of patients in the late stages of aging, and (b) a world in which the first destination is clinical availability via medical tourism in regulatory regions where only safety must be demonstrated, and anyone can walk in and undergo treatment. Stem cell medicine would be nowhere near as far along without the decade of its widespread availability outside the US and Europe. I am very much in favor of a similar progression of availability and development for the range of potentially useful human gene therapies that will be developed in the years ahead, and for the first SENS rejuvenation technologies, such as senescent cell clearance.\n\nNonetheless, whether or not the outcome is much delayed availability of therapies, success in building a company based on SENS therapies is a very important step. It will in some cases, as for Oisin Biotechnologies, bring significant funding for other lines of SENS research as various advocates and the SENS Research Foundation are early investors. More importantly, success in clinical development of a treatment that meaningfully addresses easily measured metrics of aging after one set of treatments - metrics such as the epigenetic clock based on DNA methylation, or inflammation, or skin elasticity, or blood vessel elasticity, and so on - will be widely noted. That will go a long way towards opening many doors to much larger sources of funding. Either this happens soon, for the companies already under way, or they will fail, possibly damaging the view of SENS even should that failure happen for reasons unrelated to the technical aspects of the work. Failure will push back ultimate success in the medical control of aging for years, and that has an enormous cost associated with it: tens of millions of lives lost, and hundreds of millions suffering due to age-related conditions that might otherwise have been turned back. The SENS Research Foundation staff realize this well, and hence their focus on Project|21, launched earlier this year.\n\nIn short, this is an important time, and we should all put some thought into how we might best support the work on rejuvenation biotechnology that is presently taking place.\n\nAn Effort to Obtain More Human Data on Plasma Transfusion from Young to Old\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/08/an-effort-to-obtain-more-human-data-on-plasma-transfusion-from-young-to-old/\n\nHere I'll link to a recent press article on Ambrosia, a company currently working to obtain more human data on the effects of transfusing young blood plasma into old individuals. The aim is to see whether or not this can usefully change the balance of signaling molecules to, say, spur greater stem cell activity. There has been a trial in Alzheimer's patients, but some signs in animal studies that transfusions from young to old don't do much. It seems useful to speed up the process of determining whether or not transfusions are an interesting line of research, or something that only looked promising. That means more patients and larger trial populations, which Ambrosia is working on.\n\nThese transfusion initiatives are one of a number of outgrowths of parabiosis research in mice. Heterochronic parabiosis is the name given to connecting the circulatory systems of an old and a young individual. The older mouse shows a modest rejuvenation in a number of measures of aging, and the younger mouse shows some greater signs of aging - though most of the focus here has been on the old mouse. In recent years this technique has been used to search for potentially actionable differences in levels of specific signal molecules circulating in the bloodstream. For example, stem cell activity declines with aging, and this is likely governed by signaling processes. If levels of the most relevant molecules could be adjusted in old individuals, it might be possible to produce benefits that look quite similar to those of stem cell therapies: increased regeneration and tissue maintenance. This class of approach puts damaged, aged cells back to work, and does little to address causes of aging based on accumulation of metabolic waste, such as cross-links that stiffen blood vessels, but to the degree that it can improve health it is probably worthy of further investigation in the same way as stem cell therapy was back in the day.\n\nOne potential shortcut to the production of therapies is to perform transfusions: deliver young blood or young plasma to old individuals. I call this a potential shortcut because it really is still very uncertain as to (a) whether or not the whole process works in humans anywhere near as well as it works in mice, and (b) whether or not transfusions will recapture the effects of parabiosis to a useful degree. The evidence in mice suggests so far that it may not. It is possible to paint all sorts of scenarios in which the fact that old and young cells are in contact, feeding signals to one another in a feedback loop, is necessary to produce beneficial changes in the old individual. It is also possible to imagine signals with a short half-life, that won't be recaptured in transfusions, or changes in the old environment that are based on an increased level of specific signal molecules. That increased level won't be changed in the slightest by the arrival of some amount of young blood plasma. Only reduced levels are likely to be impacted that way.\n\nIn any case, testing and perhaps ruling out the fast path of transfusions seems like a fair plan. If it works, it will draw in more funding to build the better option of manipulating signal molecule levels directly. It if doesn't work, that result will direct scientists to focus on more productive lines of research and development. There is some grumbling from the expected quarters over the structuring of this present initiative by Ambrosia, but getting it done is better than not getting it done. The data will be useful in the sense that only sizable effects are interesting, and thus before and after data for participants will be convincing. Marginal effects, of the sort in which it would have been useful to have a control group to establish whether or not any benefits actually resulted, would mean that this probably isn't worth further exploration. Still, this well demonstrates the fact that many scientists who work within the heavily regulated, slow, and repressive system of medical development really don't like it when people try to get things done more rapidly and more inventively. To the extent that it closes down productive avenues, this is a dangerous attitude.\n\nYoung blood antiaging trial raises questions\n\nIt was one of most mind-bending scientific reports in 2014: Injecting old mice with the plasma portion of blood from young mice seemed to improve the elderly rodents' memory and ability to learn. Inspired by such findings, a startup company has now launched the first clinical trial in the United States to test the antiaging benefits of young blood in relatively healthy people. But there's a big caveat: It's a pay-to-participate trial, a type that has raised ethical concerns before, most recently in the stem cell field. The firm's co-founder and trial principal investigator is a 31-year-old physician named Jesse Karmazin. His company, Ambrosia in Monterey, California, plans to charge participants 8000 for lab tests and a one-time treatment with young plasma. The volunteers don't have to be sick or even particularly aged - the trial is open to anyone 35 and older. Karmazin notes that the study passed ethical review and argues that it's not that unusual to charge people to participate in clinical trials. \"There's just no clinical evidence [that the treatment will be beneficial], and you're basically abusing people's trust and the public excitement around this,\" says neuroscientist Tony Wyss-Coray of Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who led the 2014 young plasma study in mice. Wyss-Coray has since started a company, Alkahest, that, with Stanford, has launched a study of young plasma in 18 people with Alzheimer's disease, evaluating its safety and monitoring whether the treatment relieves any cognitive problems or other symptoms. The company covers the participants' costs. Wyss-Coray expects results by the end of this year. In Ambrosia's trial, 600 people age 35 and older would receive plasma from a donor under age 25, according to the description registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, the federal website intended to track human trials and their results. Karmazin says each person will receive roughly 1.5 liters over 2 days. Before the infusions and 1 month after, their blood will be tested for more than 100 biomarkers that may vary with age, from hemoglobin level to inflammation markers. The 8000 cost will cover costs such as plasma from a blood bank, lab tests, the ethics review, insurance, and an administrative fee, Karmazin says. \"It adds up fairly quickly.\" The scientific design of the trial is drawing concerns as well. \"I don't see how it will be in any way informative or convincing,\" says aging biologist Matt Kaeberlein of the University of Washington, Seattle. The participants won't necessarily be elderly, making it hard to see any effects, and there are no well-accepted biomarkers of aging in blood, he says. \"If you're interested in science,\" Wyss-Coray adds, why doesn't such a large trial include a placebo arm? Karmazin says he can't expect people to pay knowing they may get a placebo. With physiological measurements taken before and after treatment, each person will serve as their own control, he explains. Doubts aside, Ambrosia's trial has already attracted attention from the investment company of billionaire Peter Thiel.\n\nThe Utility of a Request for Startups in Rejuvenation Research and Development\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/08/the-utility-of-a-request-for-startups-in-rejuvenation-research-and-development/\n\nThe Request for Startups (RFS) is something lately popularized by the venture incubator Y Combinator, a part of their shifting approach to the field. Having achieved sufficient growth and cultural dominance, they now have the ability to play a greater role in shaping the future, insofar as startups and the entrepreneurial community as a whole are tools to create change. To the extent that the Y Combinator principals would like to see specific changes in to world take shape over the decades ahead, they would like to help nudge that along by funding credible startups in some areas presently neglected. So they put out the RFS, a notice they they are willing to listen to pitches and are interested in funding startups in a set of specific fields or with specific focuses. The name is a play on the technical standards practice of putting forward protocol definitions in the form of Request for Comments, RFC. Standards of all sorts become known by their RFC number, and referring to RFC 1234, RFC 3456, and the like in the course of development is very common in software engineering circles.\n\nThe few SENS rejuvenation therapy startups launched and underway over the past year or two have adequately demonstrated that there is no real shortage of venture funding for our corner of the medical biotechnology field at the present time. If anything there is far more money on the sidelines waiting for an opportunity than there are SENS-relevant companies to invest in. This is partly a function of the era, in which various self-serving decisions by the powers that be have created a flood of easy money in search of returns, any returns, but more importantly it is a function of the fact that the SENS approach to treating aging is only just starting to emerge from the laboratory. SENS is all about repairing the clearly identified forms of cell and tissue damage that cause aging, which if done well enough should postpone aging indefinitely in younger adults, and at least partially rejuvenate the old. There are numerous types of damage, so while forms of senescent cell clearance are under development in various companies, items like cross-link clearance or mitochondrial DNA repair are still years out, and other problems may still be working their way through the laboratory ten to fifteen years from now.\n\nGiven the imbalance between available funding and relevant available startups, I think it would be a good plan for the SENS Research Foundation, or other parts of our community such as the Methuselah Foundation, to publish, maintain, and publicize a Request for Startups - a moderately detailed set of areas that investors in the SENS network are interested in funding. The aging research community is small and highly connected, and it can be argued that the SENS Research Foundation staff are very familiar with a large fraction of all of the research groups who might produce work leading to a startup to develop a possible SENS repair therapy. As matters progress, however, that fraction is going to become smaller. The world is a large place. As new groups focused on aspects of SENS emerge, some form of prominent banner will be useful, influencing unaffiliated researchers in the direction of considering the leap to run a startup. Further, I think that it isn't yet widely known that anyone who turns up with a credible technology and team to start for-profit clinical development of a SENS rejuvenation therapy will have no problems whatsoever in raising funds. In the non-profit laboratory world, aging researchers operate in a very resource poor environment; funding for any type of initiative is hard to come by. It is not always obvious to people immersed that culture that a wealth of funding awaits just on the other side of the conceptual wall that is crossed when moving into for-profit work. How many projects relevant to SENS exist out there, languishing for lack of funding, and where the researchers are not in contact with the SENS Research Foundation? I'd argue that we'll never know the answer to that question unless we aggressively advertise the fact that investors are interested.\n\nIt is of course frustrating to see so little interest in funding research while so much money is waiting on the sidelines for that research to reach the point of viable commercial development. It is like watching someone fail to connect the obvious two dots to improve their present situation. Changing this state of affairs is a big challenge, somewhat beyond the scope of this post: I've written on the topic in the recent past. Reforming the investment world to the point at which it is understood that investing in companies is not as effective in many situations as investing in research and then in the resulting companies that emerge from that research ... well, that is the work of a lifetime for some career advocate or leader in the venture community. Sadly all too few investors are in it to change the world, but when it comes to aging research the primary goal is exactly this: to change the world, to eliminate the suffering and death caused by aging. Life trumps money, and money is only useful for what it can do, not what it is. Investing in SENS rejuvenation research and development is one of the growing number of ways in which money can be traded for an expectation of more healthy life in the years ahead.\n\nThe recently launched SENS Project|21 is the obvious home for a rejuvenation biotechnology Request for Startups, given the pledge of 5 million in research funding and 5 million in venture investment by Michael Greve earlier this year as a starting point for the initiative. But there are a number of other places such a call to action could usefully reside. This is something for the broader community to think about as we move closer to the advent of the first treatments for the causes of aging.\n\nRemoving Senescent Cells from the Lungs of Old Mice Improves Pulmonary Function and Reduces Age-Related Loss of Tissue Elasticity\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/08/removing-senescent-cells-from-the-lungs-of-old-mice-improves-pulmonary-function-and-reduces-age-related-loss-of-tissue-elasticity/\n\nThe open access paper linked below provides another reason to be optimistic about the therapies to clear senescent cells from old tissues that are presently under development. Here, the researchers created genetically engineered mice in which they could selectively trigger senescent cell death in lung tissues. In older mice, the result was improved pulmonary function, and other improvements in the state of lung tissue - turning back the clock on some of the detrimental age-related changes that take place in the lungs.\n\nCells become senescent in response to damage or environmental toxicity, or at the end of their replicative lifespan, or to assist in wound healing. The vast majority either destroy themselves or are destroyed by the immune system, but a few manage to linger on. Those few grow in numbers over the years, and more so once the immune system begins to decline and falter in its duties. Ever more senescent cells accumulate in tissues with advancing age, and they secrete a mix of signals that can encourage other cells to become senescent, increase inflammation, and destructively remodel nearby tissue structures. In small numbers senescent cells can help to resist cancer or assist healing, but in large numbers they contribute meaningfully to all of the symptoms and conditions of old age. They are one of the root causes of aging.\n\nBuilding therapies to destroy senescent cells is the best, easiest, and most direct response. If carried out sufficiently well it would remove this contribution to the aging process entirely, and fortunately the cancer research community has been working on targeted cell destruction for many years now: the technologies exist and just need to be hammered into shape. This class of rejuvenation therapy has been advocated as a part of the SENS vision for the medical control of aging for going on fifteen years now, but only in recent years has the research community made useful progress. As for so many promising lines of research related to bringing aging under medical control, it has been next to impossible to raise funds for this work. The most critical studies in senescent cell clearance, those that proved the case beyond any reasonable doubt, were funded through philanthropy, as is often the case for work at the true cutting edge of medical science. The tipping point has come and gone now, however. At present commercial development is underway. Oisin Biotechnologies and UNITY Biotechnology are building various types of therapy to eliminate senescent cells, and I'm sure they'll be joined by other efforts as more evidence rolls in from animal studies.\n\nOf particular interest in the research results linked here is that tissue elasticity improved. Loss of elasticity is of great importance in the aging of many parts of the body, such as skin and blood vessels. In blood vessels, for example, loss of elasticity leads to hypertension which causes cardiovascular disease and then death. It remains an open question as to which of the primary forms of cell and tissue damage are more important in this process of stiffening. If senescent cell clearance helps meaningfully for blood vessels, then we should all be very thankful, as therapies to remove senescent cells will be arriving in the clinic years in advance of rejuvenation treatments that can address other likely causes of loss of elasticity, such as persistent cross-link formation in the extracellular matrix.\n\nThe method of senescent cell elimination that the scientists employed in this study is not something that can be turned into a therapy, since it depends on creating a genetically altered lineage of mice, in which cells are primed to accept a self-destruct trigger that operates only on senescent cells. Its utility lies in the ability to remove senescent cells precisely in a given tissue, and at a given time. That precision means that researchers can be more certain that senescent cell clearance is the cause of the observed benefits. Given the growing number of ways to target senescent cells for clearance that can be turned into human therapies, it is fortunately not an issue that the experimental tests are using a more restricted approach. Removal of these cells is the important target, and any safe and effective methodology should do the job just fine.\n\nElimination of p19ARF-expressing cells enhances pulmonary function in mice\n\nWhile there is no doubt that cellular senescence prevents cancer, an increasing amount of evidence suggests that cellular senescence is involved in other biological processes and pathologies. Cellular senescence has been shown to contribute to embryonic development, wound healing, and tissue regeneration. Additionally, it has become more evident that cellular senescence contributes to tissue aging. Senescent cells accumulate in many tissues during aging and are considered to underlie aging-associated pathologies. The contribution of senescent cells in aging-associated phenotypes may depend on signaling, such as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), because the population of senescent cells is very small, even in very old human tissue. Two major tumor suppressor pathways, namely, the p19ARF (p14ARF in humans)/p53 and p16INK4a/Rb pathways, play critical roles in the induction and maintenance of cell cycle arrest during cellular senescence. In the present study, we established a transgenic model from which it was possible to eliminate p19ARF-expressing cells using a toxin-mediated cell knockout system. Similar to INK4a, the expression of ARF has been shown to increase during aging in the mouse. Using the transgenic model, we successfully eliminated ARF-expressing cells from the lung tissue of 12-month-old animals. The ablation of ARF expression abolished the expression of other senescent markers, including INK4a and p21, suggesting that the expression of ARF reflects the accumulation of senescent cells in tissues. The elimination of p19ARF-expressing cells in lung tissue ameliorates the aging-associated loss of tissue elasticity. Moreover, the expression of a large number of aging-associated genes was reversed after the removal of p19ARF-expressing cells. Taken together, these findings highlight the role of p19ARF in lung tissue aging and indicate that the aging phenotype in lung tissue may be reversed by eliminating p19ARF-expressing cells from tissue. Senescent cells are known to have an effect on their surrounding \"nonsenescent\" cells through SASP. Our results suggest that the population of p19ARF-expressing cells was very small, even in adult lung tissue (approximately 1% of the lung mesenchymal population). Nevertheless, our microarray data indicate that these \"rare\" p19ARF-expressing cells strongly influence gene expression in lung tissue. Hundreds of genes are upregulated and downregulated during aging in the lung, and more than half of these aging-associated genes show p19ARF dependence. Since senescent cells induce senescence-like gene expression in their surrounding cells through SASP, it is reasonable to assume that changes in aging-associated genes in lung tissue do not simply reflect the events within p19ARF-expressing cells, but also include global changes in lung tissue cells that are mostly nonsenescent. We performed pulmonary function tests on these mice. Static lung compliance (Cst) was significantly higher in older animals than in young animals. The treatment resulted in the marked recovery of lung elasticity (decrease in Cst). Similarly, the treatment reversed aging-associated changes in dynamic compliance, dynamic resistance, tissue elastance, and tissue damping. These results clearly indicated that the p19ARF-expressing cells that accumulated in 12-month-old lung tissue had deleterious effects on pulmonary function and that aging-associated declines in pulmonary function were ameliorated by the elimination of these p19ARF-expressing cells. We also examined the effects of ARF-expressing cell elimination on even older animals. Tumor-free female mice between 20 and 22 months old were treated 1 month. Pulmonary function tests revealed that tissue compliance in older mice was similar to that in 12-month-old mice. The treatment reduced tissue compliance in older animals; however, this effect was less than that observed in 12-month-old mice. Collectively, these results indicated that p19ARF-expressing cells provoked the loss of elastic fibers in lung tissue and were also responsible for the increase in lung compliance in aged animals.\n\nThe SENS Rejuvenation Research Supporters of the German Party for Health Research to Run in Berlin State Parliament Elections\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/08/the-sens-rejuvenation-research-supporters-of-the-german-party-for-health-research-to-run-in-berlin-state-parliament-elections/\n\nSingle issue political parties are near invisible in the US, thanks to the political duopoly that manifests as an outcome of the use of first-past-the-post election rules. In many European countries more representative voting rules allow for the existence of a much larger number of competing parties, and as a result forming a political party to advance a single issue is a entire viable way to run a long-term advocacy campaign. You only have to look at the many environmentalist Green parties, or the more recent growth of the Pirate party, or even the lasting message provided by the Official Monster Raving Loony Party of the UK to see that this can work. Attention can be captured, and a message delivered, even if no governing seats are ever won. A number of advocates for longevity science in Europe have started parties, and have for the past few years put in the hard work to make waves. Most are associated with the International Longevity Alliance, and it is the German Partei für Gesundheitsforschung, the Party for Health Research, that I'll point out today.\n\nThe Party for Health Research folk are strong supporters of the SENS rejuvenation research approach to the medical control of aging. Aging is caused by an accumulation of various forms of cell and tissue damage, and repairing that damage is the best way forward to end the frailty and disease that accompanies aging. In the past the Party for Health Research has organized activities including petitions to government to fund this branch of aging research. From the point of view of the continued growth of the movement, it is encouraging to see that these volunteers have now qualified to run in the upcoming elections to the Berlin state parliament. Every long journey consists of a series of small steps. I believe that the Party for Health Research is the first single issue longevity party to make this leap, and congratulations are due to those who put in the work to make it happen.\n\nWe reached quorum, and are admitted to the elections in Berlin!\n\nWe have collected 2314 signatures, enough to reach the quorum of 2,200 signatures and can thus stand in the election to the Berlin House in September on the ballot! Thanks to all helpers!\n\nElection program in 2016 for election to the Berlin House of Representatives\n\nMost people in Germany fall ill and die of old age diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, heart attack, stroke and type 2 diabetes. Age-related diseases cause a lot of suffering and immense costs and concern each of us. Today biotechnologies enable us now to finally develop effective therapies against the full range of age-related illnesses and ailments. Age-related illnesses caused by certain developments inside and outside the cells. By repairing these changes at the molecular and cellular level it will be possible in future to cure age-related diseases. The Party for health research advocates for more research against diseases of aging, so that these therapies will be developed faster and they arrive soon enough to benefit people who are already older today. Therefore, the party sets for Health Research committed to build more research institutes in Germany, the work on this issue, and train more researchers in the relevant fields. The party will form a coalition with one or more other parties and even only address health research. In all other political issues, the party does not want to interfere. This can be handled by the coalition partners. We want to spend an additional one percent of the state budget in the development of therapies against diseases of aging. Since all people are directly or indirectly affected by diseases of aging, all would benefit. To finance this one percent is to be subtracted from each other budgetary item. About half of these additional investments should flow in the construction and operation of new research facilities. With the other half more scientists will be trained in the relevant fields such as biochemistry and molecular biology. For the corresponding departments at the universities of Berlin are to be expanded.\n\nI believe that as research and development of the means to control aging by repairing its causes begins to show signs of concrete progress outside the laboratory, as the first therapies start to emerge, we will see ever more of this sort of political activism in Europe. It will slowly sink in that aging is the greatest cause of death and disease, and that perhaps something can be done, and that will give rise to far greater support for this and other forms of advocacy. The Party for Health Research volunteers are now starting their campaign; there are posters on the website, and posters going up in Berlin. The one pictured below says \"Cancer? Alzheimer's? Stroke? NO, THANKS! For more pharma-industry-independent research for better medicine against age-related diseases, vote for the Party For Health Research.\"\n\nLatest Headlines from Fight Aging!\n\nConsidering Mitophagy and Cancer\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/08/considering-mitophagy-and-cancer/\n\nMitophagy is the process by which damaged or excess mitochondria in cells are destroyed, their parts recycled. Mitochondria, and in particular the level of damage in mitochondria, are important in aging. For most things that are important in aging, there is also a fair amount of evidence suggesting relevance to cancer, and mitochondria are no exception. Researchers here consider some of the known links between the modulation of mitophagy and the development of cancer, and taken as a whole the evidence suggests anything but a simple relationship. Depending on the particular context, when it comes to cancer it can be argued that either less mitophagy or more mitophagy is a bad thing. This is not the case for aging, in which greater mitophagy should always be beneficial, to the extent that it maintains lower levels of mitochondrial damage and the harms that result from that damage.\n\nMacroautophagy, hereafter referred to as autophagy, is a highly conserved degradation process targeting large and possibly toxic structures in the cell. Mitochondria-selective autophagy (mitophagy) plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis, regulating the size and quality of the mitochondrial population. In addition, mitophagy eliminates damaged mitochondria under diverse stress conditions. Healthy mitochondria are also removed when attenuation of mitochondrial function is required upon hypoxia, caloric restriction, or during certain developmental processes. Mitochondrial surveillance and quality control mechanisms, including mitophagy, decline with age and in several pathologies, causing progressive deterioration of mitochondrial function. Deregulation of mitophagy is closely linked to cancer development and progression. Thus, elucidation of the mechanisms governing mitophagy holds promise for novel anticancer interventions. In C. elegans, inhibition of mitophagy increases mitochondrial mass, uncouples respiration from ATP production, enhances mitochondrial ROS production, and increases cytoplasmic calcium levels. These phenotypes are commonly observed in aged animals, and across large evolutionary distance. Increased ROS contribute to carcinogenesis by causing DNA damage and triggering aberrant alterations in gene expression. Therefore, in addition to the manifestation of pro-aging phenotypes, impairment of mitophagy potentially facilitates tumorigenesis. Yet cancer cells within several types of solid tumors induce autophagy and mitophagy to adjust to their microenvironment of limited nutrient and oxygen availability. In the largely hypoxic solid tumor environment, energy production shifts from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, leading to increased glucose uptake and reduced oxygen consumption, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. Mitophagy induction has thus been proposed to be part of a hypoxia adaptation response that promotes cancer cell survival. Notably, we found that DCT-1 upregulation under mitophagy-inducing conditions is mediated by SKN-1, the nematode homolog of mammalian Nrf2, a transcription factor that becomes activated upon oxidative stress to preserve mitochondrial homeostasis. SKN-1 also stimulates the expression of core mitochondrial components, promoting the assembly of fresh mitochondria. Our findings reveal a new layer of mitophagy regulation, which interfaces with mitochondrial biogenesis resulting in rejuvenation of the cell's mitochondrial pool. These observations highlight SKN-1/NRF2 as a new anticancer target whose activation could induce both mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. This dual coordinating role may shield mitochondrial metabolism from oncogenic transformation by opposing the Warburg effect to increase healthspan. Decreased insulin signaling is an evolutionarily conserved molecular pathway that promotes longevity. We have shown that mitophagy is a significant contributor to lifespan extension under low insulin conditions. Indeed, inhibition of mitophagy shortens the lifespan of long-lived animals carrying lesions in daf-2, the gene encoding the sole insulin/IGF-1 receptor homolog in C. elegans. SKN-1 and DAF-16 underlie mitophagy induction under low insulin signaling conditions. In summary, mitophagy is emerging as a nexus of cellular and organismal physiology. Several mitophagy promoting conditions engage distinct transcription factors that impinge on cancer-associated processes. The extent of mitophagy induction is critical for the onset and progression of carcinogenesis. Impairment of mitophagy in healthy tissues can promote tumor formation and mobility of cancer cells, whereas mitophagy induction in hypoxic solid tumors promotes adaptation and tumor cell survival. Coordination of mitochondrial biogenesis and removal could provide a new pathway to circumvent the adverse effects of mitophagy in this context. Further dissection of this pathway could unravel new potential anticancer interventions targeting tumorigenesis by promoting mitochondrial rejuvenation.\n\nIn Search of a Foundation for Therapies to Block and Reverse Fibrosis\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/08/in-search-of-a-foundation-for-therapies-to-block-and-reverse-fibrosis/\n\nFibrosis is a form of inappropriate scarring, connective tissue forming where it should not inside organs, destroying the structures necessary for correct function. Fibrosis is involved in many age-related diseases, notably in liver conditions, for example. Researchers have in the last couple of years made a few initial inroads in targeting cell behavior to reduce fibrosis in some organs, but there is still comparatively little that can be done for patients suffering fibrotic conditions. Better and more universal approaches to block the mechanisms of fibrosis are needed, but as the publicity materials here indicate, the process of discovery is still in comparatively early stages.\n\nResearchers have utilized the new software tool to evaluate the perturbation status of many signaling pathways. This new system aimed to identify robust biomarkers of fibrotic disease and develop effective targeted therapy. Fibrosis, a progressive accumulation of extracellular matrix, can occur in a wide range of organs and potentially distort their structure and function; most commonly it affects lung and hepatic tissues, causing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and liver fibrosis respectively. Fibrosis accounts for up to 45% of deaths in the developed world, yet to date no effective therapeutic treatment has been developed. \"Currently, there are no approved anti-fibrotic remedies and no reliable fibrotic biomarker. Our system can detect hidden fibrotic molecular signatures based on a pathway network analysis, and identify specific fibrogenic molecular changes regardless of detecting platform and tissue of origin. Despite many efforts, fibrosis is often misdiagnosed. Our system is supposed to help with proper and timely diagnostic.\" With broad screening across multiple fibrotic organs, the platform identified pathogenic pathways that served as potential targets for the anti-fibrotic therapy. This approach led to a selection of the list of small molecules and natural compounds by their ability to minimize the signaling pathway difference between a fibrotic and a healthy state of the tissue. Further work with provides promising opportunities to identify conserved biological pathways that play a critical role in fibrosis development. \"We have discovered previously-undetected pro-fibrotic signatures in glaucoma, based on pathway analysis. This new knowledge will allow us to cooperatively select and develop anti-fibrotic small molecule interventions to minimize or reverse this fibrotic state, and restore the tissue to normal function.\"\n\nRisk of Heart Attack Continues to Fall\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/08/risk-of-heart-attack-continues-to-fall/\n\nAmong the many noteworthy achievements in modern medicine over the past few decades is the reduction in heart attack risk, alongside reduced rates of many other aspects of cardiovascular disease. The data I'll point out here is but one example in a much broader trend. This is the higher end of what can be achieved through compensatory medicine for age-related disease, a set of increasingly sophisticated efforts to patch over the consequences of dysfunctional tissues, but without actually repairing the molecular damage that causes that dysfunction. Keeping a damaged machine functioning without repairing it is expensive and challenging. To go beyond the incremental improvements produced by medical science in the recent past, it will be necessary to change the high level strategy, and start to address the root causes of aging and age-related disease rather than merely papering over the problem.\n\nHeart attack rates among an ethnically diverse population of more than 3.8 million Kaiser Permanente members in Northern California fell 23 percent from 2008 to 2014. Researchers studied rates of heart attacks by severity, age, gender, and diabetes status. While the incidence of heart attacks was highest in men, older age groups, and people with diabetes, similar declines in heart attack rates were seen across all subgroups - including those most at risk and with the highest rates, as well as among lower-risk patients, such as younger patients and women. The findings of this latest study build on research published in 2010 that demonstrated a 24 percent decline in heart attacks between 1999 and 2008. A key difference in the two time periods studied was the type of heart attack that accounted for the majority of the declines. More severe but less common heart attacks, known as ST-elevation myocardial infarction or STEMI, which typically require an immediate procedure to open a blocked artery, fell by 62 percent from 1999 to 2008. The number of these heart attacks fell by an additional 10 percent from 2008 to 2014, resulting in a total reduction of 72 percent in these severe heart attacks from 1999 to 2014. The more common but less severe heart attacks, known as non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction or NSTEMI, showed the greatest decline from 2008 to 2014. These types of heart attacks peaked in 2004 and have fallen 33 percent through 2014. When taken together, there was a 40 percent reduction in all types of heart attacks across Kaiser Permanente in Northern California from the peak in 2000 through 2014, the most recently studied year. \"While the decline in severe heart attacks across our population has been astonishing, we now see consistent declines in all types of heart attacks. Reductions in less severe heart attacks, which are nearly four times as common as the severe heart attacks, drove the bulk of the recent decline. But what is most heartening is that these reductions were consistent across every demographic and risk group we examined.\"\n\nOne Example Among Many Human Telomere Length Studies\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/08/one-example-among-many-human-telomere-length-studies/\n\nAverage telomere length decreases with aging, and is commonly measured in immune cells taken from a blood sample. Telomeres are a part of the mechanism that limits the number of times most cells can divide. Tissues are made up almost entirely of such limited cells, each losing a little telomere length during each division. When telomeres become short, the cell self-destructs or becomes senescent and ceases to divide. An associated stem cell population supports the tissue by delivering a continual supply of new daughter cells with long telomeres to replace the losses. Thus average telomere length is a function of cell division rates and cell replacement rates. Since stem cell activity declines with aging, it shouldn't be surprising to see that average telomere length does as well. In fact average telomere length in immune cells is highly variable between individuals, and even with circumstances for the same individual, and the rate of decline is small. It thus makes a pretty terrible measure of aging, a point reinforced by the numbers in this open access paper.\n\nIn the current study, we first examined the cross-sectional associations between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and age, and, like previous reports, we found an inverse relationship with increasing age. Second, using up to five measurements across 20 years, we found that LTL decreases with age in a two-slope model with a small acceleration of decline after 69.3 years of age. Men have shorter telomere lengths than women, and genetic variation has an additional influence on overall LTL. Several earlier studies have reported an inverse association between age and telomere length, as did we, and we further demonstrated that women have longer LTL, which is in line with earlier research. Taking our results and prior literature together, shorter telomeres in men could result from very small but consistent attrition throughout adulthood rather than a steeper decline compared to women in old age. Moreover, previous literature from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies has suggested a linear relationship between telomere length and age. We found both the one-slope and the two-slope models to be significant, with a substantially better fit of the latter. While the overall average trend was linear, there was systematic variability around the average trend, better described in a two-slope model accounting for more individual differences. The magnitude of this age-related decline was small overall, and with slight acceleration in the old-old. This observation is in line with earlier research in the field where faster decline in LTL is believed to take place in childhood and old age. The two-slope trajectory analyses supported both familial and non-familial influences on LTL, with equal contributions to average LTL level (at age 69) and non-familial sources featuring more prominently in the change before age 69 than after age 69. This suggests that in young-old age, individual-specific lifestyle factors may prove more relevant to accelerated LTL shortening above and beyond familial and environmental contributions to overall LTL; however, in old-old age, familial factors may become increasingly salient to accelerated LTL shortening. Moreover, we note that the variation in rate of change was larger in young-old age; hence, evaluating variation in trajectories beyond the assumption of simple linearity and average trends is important for understanding etiological underpinnings.\n\nInducing Autophagy as the Basis for an Atherosclerosis Treatment\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/08/inducing-autophagy-as-the-basis-for-an-atherosclerosis-treatment/\n\nMore of the cellular housekeeping process of autophagy appears to be an unalloyed good: more repair means less damage. It shows up in a range of interventions that modestly slow aging in mice and other species, such as calorie restriction. In fact it may even be essential to the ability of calorie restriction to extend healthy life spans in these studies. One place in which greater levels of autophagy might do some good is in the development of atherosclerosis, a pervasive age-related condition in which an overreaction to minor molecular damage in blood vessel walls snowballs into zones of inflammation and growing plaques made up of fats and dead cells. Eventually these plaques cause ruptures or blockages of major blood vessels that are frequently fatal. Higher levels of autophagy should slow the pace of progression of this problem through increased clearance of plaque materials, though it seems clear from the data here that much more aggressive interventions to clean up the waste and damage will be needed to solve it completely. The effects are small.\n\nSpermidine is an endogenous biological polyamine that exhibits broad longevity-extending activities via the induction of autophagy. Because basal autophagy is atheroprotective during early atherosclerosis but dysfunctional in advanced plaques, the aim of the present study was to assess the potential beneficial effects of autophagy induction by spermidine on atherosclerotic plaque progression and composition. Apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice prone to development of atherosclerosis were fed a Western-type diet for 20 weeks with or without 5 mM spermidine in the drinking water. Analysis of plaques in the aortic root, proximal ascending aorta and brachiocephalic artery showed that spermidine changed neither the size of the plaque nor its cellular composition. However, spermidine treatment significantly reduced necrotic core formation (6.6 ± 0.5% vs. 3.7 ± 0.5% in aortic root) and lipid accumulation inside the plaque (27 ± 3% vs. 17 ± 1% oil red O positivity in thoracic aorta). In vitro experiments showed that macrophages, unlike vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), were relatively insensitive to autophagy induction by spermidine. Along these lines, spermidine triggered cholesterol efflux in autophagy-competent VSMCs (5.7 ± 1.2% vs. 8.7 ± 0.2%), but not in autophagy-deficient VSMCs or macrophages. Analogous to the experiments in vitro, spermidine affected neither necrosis nor lipid load in plaques of autophagy-deficient ApoE-/- mice. In conclusion, spermidine inhibits lipid accumulation and necrotic core formation through stimulation of cholesterol efflux, albeit without changing plaque size or cellular composition. These effects, which are driven by autophagy in VSMCs, support the general idea that autophagy induction is potentially useful to prevent vascular disease.\n\nIntestinal Autophagy Important in Calorie Restriction and Longevity in Nematodes\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/08/intestinal-autophagy-important-in-calorie-restriction-and-longevity-in-nematodes/\n\nBased on the evidence accumulated from many years of studies of flies and nematodes, intestinal function is fairly central in aging and longevity. This is one of those things that probably doesn't translate so well to higher, more complex, and larger species, but the general principle of better organ function correlating to better health and a longer life expectancy is something to hold on to. In this open access paper the the increased activity of the cellular housekeeping mechanisms of autophagy, produced alongside greater longevity by the practice of calorie restriction, is investigated in the context of intestinal function in nematodes:\n\nDietary restriction (DR) without inducing malnutrition has robust beneficial effects on lifespan in many species, including humans. The cellular recycling process of autophagy contributes to DR-mediated longevity. Autophagy is triggered by nutrient scarcity and increases the degradation of cytosolic molecules and organelles in the lysosomes. Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism, we previously showed that genes involved in autophagy are required for lifespan extension through DR; however, it is not clear whether autophagy in individual tissues plays critical roles in DR-mediated longevity. Here, we investigated the contribution of autophagy in genetically dietary-restricted eat-2 mutants. Our major findings include: (i) Inhibition of autophagy in the intestine prevents the long lifespan observed in eat-2 mutants; (ii) the intestine of eat-2 mutants contains an expanded lysosomal compartment and flux assays indicate increased autophagosome turnover, consistent with elevated autophagy in this tissue; (iii) intestinal autophagy is required for the improved intestinal integrity observed in eat-2 mutants; (iv) autophagy inhibition impairs motility in older animals; and (v) inhibition of autophagy in the intestine accelerates the motility decline in eat-2 mutants. Collectively, these studies suggest a critical role for intestinal autophagy in dietary-restricted animals, and highlight the importance of this process in maintaining fitness and longevity.\n\nEstimating the Cost of Sedentary Lifestyles\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/08/estimating-the-cost-of-sedentary-lifestyles/\n\nIt is known that leading an inactive life, one lacking in physical exercise, has a fairly large negative effect on health and life expectancy. In a similar way to past studies that assessed the overall cost of obesity across populations, researchers here investigate one methodology by which it is possible to estimate the global cost of sedentary lifestyles:\n\nA study has revealed that in 2013, physical inactivity cost 67.5 billion globally in healthcare expenditure and lost productivity, revealing the enormous economic burden of an increasingly sedentary world. Based on data from 142 countries, representing 93.2 per cent of the world's population, this study provides the first-ever global estimate of the financial cost of physical inactivity by examining the direct health-care cost, productivity losses, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for five major non-communicable diseases attributable to inactivity: coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, breast cancer and colon cancer. \"Physical inactivity is recognised as a global pandemic that not only leads to diseases and early deaths, but imposes a major burden to the economy. Based on our data, physical inactivity costs the global economy 67.5 billion in 2013, with Australia footing a bill of more than AUD 805 million. At a global and individual country level these figures are likely to be an underestimate of the real cost, because of the conservative methodologies used by the team and lack of data in many countries. Increasing physical activity levels in communities is an important investment that governments should consider which could lead to savings in healthcare costs and more productivity in the labour market.\" The 67.5bn in total costs, including 53.8bn in direct cost (healthcare expenditure) and 13.7bn in indirect costs (productivity losses), breaks down as follows. 31.2bn for total loss in tax revenue through public healthcare expenditure; 12.9bn as the total amount in private sector pays for physical inactivity-related diseases (e.g. health insurance companies); 9.7bn as the total amount households paid out-of-pocket for physical inactivity-related diseases. Type 2 diabetes was the costliest disease, accounting for 37.6bn (70 percent) of direct costs.\n\nQuantifying the Positive Effects of Exercise versus the Detrimental Effects of Sitting\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/08/quantifying-the-positive-effects-of-exercise-versus-the-detrimental-effects-of-sitting/\n\nOne of the themes that has emerged from the past few years of studies on the epidemiology of activity versus inactivity is the suggestion that time spent sitting is harmful regardless of whether or not an individual exercises. This relationship is extracted from statistical studies across populations, and as is usual in these matters the conclusion is disputed. In general, it is a good idea to give little weight to any one such epidemiological study and look instead for the consensus across many studies. That a sedentary lifestyle is bad for health and that regular moderate exercise is good for health is not in dispute, but arguments take place over the interpretation of population data for more subtle aspects of the relationship between these two things. This latest research should be added to the existing stack and considered in that context:\n\nEver since a study back in 1953 discovered that London bus drivers were at greater risk of heart disease compared to bus conductors, scientists have found increasing evidence that lack of physical activity is a major risk factor for several diseases and for risk of early death. Recent estimates suggest that more than 5 million people die globally each year as a result of failing to meet recommended daily activity levels. Studies in high-income countries have suggested that adults spend the majority of their waking hours sitting down. Current physical activity guidelines recommend that adults undertake at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week. In a recent analysis that draws together a number of existing studies, an international team of researchers asked the question: if an individual is active enough, can this reduce, or even eliminate, the increased risk of early death associated with sitting down? In total the researchers analysed 16 studies, which included data from more than one million men and women. The team grouped individuals into four quartiles depending on their level of moderate intensity physical activity, ranging from less than 5 minutes per day in the bottom group to over 60 minutes in the top. Moderate intensity exercise was defined as equating to walking at 3.5 miles/hour or cycling at 10 miles/hour, for example. The researchers found that 60 to 75 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per day were sufficient to eliminate the increased risk of early death associated with sitting for over eight hours per day. However, as many as three out of four people in the study failed to reach this level of daily activity. The greatest risk of early death was for those individuals who were physically inactive, regardless of the amount of time sitting - they were between 28% and 59% more likely to die early compared with those who were in the most active quartile - a similar risk to that associated with smoking and obesity. In other words, lack of physical activity is a greater health risk than prolonged sitting. \"There has been a lot of concern about the health risks associated with today's more sedentary lifestyles. Our message is a positive one: it is possible to reduce - or even eliminate - these risks if we are active enough, even without having to take up sports or go to the gym.\"\n\nWhite Matter in the Brain is Lost More Rapidly in Overweight People\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/08/white-matter-in-the-brain-is-lost-more-rapidly-in-overweight-people/\n\nResearchers here find yet another reason to avoid becoming overweight, in that the brains of people who are overweight tend to lose white matter at an accelerated rate. The mechanism involved remains to be determined, but based on past research, the greater levels of chronic inflammation produced by larger amounts of visceral fat tissue would seem to be a good place to start looking.\n\nOur brains naturally shrink with age, but scientists are increasingly recognising that obesity - already linked to conditions such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease - may also affect the onset and progression of brain ageing; however, direct studies to support this link are lacking. In a cross-sectional study - in other words, a study that looks at data from individuals at one point in time - researchers looked at the impact of obesity on brain structure across the adult lifespan to investigate whether obesity was associated with brain changes characteristic of ageing. The team studied data from 473 individuals between the ages of 20 and 87. The researchers divided the data into two categories based on weight: lean and overweight. They found striking differences in the volume of white matter in the brains of overweight individuals compared with those of their leaner counterparts. Overweight individuals had a widespread reduction in white matter compared to lean people. The team then calculated how white matter volume related to age across the two groups. They discovered that an overweight person at, say, 50 years old had a comparable white matter volume to a lean person aged 60 years, implying a difference in brain age of 10 years. Strikingly, however, the researchers only observed these differences from middle-age onwards, suggesting that our brains may be particularly vulnerable during this period of ageing. Despite the clear differences in the volume of white matter between lean and overweight individuals, the researchers found no connection between being overweight or obese and an individual's cognitive abilities, as measured using a standard test similar to an IQ test. \"We don't yet know the implications of these changes in brain structure. Clearly, this must be a starting point for us to explore in more depth the effects of weight, diet and exercise on the brain and memory.\"\n\nContradictory Results on New Neurons and Old Memories\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/08/contradictory-results-on-new-neurons-and-old-memories/\n\nThe adult brain adds new neurons at a very slow pace. Exercise increases that pace, so it is a place to start when trying to determine the likely outcome of therapies that greatly increase the generation of new neurons. As they are developed, such therapies will likely come to have an important place in the near future toolkit of rejuvenation therapies. The generation of new neurons diminishes with age, and is an important part of the plasticity of the brain, determining the ability to learn, change, and heal minor damage. At this point, many of the possible outcomes of a greater supply of new neurons remain debated, with studies still taking place. The contradictory animal data covering effects on memory noted here is just one example.",
  "latent_22471": "Microsoft has teamed up with Ethcore and Blockstack to bring added solutions to the Azure™ Marketplace via Parity and Blockstack Core v14.\n\nEvery day, the blockchain community continues to grow and interconnect. The entire ecosystem benefits from this increased collaboration and interoperability. In another step forward for blockchain, Microsoft has added two partners to their Azure™ Marketplace.\n\nThe Microsoft Azure Marketplace is an online market for the buying and selling of SaaS (Software as a Service) applications and premium datasets. It offers thousands of “certified, open source, and community software applications, developer services, and data—pre-configured for Microsoft Azure.” Companies utilize this marketplace for cloud-based solutions.\n\nMicrosoft has already made an Azure Quick Start template that allows the creation of a private Ethereum network, through their Ethereum Consortium Blockchain Network solution. Now, Microsoft has taken another step into Ethereum incorporation by adding two new partners to their burgeoning blockchain ecosystem in the Azure Marketplace: Ethcore and Blockstack. Those new partners, Ethcore and Blockstack, now offer Parity and Blockstack Core v14 respectively, on the Azure Marketplace. Those familiar with Ethereum should recognize Parity as one of the more popular Ethereum clients that can be integrated directly into users’ web browsers. Through Ethcore partnering with Microsoft, setting up a new Parity node in the cloud is possible with minimal configuration on the user’s end. Due to the simplified nature of Azure, it’s quick and easy to set up a private, single-node Ethereum network for development and testing.\n\nAs for Blockstack, they’re building “a decentralized web of server-less applications,” which is another way of saying they help developers create Dapps. They like the idea of users being able to control their own data and any developers who feel the same can now deploy Blockstack Core nodes on Microsoft Azure.\n\nAside from adding two new partners, Azure has improved deployment resiliency for their consortium network blockchain solution. They’ve released some updates that should improve overall deployment success rates, making the creation of a blockchain network even more reliable. They’re continuing to work on new features as well, which will be released in the coming months.\n\nThe easier it becomes to deploy a blockchain network, and the more blockchain enterprises cooperate, the stronger the blockchain ecosystem will become as a whole. This type of collaboration between different companies in the same tech field could lead to increased awareness and adoption of revolutionary blockchain technologies.",

  "latent_22872": "A new model that predicts the solar cycles more accurately than ever before has suggested that solar magnetic activity will drop by 60 percent between 2030 and 2040, which means in just 15 years’ time, Earth could sink into what researchers are calling a mini ice age.\n\nSuch low solar activity has not been seen since the last mini ice age, called the Maunder Minimum, which plunged the northern hemisphere in particular into a series of bitterly cold winters between 1645 and 1715.\n\nThe prediction is based on what’s known as the Sun’s '11-year heartbeat'. The Sun’s magnetic activity is not the same year in year out, it fluctuates over a cycle that lasts between 10 and 12 years. Ever since this was discovered 172 years ago, scientists have struggled to predict what each cycle will look like.\n\nBut just last week at the National Astronomy Meeting in Wales, mathematics professor Valentina Zharkova from Northumbria University in the UK has presented a new model that can forecast what these solar cycles will look like based on the dynamo effects at play in two layers of the Sun. Zharkova says she can predict their influence with an accuracy of 97 percent.\n\nWhat exactly are these so-called dynamo effects? They’re part of a geophysical theory that explains how the motion of Earth’s outer core moves conducting material, such as liquid iron, across a weak magnetic field to create an electric current. This electric current also interacts with the fluid motion below the surface of Earth to create two magnetic fields along the axis of its rotation.\n\nWhen Zharkova’s model applied this theory to the Sun, it drew its predictions assuming that there are dynamo effects in two subterranean layers - one deep down in the convection zone, and another up near the surface, each fluctuating between the northern and southern hemispheres.\n\nZharkova explained her findings at the conference:\n\n\"We found magnetic wave components appearing in pairs, originating in two different layers in the Sun's interior. They both have a frequency of approximately 11 years, although this frequency is slightly different, and they are offset in time. Combining both waves together and comparing to real data for the current solar cycle, we found that our predictions showed an accuracy of 97 percent.\"\n\nLooking at these magnetic wave patterns, the model predicted that there would be few sunspots over the next two 11-year heartbeats - called Cycle 25, which peaks in 2022, and Cycle 26, which runs from 2030 to 2040.\n\n\"In Cycle 26, the two waves exactly mirror each other - peaking at the same time but in opposite hemispheres of the Sun. Their interaction will be disruptive, or they will nearly cancel each other. We predict that this will lead to the properties of a 'Maunder minimum',\" said Zharkova.\n\nDuring the original Maunder Minimum, the entire River Thames froze over in England. So I guess time to get your skates ready?",
  "latent_22915": "“Wherever there is a human being, there is an opportunity for a kindness” – Seneca\n\nA couple of days ago someone said to me: “Be kind to yourself!” Ever since hearing these words they have been stuck in my head. I have always understood the importance of kindness, but I have always focused on kindness to others. I had never thought about kindness towards myself. It really got me thinking.\n\nI started with how it feels to have someone be kind to you. I know that feeling. It’s warm and cozy and bonding. But I am not the one to evoke that type of feeling in myself. I thought about how it feels to be kind – the type of emotions that surge within you when you are considering another person; care and gentleness. I do not often feel these types of emotions when dealing with myself. This leads me to question whether I am ever pointedly kind to myself and how my life would be different if I specifically paid myself some kind attention.\n\nI’ve been thinking about how you can be kind to yourself and benefits of doing so. Here are some of my suggestions.\n\nBe Patient\n\nIt is important to be patient with yourself if you are battling with a task. The other night I was in a yoga class, it was hot and sticky, and I was repeatedly falling out of a balance because my hands kept on slipping. I was highly irritated with myself. My teacher reminded me that some days I would be better at it than others, some days my practice would be stronger than on others and that it was not a competition with myself.\n\nNow I think: “What if I had said that to myself and not relied on the teacher to divert me from unkind behavior towards myself?” Impatience has a tendency to lead towards decreased self-esteem and a general bad mood. It is also something we tend to brood over; getting stuck in the negative past instead of valuing the present moment. Stay patient and you will be sure to have more peace in your life.\n\nWatch Your Words\n\nEverybody has self-talk or self-chatter. Sometimes it is positive and sometimes it is negative (or very negative). Do you say things to yourself such as: “you idiot” or “how could you do that?” Do you say things to yourself that you wouldn’t say to others? Is what you say to yourself kind?\n\nI know that if someone said directly to me some of the reprimands that I give myself, I would be extremely hurt. So why is it all right for me to make such comments to myself? For many reasons it is good to try to be aware of negative self-talk and to turn it around. With awareness one can take action. In the case of “kindness to self”, I think it is important to change ugly to words and tones into sentences that you would feel comfortable using with someone else. Nice words, kind words, make you feel good or better or even accepted.\n\nEncourage Yourself\n\nWhen things are tough or you are battling with something, encouragement is a wonderful means of giving you a boost. But, does encouragement have to come from someone externally? I think we should always have enough positive belief in ourselves to carry us through. Belief is empowering.\n\nForgive\n\nForgiveness is often not easy. One of the steps in attaining forgiveness is self-forgiveness. So, if we don’t get that right, we are “doomed” in attempts to forgive others. Forgiving yourself is kind. Forgiving others is kind.\n\nGive\n\nActs of kindness involve giving – whether it is material or time or energy of some sorts. Are you generous towards yourself? I think it is important to treat yourself with things you enjoy (even if it is simply a bath in beautiful oils) and gifts.\n\nEveryone needs to take time and energy out for themselves, be it reading a book or attending a class or coffee with a friend. I need to do more of this.\n\nYou give to others in order to rejuvenate them. You are just as worthy of and in need of rejuvenation. Rejuvenation is key to success. Besides, you can’t give to others, if you don’t have enough for yourself first.\n\nListen\n\nKindness also involves listening. Do you listen to yourself? Do you hear what your body, heart and soul are saying?\n\nIt’s important to rest if you are tired, to take a break if you have been mentally overworking, to make changes if you are dissatisfied, to seek help if you need it etc. It’s another key to success and happiness. Paying attention to yourself is part of a positive life journey.\n\nAllow\n\nWith kindness, one creates a space for and allows another person to be themselves and experience their feelings. Allowing yourself to feel painful or negative emotions helps with moving forward – so long as you deal with them. If you keep on covering them up, they continue to draw you downwards and backwards. You can be empathetic and compassionate with yourself without wallowing in self-pity. I don’t think that I am most efficient with dealing with my emotions. There is a bit of fight going on there. That energy is better spent elsewhere.\n\nGive Advice\n\nKindness can involve the giving of advice or suggestions. So it’s a matter of taking things into your own hands, learning what you need and the applying it (in a kind manner!). A step towards growth.\n\nIf you think about it, is everyone not worthy of kindness? So then too are you.\n\nI’ve decided that I need to cultivate kindness towards myself. I need it in order to extend my acts of kindness, to raise my energy levels and I think it will bring more contentment into my life.\n\nWhat about you? Do you need to treat yourself better? Or, do you have any tips for how to be kind to yourself? Please share your thoughts in the comments below.\n\nPhoto by Nattu",
  "latent_23012": "Working class people — aren't they just the absolute worst? Yes, but thanks to the power of laughter, Federal Reserve bankers are able to tolerate these two-legged parasites.\n\nAccording to recently released transcripts, Federal Reserve bankers had a heck of a good time chatting about lazy, good-for-nothing Americans in 2011. No mention of the fact that the United States was still reeling from one of the worst financial meltdowns in recent memory. No. According to Federal Reserve officials, high unemployment numbers in 2011 were the direct result of Joe Lunchpail not getting excited enough about career paths at Walmart.\n\nA stock photo we found on the Federal Reserve's website\n\nAs the Intercept reports:\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s mandate is to promote “maximum employment,” which essentially means: print enough money so that everyone who wants one has a job. Yet according to transcripts released this month after the traditional five-year waiting period, Federal Reserve officials in November 2011 were debating whether unemployment was caused by bad work ethics and drug use – rather than by the greatest financial crisis in 80 years. This debate then factored into the argument over setting monetary policy. “I frequently hear of jobs going unfilled because a large number of applicants have difficulty passing basic requirements like drug tests or simply demonstrating the requisite work ethic,” said Dennis Lockhart, a former Citibank executive who ran the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank. “One contact in the staffing industry told us that during their pretesting process, a majority—actually, 60 percent of applicants—failed to answer ‘0’ to the question of how many days a week it’s acceptable to miss work.” The room of central bankers then broke into laughter.\n\nThe laugh track continues, though:\n\nIt was hardly the first time these bankers blamed unemployment on the unemployed, rather than, say, bankers. In an April meeting that year, Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeff Lacker told participants that “Several firms told us of difficulty finding adequate workers, because they preferred to collect unemployment benefits or can’t pass drug tests.” He reiterated that point in November, saying that in West Virginia he was told by an employment agency that “unquestionably the biggest problem in hiring skilled and unskilled workers was the inability to pass a drug test.” Lacker’s Federal Reserve district includes West Virginia. In August, he again spoke of “widespread reports about hard drug use, OxyContin and methamphetamine, in Appalachia and other rural parts of our District—in particular, Appalachia.” Apparently his colleagues responded with laughter again, because he then said “Drug abuse and the hardship involved in unemployment aren’t really laughing matters.” Usage, he noted, isn’t higher than the national norm in West Virginia. “It’s hard to pin this down quantitatively,” he continued, wondering if there was “something meaningful there as a contributor to impediments to labor market functioning.”\n\nIt's nice to know that they're looking after us little guys.\n\nWhen do we get to audit these jerk-offs? And drug test them? We want to know how many mountains of cocaine they snort each year. This information is included in GAO audits, right?",
  "latent_23178": "Many of Durham’s attractions are housed in repurposed postindustrial buildings, like the American Tobacco Campus, pictured here. Photo: Hal Goodtree\n\nThis spring, when I embarked on a slightly ill-advised rekindling of a college romance, I figured that flying to Durham, North Carolina (less than two hours from any NYC-area airport), was only slightly more arduous than taking the train to, say, Ridgewood, and there was a certain glamour in going out of state to get laid. Fortunately, only ever being in town purely for the business of pleasure meant spending a lot of time in bars, restaurants, swimming holes, and the occasional Airbnb. Durham is a postindustrial town — many of the spots listed below are set in old factories or warehouses — that’s quickly gaining notice for its hip local food and music scene, and it’s worth a weekend trip, long-distance lover or no.\n\nWhere to Stay\n\nThe Durham has a rooftop bar and mid-century-modern-style décor. Photo: Courtesy of the Durham Hotel\n\nThe 21C Museum Hotel (from $199) in downtown Durham is located in an old bank, which gives it a certain Gatsbyesque charm. The real draw is the art, which is featured throughout the hotel, and yes, there really is a museum. The contemporary art on display is worth checking out, the curation better than most galleries in major cities. The restaurant and bar, Counting House, serves up cocktails, which you’re free to carry throughout the hotel and savor in a number of semi-private nooks and miscellaneous seating areas. Don’t forget to check out the vault, which is preserved in near-original condition in the basement of the hotel, away from the bar. It’s got cozy seating but fills up quickly — if you’re bringing a date, you might have to get there early to corner a spot. And a word about the extremely modern bathrooms: Yes, they’re made of clear glass, but you don’t have to pee exposed for art. Make sure to engage the lock all the way, and the glass will turn opaque. (Your correspondent learned this the hard way!)\n\nThe Durham (from $199) is a cool, modern hotel, also located downtown. The décor is mid-century modern, as is the style these days, but with a warm, not-airspace-y touch. Downstairs, you’ll find a restaurant, run by James Beard Award–winning chef Andrea Reusing, that’s always booked for brunch. Outside of mealtimes, the space serves as a chill coffee bar that lets patrons hang out for as long as they want. It’s not rare to see people quietly working on laptops in the middle of the afternoon, but the space is so large there’s plenty of room for everyone. Upstairs, there’s a rooftop bar, serving up cocktails as well as a raw bar and a small kitchen menu. The view is great, and there’s both covered and open-air seating.\n\nUnscripted (from $169) is a similarly mid-century-modern hotel, though the vibe is funkier than that at the Durham and it’s geared more for creative professionals. It offers lots of different spaces to hang out in, including a fun, vintage-inspired poolside lounge and The Studio, based on mid-century rec rooms. Unscripted doesn’t have a restaurant like the Durham’s, but allday, a mixed-use coffee bar and sundry shop, serves food and functions as a cool meeting space.\n\nWhere to Eat\n\nThere are string lights galore in Durham (including at the restaurant Luna, pictured here). Photo: Courtesy of Luna\n\nFor a casual breakfast made with local ingredients, check out Scratch. The menu is seasonal and therefore variable, but don’t miss the pastries, baked in-house. The shirred eggs are a buttery delight, served in a ceramic dish atop folded triangles of the New York Times (this correspondent spotted a friend’s book review in print on a visit), and the coffee is strong. Another great brunch option is the bakery-café Monuts, which has a bigger space and a slightly more casual cafeteria vibe, plus: All the employees get paid a living wage! Also, there’s a giant rabbit statue inexplicably placed near the entrance.\n\nLuna offers a mix of southern and South American cuisine; everything on the menu is great, and if you’re really hungry, the patacon pisao — basically southern-style BBQ sandwiches with fried plantains for buns — are filling and decadent. If you’re a normal amount of hungry, a meal of a roasted protein (Luna offers chile-braised jackfruit alongside staples like brisket and carnitas) plus a couple of sides is still plenty. The jalapeño lemonade is worth a mention, too: It’s got a kick, and it’s totally refreshing.\n\nFor a lively — maybe too lively — atmosphere, grab a beer at Surf Club. It’s best when you can take advantage of the outdoor seating; the bar itself tends to get crowded. String lights are all over the place in this town, and Surf Club is no exception. On the weekends, it can get crowded and a little bro-y, but if that’s your vibe, it’s a great time. It’s also the local bar of choice for the not-so-local musical duo Sylvan Esso: Their album art comes from the mural on the outside wall.\n\nAlso worth a visit is Arcana, a hip cocktail bar inspired by tarot — you can even get your cards read. The menu features an extensive selection of herbs and liqueurs inspired by the occult, and the vibe is moody and intimate. You can sometimes catch live music at the space, as well as other, more occult events. Note that all the hotels mentioned above have bars that are great for cocktails; the ones at 21C are particularly good, and if you’re going solo, you can always have one of 21C’s iconic penguins (at the Durham location, they’re fuchsia) accompany you.\n\nWhat to Do\n\nThe repurposed American Tobacco Campus (where cigarettes were produced until the late ’80s) is home to an artificial river of sorts. Photo: Courtesy of American Tobacco Campus\n\nTake a stroll around the American Tobacco Campus, a former tobacco factory that now houses offices, apartments, restaurants, a gallery, and a theater and that partnered with the Full Frame documentary festival earlier this year. There’s a water feature, a remnant of the old factory, that runs through the campus, and it’s a pleasant place to meander through at any time of day. From there, you can walk to the Golden Belt, a onetime textile mill now repurposed as galleries, apartments, and event spaces and check out the local art scene.\n\nThe Duke Gardens (admission is free) are another great place for a walk. They take up 55 acres, so there’s probably more than you’ll be able to see on one visit, and feature four different gardens: the Historic Gardens, the Garden of Native Plants, the Asiatic Arboretum, and the Doris Duke Center Gardens. The Historic Gardens have a beautiful, Italian-style terraced garden, which features a wisteria-covered pergola, and there’s a pond with koi, goldfish, and, in the summer, water lilies. After you’re done wandering the Duke Gardens, you can walk over to the Nasher, Duke’s art museum. The collection spans 5,000 years of art history, so there’s something for everyone, and there are always a number of changing exhibitions. The sculpture in the front lawn of the museum changes annually; right now, it’s a monumental piece by German artist Katharina Grosse, who also did the spray-painted “Rockaway!” house in Fort Tilden last year.\n\nThe local-music scene in Durham is thriving, and there are plenty of places to catch a show. You can hear anything from darkwave synth to acoustic sets at Arcana, mentioned above. Meanwhile, The Pinhook is at the heart of Durham’s queer scene, hosting drag shows and live music as well as dance parties. The music is loud and the atmosphere is friendly and it’s located right downtown. To catch major acts like Guided by Voices or Blitzen Trapper, swing by Motorco, a roomy music venue that has an extensive menu, inspired by global street food. And Motorco has a great Monday drink special — $2 PBR and $3 wells. Doesn’t that make you want to get out of New York already?\n\nExpert Tips\n\nThe café Cocoa Cinnamon, like Monuts, is certified by the City of Durham’s Living Wage project. Photo: Courtesy of Cocoa Cinnamon\n\nIt’s not too hard to get around Durham without a car, but it is just hard enough. If you’re going by foot, most of these spots listed are downtown, but there’s also a free shuttle bus, the Bull City Connector, which runs between Duke University and the Golden Belt hub. Along the route are the Duke Gardens, the cute Ninth Street shopping district, the American Tobacco Campus, and the Durham Central Park, home to the farmer’s market, a skate park, and a great place to watch dogs.\n\nIf you’ve got some leisure time, or just want a cold brew, drop by Cocoa Cinnamon, Durham’s favorite coffee shop. It’s got two locations, both with indoor and outdoor seating. The vibe is friendly and conducive to working or just hanging out; the Hillsborough Road location is slightly more spacious and closer to Duke’s campus, while the West Geer location has more of an indie vibe.\n\nFinally, if you’re trying to get into some nature — but not too much nature — drive out to the Eno for a swim at Turtle Hole. You’ll enter at Little West Point on the Eno, where there’s also parking, and it’s a very short half-mile hike on a wide path to the swimming hole. The water is deep, cool, and fresh; there’s lots of fun currents and little falls to splash in; and there are always plenty of families and groups of friends hanging out.",
  "latent_23219": "The crypto markets continued to climb on Tuesday, with the vast majority of top 100 cryptocurrencies posting moderate gains. The bitcoin price rose to within striking distance of $4,000, while the ethereum price edged past $290 to continue its march toward $300. Altogether, the markets added more than $5 billion.\n\nChart from CoinMarketCap\n\nThe total crypto market cap began the day at $131.5 billion, having risen past the $130 billion mark the day before. Monday afternoon, it quickly shot up to $135 billion and eventually rose to a present value of $137.2 billion–its highest point since September 20.\n\nChart from CoinMarketCap\n\nBitcoin Price Eyes $4,000\n\nThe bitcoin price led the advance with a 4% increase. After falling close to $3,500 a few days ago, bitcoin is once again challenging the $4,000 mark. Within the past day, the bitcoin price has risen from $3,762 to $3,934, placing it just $66 below this psychologically-important threshold. Bitcoin now has a market cap of $65.3 billion.\n\nChart from CoinMarketCap\n\nSome analysts have attributed this movement to increasing tensions between North Korea and the United States, noting parallels to similar events last month. Another factor that is likely influencing bitcoin’s climb is the continued emergence of Asian markets such as South Korea and Japan in the wake of China’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. Notably, South Korean messaging platform Kakao announced the creation of a new cryptocurrency exchange, named Upbit. Developers say it will support 110 cryptocurrencies and predict it will be the largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea.\n\nEthereum Price Crosses $290\n\nThe ethereum price did not climb as quickly as bitcoin on Tuesday, but it did manage to post a 1% gain to continue its gradual climb. Though minor, this positive movement enabled the ethereum price to tick up past $290. The ethereum price currently rests at $291–less than $9 below the $300 mark. This gives ethereum a market cap of $27.6 billion.\n\nEthereum Price Chart from CoinMarketCap\n\nLitecoin Recovers Past $50\n\nThe altcoin markets were characterized continued upward movement, with every cryptocurrency in the top 15 posting at least a minor gain.\n\nAltcoin Price Chart from CoinMarketCap\n\nBitcoin cash rose more than 4%, bringing its price to $451 and market cap to $7.5 billion. Ripple increased 3% following news that the FinTech startup was opening a new office in Singapore, further increasing its Asian presence.\n\nLitecoin Price Chart from CoinMarketCap\n\nThe litecoin price advanced 7% following a disappointing week. Today’s trading helped the litecoin price recover past the $50 mark to a present value of $52. Dash, on the other hand, rose just 1%, causing it fall behind litecoin on the market cap charts.\n\nSeventh-place NEM rose 5%, while IOTA increased by 1%. The Monero price rose 3%, lifting its market cap to $1.4 billion. NEO–which recently supplanted ethereum classic as the 10th-largest cryptocurrency–continued its dramatic rise with a 21% climb to $26.\n\nCryptocoinsnews",

Burgis-capitalist!” Ordinary pedestrians, motorists and joggers might protest, comparing the now less accessible campus to gated communities in posh subdivisions.\n\nStrategic points\n\nIn a phone interview, UP security officer Prof. Edgardo Dagdag said they have identified vulnerable areas where 10 CCTV cameras will be installed, and the five entry points where barrier gates will be put up. “The UP barangay is also planning to put up CCTV cameras in strategic points in the residential area of UP,” Dagdag said.\n\nNews of this boost to UP’s existing security system came several days after the strafing of the campus residence of UP professor and Inquirer columnist Randy David.\n\nBut Dagdag said the technology upgrades to UP Diliman’s security arrangement were planned and the budget set aside even before the strafing.\n\nSecurity summit\n\nIn March, the university held a security summit for its campuses to come up with enhanced security plans for their areas of responsibility. A statement released by the Office of the Chancellor on March 4 and posted on the UP website also detailed the steps the university had been taking to balance campus-wide security with the need to make UP Diliman accessible to its “mandated stakeholders… given that thousands of alumni, guests, visitors, third-party employees, passers-by and informal settlers also set foot daily on campus land.”\n\nThe statement said the UP Diliman campus in Quezon City has a contiguous land area of 493 hectares that cover seven barangays and several government agencies.

The campus has 303 security guards and 51 watchmen keeping peace and order, he added.\n\nOff limits to PNP\n\nThe Philippine National Police is not allowed inside, however, because of a standing memorandum of agreement with UP dating back to the 1970s.\n\nThe statement on the UP website said that UP Diliman has “new security service contracts for the next 12 months, starting January 2012, that are valued at P67.26 million… with 236 guards as baseline.”\n\nThe campus, the statement said, “is an integral part of Quezon City and Metro Manila… The socioeconomic and political consequences of increasing urbanization, widespread poverty and rapid population growth are also seriously felt here.”\n\nDagdag, the designated spokesperson for the David strafing incident, said the investigation now lies with the Quezon City Police District. David, he said, has made it known that he does not want police security at his home on campus.\n\nBut the strafing is “not an isolated incident,” Dagdag said. “It must be taken seriously. We are glad that no one was hurt,” he said, adding that he took “the initiative of increasing the visibility of security personnel in the vicinity of (David’s) house.”\n\nA security guard posted a few meters away from David’s home said there were three of them on roving patrol duty in Areas 1, 2 and 3.\n\nRead Next\n\nLATEST STORIES\n\nMOST READ",
  "latent_23449": "Newly rebranded and toned down, the Legends (cough, Lingerie) Football League, which kicked off on Saturday night in Melbourne, seems to have struck a nerve. Suffice to say, if every letter writer, Twitter linker and petition signee translated into a bum on a seat at a women’s soccer or cricket match, their athletes would be well on the way to earning a liveable wage.\n\nConsensus has it that the LFL not only constitutes a form of spiritual liposuction, but is emblematic of a country where organised sport is perched high on the misogynistic tree. The LFL however, is the symptom, not the malaise. It what’s we get when the Federal Government, the Australian Sports Commission and our national sporting organisations drop their respective balls. It reflects a nation of women increasingly disinclined to compete in, volunteer at and fork out money to watch traditional sports. To ignore this and to zero in on the garter belts, the yahoos in the commentary box and the half-soused punters in the crowd, is to miss the point spectacularly.\n\nThe ASC, which recently bemoaned corporate Australia’s lack of support for our female athletes, refuses to recognise Lingerie Football as a legitimate sport. But they – and the sporting organisations that come under its auspices – are equally loath to recognise their own failings when it comes to women’s sport. The Federal Government, which took six years to respond to a Senate report into the state of women’s sport in Australia, also stands accused.\n\nThe high drop-out rate of teenage girls in sport, the dearth of women on sporting Boards and the general health and fitness of the nation have never been ASC priorities. Their focus is on winning medals and producing world champions. This tunnel vision means they have lost touch with their grass roots. In the coming months, hundreds of thousands of Australian girls and women will line up for fun runs, open water swims, group bike rides and triathlons. But their links to the governing bodies of those sports will be tenuous at best. The potential talent pathways, commercial opportunities and incentive for TV networks to give these sports more airtime will thus be lost.\n\nSuffice to say, if every letter writer, Twitter linker and petition signee translated into a bum on a seat at a women’s soccer or cricket match, their athletes would be well on the way to earning a liveable wage.\n\nThis disconnect between the rank and file and our governing bodies continues to manifest. The way Australians exercise, particularly its women, has changed markedly. ABS statistics tell us that the boom sporting/fitness activity over the last decade has been in gym training. Many of the larger fitness centres boast childcare facilities, women’s only areas and one-on-one training. They, more so than our sporting clubs, have tapped into what people really want. Likewise, there’s been an explosion in non-mainstream pursuits such as Tough Mudder, the Spartan Race and Crossfit. For years, our national sporting organisations looked down on these ‘fast food’ sports. But they offer an interesting contrast. They market themselves shrewdly and manage to make women feel empowered and welcomed. There are some incredible stories in their ranks. Deanna Blegg, one of Australia’s finest endurance athletes and this year’s Tough Mudder winner, has lived most of her adult life with HIV.\n\nBut surely, the critics howl, this is a top-down problem, with television setting the national sporting tone? Indeed, if your daughter is blessed with a semblance of sporting talent, it would be disheartening to come home from a netball game, athletics carnival or swim meet and behold the LFL frat party on 7-Mate.\n\nBut there are bigger issues to ponder. Whether you’re the Sports Minister, a male sports nut or a woman who couldn’t give two hoots about sport, everyone has a role to play. Even, perish the thought, men like Mitch Mortaza, the founder of the LFL. Reptilian as he is, women’s sport needs more people with his entrepreneurial flair. With sport increasingly at the mercy of clicks, advertising revenue and market forces, we need to think outside the square and position women’s sport differently. We need marketing directors, TV producers and CEOs of national sporting organisations with an appetite for risk. We need to appeal to the better angels of the male nature, whilst producing a product that is empowering, inclusive and palatable to women.\n\nMen are central to changing the national sporting mindset. It can be as significant as a coterie group opting not to bankroll an AFL player’s rape trial after all. Or it can be simple as a journalist resisting the urge to unpack the adjectives and describe world champions as ‘glamour girls’ and ‘statuesque’. We need to chip away at a sporting culture dominated by our male football codes. In a country where maternity wards, birth notices, bumper stickers, work pods and funeral caskets are plastered with footy paraphernalia, it’s a colossal but not insurmountable challenge.\n\nWomen too, can affect bottom up change. The best way to support women’s sport is to actually show up and help out. More Australian women attend motor sport and harness racing than tennis or netball. What’s more, just 4% of girls/women over 15 are involved in a non-playing capacity, whether as a coach, scorer, timekeeper or administrator. Rather than scouring the sports pages for discrepancies or penning withering editorials anytime some dinosaur commentator makes a sexist remark, women need to buy tickets, join clubs, click on positive news stories and support our champions in a proactive and meaningful way.\n\nThings change. In my lifetime, women weren’t allowed to run marathons, saddle up on Australian racetracks and step into boxing rings. But some things – the missed opportunities, the pointed fingers, the shrugged shoulders, the outrage and the Government recommendations gathering dust – stay the same. In the absence of anything proactive, we get the Legends Football League. As is generally the case with Australian TV, we invariably get what we deserve.",
  "latent_23526": "Joining us today here on Buffalowdown is guest writer Michael Pina. Michael is a writer on ESPN’s TrueHoop Network and ScoreBig.com. You can follow him on Twitter @ShakyAnkles.\n\nFor 12 consecutive years, the Bills have had one of the worst suffering fan bases in the NFL. Much of that has been due to the coaching.\n\nTake, for example, last Sunday’s 21-9 loss to the Texans. Head Coach Chan Gailey only called 12 rushing plays in the game, even though his team’s ground attack is ranked seventh-most efficient in the league, according to Football Outsiders. The man has one of the best backfield tandems in football right now in C.J. Spiller and Fred Jackson. Why isn’t he using them more? As Doug Roxburgh at Buffalodown said, “It doesn’t matter what the defense is showing you, you do what you’re successful at.”\n\nWhile it’s illogical to consider firing somebody based on the outcome of a single game, this particular instance represents a larger phenomenon: the Bills have been 13-27 since Gailey replaced Perry Fewell in 2010. Currently, they’re 3-5, headed for a 12th consecutive season outside the playoffs. For a team some expected to at least clinch an AFC Wildcard spot, that’s not good. Chan Gaily needs to go.\n\nSince Marv Levy left the team in 1997, Buffalo has had six different head coaches. Here are four possible options to be named the seventh.\n\n1) University of Oregon Head Coach Chip Kelly\n\nCurrently toiling away at the top of the college ranks, Chip Kelly will likely head to the NFL. His destination is dependent on who throws him the most money, and if he can institute his fast-paced offense quickly enough to make an impact.\n\nBuffalo isn’t known for bringing in guys with flashy names or styles, but there’s a first time for everything, and Kelly would be perfect.\n\nTheir offense has game-changing skill players like Spiller and Steve Johnson, and while their situation at QB isn’t as rosy as many of the league’s contenders, Buffalo’s current trio of Tarvaris Jackson, Fitzpatrick, and Brad Smith is modestly athletic relative to the position, and a pretty good fit to run an uptempo spread offense.\n\nKelly’s spread offense has already been adopted by successful teams all over the NFL. If the Bills want to turn their organization around, hiring this offensive genius would be the way to do it.\n\n2) Suspended Saints Head Coach Sean Payton\n\nEarlier this week, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced his decision to void Sean Payton’s contract extension with the New Orleans Saints, making the Super Bowl-winning head coach a free agent next season.\n\nChances are he either returns to New Orleans or jumps to the Dallas Cowboys—making this hire a long shot—but if the Bills are serious about establishing themselves as a respectable franchise, they’ll do everything in their power to grab one of football’s most accomplished minds.\n\n3) Monday Night Football Analyst Jon Gruden\n\nAlso a Super Bowl winning head coach, Jon Gruden has spent the last few seasons analyzing Monday Night Football on ESPN. He loves the gig, but is only 49 years old, young enough to make another successful run at head coach with a new organization.\n\nTaking over the Bills and turning them into a contender would erase the glaring asterisk on Gruden’s legacy as a head coach who won Super Bowl XXXVII with Tony Dungy’s players.\n\nWhile that theory is void of logic, it remains alive in the minds of some fans, media members, and Hall of Fame voters. If Gruden were to come into Buffalo and win a string of playoff games, his legitimacy as one of the NFL’s great coaches would be set in stone.\n\n4) San Francisco 49ers Special Teams Coach Brad Seely\n\nSeely’s name isn’t recited in households across the country like the other three options on this list, but in terms of NFL experience he’s the most decorated. Prior to serving as the Special Teams coach in San Francisco these last two seasons (one of the best units in football) Seely held the same job in New England from 1999-2008. Obviously, the Patriots were extremely successful during this time period, making four Super Bowl appearances and obliterating the Bills nearly every time they faced off. Seely was undoubtedly a reason why.\n\nThink a Special Teams coach isn’t qualified to lead an entire team? Just take a look at Baltimore’s decision to replace Brian Billick with John Harbaugh in 2008. Prior to being named head coach of the Ravens, Harbaugh was the Special Teams coach in Philadelphia for nine years.\n\nDespite never serving as a head coach in the NFL, Seely is known as a great communicator who effectively understands the entirety of the game. It’s not a coincidence that the Patriots and 49ers are successful in close football games. He could be a great fit in Buffalo.",

The officials met several months ago about the possibility of a case:\n\nAt the time, three field offices were in agreement an investigation should be launched after the FBI received notification from a bank of suspicious activity from a foreigner who had donated to the Clinton Foundation, according to the official. FBI officials wanted to investigate whether there was a criminal conflict of interest with the State Department and the Clinton Foundation during Clinton’s tenure. The Department of Justice had looked into allegations surrounding the foundation a year earlier after the release of the controversial book “Clinton Cash,” but found them to be unsubstantiated and there was insufficient evidence to open a case.\n\nDOJ officials did not want to open the case at the time because it looked “more political than substantive” since the FBI had an investigation going into Hillary Clinton’s private email server.\n\nPreet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for Southern District of New York, will lead the investigation. The Daily Caller said his office “has resulted in a large number of convictions of banks, hedge funds and Wall Street insiders.”\n\nThe Clinton Foundation caused waves this week when Judicial Watch released emails that showed top Clinton Foundation donors asked then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for favors.\n\nIn April 2009, Clinton Foundation official Doug Band sent an email to Clinton’s top aides Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin about a favor. He reminded them it is important to take care of [Redacted].” Officials blacked out the name, but Abedin said “Personel has been sending him options.”\n\nIn another email, Band asks the State Department for another favor for a top donor:\n\nIncluded in the new document production is a 2009 email in which Band, directs Abedin and Mills to put Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire and Clinton Foundation donor Gilbert Chagoury in touch with the State Department’s “substance person” on Lebanon. Band notes that Chagoury is “key guy there [Lebanon] and to us,” and insists that Abedin call Amb. Jeffrey Feltman to connect him to Chagoury. Chagoury is a close friend of former President Bill Clinton and a top donor to the Clinton Foundation. He has appeared near the top of the Foundation’s donor list as a $1 million to $5 million contributor, according to foundation documents. He also pledged $1 billion to the Clinton Global Initiative. According to a 2010 investigation by PBS Frontline, Chagoury was convicted in 2000 in Switzerland for laundering money from Nigeria, but agreed to a plea deal and repaid $66 million to the Nigerian government.\n\nClinton pledged she would not participate in the foundation while she served as secretary.",

  "latent_23909": "CLOSE The Defense Department's budget will increase $574 billion. Video provided by TheStreet Newslook\n\nHis pie-in-the-sky plan breaks campaign promises and is useless as a guide for Congress.\n\nBudget Director Mick Mulvaney at the White House on May 23, 2017. (Photo11: Andrew Harnik, AP)\n\nThe best way to think about the fiscal 2018 budget released by the White House is as a Trump political campaign rally on paper.\n\nThe budget was clearly developed to make a statement to President Trump’s base of voters in the hope that they will see it as him keeping his campaign promises. According to Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, the budget will be in surplus in 10 years, construction will start on the wall between the U.S. and Mexico, there will be more money for enforcing immigration laws, and there will be much more for the Pentagon. Meanwhile, wasteful government spending will be cut and taxes will be reduced.\n\nYou can almost envision Trump tossing Make America Great Again hats into the audience as he reads from his budget to a cheering crowd of supporters.\n\nTo a certain extent, there’s nothing wrong with this. Every president’s budget is at least partly a political document, so the fact that Trump tries to make a strong ideological statement with his not only isn’t a surprise, it should have been anticipated.\n\nBut the new Trump budget is so unabashedly political that you can’t help but ask whether the administration even considered that what it proposes is also supposed to provide practical guidance to the House and Senate as they consider actual spending and taxing legislation for the coming year.\n\nThe president’s budget is supposed to be a plan for governing as well as a political campaign cheer, and that’s where the Trump 2018 completely fails.\n\nFirst, the Trump budget projects steadily reduced deficits over the next 10 years that are based on fantasy and prayers rather than solid economics. Chief among these is the administration’s contention that the economy will grow by 3% a year over the next decade, a forecast that is wildly optimistic compared with what the Federal Reserve and others are saying is likely.\n\nSecond, the Trump budget includes a veritable witches’ brew of gimmicks. They have been used before, but they haven’t been used together since Ronald Reagan was president and then-OMB chief David Stockman had to resort to budget sleight of hand to project a declining deficit.\n\nIn addition to the rosy scenario of 3% annual GDP growth, the Trump budget relies on the old standby of cutting unspecified waste, fraud and abuse (\"reduce improper payments governmentwide” by $142 billion over the next 10 years) and a “magic asterisk” of additional unspecified cuts in domestic appropriations of 2% a year every year through 2027 that supposedly will save $1.4 trillion.\n\nThird, the Trump 2018 budget proposes spending cuts that Congress — Republicans and Democrats — are virtually certain to reject out of hand. This includes cuts in Social Security disability and farm subsidies, plus more than $600 billion in Medicaid reductions over 10 years that apparently is in addition to the $880 billion in cuts the House passed several weeks ago in the American Health Care Act.\n\nSo while it might work as a campaign event, the Trump 2018 budget flops big time as a real policy proposal and practical guide for Congress. Its economics are pie-in-the-sky, its numbers are speculative at best, and its spending cut proposals are unlikely to ever be considered seriously.\n\nBut it’s also not clear whether the Trump budget will actually work as a political rallying cry.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nAlthough the administration will try to emphasize the big picture proposals — the wall, the Pentagon, the projected surplus — many of the individual plans such as the cuts in Medicaid and the Social Security disability program break promises the president made during the campaign. Trump voters will also feel many of the smaller Trump-proposed spending cuts, and congressional Democrats are certain to make political life miserable for any Republicans who support them.\n\nIt didn’t take long for the Trump 2018 budget to disappear inside the Beltway. Less than two days after the details emerged, congressional Republicans had all but stopped talking about it. With the president overseas and not part of the rollout, and no one but Mulvaney promoting it, the budget seemed destined to vanish by the end of the week.\n\nThat will make the Trump 2018 budget one of the biggest and most rapid failures in recent American history.\n\nStan Collender is an executive vice president with MSLGROUP in Washington, D.C., and an adjunct professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy of Georgetown University.

Hobbes said, \"The injuries to the victims, the positions of the bodies and also the person of interest right now is also a practitioner.\"\n\nWicca is a religion that claims to draw on the pre-Christian traditions of Western Europe, and while most practitioners engage in some form of magical practice and nature worship, they may believe in a variety of deities.

The ranks of prominent American Wiccans include Margot Adler, a well-known National Public Radio journalist who died in 2014.\n\nAccording to Hobbes, Richard Smith worked for Homeland Security and a supervisor contacted the sheriff's office, who dispatched a unit to check the home at 4605 Deerfield Drive in Pensacola.\n\nAuthorities believe the trio was killed sometime after 7:00 p.m ET, on the previous Tuesday, three days earlier.\n\nPolice are continuing their investigation.\n\n\"It’s frightening to think about.

We will miss our dear, sweet Delaney every single day.”\n\nDelaney was in a class on an intermediate ski trail at the Crystal Mountain ski resort in Thompsonville and ahead of two other children and a certified ski instructor, resort spokesman Brian Lawson tells PEOPLE. Delaney, who had been attending ski classes at the resort since she was 3 years old, was classified as a Level 4 skier, “which means her skill and control far exceeded the terrain,” he said.\n\nThough “she was a proficient skier,” he said, “she may have caught an edge or slipped a little bit. That’s when she struck a tree.”\n\nIt is unknown how fast she was going but “it’s clear there was loss of balance here,” Lawson said. The instructor “did exactly what she was supposed to do,” and summoned immediate medical attention, he said.\n\nThe girl was “unconscious, but alive” when paramedics arrived, Craig Johnson, Benzie County Medical Director, tells PEOPLE. She was transported to Munson Medical Center in Traverse City and then sent to DeVos Children’s Hospital in Grand Rapids, where she was pronounced dead, according to Lawson.\n\nDelaney’s death was the fourth fatality in the resort’s 60-year history and the first child, Lawson said, which left the employees shaken. “It’s like they’ve lost a family member,” he said. “It’s been extremely difficult for them.”\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Mom Who Fell to Her Death from Colorado Ski Lift Did Not Have Safety Bar Down\n\nFatalities at U.S. ski areas are rare. Of about 52.8 million skiers and snowboarders, 39 died last ski season, according to the National Ski Areas Association, a trade association.\n\nThough “fiercely encouraged,” helmets are not required at Crystal Mountain or in Michigan, Lawson said. About 80 percent of people do wear them but New Jersey is the only state that requires helmets, calling for skiers or snowboarders under age 18 to wear the head protector, the NSAA says.\n\nEvidence shows that helmets are “very effective” in reducing the rate of potentially serious head injuries, particularly at speeds up to about 13 mph, Dr. Jasper Shealy, an emeritus professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology who has studied ski-related injuries, tells PEOPLE.\n\nAt higher speeds, however — the average maximum speed was 27 mph in a study he conducted — the ability of helmets to prevent death drops, he says.\n\n“If you hit a tree or another fixed object,” Shealy says, “you’re simply going to need more than a helmet to save your life.”\n\nStill, he and other ski experts strongly recommend wearing one. “Wear a helmet by all means,” he says. “But don’t expect miracles.”",

  "latent_24472": "An argument about a secret congressional committee's ability to review the US intelligence agencies exploded into rare public view on Tuesday as angry senators demanded legal memos from a nominee to run the CIA's legal office.\n\nCaroline Krass, a top justice department lawyer, sparked the ire of several Senate intelligence committee members by claiming that crucial legal opinions about intelligence matters were beyond the scope of the committee.\n\nAsked directly and repeatedly if the Senate panel was entitled to the memos, which several senators claimed were crucial for performing their oversight functions, Krass replied: \"I do not think so, as a general matter.\"\n\nDianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who chairs the committee, suggested that Krass placed her nomination as CIA general counsel in jeopardy. \"You are going to encounter some heat in that regard,\" Feinstein said.\n\nThe Senate intelligence committee, whose public hearings are increasingly rare, is usually a bastion of support for the CIA and its sister intelligence agencies. The exception is the committee's prolonged fight with the CIA over a 6,300-page report on the agency's torture of terrorism detainees in its custody since 9/11.\n\nThe committee has prepared its report for years; the former chairman, Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, said the classified version contains 50,000 footnotes. For a year, the panel has sought to release a public version that multiple members of the panel say documents both the brutality of CIA torture and what they have called \"lies\" told by the CIA to the oversight committees in Congress and the rest of the executive branch concerning its torture practices.\n\nCIA director John Brennan, who was a senior CIA official during the years scrutinised by the committee, is resisting release of the report. The CIA has told reporters that the report contains numerous factual errors, which Senator Mark Udall, a Colorado Democrat on the panel, said on Tuesday was a \"misleading\" and self-serving description of differences of \"interpretation\" between the agency and the committee. \"I'm more confident than ever in the factual accuracy\" of the torture report, Udall said.\n\nThe panel said at the hearing that the CIA is stalling on the provision of documents to the committee that will help it complete its work. Krass, a former White House official who worked alongside Brennan there, did not assure the committee she would help provide them.\n\nKrass said the general counsel of the CIA had a \"duty and obligation to make sure the committee understands the legal basis\" for CIA activities. She worried that disclosure of the legal memos themselves would inhibit the executive branch from candidly discussing policy proposals for fear of embarrassing public disclosure.\n\nSeveral senators found Krass's statement insufficient. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who has investigated torture while serving on the Armed Services Committee as well, asked if the committee was \"entitled\" to the opinions as a matter of oversight.\n\nKrass said her \"caveated answer\" was, \"I do not think so, as a general matter.\"\n\nIt is unclear if the committee will reject Krass's nomination. But the two-hour exchange highlighted the difficulties the intelligence committees can face in getting basic factual information from the intelligence agencies they are tasked with overseeing.\n\nThose difficulties carry over to the ongoing controversy about the NSA's bulk surveillance activities, Udall and his colleague Ron Wyden of Oregon have charged. But they are the only dissenters on a committee that has been stalwart in favour of the NSA, even as the committee is feuding with the CIA.\n\nFeinstein got Krass to say she disagreed with a federal judge's opinion on Monday that the NSA's bulk surveillance of US phone data was likely unconstitutional. Krass, who would have a limited ability to oversee that program at CIA but likely has insight into it through her Justice Department role, disputed Judge Richard Leon's assessment that such constitutional protections surround that data.\n\n\"I have a different view about the Fourth Amendment,\" Krass said.\n\nFeinstein said she agreed with Krass, but said no one on the committee wished to contravene the constitution, urging the Supreme Court to settle the issue.",

(2:02)\n\nIRVING, Texas -- Jaylon Smith says his surgically-repaired left knee is making \"great improvements,\" but the Dallas Cowboys' second-round pick remains unsure as to when he will be able to play again.\n\n\"I'm just grinding each and every day, controlling what I can control. Once I'm healthy and I'm cleared, I'll be back out there,\" Smith said. \"Everything I do, I have a clear-eye view, a focused vision, a determination, so getting back out there is my No. 1 goal. It's definitely testing my patience, and I'm loving it.\"\n\nThe Cowboys selected Smith knowing there was a strong possibility he would not be able to play at all in 2016. He suffered torn anterior and lateral collateral ligaments in his left knee in Notre Dame's Fiesta Bowl loss to Ohio State. While the ligaments are healing, it is the nerve damage that he suffered that complicates the issue.\n\nSmith wears a brace from his foot to the middle of his calf. Whenever the nerve regenerates, the rehab process will pick up.\n\n\"We test accordingly,\" Smith said of the nerve issue. \"We give it some time and then we'll test. I'm not sure when the next test will be, but for me, it's just I have all of my trust in them and we're going to do some great things here in Dallas.\"\n\nWhile he is not on the field, he is in the meeting rooms with the players, learning the scheme. When he does get on the field, the Cowboys plan to play him at middle linebacker.\n\n\"You have a great group of guys in front of you,\" Smith said. \"I'm definitely learning a lot from Sean Lee, picking his brain each and every day. But for me, it's just learning the system, getting acclimated to my surroundings. When I'm back out there, it's going to be elite.\"",

Please read Update #6 for some exciting news and incentives!\n\n( Click \"Updates\" above the video ^^ )\n\nWe continue to receive more coverage! Scroll down to find links to Gizmag, Guitar Player, & many others! .....And our Video Gallery! ....And FAQ!\n\nIntroduction\n\nTyler Ramsey was kind enough to let us record while he tried out some of the different behaviors and sounds of the Vo-96 Acoustic Synthesizer. Clips of the unrehearsed footage are shown just as it happened with only stereo reverberation added to the mono recordings. Audio was recorded directly into the camera with the single large-diaphragm condenser microphone visible in some of the shots. We were thrilled by Tyler’s playing and intuitive command of the Vo-96!\n\nWe wish it were possible for everyone to personally try out a Vo-96 Acoustic Synthesizer. Holding and playing a standard steel-string acoustic guitar equipped with the Vo-96 immediately conveys the truth that this is something completely new – categorically new.\n\nThe experience wakens an intense sense of entering the unknown. You hold a familiar instrument yet it sounds and feels very different. Play and you are rewarded with fascinating, idea-generating sounds. Like Tyler found, you just want to keep playing and playing. You find sounds that go with music you already perform. You start to get ideas for new music and you try those. Soon there is no question: you definitely want one!\n\nHere is another video. In this one, a range of guitarists react to their first experience trying the Vo-96:\n\nEvery movement must have a beginning. Whoever you are and wherever you are in the world you can reach out and connect with us through this campaign. Make a pledge. Become a backer of Acoustic Synthesis. Help spread the word to other innovative guitarists by sharing our Kickstarter page, YouTube videos and website.\n\nIf you are such a guitarist we invite you to become one of the very first to experience this instrument. Join us and make history. The Vo-96 feature set and behavior is software defined. Future plans for software will be determined by guitarists’ actual experiences with these earliest Vo-96 equipped instruments – your experiences. Your ideas will be encoded!\n\nGet on the edge. Make the pledge that rewards you with a Vo-96 Acoustic Synthesizer!\n\nCAD Detail of the latest design of the Vo-96 transducer on a guitar.\n\nThe Vo-96 Acoustic Synthesizer - by Paul Vo:\n\nThe Vo-96 Acoustic Synthesizer is based on a key invention that enables accurate control of acoustic vibrations. I'm the inventor. My technology was behind the well-known Moog Guitar and the Moog lap steel -- instruments based on the same key principle. Since then I've been advancing this invention towards its full potential. Now I'm going ahead with the Vo-96 Acoustic Synthesizer. It's my full 'inventor's version' product and will be produced by my design company Vo Inventions LLC.\n\nThe Vo-96 was never intended to be a retail type of product. It is a concept product that takes the technology to the max and demonstrates what's really possible with acoustic synthesis. It's the “inventor's cut” and it leaves nothing out -- which makes it impractical to sell through the standard retail channels with their customary price mark-ups. Making the Vo-96 available through Kickstarter allows us to maximize the value to you and provide the most powerful product for the price; and there is simply nothing else available at any price that does what the Vo-96 does.\n\nOur goal is to launch Acoustic Synthesis technology with a bang. We want to put the most powerful instrument possible into the hands of as many forward-thinking guitarists as possible and listen to the new music you all create. This is where Kickstarter really shines! I'm thrilled to have found a way to offer the Vo-96 directly to you at the fairest price possible - about half what it would cost as a retail product!\n\nTo your right, check out the pledge levels that reward you with a Vo-96. Imagine it installed in a sweet-sounding guitar in your collection, or into a new guitar purchased just for this opportunity. In either case, you’ll be exploring new sounds and cutting edge technology, driven by your two hands, six strings and a fret board. The possibilities are as endless as your imagination, and as familiar as your favorite instrument.\n\nThe inventor setting a timbre. Note: The Vo-96 shown is the previous 'LEV' revision design.\n\nTested and ready to produce:\n\nVo Inventions has a great relationship with the Moog Music company. Last year testing was conducted by Moog Music whose relationships with artists allowed deep experimentation with this technology concept through a BETA test phase code-named LEV-96. Learning from the results, I made some important improvements to the electronics, user interface and particularly the mechanical design.\n\nThe Vo-96 Acoustic Synthesizer has over 1200 components, three high bandwidth digital signal processors, 12 channels of sub-microsecond analog sampling, 12 physical full bridge transducer drives and 96 virtual channels of vibration control. Wireless communication via Bluetooth lets it connect yet remain portable. There is an optional but highly recommended battery subsystem that makes it completely portable - just like an acoustic instrument is supposed to be!\n\nThe Core-96 Vibration Controller. Photo courtesy of Eric Church.\n\nThe initial \"LEV\" beta test version of the Vo-96, (12 units), have been out there and working for some months now, which gives us a lot of confidence about the integrity of the electronic design, the current revision of firmware and the overall instrument.\n\nWhen you become a backer of the Vo-96, you make it possible for me to incorporate important final mechanical design improvements that will make the synth interface even easier to attach to a guitar - one of the main things we learned in field testing. I'll make a 3D model to verify the new assembly and then officially advance the design. This will be the product we ship to you.\n\nWes Lambe's beautiful Jumbo-000. Courtesy of Wes Lambe.\n\nThe power of your pledge:\n\nAs an inventor I'm fascinated by the invention of Kickstarter and crowd funding in general. One of the hardest things to achieve is to create something that has never before existed and successfully have it manufactured and sold to customers. The more innovative a project is the harder it can be to find backers. Kickstarter makes it possible to reach the best kind of backer, that special person who will fuel the manufacture of my invention with a treasured combination of goodwill and the desire to own one of the first Acoustic Synthesizers ever made.\n\nEach pledge you make here on Kickstarter creates a strong commitment and ongoing relationship between us that goes well beyond merely buying and selling something. It's not unlike the relationship involved in commissioning a work of art, but it's actually something completely new and I commend Kickstarter for leading the way forward.\n\nYour pledge has power: Pledging at any level is very meaningful and significant to us. I think you'll enjoy owning the artistic rewards we offer! As an original backer you'll always be remembered. You'll be able to watch, listen and share ideas on the Acoustic Synthesis Forum, and you'll always be among the first to hear of new developments.\n\nWe have sub-assembly manufacturers all lined up and ready to begin production. All we need is the funding to turn all this on. Final assembly will be done under my direct supervision and I will personally test and sign each and every Vo-96 Acoustic Synthesizer we ship to you.\n\nWes Lambe Dreadnought Guitar - pics courtisy of Wes Lambe\n\nFunding targets:\n\nWith your backing, clearing the $50,000 hurdle will enable us to complete this final revision to the Vo-96 hardware and get the minimal quantity manufactured - at that level it is possible to go forward. If this campaign raises more than $200,000 we'll be able to fund faster software development and speed up the rate of updates for the owners of Vo-96 acoustic synthesis instruments. It comes down to this: the more you pledge, the more creativity will flow into acoustic synthesis and more incredible music and new invention will emerge.\n\nVo Inventions is offering up to 350 Vo-96 Acoustic Synthesizers here on Kickstarter. It would be so great to see them all in the hands of guitarists!\n\nThe Wes Lambe OM model guitar - pics courtesy of Wes Lambe\n\nMy Pledge of Quality:\n\nToday if you don't cut corners it's possible to design electronic equipment that will last for decades. That philosophy has guided my design choices with the Vo-96. There are no moving parts to wear out and no quickly degrading components such as electrolytic capacitors. Your Vo-96 Acoustic Synthesizer should keep working as long as your acoustic guitar remains playable.\n\nI've used the best available battery technology - a newer and reportedly safer battery than what you find in most laptop computers today. With the battery comes a sophisticated charger subsystem. The battery technology is called lithium iron phosphate - please look it up on Wikipedia where there is an excellent in-depth article.\n\nSoftware and the future:\n\nVo-96 behavior is software defined and still evolving. New features can be installed wirelessly. The current software, (it's actually called firmware), already defines an instrument that is great fun to play, but there is so much more to come. I mean it when I say we're on a journey of discovery together. Your Vo-96 Acoustic Synthesizer will be expanded and refined via updates. It will become even more amazing and rewarding to play. Your own ideas may about it may even become part of its future identity.\n\nMore information about the Vo-96 Acoustic Synthesizer:\n\nEvery owner of a Vo-96 is invited to be a member of a community of explorers. We are exploring acoustic synthesis and sharing impressions and ideas. You will help define the future of this instrument because we will be listening to you. Over the next weeks, we'll launch our forum and get ready for what I'm sure will be some lively discussions!\n\nMuch more information about the Vo-96 Acoustic Synthesizer is available online.

  "latent_24911": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The price of the digital currency bitcoin slid to its lowest level in nearly two months on Monday after bitcoin digital marketplace Mt. Gox said a halt on withdrawals it announced on Friday would continue indefinitely after it detected “unusual activity.”\n\nThe bitcoin price varied dramatically from one exchange to another, with Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, the best known operator of a bitcoin digital marketplace, recording one of the biggest drops for the day.\n\nOn the Mt. Gox platform the currency plunged to as low as $500 early on Monday, down more than 27 percent from Friday’s final price of $692, according to the Mt. Gox website. It last traded at $595.74, off nearly 14 percent from Friday.\n\n“This technical issue is of a much larger intensity than we’ve seen in the past,” said Sebastien Galy, currency strategist at Societe Generale in New York. “The market may be realizing that there are issues which are specific to these forms of currencies.”\n\nThe bitcoin in recent months started to gain wider acceptance, with Overstock.com and the Sacramento Kings basketball team both saying they would begin to accept the currency.\n\nMore recently, the digital currency has drawn increased scrutiny. New York state’s top bank regulator in late January revealed plans to regulate businesses handling transactions in bitcoin this year.\n\nTRANSACTIONS COULD BE ALTERED\n\nThe bitcoin price started falling fast on Friday when Mt. Gox said it was temporarily halting withdrawals due to unexplained technical issues.\n\nIn an updated statement on Monday, Mt. Gox said withdrawals were on hold indefinitely after it “has detected unusual activity on its bitcoin wallets and performed investigations during the past weeks. This confirmed the presence of transactions which need to be examined more closely.”\n\nMt. Gox said a “bug in the bitcoin software” could allow transaction details to be altered.\n\nIn effect, someone on the network could alter transaction details to make it appear a transfer of bitcoins from one digital wallet to another had not occurred when in fact it had. This might cause the transfer to be repeated.\n\nA bitcoin wallet is an application that stores bitcoins for the currency’s users.\n\nMt. Gox said the issue was not limited to the exchange and “affects all transactions where bitcoins are being sent to a third party.” It said the withdrawal suspension would be in effect until the issue has been resolved.\n\nCoinDesk, which launched the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index in September, removed Mt. Gox from its index Monday, citing its “persistent failure to meet the index’s standards for inclusion.”\n\n“These recent withdrawal restrictions are just the latest in a series of issues which have made Mt. Gox’s inclusion in the BPI problematic,” CoinDesk said.\n\nOn CoinDesk’s bitcoin index, the bitcoin price was lower but not by nearly as much as on the Mt. Gox platform. The CoinDesk index showed bitcoin at $667.79 on late Monday afternoon, down about 5 percent from Friday’s close of $703.57. Its low for the day was around $540 versus $500 on Mt. Gox.\n\nMock Bitcoins are displayed on a table in an illustration picture taken in Berlin January 7, 2014. REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski\n\nOn both platforms, the price was still around the lowest since late December. The price had topped $1,000 as recently as late January.\n\n“With the volatility in the currency being as much as it is, it’s going to take some time before we get enough of a comfort level from investors and merchants to enable it to be used ubiquitously,” said Darrin Peller, managing director at Barclays in New York.\n\nThe arrest of a prominent bitcoin advocate just over two weeks ago threw a spotlight on the currency. Charlie Shrem, 24, operator of the Bitinstant bitcoin exchange company, was charged by U.S. prosecutors with conspiring to commit money laundering by helping to funnel cash to illicit online drugs bazaar Silk Road. The following day Shrem resigned as vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group.",

What could be more reasonable if you’re out to protect bees from near-term extinction than preventing them being sprayed with acutely toxic pesticides while they’re foraging for the pollen and nectar with which they’ll feed themselves and their young and store up food to last the winter?\n\nSo why would beekeepers be against it? For that matter, why would USDA be against it?\n\nPolitics separates USDA and EPA on bee recomendations\n\nThe answer is: for lots of reasons.\n\nAccording to an article in Aggrow, an industry publication [behind paywall here], the EPA’s plan “could undermine existing efforts by beekeepers and farmers to ensure that contracted pollinators are protected from legal pesticide uses,” and has not incorporated a cost benefit analysis of the economic impact of its recommendations.\n\nThe proposed action denies farmers the use of established best management practices to mitigate harms to pollinators, providing little flexibility to farmers in managing pests at bloom time,” wrote Sheryl Kunickis, director of the USDA’s Office of Pest Management Policy, in an August letter.\n\nFarmers and beekeepers form an ages-old partnership. Because beekeepers generally don’t own enough land on which their bees can forage amid varied plant life all summer long, they need access to farmers’ vast acreage, with its crops and other vegetation, to support their bees. Farmers have traditionally welcomed beekeepers’ hives onto their lands, since, at worst, the bees do no harm and, at best, they help pollinate any crops requiring pollination that the farmer may be growing. Indeed, pollination is so critical for some crops that farmers or growers hire beekeepers to place hives among their crops to pollinate them. But even when this isn’t essential or even helpful for farm production, beekeepers and farmers have long traditions of making informal verbal or hand-shake deals through which the beekeepers get access to the farmer’s lands so that the bees can forage there. Often the farmer agrees to take a share of the beekeeper’s honey production as compensation.\n\nSome farmers and bee keepers believe that the EPA’s new draft rule limiting foliar pesticide applications, ostensibly to protect bees, threatens to disrupt this farmer-beekeeper partnership.\n\nAccording to the California State Beekeepers Association, EPA’s proposal would likely result in a reduction in demand for beekeeper’s pollination services for melon, seed and fruit crops because it would prevent growers from effectively controlling predatory insects, which would, in turn, lead to a reduction in acreage planted.\n\n“The lasting effect would be a decrease in the honey bee population” ultimately putting “great pressure on the national food supply,” noted the CSBA, concluding, “While there are many obstacles that face our industry and bees in general, we believe this proposal would not be significantly beneficial to bees and would in fact be detrimental to commercial beekeepers.”\n\nRandy Oliver, California beekeeper and author of the scientific beekeeper blog, has pointed out a number of problems with EPA’s proposal.\n\nThe proposed rule’s exclusive focus on bees under contract to pollinate crops forces growers to choose between pollinating their crops and protecting them from pests — a choice, if presented that starkly, that has the potential of “making beekeepers into pariahs on agricultural lands.”\n\nWithout a very careful definition of ‘contract’, the traditional ‘handshake deals’ through which farmers welcome beekeepers’ hives onto their lands could be affected and disrupted – further restricting the acreage to which bees have access for forage.\n\nIn any case, the risks to bees under contract for pollination services are already effectively handled in the contracts themselves, which typically require indemnification of the beekeeper for any pesticide-related loss or damage to the hives.\n\nWhat’s more, Oliver noted, EPA’s new draft rule ignores the potential pesticide threats to wild, native pollinators, which EPA also has a responsibility to protect. It also does nothing to prevent bees from being harmed by pesticides used on adjoining farms that don’t have pollination services contracts for bees (foraging bees can’t recognize or respect property lines!). EPA’s brittle rule-making approach could allow a farmer to ‘game the system’ by concentrating bee hives contracted for pollination services on a small, separate parcel of land merely to circumvent the foliar spray rule. In this way, a farmer could retain complete freedom to spray pesticides on vast acres of adjoining cropland, which would, of course, be visited by the bees but where their pollination services wouldn’t actually be ‘under contract.’\n\nThe USDA has pointed to other flaws in EPA’s proposed new rule. It noted that the EPA failed to demonstrate in many cases any actual risk to bees from chemicals on its target list, since a number of them are applied to the soil (where they doesn’t affect bees) before plants have even emerged or in their early growth stages, long before flowing and bee foraging. Further, the USDA noted, that the EPA:\n\nFailed to consider real-world factors, such as product formulation, application rate and timing, and residual toxicity, that could minimize or render negligible any risk to bees from spray applications during bloom of the many products affected by its new rule;\n\nFailed to perform the required cost-benefit analysis to account for the adverse impact of its proposed new rule on farmers’ crops;\n\nPre-empted documented, effective ‘best management techniques’ that would enable pesticides to be spray-applied during bloom in bee-safe manner;\n\nPossibly bypassed proper procedures for issuing a regulation of this scope and consequences.\n\nThe proposed Federal action targeted to protect bees end could end up threatening to damage bees and their keepers by imposing a rigid, ‘one-size-fits-all’ regulation. The action seems particularly curious considering that the honey bee crisis is now recognized as overblown and populations are at an all-time high in Europe and North America. In the U.S., it was reported in August that honey bee hives are at a 20-year record. Why such an obsessive focus on pesticides by the EPA when it is all but universally recognized that the problems affecting honey bee health today are complex and multi-factorial–with pesticides playing a comparatively minor role?\n\nThe EPA, USDA and the White House are clearly under fierce and conflicting pressure from environmentalists, beekeepers, farmers and the bee and pesticide industries. That’s all the more reason that they should base their decisions on the latest data and established science.\n\nJon Entine, executive director of the Genetic Literacy Project, is a Senior Fellow at the World Food Center’s Institute for Food and Agricultural Literacy, University of California-Davis.

  "latent_25216": "What to do if you find kittens\n\nIf you find young kittens without their mom, it does not automatically mean they have been abandoned by their mother. The mother could be out looking for food, or finding a more suitable home for her kittens. If you find one or two kittens, their mother may be in the process of moving the family and is on her way back for the others.\n\nWait and observe from a distance for an hour or two.\n\nIn each situation, you will ultimately have to use your own judgment to decide how to handle the kittens, depending upon the litter’s needs and your time and resources.\n\nKeep the following in mind when deciding what to do next:\n\nKittens have the best chance of survival with their mother.\n\nIf you bring the cats inside you should keep them separate from your animals until evaluated by a veterinarian.\n\nFor proper social development, kittens should be kept with their litter (and mother, if possible) until at least 8 weeks of age.\n\nUnweaned kittens in animal shelters\n\nAlmost all animal shelters will immediately kill unweaned kittens, as they do not have the resources to feed the kittens around the clock.\n\nAPA! cannot directly intake animals from the public. If you find kittens outdoors, please refer to the guidelines recommended by Austin Animal Center. If the kittens are unweaned and the mother hasn’t returned, you can bring the kittens to AAC or Austin Humane Society. While AAC will not bottle feed the kittens there, they will ensure that the kittens are transferred to either APA! or AHS to be cared for until they are old enough to be adopted out. When an unweaned kitten comes in to APA! our volunteers immediately transfer the kitten(s) to our Neonatal Kitten Nursery.\n\nCaring for unweaned kittens\n\nKittens without a mother\n\nIf the kittens aren’t weaned, and you take them in without a mother, they will require round-the-clock care and routine bottle feeding (every 2-3 hours, even overnight). Search “how to care for unweaned kittens” and you will find a multitude of great resources to help you feed the kittens. You should also watch the following videos:\n\nHow to feed unweaned kittens\n\nHow to feed older kittens\n\nYoung kittens without their mother need to be kept warm and should not be bathed.\n\nIf you cannot do this, you can try asking friends or family for help.\n\nKittens with a friendly mother\n\nIf the mother does return, and she is friendly, the best approach is to take her with her kittens indoors until the kittens are old enough to be weaned, sterilized, and adopted. Momma should then be spayed and either placed in an adoptive home or returned to her territory.\n\nDid you find a stray cat and realize that she is pregnant? Watch this video for help.\n\nKittens with a feral mother\n\nIf the mother is feral, the family should stay outdoors with shelter, food and water provided. When the kittens are weaned, they should move indoors for socialization, and sterilization. Momma should be trapped, spayed and returned.\n\nKittens are old enough to be weaned around 5 weeks – when they really start to run around. For proper social development, feral kittens should be removed from their mother around 5 weeks of age, and brought indoors. Kittens from tame moms do not need to be moved from mom at 5 weeks.\n\nTips for judging a kitten’s age\n\nUnder one week: Eyes shut, ears flat to head, skin looks pinkish. Part of umbilical cord may still be attached.\n\n1 week-10 days: Eyes beginning to open, ears still flat. A kitten this age is smaller than your hand.\n\n3 weeks: Eyes are fully open, ears are erect, teeth are visible. Kittens this age are just starting to walk and will be very wobbly.\n\n4-5 weeks: Eyes have changed from blue to another color and/or kittens have begun to pounce and leap. Kittens this age will begin to eat gruel or canned food.\n\nFinding weaned kittens a home\n\nWhen kittens are at least 8 weeks old and have been fully socialized and sterilized, they (and momma, if she’s friendly) are ready for their forever home.\n\nPlease take a look at the resources we have available to help guide you in finding the kittens a home. Remember, the younger the kitten, the easier it will be to find a new family, so start looking for their home(s) early!\n\nEven if you cannot keep the cats until they are 8 weeks old, keeping them until they are 6 weeks old before taking them to a shelter gives them the best chance of living.\n\nMore Resources\n\nCheck out more resources to help and find low cost spay/neuter options.",

Like so many elite recruits for the Buckeyes under head coach Urban Meyer, the odds of Hooker staying the course were slim.\n\nIt seemed inevitable that Hooker would jump to the NFL at the first available opportunity when his glowing scouting reports started making the rounds.\n\nIn October, one NFL scout raved about Hooker's upside to Albert Breer of The MMQB: \"Dude is the best player on the field. I like him better than both safeties last year [Karl Joseph and Keanu Neal]. ... First-rounder. Physical, quick, fast and explosive with a great nose for the ball.\"\n\nBreer even noted that he's heard some scouts bring up Ed Reed's name as a comparison for Hooker. It's hard to do better than Reed, who was a five-time first-team All-Pro and 2004 Defensive Player of the Year, in terms of the best safeties of all time.\n\nA playmaking safety who can defend the run and create turnovers in the passing game won't have to wait long before hearing his named called on draft day.

  "latent_25586": "This has been nearly finished for a long time. I thought I should finally release it on Father’s day, in honor of my dad who has made several attempts to understand group theory despite an ocean and 8 time zones separating us.\n\nGroup Theory\n\nI am always unsure of how to explain what I do to non-mathematicians. In order to understand my research someone first has to understand some group theory, in particular character theory of finite groups. Group theory is a part of abstract algebra that deals with symmetry. For that reason it shows up throughout mathematics as well as physics, chemistry, cryptography, etc. Today, I won’t explain group theory, but I’ll give you a pretty picture of its greatest achievement: The Classification of Finite Simple Groups.\n\nA major goal of group theory has been to characterize what types of finite groups can exist. That is to say, what sorts of symmetries of finite objects can exist. The mathematical community has succeeded in part by classifying all the finite simple groups. Stated simply (pun intended), simple groups are groups which cannot be constructed from smaller pieces. It is not true that they are in fact simple in the conventional sense of the word. The problem of how to build groups from smaller pieces seems hopeless to understand in full generality. This is quite similar to the problem of understanding all molecules compared to understanding all elements.\n\nThere is a good article from a few years ago about group theory and the CFSG, as it is known colloquially. It is the longest proof ever written, weighing in at over 10,000 pages in its original form of about 500 journal articles. There is currently an initiative underway to rewrite the entire proof in a more concise and relaxed style. The first 6 volumes, and 2 volumes on quasi-thin groups, have already been published, in case someone wants to get me a Christmas present. :-)\n\nThe Periodic Table\n\nProbably more familiar to most people is Mendeleev’s Periodic Table of the Elements. This is a listing of all the known elements, in order of increasing atomic number, into a table so that the elements in a column have similar properties (due to the configuration of outer electrons). Sometimes we forget just how amazing the periodic table is. After all, why should the chemical properties of the elements repeat periodically when ordered by atomic number?\n\nThe periodic table is certainly ubiquitous in popular culture, with periodic tables of many different subjects appearing on the internet. This is no doubt due to the fact that nearly everyone is familiar with it from High School chemistry. Below are a sampling of the diverse nature of the periodic tables available.\n\nI just threw in for free Abecedarium of Periodic Tables. Now I just need a Periodic Table of Abecedaria… or a Periodic Table of Periodic Tables. Maybe an Abecedarium of Abecedaria should be next?\n\nA periodic table strikes me as a good way to display the finite simple groups since, apart from 26 sporadic groups and the trivial group (which in not usually included), they all fall into families which can be arranged as the columns of the table. Moreover, there is one family that is completely different than the others (the cyclic groups of prime order), which corresponds to the noble gases. The alkali metals are also fairly different and have a parallel in the alternating groups which are quite different than the groups of Lie type.\n\nDespite the abundance of periodic tables, I could never find a Periodic Table of Finite Simple Groups. So I decided that I had to take action, and I created The Periodic Table of Finite Simple Groups.\n\nHow I created it\n\nMy guiding principles in creating the Periodic Table of Finite Simple Groups were to be visually attractive, look as much like the real periodic table as possible, and be laid out in a logical manner. Initially I was inspired by Ivan Griffin’s (nice name BTW) periodic table written in LaTeX/TikZ, and early versions of my table were based on it. At this point, our versions bear no resemblance to each other apart from the fact that they are both written in LaTeX and TikZ and they use some of the same colors.\n\nSince I wrote it in LaTeX with TikZ, the result is a pdf. The paper size is not standard because it was easier to construct that way. However zooming to fit on A4, or other A sized paper should work well. US Letter will be slightly more awkward, but should pose no real problems.\n\nPerhaps the most difficult part, besides deciding on a layout, was getting the orders (that means the size of the group) to look good. I wanted them formatted with spaces separating groups of 3 digits, and broken across lines. It was also obvious that they would need different sized fonts. I made the formatting automatic based on the number of digits so that, for example, less than 15 digits goes on one line, less than 40 on two lines, and so on. While such a thing is certainly possible to write in pure (La)TeX, I thought it would be much easier to write in lua using LuaLaTeX. It turns out it wasn’t too difficult. By far the hardest part was making sure that things didn’t get expanded incorrectly, a task made more difficult by my desire to keep everything in a single file.\n\nThe Table Explained\n\nIn each column the groups increase in size going down, and as a very general rule I tried to put smaller groups to the left. More important however, was that similar families be next to each other. The same logic appears in the arrangement of the sporadic groups, where, for instance, all the Mathieu groups are together despite this causing orders to skip around a bit.\n\nI also considered the non-classical groups to be “less important” and so there are fewer rows of them to better match the look of the real periodic table. They also have larger orders so it makes sense to include fewer of them on the table.\n\nSince there are no “sporadic” elements, I had to decide what to do with the sporadic simple groups. These are groups that don’t fall into any of the other families. At one point I put them in the upper right corner with a jagged boundary like the non-metals. This made the table resemble the real periodic table, but it had more rows and less columns so it looked rather “thick”. Unfortunately, it didn’t make as much sense from an algebraic point of view, so I placed them where the lanthanides and actinides are found instead. This is slightly misleading, because if enough new elements were to be discovered there would be another row in that section. But you can’t have everything perfect. After all, there are an infinite number of simple groups, and only a finite number of elements.\n\nI put the legend in the lower left like many periodic tables I have seen. I had a lot of space above the table, which I filled with Dynkin diagrams. Dynkin diagrams are the starting place for classifying the groups of Lie type. Note that the twisted groups of Lie type (those with a superscript to the left of the letter) arise from symmetries in the corresponding Dynkin diagrams.\n\nThe last row contains generic information and formulas for the family as a whole. Each cell contains some information, namely the order on the bottom, and the symbol most commonly used to denote it. The upper left will contain other symbols by which they may be known. For example the family of groups is also known as , and . The same is true for the sporadic groups, the monster is known as , , and . For the rest of the groups, the upper left contains “sporadic isomorphisms”, e.g. is isomorphic to . The table is large enough that all such sporadic isomorphisms are on the table, except of course for the infinite family of isomorphisms . Such groups are listed only once: in the left-most column to which they belong.\n\nI have of course made every attempt to provide accurate information, but if you notice any mistakes or suggestions for improvements, please let me know: I did use wikipedia as one of my sources.\n\nEDIT: After a few people have asked in the comments, I feel like I should just state explicitly that anyone is free to use it for non-commercial use. The only favor I ask is that you let me see the finished product if possible.\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_25928": "Yea, so, that happened. According to a tweet by Brett Swain's representative, the 49ers wide receiver has agreed to terms with the team. I would imagine it is somewhere around the league minimum and he will be back to compete for special teams playing time in training camp.\n\nThe 49ers were forced to press Swain into duty late last season thanks to a variety of injuries to the wide receiver corps. As we head towards 2012 training camp, fingers remaining crossed that will be less of an issue.

I remain convinced the 49ers will add one more in the draft and an assortment of receivers in rookie free agency. Wide receiver is a position where it would not be surprising to see them use a first round pick, and it would not be surprising to see them wait it out and use a later round pick, hoping to find a diamond in the rough.

  "latent_25938": "A common refrain in the debate over how to respond to campus sexual assault is that the investigation of reported rapes should be carried out only by law-enforcement officials. On its face, that sounds like common sense. Why would anyone else investigate a violent crime?\n\nThe Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders endorsed that view at a candidates’ forum on Monday night, saying, “If a student rapes another student, it has got to be understood as a very serious crime, it has to get outside of the school and have a police investigation and that has to take place,” The Hill reported. The U.S. senator from Vermont added that “too many schools” were handling cases of sexual assault.\n\nMr. Sanders’s remarks drew quick criticism from advocates for victims of campus sexual assault:\n\nDid Bernie say that campus rape must be investigated by the police?

Various court decisions have in recent decades established that sexual harassment (including assault) constitutes gender discrimination that can limit a student’s educational opportunity.\n\nColleges, because they receive financial aid from the federal government, must protect students’ civil rights — and that means responding to, investigating, and resolving reported rapes. The Obama administration in 2011 underscored that responsibility when it issued guidance in the form of a “Dear Colleague” letter.\n\nActivists have embraced Title IX as a tool to fight what they see as an inadequate response by many colleges to the issue — and as an alternative to a criminal-justice system they see as deeply flawed.

  "latent_26113": "What is the point of government inspections? Why waste money on them? Not that there’s anything wrong with inspectors. They often expose dreadful goings on in various institutions, but our governments take not a blind bit of notice. We have had some top notch inspectors of prisons: diligent, scrupulous, forthright, outraged, but have our prisons improved? No. They seem to have got even worse.\n\nLast week the latest chief inspector, Peter Clarke, produced a grim report, describing a “staggering rise” in violence in youth jails in England and Wales, – none of those inspected in 2017 were deemed safe. Reforms, says Clarke, are “a matter of urgency”.\n\nNothing new there then. Reforms were urgent when Judge Stephen Tumin, chief inspector from 1987-1995, complained of the “grim environment”, “filthy corridors” and “damaged children picking up further criminal habits” in young offenders’ institutions. And, in 1992 Tumin “deplored … arrangements for the mother and baby unit” in Holloway, housed in a “cockroach-infested semi-basement, looking on to a dirty yard”.\n\nHow disappointing then, to hear in 1995 that the excellent chief inspector Sir David Ramsbotham and his team were “shocked by appalling living conditions and a harsh security regime” still flourishing in Holloway.\n\nRosemary knew Ramsbotham was spot on, because she worked in Holloway as a bereavement therapist with young women back then, and very hard work it was too. Not enough staff to escort the prisoners to sessions, harsh treatment, 23 hours a day lock-up, 14 suicides in one year, she says. But her group sessions seemed to help these women, until Rosemary was dismissed and another larger outfit took over, using a cheaper method.\n\nRamsbotham, who thought too many women were imprisoned for minor offences, fought so hard to improve prison conditions, and who Rosemary and I so admired, was forced to retire in 2001 by the Labour government. Jack Straw apparently wasn’t thrilled by his revelations. So I now suspect that the purpose of inspections is only to make governments look as if they give a toss, and might do something about the rotten state of prisons, schools, and now housing.

  "latent_26282": "An East Village apartment listing on Airbnb. View Full Caption Airbnb\n\nEAST VILLAGE — When 51-year-old Edward A., a circus performer, injured both his feet in a 2009 work accident he turned to Airbnb to make ends meet, renting out his apartment to tourists for short-term stays through the website.\n\n\"It enabled me to not to go into debt on the credit card, it enabled me to keep buying groceries and contribute to the New York economy,\" said the East Village resident of more than 20 years. \"It enabled me to stay in New York, to keep afloat.\"\n\nLike many New Yorkers, Edward is now “paranoid” over his Airbnb listing following a court ruling that slapped a landlord of an East Village building with a $2,400 fine after a tenant, Nigel Warren, rented out his room to tourists for a few days using the Airbnb website last September.\n\nThe highly publicized case framed city residents who offer their homes or spare rooms as rentals for less than 30 days through the website as operating \"illegal hotels\" and in violation of city regulations, an interpretation of the law that Airbnb argues isn't always the case.\n\n\"It is my primary source of income,\" said an East Village resident, 43, who like many spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions over their use of Airbnb. \"It is a real threat to my livelihood.\"\n\nThe self-employed woman said she started renting either her entire three-bedroom apartment or just a room through Airbnb two years ago so she would have more time to take care of a sick family member.\n\n\"It is a great money maker, I won't lie,\" she said, of the thousands of dollars she has made from dozens of Airbnb guests. \"It let's me be human. I'm not living a life of luxury, but I am comfortable.\"\n\nShe has already received a concerned call from a regular renter since the ruling. Edward A. said some of his bookings have already canceled.\n\nA 25-year-old young professional who lives within blocks of Washington Square Park, has decided to only rent out one room rather than her entire two-bedroom apartment due to the court ruling.\n\n\"I will be changing our listing,\" she wrote in an email to DNAinfo. \"We only wanted to sublet the whole apartment to earn some quick cash and get the money back that we put down on the apartment in the first place.\"\n\nLike other Airbnb hosts who spoke with DNAinfo New York, she remained unclear if a short-term rental for spare room while she stayed in the apartment would also be illegal.\n\nIn Warren's case he did not stay at the apartment while he rented out his room, but the other permanent co-tenant in the apartment did stay along with the Airbnb guests.\n\nHowever, the judge stated that because the guests were complete strangers and did not have access to the entire apartment the stay was illegal.\n\nAfter the ruling, Airbnb's head of global policy David Hantman wrote in a blog post that the judge had \"some fairly tortured reasoning\" in the ruling and it implied that \"the stay might be legal only if the host and guest intend to form a relationship or friendship of some kind.\"\n\nHe went on to call the law \"confusing and often contradictory\" adding that Airbnb is assessing its options to appeal the case.\n\nAirbnb does issue a general warning to those about to book a residence through its website stating that \"certain types of short-term bookings maybe prohibited altogether\" in certain cities, but in the warning it does not mention New York City.\n\nMarisa Senigo, a spokeswoman for the city's Environmental Control Board, which handed down the ruling, said the fine is the responsibility of the building or apartments owner including in Warren's case.\n\n\"Whoever owns the residence, that is the person responsible for the decision and the violation,\" she told DNAinfo New York.\n\nWhile Warren is only a tenant, he had previously agreed to take responsibility for the incident, according to an earlier news report by WNYC. It is unclear if he volunteered to pay the $2,400 in fines to landlord Abe Carrey, who is listed on the court documents.\n\nTenant, landlord and real estate lawyer, Paul Kenney, who has been practicing for 12 years, said the decision means in most cases using Airbnb is illegal in New York City.\n\n\"The law allows for house guests, but if you are charging a stranger to stay with you for less than 30 days it is most likely going to be against the new law,\" said Kenney.\n\n\"It is going to affect a lot of people,\" he added.\n\nDespite the ruling, some with listings on Airbnb are determined to keep their line of income from short-term apartment rentals.\n\n\"I am considering deleting my [Airbnb] account just because it is so visible and out there,\" said a 25-year-old East Village resident who works in advertising.\n\n\"Maybe it is time to go through Craigslist or other back channels,\" he said.",
  "latent_26290": "Beneficial effects of estrogen therapy on cognitive performance diminish with age and time following the loss of ovarian function. This has led to the ‘Window of Opportunity’ hypothesis, which states that estrogen therapy must be administered within a limited period of time following menopause in order to be effective. Effects of estrogen therapy on cognitive performance are due, at least in part, to the effects on cholinergic afferents innervating the hippocampus and cortex, and it has been suggested that the loss of estrogen effect with age and time following menopause is due to a substantial reduction in the function of these projections. The mechanisms that underlie the effects are not clear. GPR30 is a novel G-protein coupled estrogen receptor that is expressed in the brain and other tissues. Our recent studies show that GPR30 is expressed in areas of the brain important for spatial learning, memory, and attention. In addition, GPR30 in expressed by the vast majority of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, and appears to be an important regulator of basal forebrain cholinergic function. We hypothesize that GPR30 plays an important role in mediating direct effects of estradiol on basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, with corresponding effects on cognitive performance. Hence, GPR30 may be an important target for developing new therapies that can enhance or restore estrogen effects on cognitive performance in older women. Here we briefly review the cholinergic hypothesis and summarize our findings to date showing effects of a GPR30 agonist and antagonist on basal forebrain cholinergic function and cognitive performance.",
  "latent_26371": "This article is about Lord Kelvin. For other uses, see Kelvin (disambiguation)\n\nFor other people with the same name, see William Thomson\n\nWilliam Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, OM, GCVO, PC, FRS, FRSE (26 June 1824 – 17 December 1907) was a Scots-Irish[5][2] mathematical physicist and engineer who was born in Belfast in 1824. At the University of Glasgow he did important work in the mathematical analysis of electricity and formulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and did much to unify the emerging discipline of physics in its modern form. He worked closely with mathematics professor Hugh Blackburn in his work. He also had a career as an electric telegraph engineer and inventor, which propelled him into the public eye and ensured his wealth, fame and honour. For his work on the transatlantic telegraph project he was knighted in 1866 by Queen Victoria, becoming Sir William Thomson. He had extensive maritime interests and was most noted for his work on the mariner's compass, which previously had limited reliability.\n\nAbsolute temperatures are stated in units of kelvin in his honour. While the existence of a lower limit to temperature (absolute zero) was known prior to his work, Lord Kelvin is known for determining its correct value as approximately −273.15 degree Celsius or −459.67 degree Fahrenheit.\n\nHe was ennobled in 1892 in recognition of his achievements in thermodynamics, and of his opposition to Irish Home Rule,[6][7][8] becoming Baron Kelvin, of Largs in the County of Ayr. He was the first British scientist to be elevated to the House of Lords. The title refers to the River Kelvin, which flows near his laboratory at the University of Glasgow. His home was the red sandstone mansion Netherhall, in Largs. Despite offers of elevated posts from several world-renowned universities, Kelvin refused to leave Glasgow, remaining professor of Natural Philosophy for over 50 years, until his eventual retirement from that post. The Hunterian Museum at the University of Glasgow has a permanent exhibition on the work of Lord Kelvin including many of his original papers, instruments, and other artifacts, such as his smoking pipe.\n\nActive in industrial research and development, he was recruited around 1899 by George Eastman to serve as vice-chairman of the board of the British company Kodak Limited, affiliated with Eastman Kodak.[9]\n\nEarly life and work [ edit ]\n\nFamily [ edit ]\n\nWilliam Thomson's father, James Thomson, was a teacher of mathematics and engineering at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution and the son of a farmer. James Thomson married Margaret Gardner in 1817 and, of their children, four boys and two girls survived infancy. Margaret Thomson died in 1830 when William was six years old.[10]\n\nWilliam and his elder brother James were tutored at home by their father while the younger boys were tutored by their elder sisters. James was intended to benefit from the major share of his father's encouragement, affection and financial support and was prepared for a career in engineering.\n\nIn 1832, his father was appointed professor of mathematics at Glasgow and the family moved there in October 1833. The Thomson children were introduced to a broader cosmopolitan experience than their father's rural upbringing, spending mid-1839 in London and the boys were tutored in French in Paris. Mid-1840 was spent in Germany and the Netherlands. Language study was given a high priority.\n\nHis sister, Anna Thomson, was the mother of James Thomson Bottomley FRSE (1845-1926).[11]\n\nYouth [ edit ]\n\nThomson had heart problems and nearly died when he was 9 years old. He attended the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, where his father was a professor in the university department, before beginning study at Glasgow University in 1834 at the age of 10, not out of any precociousness; the University provided many of the facilities of an elementary school for able pupils, and this was a typical starting age.\n\nIn school, Thomson showed a keen interest in the classics along with his natural interest in the sciences. At the age of 12 he won a prize for translating Lucian of Samosata's Dialogues of the Gods from Latin to English.\n\nIn the academic year 1839/1840, Thomson won the class prize in astronomy for his Essay on the figure of the Earth which showed an early facility for mathematical analysis and creativity. Throughout his life, he would work on the problems raised in the essay as a coping strategy during times of personal stress. On the title page of this essay Thomson wrote the following lines from Alexander Pope's Essay on Man. These lines inspired Thomson to understand the natural world using the power and method of science:\n\nGo, wondrous creature! mount where Science guides;\n\nGo measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides;\n\nInstruct the planets in what orbs to run,\n\nCorrect old Time, and regulate the sun;\n\nThomson became intrigued with Fourier's Théorie analytique de la chaleur and committed himself to study the \"Continental\" mathematics resisted by a British establishment still working in the shadow of Sir Isaac Newton. Unsurprisingly, Fourier's work had been attacked by domestic mathematicians, Philip Kelland authoring a critical book. The book motivated Thomson to write his first published scientific paper[12] under the pseudonym P.Q.R., defending Fourier, and submitted to the Cambridge Mathematical Journal by his father. A second P.Q.R. paper followed almost immediately.[13]\n\nWhile on holiday with his family in Lamlash in 1841, he wrote a third, more substantial, P.Q.R. paper On the uniform motion of heat in homogeneous solid bodies, and its connection with the mathematical theory of electricity.[14] In the paper he made remarkable connections between the mathematical theories of heat conduction and electrostatics, an analogy that James Clerk Maxwell was ultimately to describe as one of the most valuable science-forming ideas.[15]\n\nCambridge [ edit ]\n\nWilliam's father was able to make a generous provision for his favourite son's education and, in 1841, installed him, with extensive letters of introduction and ample accommodation, at Peterhouse, Cambridge. In 1845 Thomson graduated as Second Wrangler.[16] He also won the First Smith's Prize, which, unlike the tripos, is a test of original research. Robert Leslie Ellis, one of the examiners, is said to have declared to another examiner \"You and I are just about fit to mend his pens.\"[17]\n\nWhile at Cambridge, Thomson was active in sports, athletics and sculling, winning the Colquhoun Sculls in 1843.[18] He also took a lively interest in the classics, music, and literature; but the real love of his intellectual life was the pursuit of science. The study of mathematics, physics, and in particular, of electricity, had captivated his imagination.\n\nIn 1845, he gave the first mathematical development of Faraday's idea that electric induction takes place through an intervening medium, or \"dielectric\", and not by some incomprehensible \"action at a distance\". He also devised the mathematical technique of electrical images, which became a powerful agent in solving problems of electrostatics, the science which deals with the forces between electrically charged bodies at rest. It was partly in response to his encouragement that Faraday undertook the research in September 1845 that led to the discovery of the Faraday effect, which established that light and magnetic (and thus electric) phenomena were related.\n\nHe was elected a fellow of St. Peter's (as Peterhouse was often called at the time) in June 1845.[19] On gaining the fellowship, he spent some time in the laboratory of the celebrated Henri Victor Regnault, at Paris; but in 1846 he was appointed to the chair of natural philosophy in the University of Glasgow. At twenty-two he found himself wearing the gown of a professor in one of the oldest Universities in the country, and lecturing to the class of which he was a first year student a few years before.\n\nThermodynamics [ edit ]\n\nBy 1847, Thomson had already gained a reputation as a precocious and maverick scientist when he attended the British Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Oxford. At that meeting, he heard James Prescott Joule making yet another of his, so far, ineffective attempts to discredit the caloric theory of heat and the theory of the heat engine built upon it by Sadi Carnot and Émile Clapeyron. Joule argued for the mutual convertibility of heat and mechanical work and for their mechanical equivalence.\n\nThomson was intrigued but sceptical. Though he felt that Joule's results demanded theoretical explanation, he retreated into an even deeper commitment to the Carnot–Clapeyron school. He predicted that the melting point of ice must fall with pressure, otherwise its expansion on freezing could be exploited in a perpetuum mobile. Experimental confirmation in his laboratory did much to bolster his beliefs.\n\nIn 1848, he extended the Carnot–Clapeyron theory further through his dissatisfaction that the gas thermometer provided only an operational definition of temperature. He proposed an absolute temperature scale[20] in which a unit of heat descending from a body A at the temperature T° of this scale, to a body B at the temperature (T−1)°, would give out the same mechanical effect [work], whatever be the number T. Such a scale would be quite independent of the physical properties of any specific substance.[21] By employing such a \"waterfall\", Thomson postulated that a point would be reached at which no further heat (caloric) could be transferred, the point of absolute zero about which Guillaume Amontons had speculated in 1702. \"Reflections on the Motive Power of Heat\", published by Carnot in French in 1824, the year of Lord Kelvin's birth, used −267 as an estimate of the absolute zero temperature. Thomson used data published by Regnault to calibrate his scale against established measurements.\n\nIn his publication, Thomson wrote:\n\n... The conversion of heat (or caloric) into mechanical effect is probably impossible, certainly undiscovered\n\n— But a footnote signalled his first doubts about the caloric theory, referring to Joule's very remarkable discoveries. Surprisingly, Thomson did not send Joule a copy of his paper, but when Joule eventually read it he wrote to Thomson on 6 October, claiming that his studies had demonstrated conversion of heat into work but that he was planning further experiments. Thomson replied on 27 October, revealing that he was planning his own experiments and hoping for a reconciliation of their two views.\n\nThomson returned to critique Carnot's original publication and read his analysis to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in January 1849,[22] still convinced that the theory was fundamentally sound. However, though Thomson conducted no new experiments, over the next two years he became increasingly dissatisfied with Carnot's theory and convinced of Joule's. In February 1851 he sat down to articulate his new thinking. He was uncertain of how to frame his theory and the paper went through several drafts before he settled on an attempt to reconcile Carnot and Joule. During his rewriting, he seems to have considered ideas that would subsequently give rise to the second law of thermodynamics. In Carnot's theory, lost heat was absolutely lost but Thomson contended that it was \"lost to man irrecoverably; but not lost in the material world\". Moreover, his theological beliefs led to speculation about the heat death of the universe.\n\nI believe the tendency in the material world is for motion to become diffused, and that as a whole the reverse of concentration is gradually going on – I believe that no physical action can ever restore the heat emitted from the Sun, and that this source is not inexhaustible; also that the motions of the Earth and other planets are losing vis viva which is converted into heat; and that although some vis viva may be restored for instance to the earth by heat received from the sun, or by other means, that the loss cannot be precisely compensated and I think it probable that it is under-compensated.[23]\n\nCompensation would require a creative act or an act possessing similar power.[23]\n\nIn final publication, Thomson retreated from a radical departure and declared \"the whole theory of the motive power of heat is founded on ... two ... propositions, due respectively to Joule, and to Carnot and Clausius.\"[24] Thomson went on to state a form of the second law:\n\nIt is impossible, by means of inanimate material agency, to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the temperature of the coldest of the surrounding objects.[25]\n\nIn the paper, Thomson supported the theory that heat was a form of motion but admitted that he had been influenced only by the thought of Sir Humphry Davy and the experiments of Joule and Julius Robert von Mayer, maintaining that experimental demonstration of the conversion of heat into work was still outstanding.[26]\n\nAs soon as Joule read the paper he wrote to Thomson with his comments and questions. Thus began a fruitful, though largely epistolary, collaboration between the two men, Joule conducting experiments, Thomson analysing the results and suggesting further experiments. The collaboration lasted from 1852 to 1856, its discoveries including the Joule–Thomson effect, sometimes called the Kelvin–Joule effect, and the published results[27] did much to bring about general acceptance of Joule's work and the kinetic theory.\n\nThomson published more than 650 scientific papers[28] and applied for 70 patents (not all were issued). Regarding science, Thomson wrote the following:\n\nIn physical science a first essential step in the direction of learning any subject is to find principles of numerical reckoning and practicable methods for measuring some quality connected with it. I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind: it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of science, whatever the matter may be.[29]\n\nTransatlantic cable [ edit ]\n\nCalculations on data rate [ edit ]\n\nTo understand the technical issues in which Thomson became involved, see Submarine communications cable: Bandwidth problems\n\nThough now eminent in the academic field, Thomson was obscure to the general public. In September 1852, he married childhood sweetheart Margaret Crum, daughter of Walter Crum;[30] but her health broke down on their honeymoon, and over the next seventeen years, Thomson was distracted by her suffering. On 16 October 1854, George Gabriel Stokes wrote to Thomson to try to re-interest him in work by asking his opinion on some experiments of Michael Faraday on the proposed transatlantic telegraph cable.\n\nFaraday had demonstrated how the construction of a cable would limit the rate at which messages could be sent – in modern terms, the bandwidth. Thomson jumped at the problem and published his response that month.[31] He expressed his results in terms of the data rate that could be achieved and the economic consequences in terms of the potential revenue of the transatlantic undertaking. In a further 1855 analysis,[32] Thomson stressed the impact that the design of the cable would have on its profitability.\n\nThomson contended that the signalling speed through a given cable was inversely proportional to the square of the length of the cable. Thomson's results were disputed at a meeting of the British Association in 1856 by Wildman Whitehouse, the electrician of the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Whitehouse had possibly misinterpreted the results of his own experiments but was doubtless feeling financial pressure as plans for the cable were already well under way. He believed that Thomson's calculations implied that the cable must be \"abandoned as being practically and commercially impossible\".\n\nThomson attacked Whitehouse's contention in a letter to the popular Athenaeum magazine,[33] pitching himself into the public eye. Thomson recommended a larger conductor with a larger cross section of insulation. He thought Whitehouse no fool, and suspected that he might have the practical skill to make the existing design work. Thomson's work had attracted the attention of the project's undertakers. In December 1856, he was elected to the board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company.\n\nScientist to Engineer [ edit ]\n\nThomson became scientific adviser to a team with Whitehouse as chief electrician and Sir Charles Tilston Bright as chief engineer but Whitehouse had his way with the specification, supported by Faraday and Samuel F. B. Morse.\n\nThomson sailed on board the cable-laying ship HMS Agamemnon in August 1857, with Whitehouse confined to land owing to illness, but the voyage ended after 380 miles (610 km) when the cable parted. Thomson contributed to the effort by publishing in the Engineer the whole theory of the stresses involved in the laying of a submarine cable, and showed that when the line is running out of the ship, at a constant speed, in a uniform depth of water, it sinks in a slant or straight incline from the point where it enters the water to that where it touches the bottom.[34]\n\nThomson developed a complete system for operating a submarine telegraph that was capable of sending a character every 3.5 seconds. He patented the key elements of his system, the mirror galvanometer and the siphon recorder, in 1858.\n\nSir William Thomson's telegraphic syphon recorder, on display at Porthcurno Telegraph Museum, in January 2019.\n\nWhitehouse still felt able to ignore Thomson's many suggestions and proposals. It was not until Thomson convinced the board that using purer copper for replacing the lost section of cable would improve data capacity, that he first made a difference to the execution of the project.[35]\n\nThe board insisted that Thomson join the 1858 cable-laying expedition, without any financial compensation, and take an active part in the project. In return, Thomson secured a trial for his mirror galvanometer, which the board had been unenthusiastic about, alongside Whitehouse's equipment. Thomson found the access he was given unsatisfactory and the Agamemnon had to return home following the disastrous storm of June 1858. In London, the board was about to abandon the project and mitigate their losses by selling the cable. Thomson, Cyrus West Field and Curtis M. Lampson argued for another attempt and prevailed, Thomson insisting that the technical problems were tractable. Though employed in an advisory capacity, Thomson had, during the voyages, developed a real engineer's instincts and skill at practical problem-solving under pressure, often taking the lead in dealing with emergencies and being unafraid to assist in manual work. A cable was completed on 5 August.\n\nDisaster and triumph [ edit ]\n\nThomson's fears were realized when Whitehouse's apparatus proved insufficiently sensitive and had to be replaced by Thomson's mirror galvanometer. Whitehouse continued to maintain that it was his equipment that was providing the service and started to engage in desperate measures to remedy some of the problems. He succeeded in fatally damaging the cable by applying 2,000 V. When the cable failed completely Whitehouse was dismissed, though Thomson objected and was reprimanded by the board for his interference. Thomson subsequently regretted that he had acquiesced too readily to many of Whitehouse's proposals and had not challenged him with sufficient vigor.[36]\n\nA joint committee of inquiry was established by the Board of Trade and the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Most of the blame for the cable's failure was found to rest with Whitehouse.[37] The committee found that, though underwater cables were notorious in their lack of reliability, most of the problems arose from known and avoidable causes. Thomson was appointed one of a five-member committee to recommend a specification for a new cable. The committee reported in October 1863.[38]\n\nIn July 1865, Thomson sailed on the cable-laying expedition of the SS Great Eastern but the voyage was dogged by technical problems. The cable was lost after 1,200 miles (1,900 km) had been laid and the project was abandoned. A further attempt in 1866 laid a new cable in two weeks , and the recover and complete the 1865 cable. The enterprise was now feted as a triumph by the public and Thomson enjoyed a large share of the adulation. Thomson, along with the other principals of the project, was knighted on 10 November 1866.\n\nTo exploit his inventions for signalling on long submarine cables, Thomson now entered into a partnership with C.F. Varley and Fleeming Jenkin. In conjunction with the latter, he also devised an automatic curb sender, a kind of telegraph key for sending messages on a cable.\n\nLater expeditions [ edit ]\n\nThomson took part in the laying of the French Atlantic submarine communications cable of 1869, and with Jenkin was engineer of the Western and Brazilian and Platino-Brazilian cables, assisted by vacation student James Alfred Ewing. He was present at the laying of the Pará to Pernambuco section of the Brazilian coast cables in 1873.\n\nThomson's wife died on 17 June 1870, and he resolved to make changes in his life. Already addicted to seafaring, in September he purchased a 126 ton schooner, the Lalla Rookh[39][40] and used it as a base for entertaining friends and scientific colleagues. His maritime interests continued in 1871 when he was appointed to the board of enquiry into the sinking of HMS Captain.\n\nIn June 1873, Thomson and Jenkin were on board the Hooper, bound for Lisbon with 2,500 miles (4,020 km) of cable when the cable developed a fault. An unscheduled 16-day stop-over in Madeira followed and Thomson became good friends with Charles R. Blandy and his three daughters. On 2 May 1874 he set sail for Madeira on the Lalla Rookh. As he approached the harbour, he signalled to the Blandy residence \"Will you marry me?\" and Fanny signalled back \"Yes\". Thomson married Fanny, 13 years his junior, on 24 June 1874.\n\nOther contributions [ edit ]\n\nThomson and Tait: Treatise on Natural Philosophy [ edit ]\n\nOver the period 1855 to 1867, Thomson collaborated with Peter Guthrie Tait on a text book that founded the study of mechanics first on the mathematics of kinematics, the description of motion without regard to force. The text developed dynamics in various areas but with constant attention to energy as a unifying principle.\n\nA second edition appeared in 1879, expanded to two separately bound parts. The textbook set a standard for early education in mathematical physics.\n\nKelvin's vortex theory of the atom [ edit ]\n\nBetween 1870 and 1890 a theory purporting that an atom was a vortex in the aether was popular among British physicists and mathematicians. About 60 scientific papers were written by approximately 25 scientists. Following the lead of Thomson and Tait,[41] the branch of topology called knot theory was developed. Kelvin's initiative in this complex study that continues to inspire new mathematics has led to persistence of the topic in history of science.[42][43]\n\nMarine [ edit ]\n\nThomson was an enthusiastic yachtsman, his interest in all things relating to the sea perhaps arising from, or fostered by, his experiences on the Agamemnon and the Great Eastern.\n\nThomson introduced a method of deep-sea depth sounding, in which a steel piano wire replaces the ordinary hand line. The wire glides so easily to the bottom that \"flying soundings\" can be taken while the ship is at full speed. A pressure gauge to register the depth of the sinker was added by Thomson.\n\nAbout the same time he revived the Sumner method of finding a ship's position, and calculated a set of tables for its ready application. In 1876, he constructed a harmonic analyzer, in which an assembly of disks were used to sum trigonometric series and thus to predict tides. Kelvin mentioned that a similar device could be built to solve differential equations.[44]\n\nDuring the 1880s, Thomson worked to perfect the adjustable compass to correct errors arising from magnetic deviation owing to the increased use of iron in naval architecture. Thomson's design was a great improvement on the older instruments, being steadier and less hampered by friction. The deviation due to the ship's magnetism was corrected by movable iron masses at the binnacle. Thomson's innovations involved much detailed work to develop principles identified by George Biddell Airy and others, but contributed little in terms of novel physical thinking. Thomson's energetic lobbying and networking proved effective in gaining acceptance of his instrument by The Admiralty.\n\nKelvin Mariner's Compass\n\nScientific biographers of Thomson, if they have paid any attention at all to his compass innovations, have generally taken the matter to be a sorry saga of dim-witted naval administrators resisting marvellous innovations from a superlative scientific mind. Writers sympathetic to the Navy, on the other hand, portray Thomson as a man of undoubted talent and enthusiasm, with some genuine knowledge of the sea, who managed to parlay a handful of modest ideas in compass design into a commercial monopoly for his own manufacturing concern, using his reputation as a bludgeon in the law courts to beat down even small claims of originality from others, and persuading the Admiralty and the law to overlook both the deficiencies of his own design and the virtues of his competitors'.\n\nThe truth, inevitably, seems to lie somewhere between the two extremes.[45]\n\nCharles Babbage had been among the first to suggest that a lighthouse might be made to signal a distinctive number by occultations of its light, but Thomson pointed out the merits of the Morse code for the purpose, and urged that the signals should consist of short and long flashes of the light to represent the dots and dashes.\n\nElectrical standards [ edit ]\n\nThomson did more than any other electrician up to his time in introducing accurate methods and apparatus for measuring electricity. As early as 1845 he pointed out that the experimental results of William Snow Harris were in accordance with the laws of Coulomb. In the Memoirs of the Roman Academy of Sciences for 1857 he published a description of his new divided ring electrometer, based on the old electroscope of Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger and he introduced a chain or series of effective instruments, including the quadrant electrometer, which cover the entire field of electrostatic measurement. He invented the current balance, also known as the Kelvin balance or Ampere balance (SiC), for the precise specification of the ampere, the standard unit of electric current. From around 1880 he was aided by the electrical engineer Magnus Maclean FRSE in his electrical experiments.[46]\n\nIn 1893, Thomson headed an international commission to decide on the design of the Niagara Falls power station. Despite his belief in the superiority of direct current electric power transmission, he endorsed Westinghouse's alternating current system which had been demonstrated at the Chicago World's Fair of that year. Even after Niagara Falls Thomson still held to his belief that direct current was the superior system.[47]\n\nAcknowledging his contribution to electrical standardisation, the International Electrotechnical Commission elected Thomson as its first President at its preliminary meeting, held in London on 26–27 June 1906. \"On the proposal of the President [Mr Alexander Siemens, Great Britain], secounded [sic] by Mr Mailloux [US Institute of Electrical Engineers] the Right Honorable Lord Kelvin, G.C.V.O., O.M., was unanimously elected first President of the Commission\", minutes of the Preliminary Meeting Report read.[48]\n\nAge of the Earth: geology and theology [ edit ]\n\nThomson remained a devout believer in Christianity throughout his life; attendance at chapel was part of his daily routine.[49] He saw his Christian faith as supporting and informing his scientific work, as is evident from his address to the annual meeting of the Christian Evidence Society,[50] 23 May 1889.[51]\n\nOne of the clearest instances of this interaction is in his estimate of the age of the Earth. Given his youthful work on the figure of the Earth and his interest in heat conduction, it is no surprise that he chose to investigate the Earth's cooling and to make historical inferences of the Earth's age from his calculations. Thomson was a creationist in a broad sense, but he was not a 'flood geologist'.[52] He contended that the laws of thermodynamics operated from the birth of the universe and envisaged a dynamic process that saw the organisation and evolution of the solar system and other structures, followed by a gradual \"heat death\". He developed the view that the Earth had once been too hot to support life and contrasted this view with that of uniformitarianism, that conditions had remained constant since the indefinite past. He contended that \"This earth, certainly a moderate number of millions of years ago, was a red-hot globe ... .\"[53]\n\nAfter the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859, Thomson saw evidence of the relatively short habitable age of the Earth as tending to contradict Darwin's gradualist explanation of slow natural selection bringing about biological diversity. Thomson's own views favoured a version of theistic evolution sped up by divine guidance.[54] His calculations showed that the Sun could not have possibly existed long enough to allow the slow incremental development by evolution – unless some energy source beyond what he or any other Victorian era person knew of was found. He was soon drawn into public disagreement with geologists,[55] and with Darwin's supporters John Tyndall and T.H. Huxley. In his response to Huxley's address to the Geological Society of London (1868) he presented his address \"Of Geological Dynamics\" (1869)[56] which, among his other writings, challenged the geologists' acceptance that the earth must be of indefinite age.[55]\n\nThomson's initial 1864 estimate of the Earth's age was from 20 to 400 million years old. These wide limits were due to his uncertainty about the melting temperature of rock, to which he equated the earth's interior temperature,[57][58] as well as the uncertainty in thermal conductivities and specific heats of rocks. Over the years he refined his arguments and reduced the upper bound by a factor of ten, and in 1897 Thomson, now Lord Kelvin, ultimately settled on an estimate that the Earth was 20–40 million years old.[59][60] In a letter published in Scientific American Supplement 1895 Kelvin criticized geologist’s estimates of the age of rocks and the age of the earth, including the views published by Charles Darwin, as “vaguely vast age”.[61]\n\nHis exploration of this estimate can be found in his 1897 address to the Victoria Institute, given at the request of the Institute's president George Stokes,[62] as recorded in that Institute's journal Transactions.[63] Although his former assistant John Perry published a paper in 1895 challenging Kelvin's assumption of low thermal conductivity inside the Earth, and thus showing a much greater age,[64] this had little immediate impact. The discovery in 1903 that radioactive decay releases heat led to Kelvin's estimate being challenged, and Ernest Rutherford famously made the argument in a lecture attended by Kelvin that this provided the unknown energy source Kelvin had suggested, but the estimate was not overturned until the development in 1907 of radiometric dating of rocks.[55]\n\nIt was widely believed that the discovery of radioactivity had invalidated Thomson's estimate of the age of the Earth. Thomson himself never publicly acknowledged this because he thought he had a much stronger argument restricting the age of the Sun to no more than 20 million years. Without sunlight, there could be no explanation for the sediment record on the Earth's surface. At the time, the only known source for the solar power output was gravitational collapse. It was only when thermonuclear fusion was recognised in the 1930s that Thomson's age paradox was truly resolved.[65]\n\nLater life and death [ edit ]\n\nIn the winter of 1860–1861 Kelvin slipped on some ice and fractured his leg, causing him to limp thereafter.[66] He remained something of a celebrity on both sides of the Atlantic until his death.\n\nIn the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902 (the original day of King Edward VII´s coronation),[67] Lord Kelvin was appointed a Privy Counsellor and one of the first members of the new Order of Merit (OM). He received the order from the King on 8 August 1902,[68][69] and was sworn a member of the council at Buckingham Palace on 11 August 1902.[70]\n\nIn November 1907 he caught a chill and his condition deteriorated until he died at his Scottish residence, Netherhall, in Largs on 17 December.[71]\n\nAt the request of Westminster Abbey, the undertakers Wylie & Lochhead prepared an oak coffin, lined with lead. In the dark of the winter evening the cortege set off from Netherhall for Largs railway station, a distance of about a mile. Large crowds witnessed the passing of the cortege, and shopkeepers closed their premises and dimmed their lights. The coffin was placed in a special Midland and Glasgow and South-Western Railway van. The train set off at 8.30 pm for Kilmarnock, where the van was attached to the overnight express to St Pancras railway station in London.[72]\n\nLord Kelvin’s coffin was then taken by hearse to Westminster Abbey where it rested overnight in St Faith’s Chapel. The following day the Abbey was crowded for the funeral, including representatives from the University of Glasgow and the University of Cambridge, along with representatives from France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Russia, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and Monaco. Lord Kelvin’s grave is in the nave, near the choir screen, and close to the graves of Isaac Newton, John Herschel, and Charles Darwin. The pall-bearers included Darwin’s son, Sir George Darwin.[73]\n\nBack in Scotland the University of Glasgow held a memorial service for Lord Kelvin in the Bute Hall. Lord Kelvin had been a member of the Scottish Episcopal Church, attached to St Columba’s Episcopal Church in Largs, and when in Glasgow to St Mary’s Episcopal Church (now, St Mary's Cathedral, Glasgow).[72] At the same time as the funeral in Westminster Abbey, a service was held in St Columba’s Episcopal Church, Largs, attended by a large congregation including burgh dignitaries.[74]\n\nWilliam Thomson is also memorialised on the Thomson family grave in Glasgow Necropolis. The family grave has a second modern memorial to William alongside, erected by the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow; a society that he was president of in the periods 1856-58 and 1874-77.[75]\n\nAftermath and legacy [ edit ]\n\nLimits of classical physics [ edit ]\n\nIn 1884, Thomson led a master class on \"Molecular Dynamics and the Wave Theory of Light\" at Johns Hopkins University.[76] Kelvin referred to the acoustic wave equation describing sound as waves of pressure in air and attempted to describe also an electromagnetic wave equation, presuming a luminiferous aether susceptible to vibration. The study group included Michelson and Morley who subsequently performed the Michelson-Morley experiment that undercut the aether theory. Thomson did not provide a text but A. S. Hathaway took notes and duplicated them with a Papyrograph. As the subject matter was under active development, Thomson amended that text and in 1904 it was typeset and published. Thomson's attempts to provide mechanical models ultimately failed in the electromagnetic regime.\n\nOn 27 April 1900 he gave a widely reported lecture titled Nineteenth-Century Clouds over the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Light to the Royal Institution.[77][78] The two \"dark clouds\" he was alluding to were confusion surrounding how matter moves through the aether (including the puzzling results of the Michelson–Morley experiment) and indications that the Law of Equipartition in statistical mechanics might break down. Two major physical theories were developed during the twentieth century starting from these issues: for the former, the theory of relativity; for the second, quantum mechanics. Albert Einstein, in 1905, published the so-called \"Annus Mirabilis papers\", one of which explained the photoelectric effect and was a precursor of quantum mechanics, another of which described special relativity, and the last of which explained Brownian motion in terms of statistical mechanics, providing a strong argument for the existence of atoms.\n\nPronouncements later proven to be false [ edit ]\n\nLike many scientists, Thomson made some mistakes in predicting the future of technology.\n\nHis biographer Silvanus P. Thompson writes that \"When Röntgen's discovery of the X-rays was announced at the end of 1895, Lord Kelvin was entirely skeptical, and regarded the announcement as a hoax. The papers had been full of the wonders of Röntgen's rays, about which Lord Kelvin was intensely skeptical until Röntgen himself sent him a copy of his Memoir\"; on 17 January 1896, having read the paper and seen the photographs, he wrote Röntgen a letter saying that \"I need not tell you that when I read the paper I was very much astonished and delighted. I can say no more now than to congratulate you warmly on the great discovery you have made\"[79] He would have his own hand X-rayed in May 1896.[80] (See also N rays.)\n\nHis forecast for practical aviation (i.e., heavier-than-air aircraft) was negative. In 1896 he refused an invitation to join the Aeronautical Society, writing that \"I have not the smallest molecule of faith in aerial navigation other than ballooning or of expectation of good results from any of the trials we hear of.\"[81] And in a 1902 newspaper interview he predicted that \"No balloon and no aeroplane will ever be practically successful.\"[82]\n\nThe statement \"There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement\" has been widely misattributed to Kelvin since the 1980s, either without citation or stating that it was made in an address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science (1900).[83] There is no evidence that Kelvin said this,[84][85] and the quote is instead a paraphrase of Albert A. Michelson, who in 1894 stated: \"… it seems probable that most of the grand underlying principles have been firmly established … An eminent physicist remarked that the future truths of physical science are to be looked for in the sixth place of decimals.\"[85] Similar statements were given earlier by others, such as Philipp von Jolly.[86] The attribution to Kelvin giving an address in 1900 is presumably a confusion with his \"Two clouds\" speech, delivered to the Royal Institution in 1900 (see above), and which on the contrary pointed out areas that would subsequently see revolutions.\n\nIn 1898, Kelvin predicted that only 400 years of oxygen supply remained on the planet, due to the rate of burning combustibles.[87][88] In his calculation, Kelvin assumed that photosynthesis was the only source of free oxygen; he did not know all of the components of the oxygen cycle.[dubious – discuss] He could not even have known all of the sources of photosynthesis: for example the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus—which accounts for more than half of marine photosynthesis—was not discovered until 1986.\n\nEponyms [ edit ]\n\nA variety of physical phenomena and concepts with which Thomson is associated are named Kelvin:\n\nHonours [ edit ]\n\nThe memorial of William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin in Kelvingrove Park next to the University of Glasgow\n\nArms [ edit ]\n\nCoat of arms of William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin Notes The arms of Lord Kelvin consist of:[99] Crest A cubit arm erect, vested azure, cuffed argent, the hand grasping five ears of rye proper.

  "latent_26386": "The discourse on Asia's so-called rise is dominated by comparisons of China and India, countries whose vast populations and buoyant economies have captured the imagination of international investors, journalists and policy analysts. Indeed, the India-China comparison is a virtual industry, born aloft on a river of books and reports that rely on florid bestial analogies featuring casts of tigers, elephants, dragons and tortoises.\n\n\"Chindia\"-scented rhetoric abounds with catchphrases that state the obvious, but whose import is less so. China has the hardware, India the software; India needs China's roads, China could do with India's political inclusiveness. Given how fundamentally different India and China are, though, these kinds of \"lessons learned\" (complete with PowerPoint presentations) are of limited value. An apple cannot become an orange simply because a McKinsey or Deloitte report asserts it would be beneficial for it to do so.\n\nTwo's Company\n\nThe more relevant comparison in Asia — and one with enormous implications for the global economy — is between India and its civilisational sibling, Indonesia. These two eclectic democracies have more in common than India and China, yet they are rarely hyphenated.\n\nWhile China's per capita GDP in 2013, adjusted for purchasing-power parity, was $9,600, the equivalent for India was a mere $4,000, putting it much closer to Indonesia's $5,200. China's investment in fixed capital in 2013 accounted for 46 percent of its GDP, compared to only 30 percent in India, a figure that is again more comparable to Indonesia's 33 percent. China is the global leader of merchandise trade, boasting well over a 10 percent share of the world total, while India's share is only 1.6 percent and Indonesia's is 1.0 percent.\n\nOn parameters of human development ranging from sanitation to malnutrition, India and Indonesia are once again closer to each other than they are to China. For example, around 37 percent of children under the age of 5 in Indonesia and 39 percent in India are stunted (that is, shorter than the World Health Organization's reference population) from malnutrition and related factors, compared to less than 10 percent in China.\n\nA list of the fundamental challenges confronting India today could just as well be Indonesia's. On the economic front, both nations need to boost manufacturing competitiveness to create the millions of jobs required to ensure their young and growing populations become a demographic dividend, rather than a Malthusian disaster. Both have governments that must attract foreign investment and fix creaky infrastructure, even as they assuage protectionist lobbies and battle entrenched corruption. Weak governance plagues both nations, as both Delhi and Jakarta continue to struggle to balance power between the center and provinces.\n\n\"Bhinekka Tinggal Ika\" (multiple but one), the Indonesian national motto, is in essence identical to the Indian catchphrase of \"unity in diversity,\" and they underscore the nations' comparable accomplishments in having managed to sustain national identities in societies fractured along ethnic and religious lines. Nonetheless, ensuring the rights of minorities remains a fraught undertaking for both countries.\n\nChina's problems are, for the main part, of a different nature. The country already boasts world-class infrastructure. It is an established manufacturing powerhouse and became the world's largest recipient of foreign direct investment in 2012. China's demographic problems look more like those of highly industrialised countries with their aging populations, low fertility rates and contracting labour forces.\n\nWith a single official language (India has 23), standardised written script, one major ethnic group, and political tendency (both past and present) toward imposing uniformity, China is also a more homogeneous nation in ethnic and religious terms than India or Indonesia. While China does not have a national motto, tianxia (\"all under heaven\") is a dictum long associated with the Middle Kingdom that stresses the complete political sovereignty of the Chinese emperor over all the land \"divinely\" ordained for him. It illuminates the strong centripetal tendency that has been, and still is, fundamental to the Chinese polity.\n\nUnlike India or Indonesia, contemporary China is preoccupied with foreign policy issues and the pressing of territorial and maritime claims. Economically, it needs to move up the value chain from a manufacturing hub to a services leader and an innovation center. Politically, China's leaders are focused on \"stability\" — a euphemism for ensuring the Communist Party's monopoly on power.\n\nConnections\n\nAn Indian's first reaction to China is often bewilderment. The language is wholly alien in sight and sound. The scale of the architecture seems outlandish. The highways are impossibly smooth, and the winter cold frighteningly desolate. Despite the fact that the days of everyone dressing in identical Mao suits are long over, there is an underlying uniformity to the physical and intellectual lives of the Chinese that is unfamiliar to Indians.\n\nEvery big Chinese city has identical glittering glass-and-chrome malls. Smaller towns use bathroom tiles as their construction material of choice. The heated political debates that are par for the course aboard Indian trains are absent; the pageantry of street demonstrations and strikes is missing. Calls to prayer and the ringing of temple bells are rarely part of the aural backdrop.\n\nIndonesia, on the other hand, is immediately familiar to an Indian. Regular demonstrations, featuring protestors who range from workers clamouring for a higher minimum wage to religious hardliners demanding the cancellation of beauty pageants, cause massive gridlock on the roads. Little retail shops selling everything from candy to talcum powder shelter in the shade of the extravagant malls. The call of muezzins punctuates the day, while the smell of moist earth emanate from gardens.\n\nEverywhere — embedded in the language, on street signs, in political commentary and on bus advertisements — are references to the Hindu epics of the Ramayana and Mahabharata. An enormous statue of Krishna leading Arjuna into battle dominates the roundabout in front of Monas, Jakarta's main nationalist monument. Even Indonesian Muslims are commonly named after Hindu gods and goddesses. Among the country's favorite forms of mass entertainment, particularly on the populous island of Java, is wayang kulit, shadow-puppet theatre that features tales from the Indian epics.\n\nConsequently, it remains common in both countries to express values like courage, strength and honesty with allusions to characters from Hindu stories. Even relatively hard-line Islamic political parties like the Partai Keadilan Sejahtera (PKS) have been known to hold wayang performances to boost their electoral fortunes. At a party convention held in Jogjakarta in 2011, for example, the PKS staged scenes from the life of Bima (a Mahabharata hero) to claim the need for a Bhima-like entity (the PKS itself ) to fight corruption.\n\nThe explanation for this affinity (it was not wholesale but tempered and modified by indigenous culture) is that for centuries, Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms ruled over large parts of the Indonesian archipelago. And Hindu cultural norms continued to infuse indigenous mores, even after large-scale conversion to Islam in the 16th century.\n\nColonial rule — British in India's case and Dutch in Indonesia's — disrupted many of the direct links between Indian and Indonesian kingdoms. Long established trade routes along which textiles, spices and ideas had travelled for centuries were gradually taken over by European powers from the 17th century on.\n\nIndia and Indonesia both gained their independence in the late 1940s, but the turn toward economic isolationism that characterised decolonisation in both only cemented the colonial disconnect. As a result, Indians and Indonesians today are generally unaware of their strong cultural ties. Yet, the India-Indonesia hyphenation is a reality that finds present-day resonance not only in value systems, but in language. A large percentage of the vocabulary of Bahasa Indonesia, a standardised form of Malay, derives from Indian languages, including Sanskrit, Tamil and Urdu.\n\nSimilarity in Diversity\n\nChina has long been a more territorially coherent entity than India or Indonesia. The geographical boundaries of China over the centuries have been mutable, but what we call \"India\" and \"Indonesia\" arguably did not even exist as political entities until the colonial period. Well into the second half of the 20th century, many Western commentators believed that post-colonial balkanisation was inevitable for both, given their eclectic mixes of languages, ethnicities and religions. India, the world's largest democracy, is a Hindu-majority country — but is home to almost as many Muslims as Pakistan, in addition to substantial numbers of Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Zoroastrians. Contemporary currency notes have the denomination written in 15 languages.\n\nIndonesia's remarkable diversity is less widely understood. With 250 million citizens, it is the world's fourth-most-populous nation and third-largest democracy. Superimposed on the map of Europe, the Indonesian archipelago would span the distance from Ireland to the Caspian Sea. It is home to 719 languages, spoken by people from over 360 ethnic groups (although, unlike India, it does have a national language: Bahasa Indonesia).\n\nSeven out of eight Indonesians self-identify as Muslims, implying that more Muslims live in Indonesia than in any other country. The state, however, also recognises five other religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Protestantism, Catholicism and Confucianism.\n\nIndia and Indonesia have grappled with secessionism on their peripheries for decades, but have nonetheless survived decolonisation almost intact. They have consequently defied the European concept of the ideal nation, in which a single religion, language and ethnicity is assumed to be the \"natural\" basis for a sustainable political state.\n\nThat India and Indonesia have not only endured but are among the fastest growing economies in the world today is a testament to the fact that it is possible to create a strong, common identity out of seemingly irreconcilable multiplicity. That they are able to calibrate such diversity within a democratic political system (Indonesia has been a democracy since the downfall of military dictator Suharto in 1998) is an achievement that sets them apart from China.\n\nHowever, both countries face major challenges in ensuring that democracy does not turn into the tyranny of the majority. Narendra Modi (India's current prime minister), who is widely hailed as an economic reformer, also stands accused of doing little to stop the 2002 religious riots that took place under his watch as chief minister in the State of Gujarat. More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed.\n\nModi denies that he was complicit and has been cleared by the courts; nonetheless, many civil-society groups continue to hold him culpable. Modi's political party is also closely affiliated with the right-wing Hindu organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, whose objective is to establish India as a Hindu nation. Thus India's pluralism cannot be taken for granted.\n\nIndonesia's new leader, Joko Widodo (popularly known as Jokowi), has stronger credentials among his country's minority communities. When he ran for governor of Jakarta in 2012, for example, he chose Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian of Chinese descent, as his running mate. Yet, minority Muslim groups, including Shia and Ahmadiyah, continue to protest discrimination at the hands of the majority Sunni Muslims. Christian groups have also complained about difficulties in acquiring permits to build churches.\n\nIndia and Indonesia eschewed theocracy as the basis for nation-building. Nonetheless, unlike in secular Europe, religion has an active place in the public life of both. As a result, they constitute important experiments in developing a third way for countries in which religion remains a central part of the identity of most citizens, but where the more intolerant aspects of religion are held in check.\n\nThe preamble to India's constitution asserts that it is a secular state. However, neither the constitution nor its laws define the relationship between religion and state. Instead, secularism is understood as respect for all religions.\n\nIndonesia's constitution leaves out the word secular altogether. The founding doc trine of Pancasila, which forms the basis for the constitution, professes a \"belief in the divinity of the one God.\" But by leaving out any reference to a specific God (in the face of opposition from Islamists who had wanted a concrete mention of Allah), the Indonesian constitution also protects freedom of religious belief and practice.\n\nAs India and Indonesia feel their way forward into the new millennium, there is inevitably confusion about their founding ideas. Conceptually, both nations are works in progress, rather than polished accomplishments. But this only underscores how germane their experiences are for each other.\n\nReligion remains a political force in each, even as development and fighting corruption have emerged as vote-winners. If the economic growth promised by the new governments in Delhi and Jakarta fails to materialise, it is possible that leaders, especially Modi, will fall back on stoking religious rivalries as a strategy aimed at the next elections. It is unclear, though, how voters would respond to such tactics.\n\nThis piece was written in collaboration with Tan Chin Hwee and was first published in the Milken Institute Review.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nTeen pregnancy (Photo: WKYC-TV)\n\nA program aimed at preventing teen pregnancy in western Iowa is in jeopardy because of a Trump administration decision to curtail federal money for such efforts.\n\nLike most of the country, Iowa has seen teen pregnancies become much rarer in recent years.

By 2015, that rate had plummeted to less than 19 per 1,000.\n\nSupporters of programs like the one in western Iowa say the decline in teen pregnancy is largely due to carefully designed education efforts, which help adolescents understand the effects of sexual activity and the benefits of waiting to become pregnant.\n\n“The reality is, as soon as you take away that education, those rates can pop right back up,” said Andi Grubb, education director for Planned Parenthood of the Heartland.\n\nGrubb oversees a program focusing on three western Iowa counties – Mills, Pottawattamie and Woodbury – and two eastern Nebraska counties. The counties were chosen because they had relatively high teen-pregnancy rates and because they lacked strong prevention programs, Grubb said.\n\nFederal officials recently notified Grubb’s agency that they would halt the program’s $966,000 annual grant money next June – two years before the five-year grant was scheduled to end.\n\nTrump administration officials said they decided to suspend more than $200 million annually in such grants because the education programs have not been proven effective. “The very weak evidence of positive impact of these programs stands in stark contrast to the promised results, jeopardizing the youth who were served, while also proving to be a poor use of ... taxpayer dollars,” according to a statement provided by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe department said it was reviewing the Teen Pregnancy Prevention grants, and would make recommendations to Congress about whether to restart them. “Decisions by the Department regarding the TPP program will be guided by science and a firm commitment to giving all youth the information and skills they need to improve their prospects for optimal health outcomes,” the statement said.\n\nGrubb said her program has reached more than 1,000 teens in western Iowa and eastern Nebraska. She said that after just two years, it is too soon to expect concrete evidence of its effect on teen births. However, she said, the instructors are using proven education methods. Proponents of such efforts say that by preventing unintended pregnancies, they can save public money that would be spent on health care and social services for teen parents and their babies.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Breaking News Alert newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Alerts on breaking news delivered straight to your inbox.

More newsletters\n\nGrubb said her agency's program tailors education efforts to different age groups. With sixth-graders, the instructors talk about resisting pressure they might come under to do things they don’t want to. “It’s really about helping young people understand what their boundaries are,” she said.\n\nWith older teens, the instructors discuss more specifics, including how to use contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases if the teens decide to become sexually active, she said. The program doesn’t distribute contraceptives, but it can refer teens to agencies that offer those products.\n\nGrubb said Planned Parenthood hopes to find other sources of money to continue offering at least parts of the education program.\n\nThe curtailment of federal grant money for the teen-pregnancy prevention program comes on top of a state decision in April that blocked $2 million in family planning money from going to Planned Parenthood of the Heartland and other agencies that provide abortions. In the wake of that decision, Planned Parenthood announced that it would be forced to close clinics in Bettendorf, Burlington, Keokuk and Sioux City.\n\nThe Legislature's decision meant Iowa is foregoing about $3 million in federal Medicaid matching money. Supporters said the change was worthwhile, because it meant fewer tax dollars would go to agencies that provide abortions. They said other organizations could step in to provide the family-planning services. But critics contend the change will limit access to birth-control options, especially for rural Iowans. That will lead to more unintended pregnancies and more abortions, they predict.\n\nAlong with a decline in teen pregnancies, Iowa has seen a dramatic drop in overall abortions. From 2007 through 2014, the number of abortions performed in the state fell 40 percent, from 6,649 to 4,020, according to the Iowa Department of Public Health.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/2vQ16am",

  "latent_26941": "Eight months after 13-year-old Molly Banzhoff died from an undetected brain tumor, her family is suing Concord Hospital, its affiliates and three of its doctors for medical negligence.\n\nFor months leading up to her death in early May, Molly’s pediatricians and emergency room doctors did not perform diagnostic brain imaging, even as the young teen repeatedly complained of severe migraines, nausea, problems with her vision and tongue numbness, which are “classic signs of a pediatric brain tumor,” according to the suit filed by Molly’s parents, Barb Higgins and Kenny Banzhoff.\n\nEven after Molly was admitted to the emergency room on May 1, doctors at Concord Hospital did not order an emergency CT brain scan until after Molly was unresponsive and had stopped breathing twice, the lawsuit states. At that point, the tumor growing in her brain was so large that it caused fluid to build up and massive pressure that “destroyed all neurologic function,” according to the suit.\n\nMolly was declared brain-dead five days later and was eventually removed from life support at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, surrounded by her family members.\n\n“Not only did they endure a loss that no family should have to endure, they watched helplessly as Molly needlessly suffered before her death,” the suit states. “They were forced to make the difficult decision to remove Molly from life support. After doing so, they laid with Molly, listening to her heartbeat slow and eventually stop.”\n\nBanzhoff and Higgins are seeking damages from Concord Hospital Inc., Concord Pediatrics, Concord Emergency Medical Associates, Concord Family Health Center, and Capital Regional Health Care Corp. as well as individual doctors Dolly Courtemanche, Elizabeth Hoffman and Ashley Fox.\n\n“Rather than order diagnostic testing to rule out the most dangerous possible cause of Molly’s symptoms, a brain tumor, the defendants either assumed Molly was faking it or that the most benign possible cause was the source of her symptoms,” the lawsuit states.\n\nConcord Hospital officials said they could not comment on medical care of a minor or on a pending lawsuit, but they released a short statement on Monday.\n\n“All of us at Concord Hospital were saddened to learn of the tragic death of Molly Banzhoff,” the statement said. “Although we are unable to comment on pending litigation, our sincere thoughts and prayers are with Molly’s loved ones and friends, who we know miss her dearly.”\n\nMonths of missed signs\n\nThe lawsuit, due to be filed in Merrimack Superior Court on Tuesday morning, lays out the months leading up to Molly Banzhoff’s death in painstaking detail. It cites nine “missed opportunities” where doctors could have ordered a brain scan but didn’t.\n\nMolly first went to Concord Pediatrics on Feb. 28 complaining of headaches and was told to come back if they persisted, got worse or other symptoms like vomiting occurred.\n\nShe was back in the doctor’s office on April 21 after waking up describing “squiggly lines” in her peripheral vision, as well as a headache, nausea and vomiting. Examined by Courtemanche, Molly said she had experienced “pounding headaches” for three weeks and intermittent nausea for a month.\n\nCourtemanche diagnosed Molly with a “classical migraine headache” and instructed further follow-up if the symptoms persisted.\n\nSix days later, on April 27, Molly woke up with similar symptoms and returned to Concord Pediatrics, where she was again examined by Courtemanche. During the visit, the teenager told the doctor she had experienced a pounding headache that morning, as well as several episodes of vomiting. She also complained of a new symptom – numbness in her tongue – according to the lawsuit.\n\nCourtemanche diagnosed Molly with a migraine and sinusitis and did not order any diagnostic tests, the lawsuit states. Instead, she prescribed Molly anti-nausea medication.\n\nEmergency room visit\n\nOn May 1, Molly went to the Concord Hospital Emergency Department after being woken up by a bad headache, nausea and vomiting that lasted for several hours, the lawsuit states.\n\nShe was evaluated by Hoffman, who documented Molly had not had brain imaging for her headaches and prescribed medication for her symptoms. While Hoffman did recommend brain imaging, she ordered an outpatient MRI to be done at a later date, rather than a CT scan, the lawsuit states.\n\nIn the emergency room that day, Molly’s health worsened. She became lethargic and was unable to follow the doctor’s commands when she was re-evaluated in the afternoon, according to the lawsuit.\n\nA pediatrician, Dr. Joseph Toshach, also evaluated Molly on May 1, the lawsuit states. He did a physical examination on the teenager, during which she did not respond to verbal commands.\n\n“Dr. Toshach attributed Molly’s sleepiness to her medication and lack of sleep,” the lawsuit states. “He recommended further observation in the emergency room to allow Molly’s medication to wear off and discharge her if her mental status improved.” Toshach also did not order a CT scan for the patient, according to the lawsuit.\n\nA few hours later, Hoffman came back to re-evaluate Molly and found she was still asleep, even though she had been given medication several hours prior. Hoffman signed Molly’s care over to Fox, the lawsuit states.\n\nThat night, Molly’s health continued to deteriorate. She needed two people to help her get to the bathroom that night, leaning heavily on Higgins, walking with her eyes closed and swaying while her mother tried to help her sit on the toilet, according to the suit.\n\nWhen Toshach returned to re-evaluate Molly, she was not responding to verbal stimulation or shaking.\n\n“Rather than order an emergent CT to rule out the most dangerous possible cause for Molly’s symptoms, a brain tumor, Dr. Toshach apparently assumed Molly was exaggerating, noting that there ‘appear[ed] to be a behavioral component to her somnolence,’ ” the lawsuit states. Toshach admitted Molly to the hospital for observation, ordering pain medications and IV fluids for her.\n\nWhen Molly was transferred to the hospital’s pediatric floor, nursing staff noted she had dried blood in her nose, swollen eyes and rapid breathing. By 1 a.m., her pupils were different sizes.\n\nDuring a catheterization by hospital staff, Molly stopped breathing twice and her face turned gray as her heart stopped, the suit states.\n\n“Molly’s family watched in horror as the nurse began chest compressions and called a Code Blue,” the suit states. Molly was put on a ventilator and Toshach “finally ordered an emergent CT scan.”\n\nThe scan revealed a large tumor causing pressure in her brain. A neurosurgeon was called to drain the fluid, after which he told her family “the pressure on her brain had been very high and, as a result, the brain injury she sustained may be irreversible,” according to the lawsuit.\n\nShe was transferred to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon for emergency brain surgery to remove her tumor. She was never able to regain neurological function and was declared brain-dead a few days later.\n\nAfter hundreds of her friends came to the hospital to visit and say goodbye, Molly’s family removed her from life support on May 7.\n\nMolly, a seventh-grade student at Rundlett Middle School when she died, was remembered later that month in a huge communitywide celebration called “Molly B: The Musical,” which included tributes and performances from friends and family members at Concord’s Capitol Center for the Arts. Many in the audience wore pink – Molly’s favorite color.\n\n“As a result of the defendants’ failures, Molly, a young, fun-loving, thirteen-year-old girl, is dead,” the suit concludes. “Molly will never dance in another recital or be part of a musical. She will never have a slumber party with her best friends. She will never laugh while making silly music videos with her sister. And, she will never grow up to graduate high school and college to be the successful woman that she was motivated to become.”\n\nSign up for the Monitor's free daily newsletter of top stories.\n\n(Ella Nilsen can be reached at 369-3322, enilsen@cmonitor.com or on Twitter @ella_nilsen.)",
  "latent_26982": "Lambeth Council says it will resume negotiations with the Garden Bridge Trust over the use of land on the South Bank after Transport for London slashed its funding for the bridge from £30 million to £10 million.\n\nThe council halted talks in September, citing concerns about the £60 million of public funds to be spent on the bridge, half from Transport for London and half from the Department for Transport.\n\n\"I'm pleased that Londoners are getting a better financial deal particularly at a time of austerity when all public sector organisations are being forced to make deep cuts to services,\" said Cllr Lib Peck, leader of Lambeth Council.\n\n\"We've been in tough negotiations with the Garden Bridge Trust and Transport for London and I'm pleased we've successfully agreed a deal that will cut London taxpayers' contribution towards the Garden Bridge by two thirds.\"\n\nLord Davies, chairman of the Garden Bridge Trust, said: \"We are delighted to move forward with the project.\n\n\"We have been hugely successful in our efforts to raise funds from the private sector, with £85 million pledged to date, and we have agreed that any of the committed funds from TfL spent over the £10 million will be treated as a loan.\n\n\"We are delighted the Garden Bridge can now progress and are grateful for all the support we've had.\"\n\nLabour's London mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan is claiming credit for the new deal.\n\n\"This is a much better deal for Londoners,\" he said.\n\n\"We've been able to secure an agreement which will allow the Garden Bridge to proceed while saving up to £20 million of Londoners' hard-earned money.\n\n\"At a time when public services are straining under pressure from cuts and increased demand, Boris Johnson was wrong to commit to £30 million of London taxpayers money to this project.\n\n\"But thanks to with this new deal, it looks like Londoners will get the best of both worlds – Lambeth Council and Lib Peck deserve great credit for their part in negotiating it.\n\n\"As this project progresses, I'll be keeping a close eye on it to ensure that London's tax and fare payers aren't burdened and that all funds over £10 million are returned as agreed.\n\n\"We need to keep the Garden Bridge on track without costs rising – when I'm Mayor, there will be no question of a penny more than £10 million of TfL funds being spent on it.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat London Assembly member Caroline Pidgeon said: \"While I welcome a reduction in Transport for London's payment towards the Garden Bridge, today's announcement simply raises more questions than it answers, especially in light of the continued evasiveness by the Mayor of London and TfL in answering mayoral questions, or responding to freedom of information requests.\"\n\nShe added: \"In addition to these basic questions there are also key issues as to whether the proposed Garden Bridge is in the right location. Is the loss of land on the South Bank and the loss of views of St Paul's Cathedral really justified.\n\n\"Most importantly the Mayor and TfL still need to come clean as to how key contracts have already been awarded. Only last week TfL's director of audit finally conceded that the Garden Bridge procurement was 'neither open nor objective'. These are serious issues which are far from being resolved.\n\n\"Today's announcement should not for one moment cloud the very dubious practices that have been adopted so far in awarding contracts and allocating significant amounts of public money.\"",

As he ran away, Turdi stabbed four more people before he was shot dead by police, it said.\n\nTwo of the four people died at the scene and the two others died in a hospital, police said in a statement.\n\nThe killings came two weeks after 29 people were killed and 140 others wounded in a knife attack blamed on ethnic Muslim Uighur separatists at the Kunming train station, initially raising concerns that the latest violence was politically motivated. Unlike the Kunming attack, Friday's violence appeared to stem from a personal dispute.\n\nThe identity of the food stall owners was not immediately clear. A witness who gave only his surname, Chen, said the stand operators were Uighurs selling flatbread. Online news reports posted early Friday that said they were Uighurs were later removed.\n\nBut the violence in Changsha had people on edge even in Chengdu, a city 750 miles west of it, where dozens of shoppers at a busy mall fled in a panic because of false rumors of a knifing spree that were circulating online, Chengdu police said.\n\n\"Because of the incident that happened in Changsha, people started to panic and ran.

  "latent_27554": "Preview | Recap\n\nKings-Mavericks Preview\n\nBy NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO\n\nPosted Jan 05 2016 2:46AM\n\nStill seeking their first victory of 2016, a visit from the Sacramento Kings historically has got the Dallas Mavericks in the win column.\n\nRajon Rondo will have a say in the matter this time.\n\nThe Mavericks try to extend their home win streak over the Kings to 22 games Tuesday night, but Rondo is looking to make his return to Dallas more memorable than his stint last season.\n\nDallas (19-15) pushed its winning streak to four by shooting 51.2 percent from the floor - 14 of 27 from beyond the arc - in Wednesday's 114-91 win over a Golden State team playing without Stephen Curry.\n\nThe Mavericks, however, followed with a 106-82 loss at Miami on New Year's Day before falling 105-98 to New Orleans a night later. They shot 39.8 percent in those two, missing 39 of 56 attempts from long range.\n\n\"I don't know,\" guard Wesley Matthews said when asked about the team's struggle for consistency. \"This is annoying, though. We didn't play well in Miami, and we didn't play well in too many stretches (Saturday).\"\n\nDallas last dropped three games in a row Nov. 22-25.\n\nThe Mavs, however, have won 21 straight home games over Sacramento dating to February 2003 for the franchise's longest home winning streak over a single opponent. It's the second-longest active home winning streak by one team against another, trailing only San Antonio's 32-game run against Golden State.\n\nDallas, though, lost 112-98 at Sacramento on Nov. 30 after taking 21 of the previous 23 overall matchups.\n\nRondo had 21 points, his first against the Mavericks after leaving them via free agency over the summer. The guard was acquired by Dallas in a trade with Boston and had a tumultuous 46-game stint that included clashes with coach Rick Carlisle. The four-time All-Star averaged 9.3 points and 6.5 assists.\n\nRondo's production has returned with the Kings (14-20), leading the NBA with 11.6 assists per game while adding 12.0 points. He came one rebound shy of a triple-double Monday, dishing out 19 assists and scoring 13 points in a 116-104 win at Oklahoma City.\n\n\"He's played extremely well. It's no surprise. He's a prideful guy,\" Carlisle said.\n\nDeMarcus Cousins had 33 points and a season-high 19 rebounds while Sacramento capitalized on Kevin Durant's absence due to a sprained toe. That was one point better than Cousins' total in a 142-119 romp of Phoenix two days earlier.\n\nCousins has been a problem for the Mavs, averaging 28.7 points and 12.0 rebounds over the last three meetings - all at home - after scoring 31 on Nov. 30. Things haven't gone as well at Dallas, where he's averaging 18.3 points in seven visits.\n\nDirk Nowitzki went 5 for 15 from the field while finishing with 13 points Nov. 30, but he's averaging 25.3 points on 56.1 percent shooting over the last three home games against the Kings.\n\nThe forward had 24 points Saturday after averaging 12.0 and making 29.5 percent from the field - 3 of 13 from behind the arc - over the previous three games.\n\nDeron Williams' status is unknown after a left hamstring injury forced him to sit out the fourth quarter Saturday. He had 11 points in his second game off the bench after the same injury forced him to miss the previous four.\n\n\"He's doing better,\" Carlisle said. \"We won't know until tomorrow whether we're going to play him or consider playing him. He's making progress.\"\n\nCopyright 2016 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

  "latent_27648": "Have you seen the internet meme which suggests that Donald Trump’s ‘divisive’ rhetoric helps Isis gather support and grow in size? It’s been getting a lot of likes and shares, possibly because it contains an element of truth. Certainly Isis seems to buy into the idea, which is why they featured The Donald in their triumphant post-Brussels video. Trump and Isis feed each other. They both thrive on and exacerbate a sense of western decline.\n\nBut the politician who has done most to help Isis grow is not Donald Trump. It may well be Hillary Clinton.\n\nAt almost every stage of her career, Hillary has managed somehow to nurture and sustain the conditions for Isis to grow in. Just look at her foreign policy record. It’s widely known that Clinton supported the Iraq War and the deposition of Saddam Hussein. Then, as Secretary of State, she supported Nouri al-Maliki’s position in Iraq. As Ali Khedery wrote in the Washington Post, this support helped nurture ‘a divisive, despotic and sectarian government that would rip the country apart and devastate American interests.’\n\nThen came Syria’s civil war, during which Clinton began to show her dovish side, even while Assad was butchering his own people, which Isis were able to capitalise on. Next, Libya. Clinton is still a strong defender of the Libyan invasion to oust Muammar Gaddafi from power. But there is no doubt that the situation right now in Libya is catastrophic; that what had been seen as a foreign policy triumph for Clinton is turning into a massive disaster. Her embarrassing incompetence during the Benghazi attack did nothing to bolster American credibility in the Middle East. Libya is now a free-for-all for numerous militias and a safe haven for Isis.\n\nIt’s difficult to assess Donald Trump’s political legacy so far, because he has never been an elected official. But we can assess Hillary Clinton’s. Look beyond her goody-goody rhetoric, and ask whether she did more than Trump or indeed anyone to create the ideal conditions for an organisation like Isis to flourish in. There’s no doubt about it — she did.",

  "latent_27666": "How will the left wing fight Rob Ford? That was the question on everyone’s mind leading up to Thursday’s crucial council meeting. “We’re hearing they may try to draw this out until Christmas Eve,” deputy mayor Doug Holyday said Monday.\n\nCouncillor and former budget chief Shelley Carroll speaks about the vehicle registration tax during the first working session of the new council Thursday. ( RENE JOHNSTON / TORONTO STAR )\n\nBut the filibuster rumours turned out to be just that. The first working council meeting wrapped up in just one day, with Ford declaring victory on his three major initiatives — killing the vehicle registration tax, reducing office budgets and asking the province to declare the TTC an essential service — and the left mounting barely a fight, even on issues they had championed under the previous administration. The tax repeal passed 39-6. Even some of the progressives who voted in favour of the fee in 2007 — such as Carroll, Glenn De Baeremaeker and Paula Fletcher — voted with Ford on Thursday.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nThe most telling moment came during the vehicle registration tax debate, when former budget chief Shelley Carroll, whom many view as a leader of the opposition, said they had made mistakes in how they presented the tax to voters, and she would be supporting the mayor. “We’re picking our battles,” one councillor said afterward. “There are fights worth having and this was not that fight. When it comes time to talk about Transit City or service cuts, then you’ll see.” Exactly what that strategy will be is still unclear. Just days after the election, left-leaning members of council began mapping out opposition tactics. There was, and apparently still is, dissent within the group. Some had wanted to come out swinging.\n\nProgressive councillors had held influential positions on all of the city’s boards and committees under David Miller. They had spent two terms learning how to work the system. Drowning Ford in paper could successfully delay key votes until after the budget. By budget time, it will be apparent whether Ford plans to cut city services to pay for a property tax freeze, which he has promised, and the vehicle tax repeal council agreed to on Thursday.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nBut other left-wingers argued that “screaming and carrying on” wouldn’t gain any sympathy with the public, who had elected Ford in record numbers. A better tactic would be to sit back and wait until his honeymoon with the voters is over. Based on Thursday’s actions, it appears there is still disagreement. Some of the more far-left councillors, such as Janet Davis, Gord Perks and Paula Fletcher — who wore a pink jacket recalling Don Cherry’s “pinko” comments at the inaugural — seemed to put up more of a fight by taking full advantage of their allotted speaking and question time, as well as moving or supporting motions to delay debate until January. Others, including far-left rookies Mary Fragedakis and Mike Layton, laid low. “We’re just going to try to sway people with facts. To me, this is not dollars and cents. It’s smoke and mirrors,” said Councillor Pam McConnell. “Where is the money coming from? You can’t do what (Ford) is doing without cuts. And that’s what I’m focusing on. I’m going to be vigilant about service cuts.” It’s doubtful the left will form an official opposition similar to what the right-wingers did with the Responsible Government Group in 2009 to oppose David Miller. During the campaign, the Miller loyalists warned they would form a rogue government with a de facto mayor so as to keep the city moving. The belief was that Ford would not have enough support on council to push through his agenda. That was then. Today the political landscape looks much different. Ford has built a strong team of right-wingers who are relishing their new power. The mushy middle, largely made up of rookie councillors, is open to the mayor’s proposals. And with voters replacing Sandra Bussin and Adrian Heaps with more right-leaning councillors, there are fewer progressives in the mix. Between Ford’s momentum and the ideological make-up of council, the left didn’t have much hope, said Councillor Adam Vaughan, one of the few who voted against repealing the personal vehicle tax and putting $60 or more back in the pockets of those who can afford cars. “There is a gravy train and it’s still running through the city,” he said. “It’s just running in a different direction and through different neighbourhoods.” Ford, like Miller on the issue of the bridge to the island airport, moved quickly on items that were important to him. “And he wanted to do it at a time when the positions he just gave out were still fresh in everyone’s mind. That’s the power of the mayor’s office,” said Vaughan. “We were not going to get Doug Holyday to stick to his principles on TTC as an essential service when voting with Ford means he gets to sit at the inner circle.” Holyday said that’s how politics works. Those who drew the plum positions agreed to be on Ford’s team and support his agenda. “And that’s what we did yesterday, and I don’t think that’s surprising. It happened with David Miller and Mel Lastman. You’re either on the team or you’re not,” he said. And those on his side of the aisle aren’t too worried about the left. “I think probably with the left right now there seems to be some jockeying about who is the boss. There isn’t an apparent leader,” Holyday said. I think there may be some divisions. Some of them deserted Joe Pantalone by endorsing George Smitherman, and some of the true believers may not like that.”",
  "latent_27696": "The champagne was flowing as hedge fund executive Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah hosted a reception during the Cannes Film Festival last May to promote “Clinton Cash,” a film by their political adviser Stephen K. Bannon and the production company they co-founded, Glittering Steel.\n\nThe Mercers, Republican mega-donors who had spent millions on the failed presidential bid of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, and Bannon, then executive chairman of Breitbart News Network, were still weeks from formally aligning with Donald Trump’s campaign. But the festivities that balmy evening aboard the Sea Owl, the Mercers’ luxurious yacht, marked the growing influence of their financial and political partnership in shaping the 2016 campaign — and in encouraging the populist surge now reverberating around the world.\n\nThe Mercers’ approach is far different from that of other big donors. While better-known players such as the Koch brothers on the right and George Soros on the left focus on mobilizing activists and voters, the Mercers have exerted pressure on the political system by helping erect an alternative media ecosystem, whose storylines dominated the 2016 race.\n\nTheir alliance with Bannon provided fuel for the narrative that drove Trump’s victory: that dangerous immigrants are ruining the country and corrupt power brokers are sabotaging Washington.\n\n(Bastien Inzaurralde,Dani Player/The Washington Post)\n\nThe wealthy New York family and the former investment banker-turned-media executive collaborated on at least five ventures between 2011 and 2016, according to a Washington Post review of public filings and multiple people familiar with their relationship. The extent of their partnership has not previously been reported.\n\nThrough those projects, the Mercers and Bannon, now chief White House strategist, quietly built a power base aimed at sowing distrust of big government and eroding the dominance of the major news media.\n\nThe Mercers provided the money, while Bannon, working in tandem with Rebekah, acted as business partner and political guide. The family’s overarching strategy, according to people familiar with their giving, is to test various tactics to see which is most effective.\n\n“The Mercers have a Silicon Valley approach to politics: Let a thousand entities bloom, and let’s see what works,” said one associate, who, like others close to the Mercers, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private family.\n\nThe Mercers poured money into Breitbart News, the media outlet they now partly own that under Bannon’s leadership gave voice to the nationalistic fervor Trump embraced. The family helped finance an investigative think tank that Bannon co-founded, the Government Accountability Institute, whose president wrote “Clinton Cash.” Glittering Steel, the Mercer film production company, then brought the book’s findings to the screen, portraying Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to a mass audience as a captive of wealthy interests.\n\nThe alliance continued with Cambridge Analytica, a data science company that did work for the Trump campaign, with the Mercers as investors and Bannon on the board. And they joined forces on a nonprofit watchdog group that is putting the spotlight on how public money is spent in the Mercers’ home state of New York.\n\nWhile other donors gave more to support Trump’s presidential bid last year, the Mercers are now arguably the most influential financiers of the Trump era. Bannon, who went on to manage the final months of Trump’s campaign before joining the White House, is the senior architect of the president’s policy vision. He is joined in the West Wing by counselor Kellyanne Conway, a friend of Rebekah Mercer who led the family-funded super PAC that backed first Cruz and then Trump in the 2016 race.\n\nPeople who know them say the Mercers, who soured on traditional political operatives, appreciated Bannon’s business savvy and share his belief that the conversation around politics must be changed for their ideas to prevail. For all of their power and privilege, both the family and their longtime adviser see themselves as outsiders, fighting the grip of elite institutions.\n\nDriving the Mercers is a belief “that there is too cozy a relationship between the established media and the political class, and that there needs to be more accountability,” said Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute and author of “Clinton Cash.” “They loathe the fact that Washington has become a very wealthy town because of government power, at the expense of the American people.”\n\nThe Mercers declined to comment. Bannon declined to comment through a White House spokeswoman.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump gives a thumbs-up to reporters upon arriving for a party at the home of Robert Mercer, one of his largest campaign donors, in Head of the Harbor, N.Y., in December.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nTrump himself paid homage to the family in December, weeks before moving into the White House, when he attended the Mercers’ elaborate annual costume party at their Long Island mansion. In a nod to the “Villains and Heroes” theme, Rebekah Mercer dressed like the Black Widow and her father as Mandrake the Magician, a comic-book superhero known for hypnotizing his targets.\n\nTrump — who did not wear a costume — told the crowd that when the famously taciturn Robert Mercer urged him to hire Bannon and Conway last August, he knew he should listen because Mercer so rarely speaks, according to people in attendance.\n\nPolitical donations by Mercer family, 2008 2016 New York hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, his wife Diana and their middle daughter Rebekah contributed $41.3 million since 2008 to support the GOP and more than 100 federal candidates.

In the 2006 midterms, the family contributed only $37,800 to federal candidates and political committees — including $4,200 that Robert Mercer’s wife, Diana, gave to Clinton’s Senate reelection campaign, federal records show. The family’s foundation was similarly low key, giving away $292,000 in 2007, with nearly half going to a nonprofit math foundation started by one of Robert Mercer’s hedge fund colleagues, tax documents show. But, after the election of Barack Obama, the family started to increase its political giving, tapping into newfound wealth.\n\nIn 2010, Robert Mercer was elevated to co-chief executive of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, whose closely held quantitative formulas have generated staggering returns. The following year, he began drawing annual earnings of $100 million and up, according to Institutional Investor’s Alpha list.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision in 2010 paved the way for new forms of unlimited political spending — an opening seized upon by mega-donors on the right opposed to the Obama administration.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2016, they pumped at least $77 million in political donations and gifts from their family foundation into a vast universe of causes across the conservative landscape, according to campaign finance reports and tax filings. Their foundation financed groups focused on international affairs, religious freedom, state policies, judicial issues and free enterprise. They poured millions into the Koch network and super PACs that promoted Republican candidates across the country.\n\nDonations to think tanks and policy groups by the Mercer Family Foundation, 2008-2014 Out of the nearly $58 million that the Mercer Family Foundation gave away during this period, $36 million flowed to more than two dozen think tanks, policy groups and other nonprofits.

They believe in limited government and free markets, according to people who know them. They both have a staunch antipathy to the Clintons. Rebekah Mercer, who home-schools her four children, is strongly antiabortion, associates said.\n\nBut what sets the Mercers apart is their interest in finding new ways to shape the environment in which policy issues are debated, an impulse driven by their background in technology and finance.\n\n[How a reclusive computer programmer became a GOP money powerhouse]\n\nRobert Mercer is a renowned computer programmer who helped pioneer the field of machine translation. He made his fortune after leaving IBM for the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies in the early 1990s. He bought an estate with a harbor view on Long Island and a 203-foot yacht, which includes flourishes such as a four-deck-high tree carved from Peruvian mahogany and a rosewood self-playing Steinway baby grand piano.\n\nRebekah Mercer, 43, a former Wall Street trader, lives with her family in a sprawling triplex in a Trump-branded condominium on Manhattan’s Upper West Side and sits on the boards of the American Museum of Natural History and the Heritage Foundation. She and her two sisters also run an online gourmet cookie company.\n\nShe is the most political of Mercer’s three daughters, largely directing where the family puts its resources, and is known in conservative circles for her unyielding and skeptical questioning of candidates and established political operatives.\n\n“They are right-wing nerds,” said George Gilder, an economist and former Ronald Reagan adviser who met Robert Mercer when the hedge fund executive began attending speeches Gilder has given touting bitcoin and a return to the gold standard.\n\n“[Robert Mercer] believes in free markets, and he believes that technology is a positive force and that a lot of government is overregulating and suppressing economic creativity,” Gilder added.\n\nOne of the biggest beneficiaries of the Mercers’ donations over the past eight years has been the conservative watchdog Media Research Center, which collected $13.5 million from the Mercer Family Foundation between 2008 and 2014, tax records show.\n\nThe center’s projects include a website called CNSNews.com that publishes stories it says are ignored by the mainstream media — an early precursor to Breitbart News.\n\nL. Brent Bozell III, founder of the Media Research Center, did not return requests for comment. But in an interview with The Post last year, he called the family “visionaries” when it comes to recognizing new ways to communicate with the public.\n\n“What they are looking to do is build a movement, not just fund a movement,” Bozell said. “I don’t know where it is all leading, but I can tell you they are in it for the long haul.”\n\nMERCERS Glittering Steel This production company, established in 2015, made two Bannon movies and produced ads for the Mercer super PAC.

BANNON Matea GOld and Kevin Uhrmacher/The Washington Post\n\nThe Mercers’ partnership with Bannon began in 2011, thanks to an encounter that Robert and Rebekah had with Andrew Breitbart.\n\nDuring a spring meeting of Club for Growth donors at the Ritz-Carlton in Palm Beach, Fla., the Mercers sought out Breitbart after watching him deliver a talk about how to co-opt the political strategies used by liberals.\n\nThe conservative media entrepreneur, who liked to denounce the mainstream press as the Democrats’ “dominant partner in crime,” was arguing at the time that government policies could not be changed until conservatives seized control of the media narrative. The message resonated with the Mercers, according to a person familiar with their views.\n\nBreitbart introduced them to Bannon, then a screenwriter and producer in Southern California who was directing a movie called “Occupy Unmasked” that featured Breitbart. It was co-produced by the conservative advocacy group Citizens United, whose allied foundation would later receive Mercer funds.\n\nBannon, whose peripatetic career had taken him from Wall Street to Hollywood, was at the time increasing his political focus, directing and producing a slate of conservative documentaries.\n\nHe had grown close to Breitbart and was urging the writer to expand his website, which originally operated out of Breitbart’s basement. As part of that effort, the Mercers invested $10 million in the enterprise in the summer of 2011, according to a person familiar with the transaction. When Breitbart died of a heart attack the following March, Bannon became executive chairman of the news outlet. The Mercers’ co-ownership of Breitbart News, along with chief executive Larry Solov and Breitbart’s widow, Susannah, was confirmed by the company last month.\n\nThe site was an early champion of Trump and the anti-establishment, populist movement that buoyed his campaign. It has also fielded intense criticism for airing inflammatory stories about immigrants, refugees and radical Islamists. Bannon once touted it as a “platform” for the alt-right, a small, far-right movement that seeks a whites-only state and whose adherents have espoused racist, anti-Semitic and sexist points of view.\n\nBreitbart officials have disputed charges that their content promotes racism or Islamophobia. Solov did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFrom left, Rebekah Mercer, Robert Mercer and Diana Mercer attend the World Science Festival Gala at the Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York on April 7, 2014.

(Feadship)\n\nAccording to a person familiar with her views, Rebekah Mercer has taken pride in the fact that Breitbart’s stories have affected the political debate by filtering into the mainstream media — an impact that has been affirmed by some independent researchers.\n\n“They view Breitbart as a business and as a brand that gets a lot of traffic that is steering and shifting the way other outlets are covering these issues,” the person said.\n\nWhile he was running Breitbart News, Bannon was also serving as the family’s political adviser, assessing the impact of think tanks, policy groups and super PACS they were considering financing, according to multiple people familiar with his role.\n\nFor Bannon, the partnership with the Mercers proved profitable.\n\nIn 2013, he reported earning $750,000 a year as chairman of Breitbart News, according to a rental application previously reported by The Post. He also received about $100,000 in salary that year as part-time chairman of the Government Accountability Institute, according to filings with the Internal Revenue Service, first reported by The Post.\n\n[During his political rise, Stephen K. Bannon was a man with no fixed address]\n\nElecting candidates Mercer family donations to super PACs, candidates and political parties $15 million 10 5 0 ‘08 ‘10 ‘12 ‘14 ‘16 Affecting policy Donations to think tanks and policy groups $15 million 10 5 0 ‘08 ‘10 ‘12 ‘14 ‘16 Sources: Internal Revenue Service filings, Federal Election Commission filings\n\nA strategic turning point came in 2012. The Mercers put $3 million behind super PACs that backed GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, filings show, and when he lost, they became disenchanted with the Washington political class, according to multiple people familiar with their thinking.\n\nBannon urged them to take a different approach: Instead of helping consultants get rich, they should create their own network, according to associates.\n\nIn 2013, the Mercers became the principal investors in the data science firm Cambridge Analytica, which says it can target voters based on their personality types. It was spun out of a British company that advises governments around the world on how to conduct effective psychological operations.\n\nBannon served as vice president and secretary of Cambridge’s board, corporate filings in Delaware show, and was instrumental in pushing its expansion into the U.S. market, according to people familiar with his role.\n\n[After working for Trump’s campaign, British data firm eyes new U.S. government contracts]\n\nOther Mercer-Bannon projects had narrower aims. Together, Rebekah Mercer, her sister Jennifer and Bannon started a watchdog group in 2013 called Reclaim New York, which is using the state’s freedom-of-information law to try to disclose every local public expenditure.\n\nOne of the family’s most effective plays was helping finance the organizations that produced “Clinton Cash.”\n\nThe Mercer foundation gave $2 million between 2013 and 2014 to the Government Accountability Institute, the Tallahassee-based investigative think tank founded by Bannon and Schweizer.\n\nSchweizer began writing “Clinton Cash” in late 2013, using the institute’s research about Clinton Foundation donors, much of the material plumbed from obscure foreign websites. The book was release in 2015, just as the presidential race was heating up.\n\nThat same year, the Mercers set up a production company called Glittering Steel, which Bannon co-founded, according to people familiar with his role.\n\nAt the Cannes screening of the “Clinton Cash” documentary, which kicks off with the image of a blood-stained $100 bill, Bannon told reporters that he envisioned the target audience to be liberals who might grow disenchanted with Clinton.\n\n“I want as many progressives to see this as possible, because I think you have to understand how the Clintons, who proclaim that they support all your values, essentially have sold you out for money,” Bannon told Reuters.\n\nThe 2016 race offered an opportunity for the Mercers to deploy the network of groups they built with Bannon.\n\nBreitbart News, whose coverage echoed Trump’s dark warnings about illegal immigrants and radical Islam, helped shape the campaign climate. A new study by a team of Harvard and MIT researchers, funded by a Soros-backed foundation, found that Breitbart drove coverage of the election in the conservative media and influenced mainstream news organizations.\n\nGlittering Steel produced videos for the Mercer-funded super PAC Make America Number 1, which paid the production company about $700,000, according to campaign finance filings.\n\nThe super PAC directed another $5.5 million to Cambridge Analytica for consulting, data and ads. Cambridge was also paid at least $6 million for the work it did helping the Trump campaign identify and target voters, finance filings show. Since the election, its parent company, SCL Group, has stepped up its pursuit of U.S. government contracts.\n\nBannon’s ascension last August as Trump’s chief adviser forced him to walk away from the Mercer operation. He stepped down from the Government Accountability Institute last summer when he joined the campaign and formally resigned his post at Breitbart after the election, according to information Solov gave a panel of congressional journalists last month.\n\nIn his absence, the Mercers are forging ahead. Rebekah Mercer is spearheading a new group called Making America Great to support Trump’s agenda, according to people familiar with the plans and corporate documents filed in Virginia. It remains unclear what relationship that group will have with an entity called America First Policies that has already been launched by other former Trump advisers.\n\nThe Mercers are looking to produce more film projects through Glittering Steel, as well as graphic novels. The graphic novel based on “Clinton Cash” was a New York Times bestseller.\n\nAnd down in Tallahassee, one of their major causes, the Government Accountability Institute, is pressing forward with investigative projects.\n\nOverseeing the effort as the group’s new chairwoman and Bannon’s successor: Rebekah Mercer.\n\nAlice Crites and Ann Hornaday contributed to this report.",

I’m an animal rights lawyer in Washington. I hate my job, I love my job, you get the picture. I’m happily married to Dan, a government employee, and we have a three-year-old daughter, Kara. He’s just left to drop her off at school.\n\nThe roar of hot air obscures every other radio word. When my mother speaks—“We demand legal recognition for all living creatures”—I drop my hair dryer. It clatters on the tile floor. I turn up the radio and listen, stunned.\n\nMy mother died twenty-five years ago.\n\nYet I hear my mother’s beloved voice: “. . . and humans practice deliberate cross-speciation, mingling plant and animal DNA for commercial gain. We therefore demand the right to accept or reject technological changes to our fundamental being.”\n\nFirst come swift, crazy suppositions: she’s not really dead; this is a recording. Then it hits me, quite literally, in a flash, like slap upside the head. It’s Meitner, and she is an African Grey Parrot.\n\n“From space, I see the Earth below me. I see the broad outlines of rain forests, where my kin flock; oceans where others of us school, and plains where herds run headlong . . .”\n\nBut it is like hearing the dead speak, and I am correspondingly chilled. When Mom died, Meitner vanished into the cloudy reaches of Kauai’s rain forest mountains, blended with her flock. I was just a little girl, as lonely as Meitner must have been, even though my father was close at hand. He was suffering too—withdrawn, grumpy. Unavailable, as they say.\n\nMeitner could have consoled me. She did not.\n\nThe anger I’d had as a child resurfaces. I visualize smashing the mirror with the hair dryer, for an instant. The intensity of the impulse surprises me.\n\nI feel betrayed. It had been easier to think that Meitner had died, though that too was as painful as any animal’s loss, the mystery of a vanishing. Funny to expect so much of a parrot, but Meitner is more than a parrot, and less than a parrot.\n\nI sink to the cold tile floor, cross my legs, bow my head, and drink in my mother’s rich, low voice for a few more seconds before a male announcer interrupts the flowing words.\n\n“Meitner, the African Grey Parrot you have just heard speaking, was a celebrity at one time. She disappeared after the death of her trainer, Dr. Jean Woodward, twenty-five years ago. As we piece together her story, we find that it is long and complicated. Presently, she is part of an experiment.\n\n“Meitner is in a specially modified space suit, on a scientific mission in what has been dubbed the Stinger Ship. It looks like a massive jellyfish, complete with tentacles. But instead of stinging, these are life-support tentacles that allow people, and now, apparently, parrots, to float free in space. For those of you who have not been keeping up, this ship, which has been decades in the building, is scheduled to leave Earth’s orbit soon.\n\n“We have gotten word that an entire flock of parrots will be dropped from the ship in specially made suits that allow parrots to operate jet packs, radios, and computers. All the parrots are enhanced in various ways, and their brain activities are being measured in real time. In fact, according to their spokesperson, the data being gathered is related to the mathematical abilities from which flocking behavior emerges. This information may lead to many breakthroughs, including—and it does sound far-fetched—space-time travel.”\n\nMeitner’s words recede, and I recall my mother’s real voice telling bedtime stories, all of them merged in my memory into a single narrative of cloudy jungle, infused with the thrill of finding her African Grey Parrot and of the knowledge she hoped her studies might lead to. When I was a little girl, I imagined I had been with her on that trip. Like Meitner, I became part of her, so much so that her story is like a well-worn stone with strata exposed by the rush, the power, of time.\n\nMom was a postdoc when she tracked down Meitner.\n\nShe knew that animal activists had liberated Meitner and other animals from a Cairo lab, run by someone known internationally as Dr. Moreau. WikiLeaks had published some of Moreau’s research, in which it seemed clear that chimps, Grey Parrots, and porpoises injected with experimental neuroplasticity drugs were in captivity.\n\nIt was also clear that human DNA was part of their makeup.\n\nThe activists ran their standard operation, which, as usual, was in the news after the fact. They turned off the electricity, posted fake surveillance videos showing everything as normal, herded all the humans into a bus, evacuated every animal to an appropriate environment, and incinerated all records. A few bits left behind on the Internet are all anyone ever knew about the experiments. It was discovered that the lab had been established by a wealthy man, who died five years before the dramatic rescue. The original project was framed as an exploration of the possibilities and limits of rapid transpeciism with an eye to expanding human capabilities and lifespan. After the founder died, the project segued into a drug-development mill. Elephant poachers, charged with procuring a calf, tipped off authorities anonymously when they felt underpaid. No one knew what had happened to the animals, but once my mother heard about the parrot, she began sleuthing, getting closer to the secret heart of the activist organization, until she made the connection that changed our lives.\n\n“After a year of feints and parries,” my mother would begin, at that magical hour on our Kauai ridgetop when I was tucked into bed and the smell of wild ginger filled the room, “I was in a small plane that landed with a big bounce on a short runway that looked like a river from the air because of the rain. When I climbed down from the plane, the wind whipped up my poncho and I was soaked in the first minute.”\n\nMeitner was always in the bedroom, perched behind my mother on the old rocking chair from the Big Island that Tutu, my grandmother, gave us, eyes closed, listening and waiting, soothed as if on a bough moved by wind.\n\nMom’s calm, measured words and soothing voice were always tinged with humor, as if she might laugh at any moment at her younger self, so intrepid and, perhaps, lacking good judgment. “I could hardly see because of the rain, but a short, dark woman yelled ‘Bienvenu!’ out the window of a beat-up Land Rover almost hidden by the brush, under a huge baobab tree. When I got to the car, she flung open the passenger door and said, ‘Hurry inside, hurry inside!’ She had a round face and a big smile. She said, ‘Call me Belinda.’ It wasn’t her real name; that was part of the plan. I thrust my pack inside and slid into the seat. She shifted into first gear and rocketed down a mud-dirt road. I had no idea how she could see. The wipers didn’t work at all. I held onto the sissy bar for dear life.”\n\nSometimes Meitner sidled back and forth on the top of the chair, head bobbing, barely able to contain her excitement at this, her own story. Sometimes she just listened, as if contemplating.\n\n“Belinda said, ‘How was your trip?’ She looked at me for a long time, a huge grin lighting her face. I wanted to scream, ‘Keep your eyes on the road!’ but I didn’t want to distract her. I settled for ‘Interesting.’\n\n“It was a horrible, rough, eight-hour-long ride. I started out feeling like an intrepid explorer, but pretty soon I realized that I was pretty low on the Martha Gellhorn scale—she’s a writer, honey. We drove over huge cloudy mountains. Like here. We got stuck behind big trucks and Belinda would get out and yell at them. We finally got to a place way back of nowhere, a house with a stone floor and big heavy beams, mostly open. Belinda took me to a tiny bedroom with high, open louvered windows and a bed covered with mosquito netting. The room was full of a beautiful smell that I wanted to inhale forever. I asked Belinda, ‘What’s that smell?’”\n\nAt that point I’d always say, “Wild ginger! Just like here.”\n\n“Right,” Mom would say. “I fell onto that lovely bed, just for a minute, and didn’t wake until the next morning. The howler monkeys screamed all night, though.”\n\n“Just like here,” Meitner and I would say, then laugh.\n\nMy mother said that she chatted with Belinda for two days, but she knew that Belinda was really giving her the final test. Mom’s background, her experience, her plans, were just what the activists wanted. She was perfect.\n\nFinally, she met Meitner. This was the place in the story where Meitner always got excited. She’d flutter from the chair to the bed and back again, muttering in low, rapid French.\n\n“Belinda said that I might want to take a walk down to the river. The man who brought Meitner was tall and thin. He had blue-ebony skin. He was nervous and left quickly.\n\n“I picked up the big plastic parrot carrier that he left on the bank under the banana trees. What did you say, Meitner?”\n\nMeitner raised her head, whistled, and imitated the sound of a car engine and some phone tones. Then she said, in a really cranky man’s voice, “Où allons nous?”\n\nMy cue to translate: “Where are we going?”\n\nMy mother responded, “Right! And what did I say?”\n\nMeitner would say, “‘Maison.’ Home.”\n\nAnd home—my future home—was where she would soon meet John Kalani, my father.\n\nJohn Kalani\n\nI am on a Kauai ridgetop, monitoring the feed from the Stinger ship, when I hear Jean’s voice, but after an instant’s shock, I realize that it is Meitner. Our former family member, up on that ship, with some kind of plan.\n\nAwe, puzzlement, delight, dark loss, and emotions beyond the reach of the most nuanced languages stop my mind. A blast of cool wind brings a spatter of rain and then, for an instant, parts the clouds so that I see the steep range of cliffs, one behind the other, vanishing from deep green to blue, lavender, gray. Jean’s voice. A brilliant parrot. A murder. All long ago, and yet as close, in my mind, as yesterday.\n\nThe day I met Dr. Jean Woodward, she stepped from a rented Jeep into my backyard as I watched from my lanai. Her red hair glinted in the sun as she retrieved a cage containing her African Grey Parrot, Meitner, from the back of the Jeep.\n\nI’m a Hilo boy who went to Silicon Valley by way of Cal Tech and got big, as they say. I made a lot of money on software and bought a chunk of rain forest on the island of Kauai.\n\nAn acquaintance from Cal Tech sent me Dr. Woodward’s proposal. She was searching for a habitat for an extraordinary parrot she had acquired. As it happened, there was a flock of African Greys in my backyard—a range of the steepest, rainiest mountains on the earth. Years ago, someone brought a flock of Greys to Kauai, illegally, as is the case with most of the fauna and flora in the Hawaiian Islands. So we have quite a population of non-indigenous creatures here—monkeys, aforesaid African Grey Parrots, other kinds of parrots, macaws—you name it, someone smuggled one in and let it go.\n\nI’d read about the liberation of the lab animals a while back. All of the animals had vanished, but Dr. Woodward tracked down the parrot.\n\n“Since all records were destroyed, I’m not sure how old she was when I got her,” Jean had told me over the phone a week earlier. “Or, when she got me.” That was the first time I heard Jean’s low, burbling chuckle. “I could almost hear her thinking how lucky she was to get such a pliable custodian. I know that she was at least three, because that’s when the iris turns from pale gray to yellow. Her language skills are amazing for a gray parrot of any age.” Her voice became fervent. “I want to help her discover who—or what—she is. I want all of her abilities to—unfold, just as they do in any living creature. I think she might be a bridge between us and other animals—or, at least, between us and parrots. Parrots and humans share speech-related genes and genetically expressed neural pathways. She needs a strong human presence in order to manifest her humanity. But she also needs the environment of a parrot in the wild. No one knows what might happen in Meitner’s instance. I want to be there when she needs human interaction and let her have distance when she needs to be a bird. Her wings have always been clipped, but I think that the development of innate parrot-intelligences are just as linked to the use of wings as the development of human intelligence is linked to use of the hands. It seems plausible that learning flocking behavior in flight is analogous to humans learning to navigate and explore their world, I . . .”\n\nBut she had me the second she said “flocking behavior.” That’s what I do—work on mathematical models of flocking behavior, synchronous movement that displays rules of spacing, momentum, direction, and individual choice that we observe in the movement of groups of birds, fish, insects, herds, and even, some claim, humans in social environments, both physical and in thought and opinion. That’s how I made my fortune. So, when I look back, it all seems inevitable.\n\nNow I know that Jean dreamed of illuminating the nature of consciousness through a series of carefully articulated projects that she was busily mapping out when she acquired Meitner.\n\nThat first morning, I waved, shouted “Aloha!” and hurried through my wild yard to shake Jean’s hand. When I picked up the bird carrier I was startled to hear a man’s voice, cursing in French. I set the cage on the lanai; it was too unwieldy to carry on the hike to see Meitner’s possible new digs. As Jean and I passed through my orchid-laced yard and reached the trailhead, the curses blessedly receded.\n\nJean wanted to build a communication bridge between humans and other species. This intrigued me. I worked on making computers seem like humans, so that they might, perhaps, be a home for human minds at some point. She wanted to go in the opposite direction. She had a vision of all living creatures being increasingly connected through biology. She wanted all creatures to be able to selectively incorporate the biological richnesses of other species.\n\nThe many vectors and implications of flocking behavior were our Venn diagram overlap.\n\nHer thesis was that birds, who navigate rapidly in three dimensions, have mathematical abilities that exceed those of humans. Flocking—or schooling, or swarming—adds another layer of complexity. Therefore, to develop optimally, Meitner needed to learn to flock.\n\nThe social aspects of flocking seem as important as the spatial aspects. Parrots and other social animals converse with intent. As the feral Wild Boy of Aveyron revealed so long ago, in a situation it would be unethical to repeat, sociality delayed is sociality denied. Jean’s desperation about time-related developmental doors closing came through in the proposal.\n\nAs far as I could tell, the woman lived on a shoestring—hand to mouth, grant to grant. But she seemed happy, despite her unemphasized but obvious lack of funds. I had money coming out of my ears. The idea of helping her out in this good cause gave me kind of a do-gooder feeling. I often thought I should do something good. Maybe, I thought, this is it.\n\nThe minute she stepped onto the narrow trail, where lush tropical forest pressed in on both sides and gusts of wind brought spatters of rain that soaked us, she began to talk. “We live parallel lives with animals. We co-evolved, and yet we’re so insular. We’re impacting their habitats, killing them, and we have so much to learn from them. If people only understood what it means—”\n\n“What what means?”\n\nAnd so it began, with her following closely behind and me hanging on her every word, tossing back interruptions like small stones—or bread crumbs. I found that instead of rising to the bait when I needled her every three minutes—a bad habit that upset most people—she always responded with patience. I liked that. Soon I realized that for her these were opportunities; teachable moments. I’m smart, sure, but socially and emotionally I’m in the stone age. Knowing that never changed my behavior, and it may be the reason I spend most of my time with computers. Or maybe it’s the other way around.\n\nJean said, “Every species has niche-evolved skills, ways of interpreting the environment. Our senses and our skills evolved for survival. The species that have survived are descended from the wariest, so we don’t intermingle. We can’t. We might kill or be killed. But we’re just learning what human consciousness is, and that it isn’t the only form of consciousness. We have so much to learn from each other! For instance, I think that mathematics could be enriched by a native model of flocking behavior.”\n\n“We actually do flock,” I offered. “We flock with our minds. In opinions, ideas, art, science. We test, we keep our distance, we draw together, we change our theories en masse, engage in political movements, have revolutions.”\n\n“Hmmm,” she allowed. “Yeah. Language is like that—emergent. Emergence is cooperation of things of unlike kinds. Lewes said that in 1870s. I think.”\n\nIf there’s anything I know a lot about, it’s emergence. G. H. Lewes, a philosopher, had coined the term and defined it, as this increasingly remarkable woman had just pointed out. Emergence is self-organized and unpredictable. It tickles and delights the human mind (while it may dismay politicians or those who make financial predictions) because of its propensity to spring from events, properties, social currents, whatever, that would seem unconnected, almost as if their sheer unlikeness has drawn them together and created new energy.\n\n“A lot of things were shakin’ back in the nineteenth century, that’s for sure, I said.” I’d heard the term “emergent” applied to language, and perhaps her surprising perspicacity jolted this sardonic, dismissive response out of me—suddenly, she was on my turf.\n\n“Well, blow it off if you want.” Her voice was low, strong, and sure, and in it I heard a shrug.\n\n“I’m trying to have a conversation. With you it’s—well, having a conversation with you seems to be an exercise in emergence. According to your definition—‘things of unlike kinds.’ Or Lewes’ definition.”\n\nShe laughed, then the sound of her footsteps paused for a second. “Oh! What’s that smell?”\n\n“Awapuhi kuahiwi. Ginger. So . . . what do you think you’ll learn? You’ve said that you think Meitner is unique.”\n\n“I think every brain is unique, but mostly in small ways. She may be unique in large ways. And I don’t know what I’ll learn. That’s the point. I guess I’m just curious.”\n\nEntranced would have been a better word. As was I—not with Meitner, but with Jean.\n\nAnd that name! Lise Meitner was the physicist who confirmed that nuclear fission was possible. In the late forties, she was called “The Mother of the Atomic Bomb,” a title she hated. Deeply pacifist, she had turned down an invitation to work on the Manhattan project, and had earlier risked her career during World War I when she turned down the opportunity to work with her mentor, Otto Hahn, on developing ever more potent poison gas. Instead, to fill out her mandatory war-effort dance card, she went to the German front and used the new technology of X-rays to diagnose the shattered bones of German troops.\n\nWhen I joked about laying such a heavy mantle on a mere bird, as we huffed up the steep, slippery ridge and rain forest gave way to views of the canyon and the blue Pacific, Jean bridled. I’d say that’s when I first began to fall in love with her, but that’s not true—that began to happen when I read her visionary proposal, though I didn’t realize it. I could tell, then, that she played a long game. Her vision of the possible shone like an isolated, sharp, brilliant ellipse of sun far out on an otherwise stormy sea, and I admired that. I prefer the long game as well. What I’m doing might not ever bear fruit, but it’s a worthy and fascinating goal. Or obsession.\n\nThe trail to the hale—the semi-traditional Hawaiian house I’d offered for her use for her study—steepened on the knife-edge of a ridge. Wild goat country. I yelled over my shoulder, “Her name—like Einstein, the parrot? The parrot is funny—why not, um, Lucille Ball? Or Julie Andrews. The parrot can sing, right?”\n\nI heard Jean’s slogging footsteps stop, and I turned to look down at her. Her face red (she was slightly overweight, sunburnt, and not in very good shape), she was sitting on a rock, apparently unfazed by the sheer drop behind her. She unhooked her water bottle from her belt and took a long gulp. Her chin-length red hair stuck to her cheeks.\n\nI got the feeling she’d heard that jibe before, and thought, I’m in for it now. It was a careless remark. I’d taken Dr. Woodward seriously enough to offer her some support for her endeavor, so I’m sure the tone was unexpected.\n\nShe stared out a tiny triangular patch of Pacific Ocean, far below at the end of a widening valley. Finally she said, “Lise Meitner’s extraordinary gifts were invisible to the society she lived in—Vienna in 1900. It was illegal—illegal!—for girls to attend school after eighth grade.” Despite a gust of cool wind, her face flushed deep pink. “She had to get a tutor—”\n\n“I know,” I told her, a bit nettled. I’d just read Meitner’s most recent biography. “She got her doctorate in physics, went to Berlin, pretty quickly became part of the in-crowd in theoretical physics. Bohr, Einstein, all those guys.”\n\n“Right. All those guys.” But she smiled. “Anyway, sure, I guess it’s pretentious, but it fits. We have no idea what she’s capable of. We have no idea what any animal really thinks, or any other human, for that matter. Parrot Meitner has had some kind of—well, let’s be positive, and call it enhancement, although it might just be damage. I don’t know if you read the whole proposal and background.”\n\nI had. “I know that these parrots can talk, but do they really understand what they’re saying?”\n\nShe stood. “How much farther?” She passed me and pushed on in silence for a few minutes, then yelled over her shoulder, “They can spell phonetically. They can formulate situation-appropriate questions. They can add and subtract.” She turned and faced me. “Think of how you might meet an alien, and although your minds and worlds might be very different, you might strive to establish a bridge of mutually understood testable hypotheses about what you are each thinking. Language is a model, and it is also a reduction, a focal point.”\n\n“But their brains are so tiny—”\n\nShe pivoted, put on a surprising burst of speed, and disappeared around a switchback. When I caught up, she was sitting on the platform of the hale swinging her legs over an abyss, with the sunlit, verdant valley a mile below. Rain swept across the tightly woven roof, yielding rainbows all around us.\n\nThe heiau was here when I bought the property. It’s about thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide. Heavy posts rise from the platform. Above the worn, old, koa plank floor there is a gap of about ten feet before the steep peaked roof rises toward its apex. Bamboo mats, rolled up on the sides, can be dropped down for walls. A few damp futons still complete the ambiance.\n\nHer hair, drying in the wind, flared out around her head. She looked like a different person; a goddess, almost. The flock of Greys rose from a nearby banyan tree.\n\nShe grinned. “I’ll take it.”\n\nJean’s life work began. Meitner’s first words in English were “I hate you,” followed quickly by “I love you.” Like any child, she meant both.\n\nTwelve years passed. We were having our annual Mele Kalikimaka party. Big doin’s. A ten-minute shower threaded cliffs with silver waterfalls that wavered with every gust of wind. The sun was low in the sky and would soon dive straight into the sea, bringing swift equatorial night. Good smells came from the kitchen.\n\nMy friends and neighbors from near and far had come to celebrate Christmas. My ohana—mother, grandmother, brothers and sister, nieces and nephews, transported from the Big Island by helicopter and running mad riot—spilled through the house and onto the broad veranda with its long, lava-rock wall where Jean and I displayed our art and artifacts. A few old friends from Cal Tech were in attendance\n\nAs was Meitner.\n\nElegantly dressed, as usual, in gray feathers and red tail, and celebrity, she held forth as if she were human and not a Grey Parrot.\n\nShe had not been surprised when she first saw herself in the mirror, as Alex, the most famous Grey Parrot had been. Her need to socialize with other parrots—so she would not see herself as wholly human—was why she had ended up here, why I fell in love with Jean, and why we had Leilani, now ten and hobnobbing with the guests as easily as Meitner.\n\nMethodically teaching Meitner human speech via a program developed by experts in education and neurology (human and avian) was not an end in itself. It was only a way to help Jean communicate with Meitner. Once that happened, once Meitner was truly accomplished in English and brought out her French curses only when she was extremely irritated, which was about once every hour, the real work began. When it became clear that the parrot understood and could use metaphor and complex linguistic constructions, the world was at Jean’s feet. Jean’s, and Meitner’s.\n\nI sidled up to one of my friends, an astronomer from the Big Island, as he chatted with the parrot, whose fluid, lovely voice mirrored Jean’s. Exactly. Jean’s accent, inflections, even that lovely low chuckle.\n\nThey were talking about dynamic topology—flocking—an emergent behavior around which I developed related software used by many governments.\n\nLeilani, a thin, brown, sparkling girl with long black hair, was showing her cousins her favorite painting, a copy of Gauguin’s “Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?” The metaphysical painting of 1897 shows lightly clothed Tahitians in various life stages.\n\n“Look,” Leilani said to her cousin, Jake, as she pointed to an old woman crouched in the corner of the painting. “There’s Tutu.”\n\n“Ugh!” Jake, eleven, recoiled. “Tutu is prettier than that!” He turned his stare to the bare breasts of a young woman.\n\nIn the painting, a fanciful, fictional Polynesian idol overlooks the people in the foreground. I imagined that Leilani liked the painting because she was always asking about the life of her ancestors in the old days. Perhaps she believed it might have been like the scene depicted in the painting, though we had etchings and photographs that showed the real thing.\n\nMeitner was on Leilani’s leather shoulder perch, as usual, and attended to the painting quite closely. She often studied it, and I wondered if her mind encompassed the wider implications of the questions that make up the title—particularly since, being a hybrid of human and parrot, she was the living embodiment of where we might all be going.\n\nBut maybe she just liked looking at the tropical foliage in the painting.\n\nLeilani and Meitner were classmates. In fact, they spent all their time together—sisters, of a sort—and they sometimes squabbled, as sisters do. The true dimensions of their relationship were unknown to me; I only witnessed dynamics, behaviors that looked like love, anger, apologies, wild play, and quiet, shared concentration. Jean brought in tremendously gifted educators on a regular basis. They waited in line to work with Meitner, to carry out their research. As a result, Leilani zipped through subjects that most high schoolers might have a hard time mastering. Like Meitner, she was good at calculus and trigonometry. She loved biology. She was on a soccer team, a debate team, and played a mean ukulele. We dropped her off at her cousins’ houses regularly, and they visited us here. We read, sang, watched movies, and played a lot of card games. Poker, for instance. Leilani and Meitner could take the house anywhere.\n\nI grabbed my astronomer friend by the elbow. “Hugh, take a look at my new painting. Just hung it today.” I herded several people toward “The Stinger Ship.” Leilani leaped and danced ahead of us, Meitner fluttering to cling to her perch, and stopped in front of the painting, a proud smile on her face.\n\n“You’ve heard about the latest private space venture?”\n\n“Yes! Great concept.” Hugh’s broad face crinkled in an enthusiastic smile.\n\n“Jean and I bought stock.”\n\nHe laughed. “Bound to pay off when your grandchildren are old.”\n\n“Oh, some of the early spinoffs are already paying dividends. The brightest and the best are working on it. Anyway, this artist painted a picture based on it.”\n\nHolding drinks, we examined it. A gigantic dome of a space ship with a cylinder hanging from its underside revealed a slice of the planet behind it. The domed shape and the tentacles that tethered human figures to the ship gave the ship its nickname.\n\nTwo figures were foregrounded. One was a space suit attached to the enormous ship with a tether. Another figure hung in space beneath the floating suit.\n\nHugh squinted at the second figure. “Ah. This man is naked. See the detail?” He leaned closer, gestured with his drink.\n\nI clearly saw a human calf. A foot.\n\nHugh said, “He’s dead. Or, after a minute out there, he would be.” A tentacle—a life-support tube, I imagined—floated in the foreground. It ended at the edge of the picture without connecting to anything. Perhaps it was out of the frame of the picture.\n\nOr perhaps it had been cut.\n\nI edged closer. “Wow. You’re right. Wouldn’t he burst?”\n\n“No. But there’s a question here. A story. Is it an accident? Suicide? Murder? Execution?”\n\nLeilani craned her neck to take a closer look. Meitner moved her head back and forth like a metronome, examining; listening. I felt a bit uncomfortable, as we had shielded both of them from television mayhem and violent video games. I always thought that Leilani would learn about the adult world in immediate, graphic terms, soon enough.\n\nLike now. I wished that I had looked more closely at the picture before having it hung.\n\n“I’m thinking it’s murder,” said Hugh.\n\n“Murder?” asked Meitner, cocking her head to one side.\n\n“When one human kills another.”\n\nThe parrot shifted back and forth uneasily on Leilani’s shoulder. “Why would they do that?” The fluency of her speech never ceased to amaze me. Or everyone else, for that matter.\n\nHugh said, shifting swiftly and irritatingly into professorial mode, “Rage. Jealousy. Or, if they have thought things through—this is called murder in the first degree—they might plan things so that it doesn’t look like a murder. They might do this to get money, or to hide something that the dead person knew. They might try to make it look like an accident, or suicide—”\n\n“Suicide?”\n\n“Killing oneself.”\n\nMeitner rested her small gray head, briefly, against Leilani’s ear. I saw a little crease between Leilani’s large brown eyes. My girl said, “Why would anyone kill themselves?”\n\n“I don’t know,” I said, quite honestly. Someday I would tell her that my brother committed suicide, but this was not the moment.\n\nShe persisted. “Why would anyone kill someone else?”\n\n“People don’t do it very often,” I lied, thinking of war. “It’s a crime. People who do it go to jail.”\n\nHugh snorted. “Sometimes.”\n\nMeitner’s feathers stood out suddenly. “I don’t like being human.” As she flew down the wide veranda and soared into the night, her strange, jarring cry bit into me like a knife.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, all I could think of to say to Leilani was, “Let’s see what your mother is doing.”\n\nA week later we found Jean’s doorless Jeep at the bottom of a deep crevasse. She was dead. The cause of death was internal injuries caused by the crash. Her face was badly damaged, but the coroner said she was pretty sure that Jean’s face and neck were bitten by birds. Not one bird, but many.\n\nI was too sick to even think about what might have happened.\n\nI waited for Meitner to show up so that I could ask her questions, but she did not.\n\nThe parrot flock was wild and protected. We could not trap or kill them.\n\nWhich was a good thing for them.\n\nIn the beginning, it was all so beautiful. It remained beautiful for twelve years. After that, it was a dread horror that brought out all that was worst in me. My lovely girl grew up in the company of her tutu and cousins, because I turned sour when Jean died and I carried the secret of her death inside me, for reasons I never quite understood.\n\nNow, when I hear Jean’s voice on my pod demanding rights for animals as I monitor the Stinger news channel in the hale where our life together began, I immediately grasp what it’s about.\n\nI turn on the video that is streaming from the ship with which I have become so deeply involved after that initial, distant investment. But I quickly turn off the visual screen. It’s jarring and heartbreaking to hear Jean’s voice, her syntax and accent, but see a parrot’s head, beak, and eye.\n\nMeitner\n\n“I am here in several capacities.\n\n“Most of you are amazed that I can talk. There is a story in that, which I will tell you.\n\n“But before that, I am here as spokesperson—yes, I am a person—to offer an invitation to participate in an international mathematical ballet. This is a ballet planned in conjunction with Psittacus and Company, one of the many corporations sponsoring the Stinger Ship, to celebrate the Stinger’s completion and departure.\n\n“Many of you already have the neuroplasticity enhancement that will allow you to do so; it is P-493, manufactured by Psittacus and Company, updated a week ago. Psittacus and Company is making a temporary dose of this drug available on demand. Directions about obtaining it will follow. Participation is, of course, entirely voluntary. It is fully compatible with all neuroplasticity drugs manufactured by other companies; it has been extensively tested for years and is fully certified for use by the International Agency for Neuroplasticity and Genetic Modification. Participants will be encouraged to be at particular places at particular times, which will follow dawn around the Earth, beginning on the island of Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands, in one week. You will need special 4-D earbuds, which will be provided, and a special bracelet, which will transmit information, accept your feedback movements, and create a dance based on the flocking capabilities bestowed by P-493. We anticipate that this will be a joyous occasion.\n\n“This is the part of this announcement that is most important to me. I am taking this opportunity to demand certain legal rights for my fellow creatures. The legal document has been prepared and will be released soon, but I will describe it briefly and follow that description with my story. Psittacus and Company is not a party to this demand; I am doing it as an individual.\n\n“Non-humans—all flora and fauna—are presently treated as beings with no real agency, as robots, slaves, toys, experimental subjects, nuisances, food.\n\n“As living individuals, we outnumber humans a billionfold. To those of you aware of how I was created, who think that we parrots have been given the gift of speech by magnanimous humans, I tell you no. We have had speech for eons. All of us non-human creatures communicate with one another and with our environment, and many have evolved communication systems that could be called speech—semiotic in nature, couched in context. We are scientists, observing the environment. We collect data. We calculate and make decisions based on that data. Some of us build. Some of us farm. Some of us hunt. Some of us use tools. All of us communicate. Some of us live solitary lives. Some of us are eusocial.\n\n“Most of us try to avoid you, but some of us are born or trapped into servitude. We parrots can serve as a bridge, spreading this message species to species where communication pathways overlap.”\n\nJohn Kalani\n\nI am musing on the fact that Meitner’s creators were testing the effects of genetic enhancement and neuroplasticity extensions, and that, twenty-five years later, like most people, I sport some of those enhancements, and many newer ones as well, when transmission ceases.\n\nI realize, in the silence, rather surprised, that Meitner is talking about Jean’s message. Her vision.\n\nBeing realized, perhaps, after all these years.\n\nSomething else is apparent to me, as well. Meitner once said: “My dreams are geometries of flight.” I did not understand at that time that her spatial dynamics were quite as unique as they are. It is something I have learned in the past few years by reading her papers. I think about those geometries in the context of the “experiment” the announcer mentioned.\n\nA thrill runs through me.\n\nChased instantly by dread. As soon as I hear Meitner say that she is going to tell her story I know: I have to call Leilani and tell her.\n\nBefore Meitner does.\n\nLeilani Kalani\n\nHands, fire, speech, memory, stories. My mother taught me that evolutionary grammar of humanity.\n\nMeitner can talk. She always could tell a good story. I’ll bet she could start a fire, too. Without hands. She sounds angry, imperious. On my television, her yellow eye stares at the camera as she tells the world what she wants. I decide that she would be a bang-up lawyer, too. A dull, sad ache flares in my chest as I watch her, but it has nothing to do with her words, which are splendid.\n\n“These are my demands: One: Significant funds, their purpose specifically delineated in my document after much research, must be dedicated to enhancing interspecies communication. Two: All animals must henceforth be regarded, legally, as sentient beings entitled to inalienable rights under international law: to wit, the right to an environment in which they can each reach their full potential, the right to live a peaceful, non-threatened life, the right to legal representation, the right to education if desired. The right to sample trans-species enhancement and changes and accept or reject them. The right to freedom from enslavement to researchers or any other human being. The right to form contractual relationships. The right to . . .” My mother’s voice trills on, as soothing and as reasonable as the million times I had heard her cajole, smooth, manipulate Meitner through tantrums and the constant negotiations of our shared childhood. Oh, amazing.\n\nI admire her. Meitner has fast-forwarded through eons of moral, philosophical, and legal thought and synthesized them into what is probably a compelling document, except for one fact: As a parrot, she has no legal standing.\n\nNot yet.\n\nThe last time I saw her was the night of my mother’s funeral.\n\nWe hiked up the trail past the hale, winding higher and higher up the road until we reached the ridgetop, where we each tossed a handful of my mother’s ashes to the wind. Wind blasted up from the valley. People leap off to hang glide there, falling and rising on complicated currents of air. The legend is that you can lean into the wind and it will stand you up again on the ridge.\n\nMom’s ashes blew back into my face. I felt my hair and found it greasy, full of grit. It was strangely comforting.\n\nThat evening, the house was full. A few uncles sat by the fireplace playing slack-key and talking story about my mother as the sweet smell of wild ginger gusted through the house, borne on the evening trade wind. Our whole ohana filled the house with food, warmth, stories, hugs. Everyone wore white. Our dark skins and slow-moving white dresses and shirts seemed to glow as we floated like moths across the huge, candlelit lanai. I gazed at the full moon, thinking about my mother. I felt as if she was giving me a message, in round, mysterious moonlight, but I didn’t know what it was. Tears on my father’s face sparkled as my aunties hugged him tight. Soon, they all joined in singing the old, old songs and chants.\n\nI wandered off and sat in the long, broad hallway where my parents kept ancient koa bowls, stone ko’i used to carve canoes, my great-great-great-grandmother’s surfboard, and their art. I looked at my favorite painting, the one that asks Where Are We Going, and I wondered where my mother had gone.\n\nThen I saw Meitner, perched on the back of a koa bench, staring at the Stinger Ship painting.\n\nI ran toward her. I was crying. I wanted to hear her voice, my mother’s voice. I wanted her wings to be arms, her beak a mouth to kiss me.\n\nShe spread her gray wings and flew. I followed her out to the vast, cantilevered lanai that hung over the deep, verdant valleys of my childhood. “Meitie!”\n\nShe vanished into the night.\n\nI never heard her voice again, though I thought that every Grey Parrot I spotted might be her until I saw their lack of her distinguishing red face-blotch. And up at the hale where I lived, sleeping on the futon, before my father sent me to Hilo, none ever spoke to me.\n\nI snap out of my memories when Meitner’s voice vanishes. After some dead air, a woman’s calm voice says, “Excuse us while we deal with some technical problems.” Some bland music comes on.\n\nDad calls. He looks old, much older than he did at Christmas. “Are you watching?”\n\n“Of course.”\n\n“I’m completely surprised that the parrots are there.”\n\n“I am too.”\n\n“Sure, you are, but I’m surprised because I’ve been working on code for the ship for some time and I haven’t heard about this experiment. It seems that I should have known. I may have told you about my work.”\n\n“Yes, you talked about it at Christmas.” The same kind of thing he’d worked on his whole life, of course, with total intensity and concentration. For years he had been living either in a shack hidden in the pines on his secluded bit of public—but hard-to-access—North Shore beach, or in the hale roughing it, talking to no one. Connected, of course, but a hermit. I worry about him, but what can I do? I’m sure he’s had various neuroplasticity enhancements. I have too, but just little things. “You’re working on some kind of human-machine interface, right?”\n\n“Kind of. Anyway, of course, Stinger is a huge enterprise, so I guess it’s not that surprising. Everything is compartmentalized.”\n\nI don’t say that he is a compartment unto himself, but I’m afraid he hears me think it. Instead I say, “It must have been expensive to get the parrots up there. Specially built suits?”\n\n“Psittacus and Company have a lot of money, and plan to make more with this publicity.” Silence, then, “Leilani, there is something I need say. It will be hard. I’m sorry, but I have to tell you.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Meitner may have killed your mother.”\n\nI jump to my feet. “What?”\n\nHe tells me a horrible story.\n\n“I don’t believe it! That’s ridiculous!\n\n“It’s not.” He is using his old reasonable-father voice. “She disappeared after that. Remember?”\n\n“Of course I remember!” I say, instantly regretting my cross tone. “But I don’t see how you can . . . even think! She loved Mom!” I walk to the kitchen to freshen my coffee, put the cup down on a table, walk to the patio door and open it, taking deep breaths of freezing air. Rain pelts my face.\n\n“I know this is hard for you. But Meitner is a bird. Her relationship with your mother was . . . confusing. Your mother agonized about it all the time, wondered if she was doing the right things, worried about what might happen to Meitner. She thought of Meitner as a victim. A bird that—”\n\n“She’s a person!”\n\nHe continues. “Your mother always worried that it was a lot to lay on a bird, or any other creature. Meitner often seemed . . . disturbed, and hateful. Like a human child can seem, sometimes, but . . .”\n\n“No, no, no.” I’m crying.\n\n“I’m sorry. I wouldn’t have told you. But . . . I didn’t want you to hear it from anyone but me.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“It’s Meitner’s story, Leilani. I have a feeling that she is getting ready to tell it. It’s what made her what she is. I never told you, but she was at the University of Hawaii for a while, and at Cal Tech . . .”\n\n“You knew she was alive? And you didn’t tell me?”\n\n“Some friends told me. I knew that she wanted to keep a low profile. That was fine with me.”\n\n“But—you thought she’d done this horrible thing! How could you just—”\n\n“Out of respect for your mother, Leilani. Meitner has been doing interesting things, some interesting mathematical work.”\n\n“What work?”\n\n“On quantum nonlocality.”\n\n“What’s that?”\n\n“Einstein called it ‘spooky action at a distance.’ Meitner’s work on it is potentially game-changing, and—”\n\nI cut him off. “But why didn’t you say anything? Weren’t you afraid she might kill somebody else?”\n\nDad sighs. “Of course. At first. But I didn’t know that she was out and about until five years ago. She could have been dead for all I knew, and I wasn’t aware of any similar cases, which would probably have made the news. Those that know her now seem to think—” He stops talking again for a moment but before I can ask Who knew her? he says in a rush, “I just heard that she was innovative and original, and that seemed to be what your mother wanted, what she tried to do. She wanted to give Meitner the power to do whatever she was capable of doing. What matters is that this is your mother’s dream. All the work she did—I wish she were alive to see this!” He pauses, probably thinking of the same irony I’m thinking of. “But . . . I’m calling for another reason, too. You need to help her with her legal demands. And you have to help her get her story told. They’ve interrupted Meitner’s broadcast for a reason. They consider her a threat of some kind.”\n\nI’m really puzzled. “What can I do?”\n\n“You’re a lawyer. An animal rights lawyer. You can get her a hearing in court.”\n\nBless his heart. He seems to be overestimating my influence, my expertise. “What court?”\n\n“What do you mean, what court? You defend dogs on death row. You defend monkeys used in experiments. What court do you go to then?”\n\n“Dad, calm down. Calm down. Whatever court has jurisdiction. That’s where we take the case. But she’s in space. There’s no court in space.”\n\n“There’s a World Court. In The Hague.”\n\n“Dad, I . . .” I falter. I was brought up never to say I can’t. I think hard and fast. “Individuals can’t bring cases. But they sometimes hear cases from groups.”\n\n“This is a group.”\n\n“This is Meitner. This is a parrot. Everyone can see she’s a parrot.”\n\n“She has human DNA. People can hear that she’s person, damn it! Didn’t you say the same thing just ten minutes ago? But she’s also a bird. Don’t you belong to some kind of international group that defends the rights of animals?\n\n“Animal Defense International, yes.”\n\n“Well? Do something! I’m afraid this Psittacus Company might kill her.”\n\n“I thought you said they stood to make a lot of money.”\n\n“They might if whatever they’re planning goes off without a hitch. I think she used them to gain this platform, and they used her to sell their enhancement. It’s politics. It’s sausage-making. But I’m worried. They might be afraid now that she’s making demands. Bad publicity. Can you imagine the sheer cost of litigating what she’s talking about? The pressure from all kinds of quarters to get Psittacus to shut her up? There could easily be an accident.”\n\nMy mind does a dizzy emotional flip back to the painting, the one Meitner was looking at when I last saw her. “Yes,” I say. I remember, too, her love of Where Are We Going?\n\nI wonder where she is going. Where she wants us to go.\n\nHe says, “We have to make sure that Meitner lives.” He picks up steam. “That she gets her dance done! For your mother! For her! Hell, maybe even for all of us!”\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever heard him so worked up. “Okay. My brain is functioning now. Let me make some calls.”\n\n“I’ll make some calls too, through my Stinger network. Maybe I can get her back on the air. So to speak.”\n\nI kind of move in slow motion, although I make things happen very quickly. All of my years of animal advocacy scholarship kicks in, all the people I’ve met. Cases come to mind. I call three people while I email six more. Within minutes, I realize that everyone I know is on Meitner’s side. It’s the case they’ve been waiting for. It sets off a chain reaction. Small guns call big guns and big guns call Psittacus. I forward information as it is requested and as I find it—proof, for instance, that Meitner has human DNA. The argument is removed from me as those with far more expertise and power take over. For two hours I monitor email, read rapid-fire injunctions, and bite my nails.\n\nThen I get a call from an unknown number. A man says “Is this Leilani Kalani?”\n\n“Who is this?” I ask, impatient to get back to my anxiety.\n\n“Meitner would like to speak to you. She wants to know if you will accept the call.”\n\nIf I would accept! I think with a rush of eagerness, but then I muffle the speaker as I burst into great, hoarse sobs that startle me.\n\n“Hello?” the man says, his voice distant, coming from arm’s length. “Hello?”\n\nI realize, with a great jolt, that I do not want to talk to her.\n\n“Just a minute,” I manage, and go away from the phone, back onto the patio, and bow my head in the cold, cold rain.\n\nI am surprised to find myself thinking in large, colored blocks of feeling, which I must maneuver with all my strength. Pull! on the yellow cube of anger. Push! on the slippery purple sphere of sorrow, which grows to huge size and howls at me, as I howled at my father earlier, No! No! No!\n\nThis is how I thought when I was a child, I remember, and that knowledge is like an electric current, connecting me to a world of overpowering feelings that I’d forgotten that I ever had.\n\nAnd it’s Meitner waiting for me: all that I’d lost forever when my mother died; a world waiting to be restored. Or to submerge me.\n\nI grip the railing, gulp frigid air. I work on my shaky breathing until it is deep and calm, the colored shapes shrink, and I am a grown-up again, but newly, sharply aware of the power of my childhood.\n\nI slide open the door and slip back inside, rub my wet hands on the back of the couch, and pick up the phone. “Hello?”\n\n“Leilani?” says Meitner, says my mother’s voice, says the being who may have killed my mother, the only living soul with whom I share so much, and who vanished so completely. I bite my tongue; I clench my fist, I say with a sob despite all that, “Meitie.”\n\nI remember to breathe deeply as I listen for her voice, but slow tears slide down my face. The lovely voice; the cadences of speech that say Mother, Mother, Mother.\n\nShe speaks again, finally. “Leilani, I am sorry.”\n\nWhat I have to say comes out in a shout, demanding and raw. “Why did you leave me?”\n\nShe speaks slowly, but without hesitation. “I was sad. I was afraid. Afraid of what I might bring to you. I am a bird. I can fly. I did so. It was the easiest thing to do. I was trying to leave behind all human feelings. They were too strong.”\n\n“I . . . understand that. Human feelings are sometimes too strong for me too.” I swallow hard. “But what happened? Tell me why you were afraid. I need to know.”\n\n“I will talk about all that, I promise you, when I’m back on the air. If they allow me to speak. They handled me rather roughly.” I hear the nervousness in her voice. “I’m not sure that I can say it twice.”\n\n“Did you kill Mother?” I use my strong, interrogatory lawyer’s voice, glad that I have that tool. Without it, I would be incoherent.\n\nIn the long silence that follows, the unthinkable scenarios generated by my father’s brief speech fill my vision. If I could, I would reach across space and strangle Meitner, grab her gray neck and twist it. Let them kill her, I think. Let them! Ranked against that impulse is my father’s reserve, his eagerness to let something that he wouldn’t tell me about, some promise, some link with Mom, unfold.\n\n“No,” Meitner says quietly, but with force. “I did not. I am very sorry if John thinks so, and sorry that you even need to ask, but I understand why. It’s actually very complicated. It goes to the heart of what I want to say.”\n\nAs I struggle to respond, her voice, almost a whisper, with an edge of happiness that is her, not my mother, comes through my phone, piercing the dark space of my listening, of my thinking, of my deep sorrow.\n\nShe says, “You are my sister, as truly as any sister could be. You are the only sister I will ever have. You shared your childhood with me. I am so grateful to Jean for giving me that. Your mother gave me my life, just as she gave you your life. When I was a child with you, the horror of the lab was fresh. You were my salvation. Leilani, I was not much older than you, confused, a child, but I stayed away from you out of what I can only call love. And that love propelled me through the horrible years that followed.”\n\nMy world whirls back around. I know Meitner. I know her through ten shared years of the deepest life I will ever know, through quarrels, pranks, laughter, and play, and I believe that what she says is true.\n\nI feel a rush of regret for lost years, pain at our human creations. And strange joy because the word sister completes me, like hearing music I never knew existed. Sister. Yes. My only sister.\n\n“Meitie, I—”\n\n“Ms. Kalani? Meitner?” The man’s voice is crisp; official.\n\n“Yes,” we both say, Meitner, I can tell, as irritated as I am.\n\n“Psittacus and Company has agreed to allow Meitner to resume talking.”\n\nSuddenly, that means nothing to me. I want to hold onto this moment. Perhaps what she has to say will destroy this fragile restoration of a part of my life that has long been dead, dead without me even realizing what was gone.\n\n“It can wait a minute,” says Meitner.\n\n“This is valuable time,” the man warns.\n\n“Go away,” she says, and the man is silent.\n\n“Leilani,” she says, “What I am going to say is troubling and painful. It will be difficult for me to say, and difficult for you to hear. But it touches on issues that all of us are going to have to think about, to confront. I hope to make that task easier by facilitating more communication—a special kind of communication—among us all. I am so happy—so deeply glad—that I have finally been able to talk to you. I am happier than you will ever know. I believe that your legal expertise will be invaluable in the effort I will outline.”\n\n“I hope so,” I say.\n\n“Meitner?” the man’s voice breaks in.\n\n“I love you, sister,” I say.\n\n“I love you,” she replies.\n\nVideo is restored. I watch Meitner’s big yellow eye, her hooked beak, and think, What Are We? Evolution fast-forwards right before my eyes and rings in my ears and in my brain as she tells the story of her life.\n\nAnd mine.\n\nMeitner\n\n“This is my story. I appreciate the opportunity to tell it. I think that it will be instructive.\n\n“I mourn my companion, Dr. Jean Woodward. When she died, I went mad with grief. I left the human world; I returned to the wild in Kauai.\n\n“As some of you might know, the vehicle through which human DNA was inserted into me was a virus. Because of the viral vehicle, human DNA was transmitted to the parrots in Kauai with whom I flocked.\n\n“Some of those parrots attacked Jean as she was driving to town. Her Jeep went off the road and she died. I have always blamed myself. I had told them how humans behaved, and had lately told them that humans sometimes committed murder. Perhaps they were angry at her for changing them, even though it was not really her who did so.\n\n“I left my flock. They were not like me; they did not have my intense human socialization. I hated them. I realized that I was alone—not like anyone or anything else in the world. New. It was a frightening realization. I didn’t know where I was going.\n\n“It’s easy to fly into the baggage compartment of a plane. I went to other islands. I spent years studying humans. I watched them through their windows; perched on trees overlooking their lanais. I listened. I never spoke. There are plenty of tropical birds in Hawaii, so I did not stand out. I therefore had the opportunity of eavesdropping on hundreds of families. I studied five or six families at a time, moving between their homes. I particularly sought out card players, for I could see all of their hands and understand their distinct strategies, and observe how they expressed themselves by showing and by not showing. I watched their televisions. I heard their arguments. I watched them make love. I saw them express love and generosity to one another. I heard them lie. Many living creatures lie, but I saw intricate, painful lies, with hurtful consequences that might ring through generations.\n\n“I never spoke. If I had never spoken, Jean would not have died. Something about knowing that kept me from being able to speak, even when I wanted to.\n\n“During that time I was learning about myself, about what this human part of me was. My parrot companions acted in a monstrous way, a way that was human, with hatred and revenge, but they had no moral imperative not to do so. They had a parrot culture, not a human culture developed and modified through eons. They were angry. They had emotions they did not know how to control. I realized that the entire time I lived with my human family I had been extremely isolated. I had known few other people, and learned that my family was unusual—deeply respectful, kind, adventurous, and loving. But not like most human families.\n\n“Finally, I was able to make peace with myself. I understood that who and what I was, although unique, and a mystery, was not my fault. I was created without a context. I returned to my flock on Kauai again and again over the years—the plane ride from Honolulu takes about an hour, and I stayed for months at a time or more—and tried to help them with their humanity, as they tried to help me in being a parrot. Over those twenty years or so we became settled; we grew; we learned to appreciate our human side, as diverse and wild as any other animal’s deep being.\n\n“The other side of my life took place in a different context, but each side of me promoted growth of the other in a seesaw pattern. The day I finally spoke again it was a surprise to me and to the mathematician at the University of Hawaii I had chosen to live with. I did so after watching many of her lectures, which sang to me. She thought about many of the things I thought about, and it was with relief that I learned the language of mathematics. I felt that I was truly home at last. She promised to keep our relationship a secret. I did not desire to become famous. I did not want to be studied ever again. Eventually, I became a ghost faculty member—a name that only a few humans could connect with a visage. Together, and separately, she and I wrote papers about emergence. My name is on those papers; I am L. Meitner. My work became more influential, and because I was never seen, there was a mystique about me. Some thought I might be an AI, or impaired in some unsightly way, or physically challenged. They wondered about my gender. Now that mystery is laid to rest—I am a female parrot with human DNA.\n\n“I have always wanted to do Jean justice. She had a vision, and without her, I would have none. I saw the indignities visited upon the beings on the planet without human speech. I saw the casual violence, the lack of respect for our homes, for our food sources, for our offspring. I began to experience a sense of mission. Most non-humans have specific missions having to do with survival but I realized that, having the gift of speech, I had a wider responsibility. I understand other species, probably, as little as you do, but I do know that they have interior lives and that they deserve rights as living beings.\n\n“My document and demands have been transmitted to those who can bring this case forward. I have already heard of massive international support, and I know that there are those who are, inevitably, against it. I thank those of you who are helping.\n\n“To illustrate Dr. Woodward’s vision, we plan to offer you a flocking ballet. It is a work of art that has mathematical underpinnings. It will be a spontaneous event performed by prepared minds on the Winter Solstice, beginning on Kauai, Jean’s home. All of you on Earth can participate.\n\n“This is her life’s work.\n\n“And mine. Soon, perhaps, it will be yours, the work of all of you, for in a flock, there is no set leader.\n\n“We take turns.”\n\nLeilani Kalani\n\nThere was enough time for all of us to get to Kauai for the Winter Solstice; the dance.\n\nI’ve taken the update; my husband has not.\n\nKara, our daughter, was here only a few months ago, but that is a long time for a toddler. Everything is new, and she is delighted with the surf, from which I grab her, the mountain, where she wisely shies from heights, with the ancient banyan tree by the hale, where she plays hide-and-seek among its many trunks, as I did with my mother. The deep sadness I carried within me for so long has lifted. The world seems as new for me as it is for Kala, charged with hope.\n\nIn the end, it was the power of social media that helped sway Psittacus, though the legal system can take some credit in setting the terms and conditions of Meitner’s freedom to speak. The world wanted to hear Meitner. Psittacus stock seesawed wildly during those hours, a fluctuation directly based on online supposition and conjecture. Now, it’s going great guns.\n\nThe whole ohana is here, some ready for the dance, with their updates, their bracelets. Lots of Dad’s friends flew to Lihue and were helicoptered in. They are a strange collection of academics, carpenters, plumbers, programmers, businesspeople, and old neighbors from his days in California and on the Big Island. Most everyone he knows.\n\nMeitner’s mathematician is here, too. She is a tiny, vivacious Thai woman—quick and thin, with long, silver hair. I am intimidated by her brilliant reputation, but her smile and her hug wipe all that away in an instant. She says, “Meitner has told me a lot about you,” and we fall into a long, healing conversation about my sister and the years during which she was lost to me.\n\nDespite such outbreaks of serious, quiet discussion, there is a festive air. People are gathering all over the world in parks, stadiums, and living rooms, and it seems that many animals are behaving differently as well, though that angle is pooh-poohed by the media. Still, there is news of the same communication bracelets we wear having been dropped, in pellet form, over great swathes of wild areas, which has caused environmentalist uproar. My father has an odd glint in his eyes and something like joy on his face.\n\nMany of us rise in the dark for Zen meditation at the hale, and then we wait for dawn. The lovely cacophony of parrots, macaws—a sliding, whooping, trilling music—fills my mind, taking me back to my childhood.\n\nThey stop vocalizing, as if cut off by a switch.\n\nIn that deep silence, a ray of sunlight shoots over the ridge. My father, listening to his earpiece, says, “The parrots have dropped.”\n\nBut I know without his saying so. We all do, and we rise.\n\nParrot music bursts forth once more, but I gradually realize that I am hearing a new kind of speech, which I also hear as music.\n\nMy movements are beyond thought. Perhaps they are like flight. My feeling is one of pure delight in an odd sort of work.\n\nMy father says, “Oh.” He is the only person who speaks the entire time, as we human-parrots dance the mathematics of nonlocal emergence.\n\nThat was the last time he spoke. And that was the instant the ship vanished, to everyone’s astonishment, except, perhaps, his.\n\nAnd that was when something new emerged.\n\nI’ve seen the parrot ballet, of course, many times now. I know that Meitner said, “Emergent Nonlocality: Going Home,” and then movement began.\n\nBecause I experienced it, and still do, I am endlessly fascinated by watching Meitner’s flock perform, in space, their three-dimensional dance of Meitner’s proof, ten short pages of symbols that they make real. That reality moves, via our communication bracelets, into us and into other living creatures.\n\nLike others, I study the first movements of humans and other creatures around the Earth that sunrise as we dance the pattern, which, once begun, continues to emerge in science, behaviors, art, politics, policies, and law.\n\nBut I am an amateur in this study, where others are serious, and brilliant. To me it is simply beautiful.\n\nAll living creatures have one goal, communicated, understood, and shared on a broad bandwith: the survival of all of us. With joy.\n\nWe flock.\n\nMy father still spends all his time at the hale or on the beach. He is completely functional and appears to be thinking. He just does not speak, not in words, not in writing. But he speaks in other ways.\n\nHe writes code: a form of speech, but not one I can cipher. I have not found anyone who really can, though I have been told both that it is gibberish and that it is profound. No one can say what its purpose might be, so it is probably art. In my opinion, art is communication on a spectacular range of wavelengths.\n\nI believe his art describes the strange new place he inhabits now, which I think is wherever that ship is. His mind is nonlocal, in two places at once, two places that communicate, part of the human-machine world he sought to create his entire life. Like art, it is its own purpose.\n\nI visit him every few months, between stretches at The Hague where my family now lives and where I work on litigation and legislation with international teams of lawyers, ethicists, and scientists. When I need respite from the Pandora’s box we have opened, I am drawn home to the place I hid from for so many years, and to my father.\n\nI seek him at the hale, climbing that haunting, lightswept trail limned with bracts of wild ginger. Or I look for him at the beach, where waves pound their infinite dance and the blue Pacific stretches half the world before me, charged with lives I can now protect, lives that interact with mine in a new dimension that is like an ineluctable flavor, a previously impossible shape, or a tone that infuses all of my senses. I am immeasurably enriched; deeply changed.\n\nMy father smiles at me quite often. His eyes glow with intense peace.\n\n“Where Do We Come From? What Are We?

  "latent_27730": "Rep. Kevin McCarthy: We can have tax reform done this year 8:53 AM ET Mon, 4 Dec 2017 | 04:40\n\nAs House and Senate Republicans get set to nail down a final tax bill, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy outlined what he wants to see in the plan.\n\nThe Senate early Saturday passed its tax bill, which contains key differences from one approved by the House last month. This week, the House and Senate are expected to vote to go to a conference committee, where lawmakers will hash out a final proposal that both chambers will need to pass.\n\nTo do so, lawmakers will need to compromise on multiple key differences between the bills. McCarthy told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday where he stood on some of those issues.\n\nCorporate alternative minimum tax: In a final rush to pass its plan, the Senate restored a corporate alternative minimum tax, which it initially proposed to eliminate. The House proposal would scrap that tax. McCarthy took a hard line. \"I think that has to be eliminated because that would destroy [research and development]. ...

  "latent_27759": "Mar 1, 2013 (CIDRAP News) – Experts are puzzled by a new study in which influenza vaccination seemed to provide little or no protection against flu in the 2010-11 season—and in which the only participants who seemed to benefit from the vaccine were those who hadn't been vaccinated the season before.\n\nThe investigators recruited 328 households in Michigan before the flu season started and followed them through the season. Overall, they found that the infection risk was nearly the same in vaccinated and unvaccinated participants, indicating no significant vaccine-induced protection, according to their report in Clinical Infectious Diseases. That contrasted sharply with several other observational studies that found the vaccine to yield about 60% protection during the same season.\n\nIn trying to figure out why the effectiveness was so low, the researchers sifted their data in different ways, said Arnold S. Monto, MD, of the University of Michigan, senior author of the study. \"We discovered that if you separated out those that had not been vaccinated the previous year, you got percentages close to what were seen in the major vaccine effectiveness studies,\" he told CIDRAP News.\n\n\"We were playing with this for a long time, and there was clear interaction of sequential vaccination and vaccine effectiveness, looking at it in a strictly statistical way,\" he added. \"We felt it had to be separated out.\"\n\nThe vaccine was found to be 62% effective in those who hadn't been vaccinated the previous year. That was similar to findings in the other observational studies and also to the results of a recent, rigorous meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. In contrast, those who had been vaccinated 2 years in a row (before both the 2009-10 and 2010-11 seasons) got no significant protection.\n\nAn additional finding was that the vaccine did not seem to protect participants who were exposed to flu in their own household, though the numbers in that arm of the study were small.\n\nResearchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the University of Hong Kong collaborated with University of Michigan researchers on the study, with Suzanne E. Ohmit, DrPH, of Michigan as the lead author.\n\nThe findings come amid a growing number of studies that raise questions about flu vaccine effectiveness (VE). They include, among others, last week's CDC report that this year's vaccine has worked poorly in elderly people and three recent European studies showing that vaccine-induced immunity in the 2011-12 season waned after 3 to 4 months. Other studies have cast doubt on the long-standing belief that a close match between the vaccine virus strains and circulating strains improves VE.\n\nIn an editorial commentary accompanying the Michigan study, John Treanor, MD, and Peter Szilagyi, MD, both of the University of Rochester Medical Center, wrote, \"As we are currently struggling through one of the most vigorous influenza seasons in recent memory, the apparent failure of influenza vaccine under optimal conditions seen in this study is indeed troubling.\"\n\nAnd Edward Belongia, MD, a Wisconsin clinician-researcher and member of the CDC's Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network, said he was perplexed by the low overall VE in the study, given the approximate 60% protection levels found in studies by the network the same season. \"I don't know what to make of it,\" he told CIDRAP News.\n\nOther researchers have said that additional studies suggesting a negative effect of prior-year vaccination on flu VE will be emerging in coming months, but they declined to give any details.\n\nAiming to detect all cases\n\nThe researchers used a prospective cohort design in an effort to detect all flu cases in the study group, regardless of whether or not participants were sick enough to seek medical attention.\n\nThe team sought to recruit households that had at least four members with at least two children and that received medical care through the University of Michigan Health System, based in Ann Arbor. Out of a target group of 4,511 households, the authors recruited 328, with 1,441 members.\n\nParticipants were instructed to report any acute respiratory illnesses throughout the flu season. Individuals with symptoms went to a study site for collection of a throat swab for flu testing. The researchers followed the illnesses to collect data on disease course, including whether the volunteers sought medical attention. Specimens were tested using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\nAmong the 1,441 participants, 866 (60%) had documentation of receiving a flu shot for the 2010-11 season, with coverage lower among younger adults and higher in those with high-risk health conditions. Of those vaccinated, 88% received an inactivated vaccine and 12% the live-attenuated vaccine.\n\nDuring the season, 624 individuals reported 1,028 acute respiratory illnesses, leading to the collection of 983 specimens. Of those, 130 specimens from 125 participants (13%) were positive for flu. By subtype, 45% were influenza A/H3N2, 34% were type B, and 20% were 2009 H1N1. Thirty-two percent of the cases led to medical attention.\n\nAmong the 125 people who tested positive for flu, 59% had been vaccinated at least 14 days before their illness onset, long enough for an immune response. The infection risk in the vaccinated people was 8.5% (74 of 866), versus 8.9% (51 of 575) in the unvaccinated individuals.\n\nCommunity vs household transmission\n\nThe researchers estimated VE separately for community and household exposures. Ninety-seven flu cases were classified as community-acquired and included in the analysis. After adjustments for age and high-risk medical conditions, the all-ages VE was estimated at a nonsignificant 31%, (95% confidence interval [CI], –7% to 55%). VE estimates by age-group were similar and likewise nonsignificant.\n\nThe result was very different when the team stratified the participants according to whether they'd had a flu immunization the previous season. As noted above, estimated VE in those with no prior-year immunization was 62% overall (95% CI, 17% to 82%), whereas VE in those who did get vaccinated the year before was low in all age-groups and came out to –45% overall (95% CI, –226% to 35%).\n\nThe team defined a household-acquired case as one that occurred within a week after another case of the same subtype in the same household. On this basis they determined that 30 flu cases were household-acquired. The estimated VE for this group was –51% overall (95% CI, –254% to 36%), and the age-group estimates were all low.\n\n\"Adults were at particular risk of infection despite vaccination,\" the report says. \"In fact, 9 of 11 (82%) adults with household acquired influenza were vaccinated, compared with 11 of 19 (58%) children.\" In this group the team found no major differences related to prior-season vaccination.\n\nThe authors found that the flu risks were similar for adults who were vaccinated in both years and those who weren't vaccinated in either year. The pattern was slightly different in children under 9 years old, in that those with no vaccination either year had the highest risk of infection.\n\nSumming up, the report notes that VE estimates against community-acquired flu of all severities were all less than 40% and \"not statistically different than zero\" (because of confidence intervals that overlapped zero). \"This unexpected finding was seen in a season with circulation of influenza strains that were considered matched to vaccine strains, and where evaluation of vaccine effectiveness using case-control designs indicated significant reductions of 52 to 60% in medically attended influenza outcomes in vaccinated patients of all ages.\"\n\nMonto said possible explanations for the low VE within households include that the vaccine may be \"overwhelmed\" by continual exposure to an infected family member, particularly since children shed more virus than adults.\n\nHe said his team is working on further studies of flu VE in the community and households and is collecting blood samples to examine immune responses to vaccination and infection, a step that was not possible in the current study. That may help shed some light on the unexpected findings, he said. For now, \"We can only speculate about what's really going on from an immunology standpoint.\"\n\nMonto commented that the study raises tough questions. \"We recommend vaccination every year because we know the duration of protection is relatively short. What are we to do if we know that being vaccinated every year is perhaps not the best way to get good vaccine effectiveness?\" he said.\n\nIntriguing and troubling\n\nIn the accompanying commentary, Treanor and Szilagyi call the findings \"intriguing\" as well as troubling. They suggest some factors that may help explain the differences between the current findings and other VE studies, but they make it clear there are no easy answers.\n\nTreanor and Szilagyi contrast the approach used in the Michigan study with the test-negative case-control design, which several large research networks have been using to assess flu VE. In the latter design, patients seeking care for an acute respiratory illness are tested for flu and their vaccination status is determined. The case-control approach has important pluses, but it is \"somewhat incomplete\" because it is limited to medically attended cases.\n\nIn comparison, Ohmit and colleagues were able to assess VE against both medically attended and unattended illnesses, as is true in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), Treanor and Szilagyi write. But the findings in this case were \"strikingly different\" from those in some recent RCTs and case-control studies of flu VE.\n\nVarious undetected biases might help explain the low VE found in the study, Treanor and Szilagyi say. For example, people who choose to be vaccinated may be more health conscious and more likely to report illnesses, compared with those who don't get vaccinated. Also, the households that enrolled in the study—only 7% of the target group—may differ from the general population in some way.\n\nTreanor and Szilagyi say concerns about the possible effect of previous vaccination on VE have been raised before, particularly in a 1979 study of students in British boarding schools. But later randomized trials did not show a consistent effect.\n\nGiven the many persistent questions about flu VE, it may be time to rethink the view that randomized trials are unethical, the two commentators suggest. \"Given that the effectiveness of the vaccine is unclear, [that] the subjects in such studies are typically at extremely low risk of serious disease, and that effective antiviral therapy is available, perhaps [the ethics] should be reconsidered,\" they write.\n\nMore research needed\n\nAngus Nicoll, MB, director of the influenza program at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Stockholm, praised the study and said the question of prior-year vaccination clearly needs more investigation.\n\n\"Our bottom line is that immunization is the most effective single thing you can do to protect yourself [from flu], and this isn't going to change what we say,\" Nicoll said. But he added, \"It's an important finding, and this does now need to be looked at in the longer term and a larger cohort.\" He commented that the question calls for study in a stable community where the turnover of residents is not too high.\n\nThe study also won praise from Belongia, who has studied flu VE extensively at the Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation in Wisconsin. \"I think they did a fine job with the study,\" he said. \"I applaud them for trying to do a community-based study, which is hard to do these days.\"\n\nHe agreed that the finding of an effect of prior-year vaccination is important. \"It needs to be looked at in other populations and seasons,\" he said. \"The numbers are relatively small in this study. As the authors note, the majority of people who get the vaccine get it year after year, so there may be important differences between those who get vaccinated repeatedly and those who just recently chose to do it.\"\n\nAs noted above, Belongia was particularly puzzled that the overall adjusted VE in the Ohmit study, at 31%, was only about half what was found in case-control studies the same season. \"I think a key message is that we need more community-based studies, with PCR-confirmed outcomes,\" he said.\n\nAnother flu vaccine researcher, Heath Kelly, of the Victoria Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia, said the suggestion that prior-year vaccination affects flu VE is not new, pointing to a study of British children in 1979. He noted that another research group developed a model suggesting that this effect is related to the antigenic distance between the current and previous vaccines and the circulating viruses.\n\nKelly said he found it \"intriguing\" that the Michigan study failed to find a significant protective effect of vaccination, \"given that many observational studies in Europe, Canada, and the US found moderate protection against medically attended, PCR-confirmed influenza in the 2010-11 season.\"\n\nHe remarked that the 62% effectiveness seen in those who were not vaccinated the previous year is similar to other published estimates, mainly from sentinel surveillance programs. \"Although it seems unlikely, could it be that the sentinel schemes include a majority of people who were not previously vaccinated?\" he asked.\n\nAnother flu expert, Michael T. Osteholm, PhD, MPH, said the findings further complicate the already difficult challenge of framing flu vaccination recommendations. Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, which publishes CIDRAP News, was the lead author of a lengthy 2012 report on the flu vaccine landscape and the need for better vaccines.\n\n\"We're at a major crossroads in integrating our current influenza vaccine science with our current flu vaccine recommendations,\" he said. \"The issues of vaccine efficacy by age and by vaccine [formulation] as well as the concept of waning immunity in a given season, the lack of correlation between vaccine virus match with circulating viruses and protection, and the potential for repeated annual vaccination to lower one's protection, versus not being repeatedly vaccinated, are all immense challenges for us today.\n\n\"If we don't go back and revisit our current vaccine recommendations, I think we stand to lose a great deal of credibility with both the medical community and even the general public as to the trustworthiness of what public health concludes and promotes,\" he said. \"This is exactly why we need game-changing influenza vaccines.\"\n\nOhmit SE, Petrie JG, Malosh RE, et al.

  "latent_28028": "Some of you may have already heard about this player because he did something truly spectacular in the summer of 2013, a feat that gave him a special nickname and media attention from all around the world — but more about that later.\n\nWhen Peña was 5 years old, he began playing for his local club, Alicante CF. His performances did not go unnoticed, which is usual for youth goalkeepers. Villarreal was the club that showed the most interest and in 2009, they captured a 10-year-old Peña for that club's youth system.\n\nIn 2012, during his third year, Iñaki had an almost perfect season at Villarreal. His team reached the final of the prestigious Arona tournament after he stopped two penalties in the semifinal shootout against Valencia. Villarreal lost to Atlético Madrid in the final, but Iñaki was voted best keeper of the tournament.\n\nFC Barcelona could not stand watching a talent such as Iñaki play for another team, and got him last season for the Infantil A side coached by Denis Silva. That team won the Liga in Peña’s first season, with a nine-point gap over local derby rivals Espanyol.\n\nLast season, Peña has been a part of the successful Cadet B side under Franc Artiga, which led its Liga regional group. In December, the team was undefeated (8-1-0), and conceded only four goals, fewest in the league.\n\nPeña shares time between the posts with Lucas Manso to give them both playing time, which is normal at La Masia. Everyone knows which of the two is more talented. In a recent match, Peña again showed his world-class potential with another cracker of a match that included yet another penalty save.\n\nHe stands out for his uncanny ability at both saving and scoring penalties. He’s a complete player who offers safety and security in defense, aerial dominance, good ball handling, great agility and reflexes and is good with his feet.\n\nThe Octopus\n\nAs was mentioned at the beginning of this piece, Peña had one performance that made people from all over the world scratch their heads — a performance that left but one nickname to describe him; the Octopus. In the final of the VII Torneo Internacional Reino de León, Barça faced the same Atlético team that Peña’s Villarreal side failed to beat. The match went to penalties where Peña saved six out of the nine penalties he faced to give his team the title. Four of his saves came in sudden death (after the first five tries). Furthermore, he scored on Barça’s final and match-winning penalty kick, since he made his sixth save on the ensuing Atlético penalty to end the shootout to give Barça the title.\n\nA Hollywood scriptwriter could not have written a better ending. The British newspaper Daily Mail wrote: “Flying to his left, flying to his right, saving them with his legs […] Can we get him an English passport?” Mundo Deportivo also wrote a piece about Peña, in which they assured everybody that not only could he stop penalties, but possessed many more goalkeeping attributes. On top all of that, he is a very mature and modest young man who also demonstrates leadership and captain-like qualities.\n\nIn case you thought that Peña was done impressing in penalty shootouts in finals, two months ago he repeated his extraordinary achievement in León, at the famous HTU Hallen indoor football tournament in Germany. This tournament featured an impressive list of teams that included Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Schalke and Arsenal. Barça’s Cadete B team was split into two smaller teams, the Blau and the Grana, with Peña selected for the Grana team that reached the final to face Dinamo Zagreb. In that match, Peña was the side’s hero in the final shootout after stopping all of Zagreb’s penalties before scoring the winner ... again.\n\nNational team and future\n\nIñaki's performances have not gone unnoticed at Spanish football headquarters either. Last year, he was called up for Spain’s U-16 team despite being a year younger than the rest of his teammates which shows the amount of talent Iñaki has to offer.\n\nThis year, Iñaki has been moved up to the Spain U-17s and right now he is with the team in Bulgaria for the U-17 European Championship. Despite only being second choice on the team, he is still the only player on the squad born in 1999 which is a great feat and it shows you how good he is.\n\nGiven the fact that Iñaki is 16 years old and already 180 cm tall, the sky's the limit for this kid.",

  "latent_28265": "Doug Pensinger/Getty Images NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York's journalist shield law cannot stop a Fox News reporter from being forced to testify about her anonymous sources for a story on last summer's deadly mass shooting in Colorado, a divided state appeals court ruled on Tuesday.\n\nReporter Jana Winter cited two unnamed law enforcement sources when she said the accused gunman, James Holmes, sent a notebook with details about his plan to a psychiatrist before the attack that killed 12 and injured dozens more at a Denver-area movie theater.\n\nTuesday's 3-2 decision by a New York state appeals court means Winter can be compelled to testify in the Holmes case, but not necessarily forced to divulge the sources for her story. Under Colorado's weaker shield law, however, Winter could find it difficult to assert her legal privileges as a reporter.\n\nThe Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of Winter that was signed by more than 40 news organizations, including Reuters.\n\n\"It's hard to say New York is such a good law when it leaves a reporter no remedy when another state wants his materials,\" said Gregg Leslie, the committee's legal defense director.\n\nWinter's story appeared five days after the July 2012 shooting, for which Holmes is on trial for murder. Defense lawyers for Holmes believe authorities leaked the information to Winter in violation of a gag order and want to force her to reveal her sources so they can be sanctioned.\n\nWinter, who is based in New York, is fighting a subpoena in both Colorado and New York compelling her to testify, saying that shield laws in those states protect her from having to name her sources.\n\nOn Monday, she made a brief court appearance in Colorado, where Arapahoe County District Court Judge William Sylvester extended the subpoena until a hearing next month on her motion to quash it.\n\nTuesday's ruling from the Appellate Division of the state Supreme Court in New York said that whether Winter can assert privilege to protect her sources was not relevant. It focused instead on whether she can be compelled to testify in general.\n\n\"Respondent is entitled to assert whatever privileges she deems appropriate before the Colorado District Court,\" Justice Darcel Clark wrote for the majority. \"Compelling respondent to testify is distinguishable from compelling her to divulge the identity of her sources.\"\n\nThe dissenting judges, however, said that was a distinction without a difference.\n\n\"This approach ignores … the importance of our state's public policy in favor of protecting the identity of investigative reporters' confidential sources,\" Justice David Saxe wrote.\n\nNew York's shield law recognizes an \"absolute\" privilege for reporters' sources, Saxe said. In Colorado, a journalist can be required to reveal sources if a judge finds the interest of the party seeking the information outweighs First Amendment concerns, among other conditions.\n\nSaxe said New York's stronger protections should be extended to Winter's case because it seems clear Judge Sylvester in Colorado will reject her privilege claim under that state's law.\n\nDori Ann Hanswirth, a lawyer for Winter, said she was \"thrilled\" that the court split 3-2, even though her side did not prevail. Under New York law, parties may appeal any 3-2 decision to the state Court of Appeals.\n\nShe reiterated that Winter will not reveal her sources under any circumstances, regardless of the outcome.\n\nDaniel Arshack, who argued the case on behalf of Holmes, said the New York court had correctly decided the narrow issue of whether Winter can be required to appear as a witness in another state.\n\n\"The question of her right to protect confidential sources would be correctly determined by the court in which she is compelled to appear - in this case, Colorado,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Cynthia Johnston and Philip Barbara)",
  "latent_28479": "The deal that will reshape the ownership landscape of professional sports in Toronto is one step closer to becoming official. The federal Competition Bureau said late Wednesday afternoon it will not challenge BCE Inc. and Rogers Communications’ joint purchase of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment.\n\nMLSE deal between BCE and Rogers won't be stopped by the Competition Bureau, clearing a major hurdle. ( Chris Young / THE CANADIAN PRESS )\n\nBut it also made clear that it has heard “a number of serious concerns” about the deal. For that reason, the bureau will keep a close eye on the outcome of the deal for one year, and could still bring matters before its tribunal. The announcement from the federal agency raised eyebrows among some observers, as well as questions over whether other providers – and their customers – will get equal and affordable access to sporting events. “The Competition Bureau doesn’t pull the trigger very often. In that sense, I’m not surprised,” said professor Mihkel Tombak, of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\n“They have kept the door open in the sense that they will keep an eye on the situation over the next year. The problem is the damage to competition could already be done by the time they act.” The powerhouse deal, worth $1.32 billion, gives Rogers, which already owns the Blue Jays, part ownership of the Maple Leafs hockey team, Raptors basketball team, the Toronto FC in soccer, as well as the Toronto Marlies hockey club. It also gives Rogers and BCE a control over a massive real estate portfolio that includes the Air Canada Centre and the Maple Leaf Square condominiums. But more than property and sports teams, the deal is about the rise of laptops, smartphones, and tablets – and the lucrative business of providing content for those high-tech devices. The question is whether other service providers would face increased charges, or whether would be cut out of the loop entirely, when it comes to providing access to sporting events to their customers.\n\n“If other networks want content and they get charged higher prices for it as a result, that could be damaging. Consumers would end up paying more to view it,” said Tombak who specializes in technology strategy and policy. Independent tech analyst Carmi Levy said “BCE and Rogers would behave aggressively at their peril.” The two companies have too much at stake, among consumers and the increased scrutiny of the competition bureau, to put smaller rivals at a disadvantage, he said.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nTelus “would prefer to abstain from commenting on the issue,” a spokesperson said in an email. The Competition Bureau did not say whether rules would be implemented regarding the sharing of content. “That’s familiar territory for these telecom giants. There could be what’s called a vertical squeeze: The price goes up for the content for all the other television networks,” Tombak said. Offering content to other providers for a fee would likely serve as another revenue stream for Rogers and BCE, said Richard Powers, also a professor at Rotman. “The extent to which they control the content now is quite amazing – the Jays, Leafs, Raptors, Marlies, Toronto FC. The Competition Bureau must have felt it did not prejudice other providers but it’s hard to imagine that it won’t,” Powers said. “The acquisition secures on a long-term basis access to TV, mobile, digital online and radio broadcast rights for both Bell and Rogers to MLSE’s sports teams,” according to a released issued by Bell, BCE’s telecommunications unit. “Bell’s investment in MLSE is part of its strategy to deliver Canada’s best content across world-leading broadband networks to any screen customers may choose.” The investment advances “Rogers’ strategy to deliver highly sought-after content anywhere, anytime, on any platform across its broadband and wireless networks and its media assets, while strengthening the value of its sports brand, Sportsnet,” Rogers said in a release. In December the rival communications companies pooled their money and paid $1.3 billion to buy a 75 per cent stake in MLSE from the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. But the entire sale was subject to the approval of the competition board, which decided to allow the deal to proceed. In the interim, Rogers and MLSE had already moved forward with a cross promotional campaign, plastering the Air Canada Centre with billboards advertising Blue Jays gear for sale at Real Sports, MLSE’s flagship apparel store. The Competition Bureau sent the telecom giants a “No Action” letter, indicating that it does not intend to take any action to block the deal. But it could still bring matters before its tribunal if it sees red flags in the year it will continue to monitor the deal. Other industry players are concerned about the effect of increasing concentration and vertical integration – where companies that create content also own the distribution channels used to get it to viewers – will have on consumers, the Bureau said in a release. “The Commissioner is actively reviewing these concerns and will not hesitate to take action should she determine that there has been a violation of the Act,” the Bureau said. Levy said the fluidity of the ruling speaks can be a positive. “Because the deal breaks new ground, there is no framework in existence. BCE, Rogers, and the Competition Bureau are kind of making it up as they go along – which isn’t necessarily a bad thing,” Levy said. “The media landscape and the Internet and the mobilization of content are changing. It’s a healthy process for everyone to be asking questions and it’s healthy for the Competition Bureau to weigh in with its assessment and give all stakeholders more time to figure out what needs to be done.” The alternative would have been to give the deal a green light, with certain modifications. For example, when Cineplex Galaxy struck a deal in 2005 to buy Famous Players for $500 million, the Competition Bureau stipulated that the company sell 35 theatres to third parties. “I hope that people who do feel aggrieved by this do step up and make it known to the Competition Bureau. If they have a grievance, Canadians should speak up more,” Tombak said. In the meantime, Maple Leafs Chief Operating Officer Tom Anselmi welcomed the move. “We are very pleased with this outcome, given this was one of the important milestones in the sale process. The transaction is still expected to close mid-2012 after CRTC (Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission), NHL, NBA and MLS approval.” With files from Kevin McGran\n\nRead more about:",
  "latent_28492": "Popular heartburn drugs called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been linked to a variety of health problems, including serious kidney damage, bone fractures and dementia. Now, a new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis shows that longtime use of the drugs also is associated with an increased risk of death.\n\nMillions of U.S. residents take proton pump inhibitors which are widely prescribed to treat heartburn, ulcers and other gastrointestinal problems. The drugs also are available over the counter under brand names that include Prevacid, Prilosec and Nexium.\n\nFor the study, the researchers examined medical records of some 275,000 users of PPIs and nearly 75,000 people who took another class of drugs - known as H2 blockers - to reduce stomach acid. The research is published online July 3 in the journal BMJ Open.\n\n\"No matter how we sliced and diced the data from this large data set, we saw the same thing: There's an increased risk of death among PPI users,\" said senior author Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, an assistant professor of medicine. \"For example, when we compared patients taking H2 blockers with those taking PPIs for one to two years, we found those on PPIs had a 50 percent increased risk of dying over the next five years. People have the idea that PPIs are very safe because they are readily available, but there are real risks to taking these drugs, particularly for long periods of time.\"\n\nBoth PPIs and H2 blockers are prescribed for serious medical conditions such as upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding, gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophageal cancer. Over-the-counter PPIs are most often used for heartburn and indigestion.\n\nPPIs have become one of the most commonly used classes of drugs in the United States with 15 million monthly prescriptions in 2015 for Nexium alone, according to WebMD.\n\nA kidney doctor by profession, Al-Aly has previously published studies linking PPIs to kidney disease, and other researchers have shown an association with other health problems. Al-Aly, first author Yan Xie, PhD, a data scientist, and colleagues reasoned that since each of these side effects carries a small risk of death, together they may affect the mortality rate of PPI users.\n\nTo find out, the researchers sifted through millions of de-identified veterans' medical records in a database maintained by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. They identified 275,933 people who had been prescribed a PPI and 73,355 people prescribed an H2 blocker between October 2006 and September 2008, and noted how many died and when over the following five years. The database did not include information on cause of death.\n\nAl-Aly and colleagues found a 25 percent increased risk of death in the PPI group compared with the H2 blocker group. The researchers calculate that, for every 500 people taking PPIs for a year, there is one extra death that would not have otherwise occurred. Given the millions of people who take PPIs regularly, this could translate into thousands of excess deaths every year, Al-Aly said.\n\nThe researchers also calculated the risk of death in people who were prescribed PPIs or H2 blockers despite not having the gastrointestinal conditions for which the drugs are recommended. Here, the researchers found that people who took PPIs had a 24 percent increased risk of death compared with people taking H2 blockers.\n\nFurther, the risk rose steadily the longer people used the drugs. After 30 days, the risk of death in the PPI and H2 blocker groups was not significantly different, but among people taking the drugs for one to two years, the risk to PPI users was nearly 50 percent higher than that of H2 blocker users.\n\nAlthough the recommended treatment regimen for most PPIs is short - two to eight weeks for ulcers, for example - many people end up taking the drugs for months or years.\n\n\"A lot of times people get prescribed PPIs for a good medical reason, but then doctors don't stop it and patients just keep getting refill after refill after refill,\" Al-Aly said. \"There needs to be periodic re-assessments as to whether people need to be on these. Most of the time, people aren't going to need to be on PPIs for a year or two or three.\"\n\nAs compared with the H2 blocker group, people in the PPI group were older (64 years old, on average, versus 61) and also somewhat sicker, with higher rates of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. But these differences cannot fully account for the increased risk of death since the risk remained even when the researchers statistically controlled for age and illness.\n\nOver-the-counter PPIs contain the same chemical compounds as in prescription PPIs, just at lower doses, and there is no way to know how long people stay on them. The Food and Drug Administration recommends taking PPIs no longer than four weeks before consulting a doctor.\n\nAl-Aly emphasizes that deciding whether to take a PPI requires a risk-benefit calculation.\n\n\"PPIs save lives,\" Al-Aly said. \"If I needed a PPI, I absolutely would take it. But I wouldn't take it willy-nilly if I didn't need it. And I would want my doctor to be monitoring me carefully and take me off it the moment it was no longer needed.\"\n\n###",

  "latent_28599": "MADISON, Wisconsin — A Wisconsin law that requires abortion providers to get admitting privileges at nearby hospitals is unconstitutional, a federal appeals court panel ruled Monday.\n\nThe 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel’s 2-1 decision doesn’t put the question to rest. Nearly a dozen states have imposed similar requirements on abortion providers, and the U.S. Supreme Court agreed last week to hear a challenge to Texas’ law in a case that could settle the issue nationally.\n\nThe Wisconsin case centers on a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood and Affiliated Medical Services. The groups argue that the 2013 law amounts to an unconstitutional restriction on abortion.\n\nRELATED: Planned Parenthood sues Texas over Medicaid refusal\n\nThe law’s supporters counter the Republican-backed statutes would ensure continuity of care if a woman developed complications from an abortion and needed to be hospitalized. But the lawsuit said the statute would force AMS’s clinic in Milwaukee to close because its doctors couldn’t get admitting privileges. That in turn would lead to longer waits at Planned Parenthood clinics. Therefore, the lawsuit maintained, the law amounts to an illegal restriction on abortions.\n\n“What makes no sense is to abridge the constitutional right to abortion on the basis of spurious contentions regarding women’s health — and the abridgement challenged in this case would actually endanger women’s health.” Judge Richard Posner\n\nU.S. District Judge William Conley sided with the abortion providers in March, saying the law served no legitimate health interest. The Wisconsin Department of Justice later appealed to the 7th Circuit.\n\nWriting for the 7th Circuit majority, Judge Richard Posner called the contention that the law would protect women’s health “nonexistent.” He said the law would put more women in danger by increasing the waiting times for abortions, which could push some procedures into the second trimester.\n\n“What makes no sense is to abridge the constitutional right to abortion on the basis of spurious contentions regarding women’s health — and the abridgement challenged in this case would actually endanger women’s health,” he wrote.\n\nJudge David Manion was the lone dissenter, saying the law protects women’s health and doesn’t amount to an undue constitutional burden.\n\nRELATED: Home abortions rise after Texas law closes clinics\n\n“The solution to the plaintiffs’ problems is that they find more qualified doctors, not that the state relax — or that we strike down as unconstitutional — precautions taken by the state to protect the health and safety of pregnant women who have chosen to end their pregnancies,” Manion wrote.\n\nAnne E.

I was going to have to learn to be ‘Quiet Roger.’ So, I went, ‘All right, let’s try this.’ Which is difficult, but I’m glad I did, because he did a really, really good job. And he’s made a record that I couldn’t have made.”\n\nRecorded in part at the L.A. house of producer and singer-songwriter Jonathan Wilson, the result often sounds far more like the music Waters did make with Pink Floyd back in the ’70s than his previous solo output, like 1984’s The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking or 1992’s Amused to Death, his last collection of rock songs.\n\n“He has a fan’s deep attachment to the oeuvre,” Waters says of Godrich. “He’s enjoyed having the opportunity to do it himself, if you see what I mean. Because that’s what he’s done. That’s why the studio was full of two-inch tape in big f—ing loops going round!”\n\nRead on for more from our conversation with Waters, which includes his thoughts on Donald Trump’s proposed wall and details on his upcoming live shows.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: The album is full of these musically lovely ballads with rage-fueled lyrics. I’ve been describing it to people as a mixture of beauty and anger. Does that seem about right?\n\nROGER WATERS: Sounds perfect, yeah. It’s about the transcendental nature of love and, I suppose, how it can transform anger into compassion.\n\nWhat was the genesis of the project?\n\nThe genesis of the album was me writing [the song] “Déjà Vu,” which you only get a bit of. Godrich has edited the rest of the song out. Not because he disapproves of it, I don’t think, but because he’s completely focused on making this thing that is a gramophone record, which is very much in the tradition of what gramophone records used to be like, when you could only put 19 minutes on each side if you wanted it to sound any good. Although this is 54-minutes long, it’s that kind of a vibe, so you have to keep throwing bits away in order to make the shape of something that is that. And I don’t disapprove of that at all. I think he’s made a great record and I say he’s made a great record. I wrote it and sang on it but he’s made the record. So it started with me writing that song, and then it developed into a long meandering radio play with lots of other songs on it, which I played to him. He listened to this long rambling thing and went, “Hmmm, it’s really interesting, I don’t think it’s a gramophone record though.” And I went, “No, you’re probably right, it is a radio play, but do you want to make a record?” “Yeah.” So, he got involved.\n\nTell us about the single “Smell the Roses.”\n\nThat song is almost an afterthought. It’s Nigel going, “Oh f—, you’ve written all these ballads, thank god we’ve done some jams. Could you please write some words to this thing?” “What thing?” “Oh, that thing in E.” “Do I have to?” “Yeah.” So I wrote that song four or five times and then eventually I said, “I’ve had this idea, which I think might work. What if Battersea Power Station is a munitions factory? And also it’s where we torture people? And it’s also this, and that, and the other, and we wrap everything up?” “Whatever, just write it!” So that’s it. It’s the image of this malevolent presence.\n\nYou recorded it mostly in L.A.?\n\nYeah.\n\nWhat was that like?\n\nFine. We were in Ocean Way, which is like an ordinary studio. It’s perfectly nice, got good equipment. But then we moved to Jonathan Wilson’s house, where it’s ramshackle hippie-dom. Lots of good old analog steam synthesizers, and lots of guitars, and bits of this and that. Stained glass. You imagine any minute some woman’s going to walk in smelling of patchouli oil and last night’s sex.\n\nThe album features a sample of Donald Trump speaking and, from a lyrical point of view, generally feels like a very Trump-era collection of songs.\n\nWell, unfortunately, it’s a very Trump era. It’s not just Trump. It’s all over, everywhere. It’s Brexit and Le Pen. It’s, “Let’s all lie about Syria, whoever we are.” “Let’s just make up any narrative that we want and say it’s true.” It’s like truth is now a completely alien concept. It’s not what is — it’s what you believe, or what you can persuade people.\n\nPink Floyd’s The Wall is a double album about the danger of people erecting metaphorical barriers between themselves and their fellow man. I imagine every time Trump talks about building an actual wall between the United States and Mexico it must literally hurt your head.\n\n[Laughs] Well, it’s so dumb, obviously. He’s been confronted with it now, because obviously he’s not going to be able to build anything, because it’s too f—ing expensive, and the people won’t wear it. It’s a really stupid idea. Everybody who lives anywhere near the border knows it is. It’s clearly a ridiculous idea. And if you look at the demographics of the citizens of the United States, there’s going to be a Latino majority tomorrow, whatever you f—ing do. You can’t stop it by building a wall. You can’t build walls anywhere, it’s ridiculous. The whole concept is a complete non-starter, except as an exercise in control — not of the border, of your electorate. Keep people dumb, uneducated, whatever, so you can go on milking them.\n\nYou start a North American tour in Kansas City, Missouri on May 26. What can people expect to hear?\n\nI’m playing four tracks off this album and, apart from that, I’m doing a bunch of old Pink Floyd tracks. Seventy percent’s old stuff, and four tracks off this album, and one of them is “Smell the Roses.”\n\nIs This the Life We Really Want? is now available for pre-order.",
  "latent_28956": "Software company Eset wants a Silicon Valley in Bratislava\n\nThe Interior Ministry's stance that it's all about the money seems strange compared to the value they want to provide, says Eset.\n\nThe visualisation of the new Eset R&D Campus by a11 atelier.(Source: Courtesy of Eset)\n\nThe Slovak company Eset, one of the most successful security software producers in the world, wants to build a brand new Research and Development campus on the premises of the former military hospital located in the Patrónka borough of Bratislava. It is prepared to invest into the premises as much as €100 million, except money invested into the purchase of the land which is owned by the Interior Ministry.\n\n“We would like to build a cutting-edge R&D centre, which would be at the same time the company’s headquarters,” explained Palo Luka, chief operating officer at Eset.\n\nThe Interior Ministry is searching for a new owner of the nine-hectare premises via a public tender currently in its fourth round. There are three bidders: Eset, Forest Hill Company by František Hodorovský, and Forespo Reality 10 close to Poštová Banka. The latter is part of the financial group J&T.\n\nRead also:\n\nRead also: Software company Eset gets a chance to buy land for its future R&D Campus\n\nForespo Reality 10 offered the highest sum exceeding €24 million while Eset offered the lowest sum, €23.457 million, the Denník N wrote.\n\nEarlier in March, representatives of Eset met with Interior Minister Robert Kaliňák. They introduced him to their plan for the R&D centre while they informed him about their willingnesw to increase their bid up to the highest level in the latest round of the tender.\n\nKaliňák reiterated that the only criterion in the tender is the price.\n\nEset CEO Richard Marko sees this stance as strange.\n\n“Everywhere in the world such a type of investment is welcomed,” said Marko, adding that the Interior Ministry should be also interested in cyber security, what is exactly the field in which Eset is doing its business.\n\nThe current premises of the military hospital at Patrónka. (Source: Sme)\n\nThe ministry originally wanted €33 million for the premises. Bids of the fourth round of the tender should be assessed by April 10.\n\nNew centre\n\nWhen drawing a new R&D centre, architects from the a11 atelier were inspired by the headquarters of the Apple company in Sillicon Valley.\n\nIt consists of buildings in the shape of circles with a lot of green as it borders with a popular recreation area Železná Studnička. There should be new headquarters for Eset, labs for students, a centre for startups and a kindergarten for children of Eset employees while other features like underground garages, a sport pavilion, auditorium for 700 people, cyclopaths and others should serve also to the general public.\n\nEset has problems finding quality people in Slovakia, as do other companies in Slovakia, and hopes that the new centre may be attractive enough for talented workers from Slovakia but also other countries to work here.\n\nThe visualisation of the possible centre is preliminary. Eset indicated that in case it acquires the premises of the former hospital, it will announce an architectural competition for the new centre.\n\nAfter Eset unveiled its plans to build a new centre, it received offers to build at other places in Bratislava or in other parts of Slovakia. It also received an offer to move to Austria.\n\n6. Apr 2017 at 14:22 | Jana Liptáková",

This is us having no base’. And she says to me, ‘Is this about Kevin?’\n\n“And I said to her: ‘It isn’t about Kevin, but it will become about Kevin’.”\n\nGillard then bluntly told him: “You can’t reward a wrecker.”\n\nRudd said he was not going to recontest the leadership without Right factional boss Bill Shorten coming to him with an offer of the final votes needed to get him across the line, which eventually came before the June 2013 ballot.\n\nAsked whether Shorten asked for anything in return, Rudd says: “No, he didn’t. I asked for something – that prior to the election we change the rules of the party to prevent a leadership coup from ever happening again.”",
  "latent_29588": "Unlike Hailo and Gett, which exclusively deal with black cabs, and Kabbee, which currently partners with private car companies, Karhoo operates an open platform that lets any company (except Uber) connect their own systems to the app. In London, ComCab -- provider of licensed taxis and black cabs -- has already plugged into the service, as has Addison Lee, KV Cars, Swiss Cottage Cars and Mornington Cars.\n\nWhen launched, Karhoo determines a user's location and shows the availability of cars in their area. Journeys can be sorted by price, estimated time of arrival or type of vehicle, if there's a need for luxury or a few additional seats. Because its system enables real-time data sharing, Karhoo can also tell supporting cab companies where demand is, allowing them to direct their fleet to wherever is busiest.\n\nOne key thing Karhoo has over Uber, however, is that it also provides the ability to pre-book a taxi, whether it's on the same day or up to a year in advance. That's something that Transport for London (TfL) considered forcing Uber to do in the capital, but later decided against it.\n\nAlthough Karhoo is launching in London today, the company plans to expand to New York and Singapore by 2017. It predicts that within a year it'll allow customers to book through its app in 100 cities across the world.\n\nHaving a large number of vehicles on its app is one thing, but Uber has managed to squeeze its traditional counterparts by offering good service at a low price. Customers will ultimately decide whether Karhoo's (and its partners') service is up to scratch, but taxi companies may have just got a leg up in their fight against their app-based rivals.",
  "latent_29714": "Weight-loss programmes often fail and forcing claimants to undergo surgery is unethical – better to work on health of whole population, says journal’s editorial\n\nDavid Cameron’s proposal to make weight-loss programmes compulsory for anybody who is obese and claiming benefits is “financially and ethically questionable”, according to medical experts.\n\nThe prime minister said last month that people who cannot work because they are overweight or suffering addiction problems could be compelled to go for treatment if they wanted to receive benefits. But an editorial in the leading medical journal in the field, the Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology says weight-loss programmes rarely work in the long term.\n\n“It is therefore important to ask whether requiring people to participate in weight-loss programmes despite a high likelihood of failure is acceptable from the point of view of an individual, provider or society,” it says.\n\nDavid Cameron calls on obese to accept help or risk losing benefits Read more\n\nWeight-loss programmes have a poor track record. Our biology is against us – after a few weeks of weight loss, the body adapts to resist any further change. “Although many people who claim sickness benefits for obesity might welcome the opportunity to take part in an intervention that helps them to lose weight, any mandated programme should have a strong evidence base for success,” says the editorial.\n\nBut although drugs have had some success, the only treatment that offers long-term sustainable weight-loss and improved quality of life in a high proportion of people is bariatric surgery, in which the size of the stomach is reduced in the operating theatre using a variety of methods including the gastric band and gastric sleeve.\n\n“Requiring people to undergo a major surgical procedure as a condition of receiving benefits seems far from ethical,” says the journal.\n\nWhat if the person seeking benefits had tried to lose weight but failed, it asks. “If people do not lose weight with one scheme, will they be enrolled into another more aggressive programme? Is there potential for escalation of treatment to bariatric surgery in people who have not lost weight with other interventions?” It was possible some people might end up enrolling on programmes that they had not intention of engaging with.\n\nFar from saving money, the journal argues that compelling people to be treated would cost more. In May last year it was revealed there were 1,780 people claiming benefits as a result of obesity, but this number is very small in relation to the 2.5 million total, says the editorial. More money would be needed to recruit and train staff to run weight-loss programmes, it claims, which would be wasted if they do not work. And bariatric surgery has high costs.\n\nThe editorial says the money would be far better spent on the population as a whole – two thirds of adults are currently obese or overweight. Weight-loss programmes could be offered to those who want to engage in them, but money could also be spent on universal free access to leisure facilities, healthy outdoor spaces and public health education on diet and exercise.\n\n“Instead of investment in a scheme that, at best, provides a short-term election soundbite, the government would be better placed to invest in schemes with the potential to improve the long-term health of the whole UK population,” it says.",

Border funding consists of $1.5 billion for technological security systems and infrastructure repairs.

So we'd have been, I mean, if this is the deal we're going to get it seems to me we should have just did the bill for the whole year.

And just as Silicon Valley got its start with military contracts, entrepreneurs and cooperative universities, they believe they can do the same with drones.\n\n“The potential up here is tremendous,” said Jack Dalrymple, the state’s governor. “It’s not about supporting a company or two; it’s creating the leading edge of an industry.”",

  "latent_30071": "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Sunday's official opening of Avaya Stadium couldn't have gone much better for the San Jose Earthquakes.\n\nThe venue looked sharp; the crowd was loud and intense. Every time the 1906 Ultras began pogoing in the stadium's west end, the press box began to shake, almost as if one of the club's namesake seismic events were taking place. Even when things went wrong -- like when a parachutist who was supposed to land on the field veered off course and had to touch down in an adjacent parking lot -- there was a happy ending. (Said parachutist was uninjured.)\n\nAnd oh, yeah: The hometown Quakes, now managed by prodigal son Dominic Kinnear, prevailed 2-1 over the Chicago Fire, who just happened to be coached by former San Jose hero Frank Yallop.\n\n\"It was like a wedding wrapped up in a bar mitzvah wrapped up in an anniversary, all in one,\" said a beaming David Kaval, the Quakes' president.\n\nKaval had every reason to be overjoyed. It was largely through his efforts that a stadium project that was lurching forward managed to achieve escape velocity and finally get completed more than seven years after MLS awarded an expansion team to owners Lew Wolff and John Fisher. In this day of almost obscene handouts to sports teams for new venues, the fact that the entire $100 million price tag was privately financed counts as an impressive achievement as well.\n\nThe San Jose Earthquakes officially opened their new home at Avaya Stadium on Sunday night.\n\nBut while Avaya Stadium was sparkling and pristine on this day, the club itself still bears a few scars from the journey to venue independence. Former captain Jeff Agoos recalled suiting up for practice at San Jose State's Spartan Stadium and then taking a 15-minute car ride over to West Valley Community College.\n\n\"It was eight miles,\" recalled Agoos. \"But it's a whole other world apart. To now have the training center and have a home field and something where you can really have roots and expand and build, it's fantastic.\"\n\nFormer goalkeeper Joe Cannon, who played for both of the club's MLS incarnations, admitted that the day was somewhat bittersweet in that he would have given almost anything to play in the venue. But he added that any negative feelings were outweighed by the fact that the stadium is finally a reality.\n\n\"I think it's just a brand-new start, and I'm looking forward to being part of an organization now that we have a foundation,\" said Cannon, who currently does work on the team's radio broadcasts. \"And the passion is here, and I'm glad we now have a stadium to house it.\"\n\nOf course, the biggest scar of all is the relocation of the original San Jose team to Houston following the end of the 2005 season. It tore the guts -- though not the heart -- out of a dedicated group of fans, not to mention others who worked, coached and played for the club. MLS commissioner Don Garber, speaking at halftime, admitted that there was \"a touch of sadness\" about the team's departure.\n\nIt was a bit surprising then that those with the biggest reasons to be bitter had nothing negative to say about having to wait so long for a stadium. Then again, their gratitude that this day had finally come was understandable. Colin McCarthy, a local attorney who was one of the founders of Soccer Silicon Valley, the group that tried to keep the team in San Jose in 2005, couldn't stop smiling as he sat in his seat next to his wife, Gina, and their three children.\n\n\"You understand the history of this club, and it's always been a fight,\" he said. \"From the beginning, MLS wanted us to be San Francisco. We were going to be San Jose. They wanted us to be the Clash; we finally became the Earthquakes. It took forever [to get the stadium], but you earn it that way. It feels more real now. We earned it. If we could rewrite it, I wouldn't have it any other way.\"\n\nJohnny Moore probably has the biggest reason of anyone to be resentful at the Quakes' circuitous path to a stadium. Moore played for the club back in the mid-1970s during its NASL days, and was the GM when San Jose won its last MLS Cup in 2003. During his tenure, he received a call from then-Santa Clara city council member Kevin Moore about a plot of land near the Great America amusement park that might be suitable for a stadium. He ended up walking the dimensions and agreed, but the club's owners, AEG, were unwilling to put up the money to build it without a municipality picking up most of the tab. The San Francisco 49ers' Levi's Stadium now occupies the site.\n\nJohnny Moore later resigned in protest when it was revealed that AEG and MLS were in negotiations to sell the Quakes to Mexican side Club America. America's intention was to rebrand the team and stock it with players from Mexico, not unlike the now-defunct Chivas USA.\n\nThe Santa Clara site originally laid out for the Earthquakes is now home to the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n\"Our whole heritage, our whole history was to be thrown aside,\" he said. \"I wouldn't be a part of that.\"\n\nThe deal eventually fell through, though Moore was still out. More than a decade later, however, he was sitting in Avaya Stadium, cheering on the Earthquakes alongside former teammates Davie Kemp and Mark Demling.\n\n\"I have nothing but happiness today,\" he said. \"It's a great day for the club, and it's a great day for anyone ever associated with the club. The stadium looks fabulous.\n\n\"They can't move now. Owners come and go. Fans stay. The club is here. It's cemented in San Jose, and it should be.\"\n\nUsually when the subject of San Jose's stadium comes up, thoughts immediately turn to what it means for the future of the club. Without question, the impact on the Quakes' finances and ability to compete will be considerable. But on Sunday it was clear that the venue will have an impact on the past as well. The chain that links the Moores, Kemps and Demlings to the Agooses and Cannons right down to the Kinnears and Chris Wondolowskis now has a permanence to it. And Quakes fans everywhere can rest easy.\n\nJeff Carlisle covers MLS and the U.S. national team for ESPN FC. Follow him on Twitter @JeffreyCarlisle.",

  "latent_30294": "Donald Trump's intrepid 49-year-old campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, will go down in history as the first woman to ever manage a successful presidential campaign.\n\nThe veteran Republican pollster and mother of four became Trump's campaign manager in late August, shortly after her predecessor, Paul Manafort, resigned from the post. Manafort had assumed the role of campaign manager following Trump's firing of Corey Lewandowski, a New Hampshire native and GOP campaign operative who ran the operation through the primary.\n\nFrom the moment she was placed at the helm of Trump's campaign to the final 72 hours of the election, Conway seemed to possess an acute understanding of how to guide the blustery billionaire toward discipline and his eventual success.\n\nToward the end of the election, Conway told reporters that she never hesitated to air her frustrations when Trump would wander off message or land himself at the center of controversy after making some outlandish remark.\n\nFor example, she recalled telling Trump, \"You and I are in a fight for the next 17 days,\" following his speech in Gettysburg, Pa. last month when he vowed to sue every woman who accused him of sexual assault \"after the election is over.\" Conway told CNN the comment made Trump sound defeated and as though he expected to lose to Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"He was like, 'OK, honey. Then we'll win,'\" she said.\n\nImmediately after she took over the campaign, and again in the waning days of the election, Conway was credited with ensuring Trump remained exceptionally disciplined. She tethered him to a teleprompter, placed restrictions on his Twitter privileges and worked diligently to boost his appeal among women and minorities, while strengthening his existing appeal among blue collar workers and the white working class.\n\nConway also spent months defending her ideas and strategy against the contrasting suggestions by other senior staffers, namely Manafort (before his departure) and Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon. She prevailed more often than not.\n\nEach time Trump faced intense media scrutiny for the various controversies he stirred, Conway would pop up on the major networks to defend the candidate against all odds. She downplayed his promise to jail Clinton if elected, stood by his decision to invite Bill Clinton's accusers to the second presidential debate and spent the final weeks of the election talking up Trump's chances of winning states where he trailed his Democratic opponent by double digits.\n\nConway has kept quiet about her post-election plans, offering no indication about whether she plans to serve in Trump's administration or what kind of role she would play if she does.\n\n\"12 hours after watching returns and a win unfold at Trump Tower, our team is taking in Hillary's concession speech,\" she tweeted Wednesday morning, adding the fitting hashtag, \"#WeMadeHistory.\"",
  "latent_30318": "In the same month that 125 Bangladeshi fabric workers died in a factory fire, a film aiming to expose the tragedy of unrestricted globalized fashion called Dirty White Gold reached its Sponsume target of £18,000 (about $27,000). The film begins by examining the hundreds of thousands of Indian cotton farmers who, saddled with economic hopelessness, have taken their own lives. It's a jolly little piece.\n\nA Center for Human Rights and Global Justice report describes the root of the problem: At the turn of the millennium, Indian farmers who had been given access to a wider range of products after India's market liberalization started buying genetically modified Bollgard Bt cotton seeds from the Gates Foundation-backed Monsanto corporation. The seeds were able to resist and kill the common American Bollworm cotton pest, making them an instant hit, with 85 percent of cotton grown in India being Monsanto-controlled Bt cotton by 2009.\n\nHowever, the seeds were expensive, and spiralling prices (coupled with planting restrictions from the multinationals selling the seeds) led to farmers approaching money lenders for hefty loans that eventually turned into unmanageable debt. Almost 300,000 cotton workers have committed suicide to date, some of them by drinking the same insecticides they were sold by multinationals. And those suicides also bring up wider questions about the ethics of the fashion industry as a whole, in that this cotton is used in the clothes that end up absolutely everywhere.\n\nIndia's embrace of the free market opened the floodgates for international money and, perhaps predictably, the corporatization of agriculture vanquished the need for the small-to-medium scale farmers who used to own and control the productive process. For roughly 100 rupees per day (about $1.80), these people are now contracted to spread toxic insecticides and fertilizers, often with little or no protective clothing. I called up the director of Dirty White Gold, London-based journalist Leah Borromeo, to see if the situation could possibly get any more depressing.\n\nLeah Borromeo interviewing Hanuman, an indebted cotton farmer\n\nVICE: Hi, Leah. How far along into the film are you at the moment?\n\nLeah Borromeo: Some days I feel like I'm a quarter of the way done, and other days I feel like I'm only an eighth of the way done. It's going to be out in 2014, toward the end of summer. I've got a deadline, so I'm trying to get everything done by then, but I can't rush nature—quite literally, in this case.\n\nWhat made you want to work on this topic in particular?\n\nI was doing it as a straightforward magazine article, but I ended up bringing a camera with me and found so many stories within that surface story. Then I found there was a real, genuine chance to express globalization, capitalism, consumerism, and all the wider political and social arguments through the medium of this story.\n\nYeah, you could look at it as a single issue, but obviously the problem is vast, and arguably a consequence of global capitalism.\n\nIt embodies absolutely everything. Fashion is the one piece of art that people tend to consume either consciously or unconsciously. The two best foils for relating to consumerism are through food or fashion. Food is quite a niche thing, because not everybody eats meat, but everybody—for the most part—seems to wear clothes.\n\nPrathiba, a widow, with her daughters and a painting of her late husband\n\nI guess one problem is that people hear about how awful unethical the practices are, but economic necessity can force them to shop cheap anyway.\n\nIt's using the poor to target the poor, in that sense. It's an obtuse battlefield if you want to look at it that way. You can fall foul of targeting those who can't afford to buy into what is now a more ethical lifestyle. At present, having ethical sustainability or buying into the idea is very much a preserve of those who can afford it, and that's not what we're trying to achieve. We want to make it the norm, so that everyone has no other option but to buy ethically and sustainably. As a business owner, if you sacrifice a little of your profit, you'll still be making money, but you'll also be able to ensure that everyone else down the line gets paid and treated fairly.\n\nWill that ever happen without strict regulation?\n\nSome brands do it voluntarily, but I doubt it would happen unless you actually legislate for supply-chain transparency across the system. These days, companies will find themselves with a factory that's caught fire and killed 161 people, and they'll say, \"It was a contractor that hired them, not us.\" But if you have to be completely transparent, you won't be able to absolve yourself of any of those crimes, and you'll have to be more strict about the people you decide to do business with.\n\nWorkers at the Sanskar cotton mill\n\nSo it's something they can just hide away at the moment.\n\nYeah. Look at the horsemeat scandal: it took the attention that got from the public for Tesco to say, \"OK, we're going to source all of our beef from Great Britain now.\" There's obviously a gap between what you put in your body and what you put on your body, but I don't think it's too much of a psychological gap to bridge. Transparency is very much on a lot of people's minds; it's only a matter of time before we start getting transparency for what we wear.\n\nParts of your film are going to be deeply unsettling. Do you think those stories will still be relatable for consumers, instead of just inducing that guilt complex typical of so many documentaries?\n\nGuilt is something I don't necessarily like to play on, but it's something that's fairly inevitable. I feel guilty; that's one of the reasons why I decided to do it. I came to realize my own complicity as a consumer in the deaths and suffering of people lower down the value chain. And that's one of my primary motivators—not just to alleviate that, but to make sure other people realize. I know we're all suffering from the recession and everything else right now, but just because we're in the shit doesn't mean we have to leave everyone else in it as well.\n\nA selection of the pesticides used on Indian farms\n\nIdeally, what do you want to achieve with the film?\n\nOfficial legislation for transparency, but that's not something that can be an instant quick fix—we're looking at possibly a ten-, 15-, 20-year scheme. We're looking at long-term goals rather than short-term gestures. Do we really want to continue feeding our own debt and our own penury through our consumer habits? It's a state of self-destructive consumerist behavior and it's something that we can address and change, but it has to be something that we're willing or made to change.\n\nWhat are the nonlegislative ways we could introduce that sooner?\n\nStuff like getting young designers, as they're coming to schools and universities, to start working in ethics and sustainability from the point of concept, so that when they're thinking about the designs they'll have to think, How is this going to be eco? or, How is this going to be sustainable?\n\nFrom an environmental perspective, I guess it's not only desirable, but necessary.\n\nYeah. There's a fatalistic aspect of me who thinks we've already done as much damage as can possibly be done, and we're just delaying the inevitable, to a certain degree. But there's also the optimist in me who thinks we're still at a point where grass still grows and trees are still green, and we can make sure it stays that way.\n\nThanks, Leah.\n\nFollow Tamlin on Twitter: @wegotblankets\n\nMore from India:\n\nThe Burnt and Bloodied Sex Workers of South Mumbai\n\nIndia's Street Doctors Will Bleed the Sickness Right Out of You\n\nWait, Are These Taxi Drivers Sleeping or Dead?",
  "latent_30606": "Permanent Records is an ongoing closer look at the records that matter most.\n\nUnderground hip-hop is no stranger to mad geniuses—from Kool Keith (the original mad villain) to Jay Electronica before his fall from grace to the cult of Earl Sweatshirt, the weirder side of rap history is littered with mystical hermits and failed messiahs. But few have captured the imagination of fans as successfully or for as long as MF Doom (now known simply as Doom) and Madlib, and nowhere as well as on their sole collaborative work under the moniker of Madvillain, Madvillainy. Hailed upon its 2004 release as one of the best rap albums of the year, if not the decade, Madvillainy’s critical reception still holds up 10 years later. Some albums are so highly anticipated that it’s almost impossible to avoid an opinion hangover as time sharpens their weak points, but Madvillainy remains exciting and fresh with every listen, the rare long-awaited collaboration that lived up to the hype.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe frenzy that awaited Madvillainy certainly had grounds, considering the careers that led to its production. Doom’s origin story is the stuff of legends: Daniel Dumile’s brief, early career as part of the group KMD (under the name Zev Love X) came to a tragic end when his brother and groupmate, Subroc, was killed in a car accident the same week KMD was dropped by Elektra Records. After a few years in the wilderness, Dumile emerged playing shows with a stocking over his head, a disguise that eventually morphed into the mask of Doom. His proper debut, 1999’s Operation: Doomsday, established an entire musical world, populated by monsters, scientists, dinosaurs, and supervillains, woven seamlessly out of a patchwork of samples ranging from The Beatles to Teena Marie to Scooby Doo. Madlib (born Otis Jackson Jr.) is the sort of mad musical scientist who could make a masterpiece like The Unseen with nothing but an 8-track, a massive record collection, the considerable spiritual assistance of Melvin Van Peebles, and $50 worth of shrooms.\n\nBy the time the pair started working together in 2002, each had made a classic album in Doomsday and The Unseen, but it still might’ve made sense to tamp down expectations—artists may have a proven history of excellent work, but that doesn’t guarantee the same alchemy will occur in a collaborative piece. When Madlib and Doom started on Madvillainy, though, the partnership energized two parties notorious for being difficult to work with. The initial sessions at Madlib’s home studio went so well, he was inspired to make some of the album’s best tracks (including “Strange Ways” and “Rhinestone Cowboy”) with nothing more than a record player, cassette deck, and an SP 303 in a hotel room in Brazil—where he also debuted the first music from the album by playing “America’s Most Blunted” at the Red Bull Music Academy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was unclear whether Madvillainy would even be finished after a demo from the Brazil sessions leaked, which discouraged Doom and Madlib from completing the album. It took most of 2003 for the pair to become interested in getting back to work, but after some last-minute vocal re-recording, Madvillainy was finally released March 23, 2004, to glowing reviews. And thank Sun Ra it saw the light of day—Madvillainy isn’t just as good as the sum of Doom and Madlib’s considerable talents, it’s better.\n\nIf Madvillainy has a defining characteristic, it’s buffet-style efficiency. Madlib and Doom are interested in throwing out ideas as fast as they have them, giving them as much attention as they need, and moving on to the next thing; no song passes the four-minute mark (many are under two) and no two songs are alike. There are no choruses—every song is just verse after densely packed verse. Take “Curls,” a 90-second verse that manages to pack in all the Doom standards of wordplay, weed, women, and money into its brief running time. “Curls” could have easily been expanded into a three-minute track, but Doom and Madlib were confident enough to let it punch hard as is, sounding like a tossed-off sketch while conveying both artists’ meticulous craftsmanship.\n\nEschewing hooks also means there’s nothing to take the focus away from the simple (yet not-so-simple) interplay of Doom’s flow and Madlib’s production. Even though the two barely interacted while actually working on the music, they’re in a sort of perfect creative mind-meld. And Doom doesn’t pass up the opportunity to comment on Madlib’s production, riffing on the sample that gives “Accordion” its name, calling out Madlib’s use of “an old jazz standard” on “Money Folder,” or perfecting the blend of cartoon theme music backing and supervillain mission statement that is “All Caps.”\n\nAnd yet, all of Madlib and Doom’s creative restlessness produces a consistent, complete album. Madlib’s production ensures that every track flows seamlessly into the next, so that the ecstatic, sugar-high piano riff of “Raid” comes naturally after the lumbering, funky bass of “Bistro.” Beyond his ear for flipping samples (especially the one of Waldir Calmon’s “Airport Love Theme” that grounds “Curls”), there’s also live instrumentation from the Loop Digga supporting “Great Day.” Where Madlib’s demented use of samples is the main show on The Unseen, upstaging his high-pitched rapping as Quasimoto, the beats on Madvillainy are primarily support for Doom, give or take the instrumental tracks (“Supervillain Theme,” in particular).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in Doom, Madlib finds something he’s been searching for ever since (and has only just found with Freddie Gibbs): a collaborator who’s as worthy on the mic as he is on the boards. Doom’s lyrics are as unrelenting as they’ve ever been, and probably ever will be, using the lack of hooks to call attention to his finesse with the English language. He still cuts a comic figure—it’d be hard not to with lyrics like, “Don’t mind me, I wrote this rhyme lightly / Over two or three Heines / And boy was they fine, G”. But Madvillainy has layers, and its quick, furious jabs of songs reward near-infinite listens—“Strange Ways” is as effective a handling of religious violence as you’re likely to find in a rap song that doesn’t break two minutes, and “Rainbows” paints a simultaneously funny and deeply moving picture of a burnout suffering from mental illness and drug addiction, revealed at the end of the song to be the villain Doom himself.\n\nThough their partnership dominates the album, Doom and Madlib don’t completely disappear into the entity of Madvillain. Instead, each gets the opportunity to display and comment on their own eccentricities with help from a kindred spirit. The showcase for Madlib’s rapping alter ego Quasimoto (as well as Madlib’s rapping in his own voice), Sun Ra tribute “Shadows Of Tomorrow,” is still undeniably a Madvillain song in its forward momentum. And the same can be said of “Fancy Clown,” which is rapped by Doom in his Viktor Vaughn persona and describes the end of a toxic relationship in which a girl cheats on Vaughn with Doom himself. On the other hand, Madvillainy’s biggest weakness is the stretch of songs given over to friends of the two collaborators, in particular the supremely boring Wildchild spotlight “Hardcore Hustle.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe considerable charms of Madvillainy are best expressed on album closer “Rhinestone Cowboy.” Based on a sample of South American singer Maria Bethania, the track also contains two of Doom’s greatest lyrical turns: “Got more soul than a sock with a hole” and the immortal “Overthrow like throwing Rover a biscuit / A lot of bitches think he overly chauvinistic.” Those lines encapsulate the many levels on which the album works—one is simply a great pun; the other is both hilarious and a deep dive into Doom himself. Considering the smatterings of sampled applause that Doom shuts down and the lyrical focus on the album’s origin story (“Wasn’t even tweaked and it leaked into cyberspace”), it’s fair to say that, like Madvillainy as a whole, “Rhinestone Cowboy” manages the meta-relation of being about itself by way of being about Doom.\n\nMadlib is such a workaholic he remixed the entirety of the album in 2008 as the not-quite Madvillainy 2 amid rumors that he and Doom were working on a true sequel. While a few of those tracks are good (“Space Ho’s Coast To Coast”), the remix album is still a bit flat—the original beats are too closely bonded to Doom’s lyrics. In a recent interview, the producer said that he had to “go see” a now-perpetually slacking Doom about getting together to finish work on that long-awaited sequel. It’s probably for the best Madvillainy 2 never hit shelves, especially if one-half of Madvillain isn’t willing to put the work in to have it equal the original—if that’s even possible. Given the almost cosmically large odds against that same lightning striking twice, Madvillainy is better as an isolated work of perfection.",

  "latent_30847": "WASHINGTON, May 4 (Reuters) - The low amount of income taxes the U.S. government collected in April, the most important month for tax filing, shows that states will have a devastating drop in their collections this year, the Rockefeller Institute of Government said on Tuesday.\n\n“With the data now in hand, it’s all over but the crying,” said Institute Senior Fellow Donald Boyd in a statement.\n\n“There weren’t any major changes in federal tax law that would have caused this revenue drop,” he added. “And it is a pretty good indication that states, too, will have large year-over-year declines in April tax payment.”\n\nFederal tax collections that were not withheld from wage earners through April 30 were down 17.6 percent from a year earlier, according to the institute.\n\nStates get a large share of revenue they use to pay for schools, roads, healthcare and other crucial services through income taxes. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, last year six states received more than half of their annual revenue from personal income taxes, with more than two-thirds of Oregon’s revenue generated by income tax.\n\nMany states set up their tax codes to mimic the U.S. tax regulations, and their collections move in sync with the federal government’s. Because the deadline for paying income taxes is April 15, states collect the most taxes that month.\n\n“At a minimum, the federal data tell us that states are not likely to get bailed out by good news in April, and that some will find that they face new shortfalls,” Boyd said.\n\nHeading into tax day, fiscal year-to-date personal income tax collections were lagging the same period in fiscal 2009 in several states.\n\nAnother drop in revenue could stress already tenuous budget situations in many states, he said. The fiscal years for almost all states ends on June 30 and they have been trying to draft budgets as the recession that began in 2007 continues to bite into their revenue.\n\nOn the national level, there are many signs pointing to the end of the recession this year, and certain states are entering economic recovery. Still, states heal slowly from downturns because income tax revenues decline when residents suffer prolonged joblessness while the demand for social services such as healthcare spikes when people lose work.

  "latent_30976": "Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev has named his wife, Mehriban Aliyeva, as vice president. Aliyeva graduated from medical school and serves in the country's parliament. She also chairs her husband's political party, Yeni Azerbaijan. (Amanda Erickson,Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\n\nThis year, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev offered his wife a special anniversary present — he appointed her first vice president.\n\nOn Tuesday, Aliyev announced that Mehriban Aliyeva, 52, would step into a role created last fall by constitutional referendum. In that position, she will succeed her husband if he steps down. She will also likely oversee the country's cabinet. (The constitutional amendments approved in the referendum also stretched the presidential term from five to seven years, after a 2009 referendum abolished term-limits in the former Soviet republic. And they ditched the age requirement for president, paving the way for the Aliyevs' 19-year-old son to run.)\n\nAliyeva graduated from medical school, but she has always had an interest in politics. She serves in the country's parliament and chairs her husband's political party, Yeni Azerbaijan. She has run several big projects, including Azerbaijan's Olympic bid and the Heydar Aliyev charity. Aliyeva was born into one of the country's wealthiest families, the Pashayevs, who have donated generously to the arts. They can afford to — the clan controls several banks, insurance companies, construction, travel, and Azerbaijan's only Bentley dealership. Several relatives hold top government posts.\n\nShe is famous (or infamous) for her love of luxury, her meticulous appearance and her stylish dress. In leaked American diplomatic cables, diplomats suggested that Aliyeva had problems showing a \"full range of facial expression\" because of \"substantial cosmetic surgery.\" They also wrote that she was poorly informed about political issues.\n\nIn a statement laying out her qualifications, President Aliyev wrote, \"it is no coincidence that the organization of the Fourth Islamic Solidarity Games due to be held this year has also been entrusted to Mehriban Aliyeva.\"\n\nOpposition leaders agree that it's no coincidence. But they don't think Aliyeva's talents got her the job. The Aliyevs, they say, run their country like a fiefdom, getting rich off Azerbaijan's energy reserves. Now they're trying to consolidate dynastic rule, critics say. \"This appointment shows disrespect to the people,\" Ali Kerimli, leader of one of Azerbaijan's opposition parties, told Reuters. \"It's the first step to the establishment of an absolute monarchy in the country.\"\n\nOthers took to social media to air their dissent:\n\nAzerbaijan's leadership has long been all in the family. Ilham Aliyev succeeded his father, Heydar Aliyev, who ruled Azerbaijan as a Communist Party boss and then as a post-Soviet president for almost 30 years. The son took over in 2003. He has focused on turning the small country into a regional power player and ally of the West. He has also built up a personal fortune in the tens of millions of dollars, thanks largely to his family's ties to state-run businesses. The Aliyev family owns significant parts of at least eight major Azerbaijani banks. They also profit from partial ownership of the country's oil and gas industries, the major telecommunication groups and construction firms (important, because Baku has seen a building boom).\n\nMuch of their money is hidden in offshore accounts. In 2013, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project named Ilham Aliyev \"corruption's person of the year.\" (Aliyev's family denies the charges.)\n\nThe country has also earned a reputation for repressive political tactics, curbing free expression and preventing fair elections. Just days before Aliyev announced the appointment of his wife, activists from the opposition party were detained and jailed. At least 10 political activists and journalists have been detained this month; 30 more have been put under administrative arrest. Khadija Ismayilova, an investigative journalist, suggested that these moves were designed to thwart government opponents who might \"dare to protest\" Aliyeva's appointment.\n\nAnd for those who note a parallel between the the behavior of Aliyev and that of President Trump — you're not alone:",
  "latent_30996": "David Cameron’s hopes of reforming Britain’s relationship with Brussels have been dealt a blow after a confidential blueprint setting out the European Union's \"priorities\" for the next five years fell far short of his demands for change.\n\nThe document, obtained by The Telegraph will be given to the Prime Minister by Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, when they meet in Downing Street.\n\nIt comes as Mr Cameron prepares to force a vote on the possible presidency of Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nThe Prime Minister has been attempting to block the appointment but is increasingly resigned to defeat.\n\nThe document being give to Mr Cameron by Mr Van Rompuy will further anger the Prime Minister ahead of a crucial Brussels summit where European leaders will discuss Mr Juncker’s appointment.\n\nThe four-page document fails to deliver any of the substantial reforms that Mr Cameron could sell to a sceptical British public in return for accepting Mr Juncker and holds out no prospect of even discussing EU Treaty change or abolishing the legal commitment to an \"ever closer union\".\n\nIt also fails to countenance Mr Cameron’s key demand for national parliaments to be given a veto over European legislation.\n\nIn March, writing for the Telegraph, Mr Cameron set out seven demands for EU reform including the key proposal that \"national parliaments [are] able to work together to block unwanted European legislation\".\n\nThe document states: “The credibility of the Union depends on its ability to ensure that its institutions and members states follow up on decisions taken. They should produce tangible results and live up to their commitment to provide shelter to European citizens and to protect their rights, welfare and well-being.”\n\nThe most concrete reference to a British demand is a loose commitment to giving MPs more of say in EU decisions but it is a pledge that falls far short of Mr Cameron's call for groups of national parliaments to be given a veto over European legislation.\n\n\"A greater place should be given to national parliaments, including by strengthening their means of participating in the debate and making their voice heard in the decision-making process,\" the document said.\n\nMore positively for Mr Cameron, the paper appears to criticise the EU parliament for imposing Mr Juncker as commission president, on the basis that he was the spitzenkandidat or lead candidate of the European People's Party (EPP) that won most seats in elections across Europe last month.\n\n\"There is a need for efficient and legitimate European institutions. The complementary dual democratic legitimacy of the European Union through the directly elected European Parliament and the elected national governments in the Council needs to be fully respected,\" said the document.\n\n\"They ought to organise themselves accordingly. They have to work together, in full respect of the Treaties and of their respective roles. Their work should be guided by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.\"\n\nMr Van Rompuy is known to share the Prime Minister's opposition to allowing MEPs to nominate candidates for the EU top jobs, a view also privately shared by Angela Merkel and the inclusion of the warning to the EU assembly not to overstep its mark will stiffen Downing Street's resolve in the battle against Mr Juncker.\n\nAs the chairman of meetings of EU leaders, Mr Van Rompuy is hoping that the paper can defuse the row over the appointment of Mr Juncker when it is discussed at a summit dinner in Ypres on Thursday night.\n\nGeorge Osborne, the Chancellor, accused European leaders of saying one thing in private and another in public, describing it as an \"odd phenomenon\" where different messages were coming out of other national capitals.\n\n\"I think privately a lot of European governments understand that the institutions of Europe need reform, that they are under huge pressure from their domestic populations to deliver stronger economies, more investment to Europe, that Europe needs to better connect as a union to the people on this continent,\" he said.\n\n\"I think this is quite widely understood among the European governments. Whether that plays out in the European councils over the next few days, we will see.\"\n\nThe Government will be relieved at the inclusion of language insisting that its is \"imperative not to create barriers between euro and non member states, while at the same time deepening the economic and monetary union\" but disappointed at the failure to mention treaty change.\n\nHowever, the Government will be concerned that the paper sets out proposals \"towards an energy union\" that will \"look at ways of making full use of the EU's collective bargaining power\", plans that would override sovereignty to negotiate gas or oil supply deals in the national interest.\n\nProposals to \"reduce early school drop outs\" and \"actions to improve educational outcomes\" will also be seen as the EU interfering in areas that are currently jealously guarded by national governments and ministers.\n\nAdditionally, Conservative backbenchers will be alarmed at proposals for greater \"police and judicial cooperation\" in a set of policy proposals that do not deliver Mr Cameron's strategy of \"powers flowing away from Brussels, not always to it\".\n\nWhile the priorities, designed to the European Commission’s agenda until 2019, do highlight already existing promises to cut \"unnecessary administrative burdens\" and to implement \"further improvement the quality of the EU decision making process\" there is no mention of a new settlement between national governments and Brussels.\n\n\"It is the same old, same old basically,\" said a diplomat.\n\nMats Persson, the director of the Open Europe think tank, described the proposals as \"under-whelming and unfocussed\".\n\n\"It confusingly mixes actions that should be taken at EU level with those that principally belong to member states, such as reducing early school drop outs. It also glosses over some key areas such as EU treaty change,\" he said.\n\n\"This document needs to be improved significantly if it is to be a solid base upon which to decide EU priorities over next few years.\"\n\nNigel Farage, the leader of Ukip, said: \"It's clear that EU leaders would rather humiliate Mr Cameron with their federalist wishlist and appointment of Juncker rather than kill him with kindness. He has been exposed as weak and inept - repatriation of powers to the UK is not going to happen.\"",

  "latent_31246": "Daily Events Featured Story\n\nWe just hobbled through another tax season. The excruciating excursion into the ridiculous thicket that is the roughly 75,000 page tax code.\n\nAll for the privilege of giving federal, state and local governments record amounts of our money.\n\nA 2011 study said we then wasted 6.1 billion hours preparing to pay our taxes – and that was when the tax code was a mere 72,536 pages.\n\nBuilt into these tens of thousands of pages are breaks and special exemptions galore. I am opposed to all of them.\n\nI don’t like social engineering via federal law – so I don’t like even very popular things like the child tax credit. I want my taxes lowered and easier to file – I don’t want to have to produce progeny to get there.\n\nTo that end I’d happily give up the home mortgage deduction (of which I only recently started availing myself).\n\nAnd lest we forget: the home mortgage deduction – combined with other horrendous laws and special exemptions, the Federal Reserve’s squelching of interest rates and the government uber-getting into the home lending business – is what caused the 2008 global economy meltdown.\n\nWhat government attempts to manage – government destroys.\n\nNot nearly all of the tax code carve outs even began benign. Many, MANY of the “loopholes” are written by Big Government proponents for Big Government cronies.\n\nNo one knows this better than the Democrats’ favorite billionaire – Warren Buffett.\n\nWhy do the Donkeys love him? In part because he talks a great Big Government game.\n\nThe Buffett Rule is part of a tax plan proposed by President Barack Obama in 2011. The tax plan would apply a minimum tax rate of 30 percent on individuals making more than a million dollars a year…. The Buffett Rule is named after American investor Warren Buffett, who publicly stated in early 2011 that he believed it was wrong that rich people, like himself, could pay less in federal taxes, as a portion of income, than the middle class, and voiced support for increased income taxes on the wealthy.\n\nExcept Buffett wants us to do as he says – not as he does.\n\n(I)n May (2014) Buffett said: “I will not pay a dime more of individual taxes than I owe, and I won’t pay a dime more of corporate taxes than we owe. And that’s very simple.”\n\nBuffett has the money to hire people to find every nook and cranny exemption in the 75,000 page tax code. And the money to hire government officials to further junk up the code to create even more exemptions specifically for him.\n\nWe the People do not. So as the code gets friendlier for the Buffetts of the world – it gets even uglier and more complicated for the rest of us.\n\nWashington, D.C. needs lots and LOTS of real, actual reform – the common denominator of all of it being Less Government.\n\nFlat Tax Makes 2016 Comeback\n\nThe purest form thereof would be the simplest – and fairest – tax code of all.\n\nA true flat rate tax is a system of taxation where one tax rate is applied to all income with no deductions.\n\nNo deductions means no special carveouts for the Buffetts – and no way for elected officials to write them in exchange for campaign cash.\n\nAnd what’s better than a simpler tax? No tax at all.\n\nThe Death Tax is government social engineering on stilts. Democrats don’t like people to have any money ever (save for the Buffett Rule crony exceptions).\n\nSo if after the government taxes everything throughout your entire life – from your income to your property to your purchases (and on, and on, and…) – you actually manage to accrue some coin, the government takes another 40% off the top when you die.\n\nThis is a part of the Donkeys’ “tax the rich” mindset and mantra. Except:\n\nFarmers Urge Repeal of Estate Tax They warned Thursday that unless it was abolished, agricultural producers in particular could be hit hard because of the soaring value of land the past few decades. Todd Wilkinson, president of the South Dakota Cattlemen’s Association and co-owner of a feedlot near De Smet, said the “death tax is a crushing blow that is facing all of us.” Wilkinson said if he or one of his brothers were to die they would be forced to pay a “big” estate tax. “I guess the point is I should just go out and blow the money, then my kids don’t have to worry about it. That’s the lesson we are learning in the (agriculture) sector,” Wilkinson said. “Just give us a break. Take this away. Don’t tax us out of business.”\n\nThe Law of Unintended Consequences.

My brother, 13, is probably biking around Cord Street, on which our house sits. I'm certain that all the potential witnesses to the devious act I'm contemplating are out of sight so I proceed to the medicine cabinet and pull out my dad's Barbasol shaving cream.\n\nAfter slathering it like frosting all over my face, I take the bristly end of my toothbrush in the palm of my hand and start \"fake-shaving,\" mimicking my dad's brusque hand strokes. It's exhilarating and satisfies me on a level too deep for words, but halfway through, my brother appears out of nowhere. \"What are you doing?\" he asks. He looks shocked—like he's just seen a monkey-manned vehicle drive by. \"Just messing around,\" I say, trying my best to make it seem like innocent fun. A smirk of contempt spreads across his face and he snort-laughs. \"Dude, you're weird,\" he says before sauntering off. I pray he doesn't tell our parents.

It lingers as I wash off my face, retreat to my bedroom, and realize that I'm only a boy in my mind.\n\n***\n\nCourtesy of Stephanie Fairyington\n\nOver the past few years, transgender issues have garnered bursts of positive attention in the media: In 2011, Chaz Bono, Cher's trans son, boogied his heart out in front of a cheering crowd on Dancing With the Stars; In early 2012, Glee portrayed its first transgender character; a year later, Netflix premiered its original series Orange is the New Black, featuring trans actress Laverne Cox. But nothing rivals Facebook's radical comment on the limitations of our binary gender system: In February, the social network added more than 50 gender options for how users can self-identify.\n\nRelated: Trans Translated: 'Boys Don't Cry' Director Kimberly Peirce On 20 Years of Queer Culture\n\nAnd yet, despite these inklings of progress, the discourse around transgenderism remains far more complicated than these milestones suggest.\n\nNothing seems to challenge people—destabilize them, really—as much as the idea that someone can reject his or her assigned sex and defy the limits of biology by transitioning from one to another. Take, for instance, Piers Morgan's blundering interview with trans author Janet Mock or Katie Couric's insensitive questions of trans actress Laverne Cox (about which Mock penned an impassioned essay for this very publication). By blurring the neat line between male and female, trans people force us to occupy the middle ground between two polarized extremes, and demand us to re-conceive our gendered assumptions.\n\nThe lively debates that ensued after Morgan and Couric's missteps showed what a vital cultural force trans people are. The unsteadying questions they evoke—Is that a man or a woman? How can you tell? What makes one a man or a woman? Who gets to decide? And so on—help us think with broader complexity and imagination.\n\nBut I admit, it took me a while to \"get it.\"\n\nCourtesy of Stephanie Fairyington\n\nEven though I'm a self-avowed lesbian feminist who appreciates all shades of queerness, I took the long road to trans acceptance, largely because of my own youthful gender ambiguities. From the moment my body began to defy my wish to \"grow up to be a boy,\" I fruitlessly challenged my unwanted maturation by peeing standing up (I'd literally straddle the toilet bowl between my legs), opting for Little League baseball with the guys over softball with the girls, and avoiding skirts and dresses with fierce resolve. But when I grew up to be a lesbian instead, I found myself expressing a disdain—similar to the one I witnessed in my brother's eyes when he caught me \"shaving\"—toward trans men.\n\nBecause there often seems to be so much crossover between the behaviors of lesbian tomboys and trans guys, my past, at first, clouded my ability to differentiate myself from them. Was I really trans after all? I wondered. Or were they really lesbians? I couldn't quite wrap my head around the idea that I might be trans, so I began to see their desire to morph into men as a manifestation of homophobia (an attempt to disavow their lesbianism) and sexism (a violent rejection of their femaleness). Changing their bodies in order to express the full range of masculinity went against everything I'd been taught as a feminist. Wouldn't real social progress aim to untether gender expression from sex? Why do you have to inhabit a male body in order to express maleness?\n\nRelated: A Closer Look at Women Who Leave Their Husband for Other Women\n\nCourtesy of Stephanie Fairyington\n\nIt was a conversation with New York magazine's Jesse Green, who wrote a brilliant cover story on the topic, that helped me to understand the difference between my gender nonconforming young self and trans kids. \"Trans youths experience an early onset identification with the opposite sex,\" Green explained, \"an unwavering persistence in feeling that they're in the wrongly sexed body and torment at the approach of adolescence.\"\n\nI realized that I had never felt tormented about my body (only disappointed) and that it didn't persist beyond my early teens.\n\nThe more trans people I meet, the more I realize how diverse and idiosyncratic each person's iteration of transness is. Some, like transwoman Janet Mock, contest the very notion that they ever belonged to the sex they were assigned at birth. Others pride themselves on the physical markings that show their journey from female-to-male or male-to-female and celebrate their queerness. And, obviously, plenty of trans men are gay and effeminate, which shows how limited my longstanding questions and beliefs were.\n\nLooking back, I think my desire to be a boy stemmed from the belief that it would allow me the privileges my older brother enjoyed—and from the (incorrect) assumption that in order to love women romantically, which I did, I must be male. Once I grew out of these misperceptions, I was ready to accept the body into which I was born. Boobs and all.\n\nPhotos: Courtesy of Stephanie Fairyington",
  "latent_32021": "The self-learning capabilities of a computer system with a dedicated support staff, enough processing power, and a large enough data set could probably overcome most difficulties with the video encoding itself. The actual exchange of information is likewise solved by the finite means which communication could be passed: there are only so many wavelengths of light, so many types of radiation, so many methods which can employed to pass information from one starship to another at reasonable speeds.\n\nA better question would be why all aliens have eyes, or have cameras, or have eyes and cameras that see in a comparable wavelength to our own. No computer could take raw video feed and translate it into colors the human eye can see if the proper wavelengths aren't in the feed. If encountering a species never seen before, which only sees in infrared, would they design a camera that sees outside of the infrared spectrum? If they didn't, then a Federation ship could only guess at what color the alien's skin is, etc.\n\nTaking the premise that these species want to communicate, it is a good bet they would indeed have cameras capable of \"seeing\" in many wavelengths. But if they don't have eyes, would they even build cameras in the first place? If they are warlike (Kazon, anyone?), why would they willingly show potential opponents anything which could be analyzed to find weaknesses?\n\nThere is the additional concern with all aliens having vocal cords- virtually every species encountered can make noises discernible to humans. A universal translator solves part of this dilemma, as it could filter unheard frequencies to what the human ear can hear and translate the language to English, but only if the alien species makes noise to communicate at all.\n\nAdditionally, very few sentient species are not humanoid in the Star Trek universe. This could only come about with planned evolution or seeding planets with common ancestors. I read something about the latter being used to explain the Star Trek universe, but this begs the question of why there are so many superficial differences between species but not radically different ones which could have evolved as well.\n\nAt some point, we must realize concessions were made to make Star Trek possible. Actors are humanoid, audiences relate better to visuals than floating voices without video and prefer sound in space despite how little sound can move in the near-void, etc etc. Still, fun to consider.",

(PTI)\n\nIf you don’t vote, then you have “no right” to question or blame the government, the Supreme Court has observed. The candid admission of an activist seeking a blanket order to remove encroachments in the country and saying he has never cast his vote, did not go down well with the apex court leading it to make the observation.\n\nObserving that the court cannot pass a sweeping order on encroachments in a matter involving all states, the bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar said “One can’t blame the government for everything. If a person does not cast his vote, then he has no right to question the government.”\n\nThe bench, which also comprised Justices N V Ramana and D Y Chandrachud, said it was not possible for it to look into encroachments sitting in Delhi and asked the petitioner to approach different High Courts wherever he saw such encroachments on roads or pavements.\n\nYou May Also Want To Watch:\n\nThe hard-hitting observation came when Dhanesh Ieshdhan, appearing in person for Delhi-based NGO ‘Voice of India’, said the governments do not do anything to remove encroachments and kept on insisting for a blanket order to remove them from across the country.\n\nThe bench asked Ieshdhan whether he has voted or not.\n\n“To be honest, I have never voted in my life,” Ieshdhan said candidly.\n\nThis irked the bench which said, “If you have not voted, then you have no right to question or blame the government”.\n\n“We do not have so much power to order a clean sweep of encroachments. If we pass any order, then contempt cases and other petitions will pile up. It’s not possible,” the bench said after the petitioner kept on seeking a blanket order.\n\n“If you do not move High Courts, we will feel that you are here for publicity,” the bench said and noted in the order that an open-ended direction to remove encroachments will not serve any purpose.\n\nIt granted liberty to the NGO to seek remedy state-wise before the High Courts.\n\nOn August 26 last year, the apex court, while hearing the plea, had said it cannot order the establishment of ‘Ram Rajya’ in the country and cannot do several things it wanted to due to its “limited capacity”.\n\n“Do you think with our directions, everything will be done? Do you (petitioner) think we will pass an order that there will be no corruption in the country and all corruption will go? Should we pass an order that there will be ‘Ram Rajya’ in the country? It cannot be like this,” the apex court had then observed.\n\nThe NGO had said that in 2014, the apex court had asked concerned authorities to deal with the issue raised it its plea.",
