REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nGRAPHIC: link.reuters.com/ram54t\n\nKEY POINTS: * Nonfarm payrolls increased by 203,000 new jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. The unemployment rate dropped three tenths of a percentage point to its lowest level since November 2008 as some federal workers who were counted as jobless in October returned to work after a 16-day partial shutdown of the government.\n\n* Job gains for September and October were revised to show 8,000 more jobs created than previously reported, lending strength to the report. Other details were also upbeat, with employment gains across the board, hourly earnings rising and the workweek lengthening.\n\nCOMMENTS:\n\nRICHARD FRANULOVICH, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, WESTPAC, NEW YORK:\n\n“A strong overall report, strong details as well. It keeps the December tapering risk alive from the Federal Reserve.”\n\nMICHAEL WOOLFOLK, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BNY MELLON, NEW YORK:\n\n“We feel this is consistent with material improvement as regards unemployment, however, we’ve seen no improvement yet in participation. The nonfarm payrolls number is probably not enough to persuade the Fed to taper in December. We still think the earliest they move is March. The unemployment rate dropping to 7 percent is good but the Fed is more focused on the participation rate picking up. Elsewhere, are focusing today on personal income and spending, too. Spending picked up, and that’s consistent with a better-than-expected holiday shopping season. We think this will feed a Santa Claus rally going into the end of the year.”\n\nSTEPHEN CUCCHIARO, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF WINDHAVEN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, BOSTON:\n\n“The stronger-than-expected employment report could increase speculation that the Federal Reserve will taper earlier than expected, perhaps as early as their next meeting on December 17-18 - which is why the markets have been correcting in the last few days. However, the Fed could point to falling inflationary expectations and increased fiscal uncertainty given the continued government gridlock as reasons to delay tapering. Because the market is pricing in some probability of a December taper, a taper delay could spark a year-end rally in stocks. We are still overweighting U.S. equities.”\n\nTOM PORCELLI, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK:\n\n“This was a constructive report overall and not so much because jobs gains were better than expected but mostly because wages improved quite nicely. That stands out as the more critical during this economic cycle than anything else in the report. Wages are strongly driving consumption in this cycle more than any other time. Overall wage gains were the most compelling news in this data.”\n\nERIC STEIN, CO-DIRECTOR, GLOBAL INCOME GROUP, EATON VANCE INVESTMENT MANAGERS, BOSTON:\n\n“It’s a very solid number, not only on the non-farm payrolls side, but with the unemployment rate falling by 0.3 percentage point and the labor force participation rate up. The U.S. labor market is still far from healed, but it certainly is moving in the right direction. This number puts a December taper on the table, but it isn’t a certainty.”\n\nMICHAEL MARRALE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, HEAD OF RESEARCH SALES AND TRADING AT ITG IN NEW YORK:\n\n“My view is show me inflation and I will show you tapering. I don’t think the Fed is in a big rush to do anything drastic in the absence of inflation. A few strong jobs numbers does not mean we are out of the woods. That said, we are in a very good spot and we can offset growth with tapering and we come out of this in one piece.\n\n“On a short term basis, it’s good news, good news gets sold, that’s just the way to trade stocks. But I don’t think we look back a month from now and say ‘wow that was a pivotal point in the market.’ The market has very strong footing here into year-end.”\n\nTHOMAS DI GALOMA, CO-HEAD OF FIXED INCOME RATES AT ED&F MAN CAPITAL, NEW YORK:\n\n“Very solid jobs data all around. Three percent 10-year yield here we come, but I don’t think a taper of the Fed’s purchases is in the cards for December.”\n\nOMER ESINER, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, COMMONWEALTH FOREIGN EXCHANGE, WASHINGTON D.C.:\n\n“The number looks pretty good to me as it not only beat expectations not only on the headline number but we saw a sharp drop in unemployment. The increase in labor force participation rate and importantly household survey showed a healthy rise in job creation. This keeps alive dwindling hope of Federal Reserve tapering this month. This report is a little more consistent with an improving jobs market and the dollar should get bit of a bid on this news.”\n\nMARKET REACTION:\n\nSTOCKS: U.S. stock index futures added to gains before pulling back\n\nBONDS: U.S. bond prices slipped, boosting yields\n\nFOREX: The dollar rose against the yen and euro",
  "latent_110": "Intel's new chip for smartphones handily beats some of the fastest phones on the market, according to chip review site Anandtech.\n\nIntel's Atom Z2460 \"Medfield\" delivers \"tablet-like scores\" on the BrowserMark benchmark, wrote Anand Shimpi. \"The Galaxy Nexus running ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich) comes close, but once again Intel expects that on the same OS Medfield should be faster than any of the currently available SoCs (system-on-a-chip),\" he said.\n\nIntel announced the Medfield chip Tuesday at CES. The system-on-a-chip will be used in upcoming smartphones--and presumably other devices--from Lenovo and Motorola.\n\nAnandtech\n\nAnandtech\n\nAnd it fared well on the SunSpider Javascript yardstick. \"Although running what appears to be a stock Gingerbread browser, Intel's Medfield reference platform posts SunSpider performance better than any other smartphone we've tested - including the Galaxy Nexus running Ice Cream Sandwich,\" Shimpi wrote.\n\nThe chip should deliver similar numbers on Ice Cream Sandwich. \"Intel promises that Medfield's performance will scale on ICS as well - [so] the gap should be maintained.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Shimpi cautioned that the performance gap may shrink when new phones emerge based on the latest ARM Cortex A15 design. \"It's probably safe to assume that things will be different with the Cortex A15,\" he wrote.\n\nNote that all benchmarks are preliminary because this is an Intel reference design phone (which Intel is showing off on the CES floor) not a commercially available phone.\n\nBrooke Crothers\n\nSo, what's different this time around for Intel and smartphones? \"Intel has been talking about getting into smartphones for a couple of years now, but thus far it hasn't been able to secure a single design or partnership that resulted in a product actually coming to market,\" Shimpi wrote.\n\nWhich, of course, is true. Intel announced a few years back that LG would bring out an Atom-based smartphone. Never happened. Nor did Nokia ultimately bring out a phone based on Intel's Moblin Linux platform.\n\n\"This time around, things are different. The major change? Focus, and Google,\" according to Shimpi. \"Intel has ramped up the software engineering engine, going into the Android source code (Gingerbread, Honeycomb and now ICS) and fixing bugs. Intel's goal is to deliver the most stable version of Android as a result of its efforts,\" he wrote.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nJune 17, 2017, 5:03 PM GMT / Updated June 19, 2017, 12:06 AM GMT By Chiara A Sottile and Jo Ling Kent\n\nMore than ever, we are shopping with a scroll and a click online instead of in our local brick-and-mortar stores. Lucrative same-day shipping deals and the convenience of shopping from home have propelled the growth of e-commerce: up nearly 25 percent last year, according to an analysis by Slice Intelligence.\n\nBut our online cravings have cardboard consequences. From boots to bananas, meal kits to makeup, we receive so many packages it's actually changing the very color of material collected at our recycling facilities.\n\n\"It used to be grayish, like the color of newspapers and magazines. And now it's more brown or cardboard in color, from all these boxes,\" said spokesman Robert Reed from San Francisco's recycling hauler, Recology.\n\n\"People are ordering a lot more things online, and they arrive in small- and medium-sized cardboard boxes, and so you can see it right here,\" Reed told NBC's Jo Ling Kent, standing beside the plant's massive pile of cardboard, hard plastics, paper, and bottles.\n\nOur Homes Are Generating More Waste\n\nEvery day, Recology collects approximately 625 tons of recyclables, including more than 100 tons of cardboard at their \"Recycle Central\" plant on San Francisco's Pier 96.\n\nAnd instead of that cardboard coming from retail and grocery stores, increasingly the boom of brown boxes comes from apartment buildings and homes.\n\n\"It's a pretty significant change. We see these changes pretty regularly in the recycling stream. But this is a big one,\" said Reed. While the amount of cardboard they receive is similar to previous years, there are far more of them and they're smaller in size.\n\nMany in the recycling business say that as consumers receive more products directly, they recycle less and throw away more — in part because of confusion over what is recyclable. According to a report from Moore Recycling Associates, in 2015, consumers recycled less than 7 percent of all plastic films and wraps. And, in 2013, the average recycling rate of all packaging (excluding compost) was less than 25 percent, according to Resource Recycling Systems.\n\nRobert Reed of San Francisco's Recology surveys a pile of mainly cardboard waste, with NBC's Jo Ling Kent. Chiara Sottile for NBC News\n\n\"We're very concerned that right now maybe this shift in disposal rates is due in part to the fact that people are going for convenience and having things mailed directly to them instead of going to stores,\" said Heidi Sanborn of the California Product Stewardship Council.\n\nCompanies and Consumers Need to Make the Fix\n\nSanborn is calling on the companies shipping these packages as well as the consumer to help make a change.\n\n\"We'd ask that the companies who are mail-order companies work on reducing their packaging waste,\" said Sanborn in an interview. \"But we're also asking the consumers to be thoughtful and to tell companies, 'Hey, I don't want all this waste. I want to buy products that are in reduced packaging, or reusable packaging.'\"\n\nWith the growing popularity of on-demand delivery and meal kit services like Blue Apron and HelloFresh, non-recyclable packaging is making its way to the recycling center.\n\n\"We're seeing an increase in waste generation and we're seeing more products coming on to the market that we can't do anything with. For example, those ice packs that are in those mail kits,\" said Sanborn.\n\nWhile Blue Apron maintains on their website that their \"box, liners, ice packs and more\" are recyclable, many recycling authorities dispute this. The plastic liners that accompany many individual food items in Blue Apron deliveries cannot be returned in many curbside pickup programs, nor can the ice packs or the foil lining of the box. Blue Apron declined to comment for this story, citing their quiet period before their initial public offering.\n\nBlue Apron subscriber Jessica Gelin of Oakland, California, loves the convenience of Blue Apron and lauds the quality of their food.\n\n\"I enjoy Blue Apron, I think it's great,\" she said with a laugh. \"I think it's getting better all the time. And as it grows in popularity, I think smart people, who like to use it, will demand a little bit better environmental packaging. And I believe it exists out there. It's just expensive,\" said Gelin, suggesting compostable bags instead of plastic ones.\n\n\"My biggest problem with Blue Apron is the ice packs,\" said Gelin, who tries to ship the packs back to Blue Apron as their website recommends, but worries what's in them. The maker of the \"Nordic Ice\" packs confirmed to NBC News that the contents of the packs are not recyclable and that the plastic can only be recycled where low-density plastic is accepted – often not curbside.\n\nRecology is asking its customers for help processing all these new sources of waste, and to do their homework about what can really be tossed in their recycling bins. And, Reed is pleading with customers to break down their cardboard boxes before putting them out for collection to save space in bins and collection trucks.\n\nHow much of this is yours? Chiara Sottile for NBC News\n\nRecyling Redux\n\nIt's not just San Francisco noticing a change. In Austin, Texas, the city has already received 30 percent more corrugated cardboard than this time last year.\n\n\"We've had to do some modificiations to the plant here, so we can recycle these cardboard boxes,\" said Reed, referring to new machinery that can sort cardboard from other material the plant receives. \"Now we have machines that'll sort them.\"\n\nThe new machines are one reason why Recology is seeking a collection rate increase in San Francisco to the tune of about 14 percent.\n\nBack at Recology's recycling plant, the cardboard consequences of our online shopping are all around — with the familiar logos of online retailers peeking out from compacted cubes. The Amazon Prime logo, with its smiling arrow, made repeat appearances. And it's no wonder: More than 40 percent of all online retails sales in the U.S. went through Amazon last year, according to Slice Intelligence.\n\nReed says all this \"trash of convenience\" shows a cultural shift to instantly gratifying online purchases instead of buying in person at local stores.\n\n\"We need to think about the environment in all things we do. You know, the earth is our home and we need to protect that, and it is a very precious resource,\" said Reed. \"We want to recycle everything we can.\"",

  "latent_232": "It all started with a question I asked my mother one December evening. “Ma, why don’t we celebrate Christmas and decorate our house with mistletoes and Christmas trees?” I was five then, and that was when my childhood religious indoctrination started. Never did I predict that I was about to go on a long, mental and emotional roller-coaster by just asking that question. “We are Muslims. We don’t worship Jesus, we worship Allah.” The very next day, my mother brought me to our local library and bookstore, and introduced me to Islamic books. From as young as three, I was able to recite from memory the 5 Kalimahs and a few short surahs (chapters) from the Quran, even though I had the faintest idea what they mean. I was told Islamic stories about the various prophets and messengers, particularly stories about the life of Muhammad, in bed time. This is the tender age where I accepted everything my parents and family elders said without and question. Like any other child, I never thought that they could be wrong.\n\nThroughout elementary school, I was not a devout Muslim. I didn’t give much thought or attention to the religion. I ensured that I adhered to the 5 pillars of Islam, but I didn’t bother going any further than that. My parents ensured that I prayed, kept my fast and learned how to read the Qur’an. I started praying when I was 9 and I first wore the hijab when I was 11. In fact, my parents were reluctant to let me wear the hijab at such a young age and I had to beg and insist that I do my duty. I was so excited when they finally agreed! I could finally wear my hijab like my mother and the rest of my aunts.\n\nI was in high school when fundamentalism crept into my thoughts. I vividly recall the day when my friend, who was an Ustazah (teacher) at a Sunday Madarasah, started to talk to me about the Day of Judgement. As we were leaving the mosque after offering our Asar prayers, she described all the signs of that so-called “Last Day” and explained about Heaven and Hell. This was the first time I had given a lot of attention to it. Believing in an afterlife is one of the six pillars of faith of Islam. As she described the brutality of Hell and its punishments, terror gripped my heart and I was filled with guilt and remorse. Although I did adhere to Islam, I was very careless and lenient about it. I thought that I have earned the wrath of Allah and that I was going to be one of the inmates of Hell. I had so little time left to seek tawbah (repentance for sins) and prepare for the afterlife. I was literally shivering with fright on my way back home that day.\n\nFrom then on, I made conscious effort to perfect my deen (religion), iman (faith) and ihsan (excellence of faith). I memorized and learnt the various surahs, duas and hadiths by heart. I made effort to pray all the prayers on time. I also started praying extra, non obligatory prayers, specifically the Tahajjud. I was very conscious about the presence of Allah every moment of my life. I feared and revered him. As time progressed, I grew love and fondness for Allah, his messenger Muhammad, and Islam. My passion pushed me to be involved in numerous projects and activities that gave me new experience. I became an ustazah at a madrasah, where I taught Islam to children aged 4 to 9 years old. I took part in many Islamic competitions and I would usually clinch the first few prizes. I excelled at Quran memorization and Quran recitation. But even as a staunch Muslim, I had a spark of humanism in me. I couldn’t bear to watch the entire world going to hell and so, I was determined to convert everyone to Islam. So I took part in many Dawah programmes, and I would seek to clarify all the misunderstanding people had about Islam and I sought to paint a more positive and peaceful image of Islam. This often entailed my throwing the blame on the ‘Kaffir’ West or the Jews while absolving Muslims of all the blame. This was the time where I got political by getting myself into a tangle of conspiracy theories. 9/11 was an inside job and thus, Muslims are not at fault. The Jews and Zionists are inherently evil and subhuman, and thus, they are the enemies of Islam. The Illuminati wants to destroy Islam and thus, we need to wage a full-fledged jihad to protect Islam. I never ever thought that the problem could stem from religion itself because from young, I was taught to never criticize or question the system. In my view, the world was divided into Muslims and Non-Muslims, and Muslims were superior because they had the true and correct way of life.\n\nI went into science stream in my senior years, and that was when I started reading up on creation science – how every ‘creation’ is a testimony of God’s greatness and how every riddle in the universe is a sign of God’s wisdom and man’s weakness to comprehend. Even though the Theory of Evolution was taught extensively in my school, I completely ignored it. Instead, I would listen to the Islamic theologians debunking evolution and reasserting the validity of creation science. I hadn’t the faintest idea what evolution was about and yet, I had a preconceived notion that anything that goes against god must automatically be false. Again, this was due to my upbringing where everything about must be accepted without any criticism. Only the clergymen were allowed to analyse the religion, because they have some special knowledge that the “common people” don’t.\n\nAfter completing high school, I had a long break and I had so much time in my hands. As a good Muslim girl, I decided to learn more about Islam, namely the Fiqh (Islamic jurisdiction) and more importantly, the central message of Islam. I read many books and talked to various scholars. I also joined Muslim women support groups, attended camps, read and researched on the religion. And for the first time in my life, I found myself reading the English translations of the Quran. It all went well at first, until a Muslim woman posted an Islamic article about why women have to give in to their husband’s sexual whims as and when they demand it. The article quoted Quranic verses and Hadith to justify this. I couldn’t take that. That is marital rape! I was puzzled, but I continued to research further. Later on, I attended a sermon where the Imam was talking about female subservience to her husband. He too, quoted Quran and Hadith to substantiate his points. I read the Quran again with the open eyes. That was when I saw the sexism in the religion. I saw ayats (verses) propogating violence against women, rape apologia, male privilege, and the stripping away of women’s body autonomy and choice. I researched high and low for a good explanation because I couldn’t handle the misogyny. It was blatant. There was absolutely no use of circumventing the translations of the various Qur’anic and Hadith texts as I understood the Arabic meaning itself. None of the Islamic scholars or friends or women or people could give me a good answer.\n\nThat left me sleepless for nights. I would literally cry every day because I was at a complete loss. In all this doubt and confusion, my list of burning questions increased everyday. How can the god I love so dearly have very little respect for me just because I have a vagina? Why is it that men don’t have to cover their faces? Why is it that men can take part in public life while women are relegated to the confines of home? Why can men take multiple wives, but women can’t take multiple husbands or even initiate divorce? Why is it that men get virgins in heaven while women are confined to their husbands only? Why is male sexuality celebrated while female sexuality is degraded? I couldn’t lose my passion for this religion, but at the same time, I could not compromise my respect towards women and girls. I did not want to be a gender traitor.\n\nTo solve this dilemma, I set out to find other plausible interpretations of Islam that could support my world view, and so I left the Sunni school of thought and became a Quranist. Quranism is a branch of Islam that relies solely on the Quran and rejects other texts, especially the Hadith. There are many variations within Quranism. I was part of the Aastana group, who believe that “the moral code contained within the Quran correlates to the workings of a socio-economic system that provides nourishment and security to a society that implement its laws. The Quran is a practical guide, which is beneficial for all; a form of governance to protect mankind in all matters and standards of life.” At that time, Quranism seemed to be the most authentic source of Islam to me because I found many contradictions within Hadith and other narratives. Quranism stems from the premise that Quran is perfect, accurate and authentic in its entirety. This claim later became dubious to me as I found multiple contradictions within the Quranic texts. Moreover, I feel that Quranism heavily relies on conspiracy theories. With so many differing viewpoints and very little methods to verify the information presented within the circle of Quranists, it gets very frustrating because you find it difficult to differentiate truth from lies.\n\nAs I continued to research on religion and philosophy, I finally found an ideology that perfectly suited my worldview, and that is humanism, the idea that humans are capable of much more than that of what is “divinely sanctioned” by other ideologies. My god centred image of the world gave way to human centred concepts. I learned to love and celebrate the achievements of humanity, and to work towards the betterment of humanity. This is why I take pride in calling myself a humanist and a human rights advocate. I developed an interest in classical philosophy, in antiquity, in literature and of course, science. I learned to value people above ideas, humanity before ideologies. My world expanded. I finally tasted the breath of fresh air as the mental shackles were lifted and my mind could wander without fear of punishment.\n\nMy mother and father are both active participants and activists in and for the Islamic community. My mother teaches in a local Sunday school that I used to teach when I was a Muslim, while my father is a member of a Muslim Majlis (committee) that organizes sermons and activities for Muslims. Some of my uncles are loud, active Islamism ‘activists’, and they remind me of Zakir Naik and Hamza Tzortzis. They would go on missionary trips to various countries, especially South Asian countries, to evangelize Islam as well as Islamism. Although I share the same blood and flesh, my ideas are very different from theirs. I stand and fight to protect what my family members attempt to destroy in the name of moral righteousness. Although I am not physically free yet, since I am in the closet, I have reached the first milestone towards freedom, and that is mental freedom. I can think for myself without having to depend on so-called ‘scholars’ or Imams. In my mind, I can explore more thoughts and ideas, something my family would never dare to do. I know what it is to own my body and my thoughts, something the other women in my family have never had the privilege to have. I can proudly say that I am the first apostate in the entire generations of fundamentalists and so that makes me a little rebel in my own right.\n\n[Follow me on Twitter @ChistaPantea]",
  "latent_425": "Shouldn’t we all be concerned over Russian interference?\n\nIt is jarring to see pro-Trump conservatives indifferent or even hostile to investigations of Russian intervention in the 2016 campaign. Just a few years ago (it feels like an eternity), conservatives were jumping all over President Obama for his Russian “reset” and his first-term eagerness to negotiate with Moscow.\n\nEven further back, conservatives hailed Ronald Reagan’s description of the Soviet Union as “an evil empire.” Reagan ran a brilliant ad during his 1984 re-election bid that showed a bear roaming through the woods. Without mentioning the words “Russia” or “Soviet Union,” an announcer intoned:\n\n“There is a bear in the woods. For some people, the bear is easy to see. Others don’t see it at all. Some people say the bear is tame. Others say it’s vicious and dangerous. Since no one can really be sure who’s right, isn’t it smart to be as strong as the bear? If there is a bear.”\n\nThe drift on the right toward Vladimir Putin is remarkable. An Economist/YouGov poll in December found that while only 9 percent of Trump voters had a favorable view of Obama, 35 percent had a favorable view of Putin. In February, Gallup reported that the proportion of Republicans viewing Putin favorably rose from 12 percent in 2015 to 32 percent this year.\n\nNot surprisingly, given what Putin did to defeat Hillary Clinton, his favorability among Democrats dropped, from 15 percent in 2015 to 10 percent now. But note how unpopular Putin was with Democrats in both surveys. What’s striking is that a 3-point gap between the two parties in 2015 is now at 22 points.\n\nIt’s true that Moscow’s intervention in Western politics goes back a long way. Throughout the Cold War, the Soviets gave strong support to communist parties around the world.\n\nPutin, of course, will lend support to any political movement — right or left, separatist or nationalist — that disrupts the West. But he seems especially interested in creating a new international political alliance focused on conservatives and the far right.\n\nHe is casting himself as a strong supporter of religion and conservative values, and as an opponent of gay rights. Late last month, Putin staged a highly public audience in Moscow with Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate in this spring’s presidential election in France. Of course Putin denied he was trying to influence French voters.\n\nPutin is active in the U.S., too. In a recent Time magazine article titled “Moscow Cozies Up to the Right,” Alex Altman and Elizabeth Dias reported on Russia’s efforts to build ties with America’s Christian conservatives and the gun lobby.\n\nThese days, any liberal who raises alarms about Trump’s relationship with Russia confronts charges of McCarthyism, hysteria and hypocrisy. The inclination of many on the left to assail Putin is often ascribed to partisan anger over his success in undermining Clinton’s candidacy.\n\nThere’s no doubt that liberals are angry, but ask yourself: Shouldn’t everyone, left, right and center, be furious over Russia’s efforts to inject calumny and falsehood into the American political bloodstream?\n\nAs last week’s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing revealed, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of Trump’s 2016 primary opponents, was also targeted by Russia. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., is right that Russia is trying to spread fear among American politicians in both parties that if they dare criticize Putin’s regime, as Clinton did when she was secretary of state, they risk being attacked in the same way she was.\n\nMoreover, the problem with McCarthyism was not that it was directed against a totalitarian regime. Liberals, social democrats and democratic socialists were overwhelmingly anti-Soviet, too. McCarthyism was about lies and false charges — often against those on the left who were actually opposed to the Soviet Union. Doesn’t that sound a bit like the fake news stories aimed at Clinton?\n\nIt is not in the least hysterical to wonder about the behavior of Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who was once paid by Putin’s propaganda network Russia Today. It is not McCarthyite to ask why Trump has spoken with such warmth about a Russian autocrat or taken so many positions (on NATO and the European Union, for example) that can be fairly seen as more in line with Russia’s interests than our own.\n\nAnd as Clint Watts of the Foreign Policy Research Institute told the Senate, Trump’s choice to “parrot” Russian-inspired conspiracy theories against Clinton made Putin’s disinformation campaign all the more effective.\n\nYes, there is a bear, and we need to know what it has done to our democracy.\n\nE.J.

  "latent_471": "1\n\nA las 8:00 de la mañana de este martes el Inegi da a conocer la cifra de crecimiento del PIB durante 2015, cuando revele los datos del último trimestre.\n\nHace alrededor de un mes, por primera vez en su historia, el Instituto adelantó una estimación preliminar que apuntó 2.5 por ciento de crecimiento en 2015.\n\nLa información que ha surgido desde entonces confirma que es altamente probable que esa sea la cifra, a lo sumo, con alguna variación de una décima de punto porcentual (2.4 a 2.6 por ciento).\n\nQuizás cuando lea este texto, el dato oficial ya se conozca. ¿Qué nos dice?\n\n1.– Que no estamos bien… pero no estamos tan mal.\n\nLa institución multilateral que de manera más próxima (la semana pasada) ha actualizado sus estimaciones de crecimiento económico en el mundo es la OCDE. De acuerdo con el organismo, el PIB mundial crecerá en 3.0 por ciento este año. Entre las grandes economías, la que crecerá más será India con 7.4 por ciento, seguida por China con 6.5 por ciento (aunque China se desacelera). En el otro extremo está Brasil con una caída de –4.0 por ciento.\n\nEl 2.5 (o aproximado) de México está ligeramente por abajo del promedio mundial. No debe satisfacernos ni de lejos. Pero en el contexto mundial no es malo. Hay quien dice que lo único que nos debe importar es el resultado en México sin tomar en cuenta el entorno mundial. No estoy de acuerdo. Creo que ese voluntarismo no cabe en una economía como la nuestra, que, lo queramos o no, va a estar afectada por lo que ocurre en el exterior. Y de hecho, por esa misma razón será inevitable que el crecimiento de este año sea inferior al de 2015.\n\n2.– El sector terciario de la economía fue el motor en 2015.\n\nSi no hay sorpresas en las cifras, en el gran promedio de 2.5 por ciento para el PIB, el sector comercio y servicios habrá crecido a una tasa promedio de 3.2 por ciento. En la medida que este sector representa el 61 por ciento del PIB, su crecimiento habrá explicado aproximadamente 1.9 puntos porcentuales del aumento global. En otras palabras, alrededor de 77 por ciento del crecimiento habrá dependido fundamentalmente de actividades relacionadas con el mercado interno.\n\n3.– Sin los efectos de la caída de precio y volumen de la actividad petrolera, creceríamos casi 3.0 por ciento.\n\nEl PIB de actividad petrolera probablemente cayó en algo así como 6.0 por ciento el año pasado.

  "latent_633": "Before The Prescription, Ask About Your Doctor's Finances\n\nEnlarge this image Katherine Streeter for NPR Katherine Streeter for NPR\n\nLast month, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology issued new guidelines that could double the number of people taking cholesterol-lowering drugs.\n\nThe organizations receive financial support from drug companies, and many of the experts who worked on the guidelines have industry ties.\n\nThe groups' response to ethical concerns raised about the advice is, in large measure, that a final decision about what you should do to manage your health is between you and your doctor.\n\nUnfortunately, doctors have biases, too. A 2007 study in The New England Journal of Medicine found that the vast majority of doctors have some kind of relationship with with a pharmaceutical or medical-device company. Most of the time, the ties involved free food or drug samples. Dozens of studies have demonstrated that even innocuous-seeming inducements like these can influence doctors' prescription practices.\n\nWhile doctors are required to disclose potential financial conflicts to each other at scientific conferences, they don't have to disclose them to their patients.\n\nAs a result, 4 in 5 patients say they are unaware of their doctors' financial incentives. Those who do know often find out inadvertently.\n\nWhen my mother discovered that her oncologist was being paid tens of thousands of dollars to speak about a cancer drug — the same one that he had put her on — she became upset, confused and scared. Every time he recommended a medication or a procedure, she wondered whether he was picking a treatment because it was right for her, or because he got paid to do it.\n\nAt the dawn of managed care, worried patients wanted to know whether their doctor was getting paid more to do less. Now, as many doctors' salaries depend on how many procedures they perform, patients want to know whether their doctor is paid more to do more.\n\nInformed consent isn't complete without doctors' disclosure of how their personal incentives align with their recommendations.\n\nOver the last two years, I have traveled to more than 50 cities and spoken with more than 200 groups of people about what they want from their health care. Two consistent themes emerged. First, people view the relationship with their doctor as the most fundamental part of medical care. Second, people want to make an informed choice when selecting their doctor.\n\nAn Australian study found that most people expressed strong interest in understanding doctors' financial incentives, and more than 80 percent said that they would have more confidence in their doctor's decisions if they were aware of potential competing interests.\n\nIn the debates surrounding the Affordable Care Act, everyone seems to agree that trust and choice are paramount. After all, illness is a time of extreme vulnerability. It takes enormous trust to confide in someone; then, to trust their recommendations, you need to be sure that this person has your best interests at heart. Transparency about compensation is a small, but critical step, towards establishing that trust.\n\nAlthough there have been some efforts by hospitals to encourage transparency, the Association of American Medical Colleges estimates that less than 1 percent of all academic medical centers have an official policy on disclosing physicians' conflicts to patients.\n\nProPublica maintains a Dollars for Docs database that consumers can consult. And the Affordable Care Act includes a provision that would publicize payments by drug company to doctors by late 2014. But neither of these addresses other potential conflicts, such as the payments doctors receive for particular procedures.\n\nA few doctors, and I'm one of them, are beginning to post information about how we earn our money on a public website and to discuss the financial issues with our patients.\n\nWe voluntarily disclose potential conflicts and incentives, explain how we are paid, and describe our philosophy of practice regarding other issues, including preventive health, shared decision-making, and end-of-life choices. We believe this can help our patients understand who we are and how this may affect their care.\n\nOther doctors have questioned whether this quest for transparency would undermine the doctor-patient relationship. Yet, research has shown that transparency leads to openness, improved relationships and increased trust. One study found that a single letter sent by regular mail that explained physician compensation enhanced patient loyalty; several have demonstrated that openness improved patient-physician communication and patient adherence to treatment recommendations.\n\nThere are other critics who say that patients won't know what to do with information on financial disclosures. This paternalistic view of medicine needs to become a relic of the past. It should be up to patients to decide what is relevant to them when choosing a doctor and whether to follow that doctor's recommendation.\n\nTo be sure, the business of health care is complex and evolving. Every doctor needs to decide for himself or herself how to explain financial compensation to patients, and how this ties into other important measures, including cost, access and quality.\n\nPatients, too, need to ask their doctors—not just about what new guidelines mean, but what may be affecting their doctors' interpretation of them. Talks like those are difficult, but all the debate about changes to the health care system is incomplete without financial transparency for those who deliver medical care.\n\nDr. Wen is an attending physician and director of patient-centered care research in the Department of Emergency Medicine at George Washington University. She is the author of \"When Doctors Don't Listen: How to Avoid Misdiagnoses and Unnecessary Care,\" and founder of Who's My Doctor, a project to encourage transparency in medicine.",

  "latent_967": "As we mentioned back on Monday, NVIDIA was going to be making some kind of GeForce announcement this evening at the NVIDA Gaming Festival 2012 in Shanghai, China. NVIDIA’s CEO Jen-Hsun Huang has just finished his speech, announcing NVIDIA’s next ultra-premium video card, the GeForce GTX 690.\n\nLaunching later this week, the GeForce GTX 690 will be NVIDIA’s new dual-GPU flagship video card, complementing their existing single-GPU GeForce GTX 680. Equipped with a pair of fully enabled GK104 GPUs, NVIDIA is shooting for GTX 680 SLI performance on a single card, and with GTX 690 they just might get there. We won’t be publishing our review until Thursday, but in the meantime let’s take a look at what we know so far about the GTX 690.\n\nGTX 690 GTX 680 GTX 590 GTX 580 Stream Processors 2 x 1536 1536 2 x 512 512 Texture Units 2 x 128 128 2 x 64 64 ROPs 2 x 32 32 2 x 48 48 Core Clock 915MHz 1006MHz 607MHz 772MHz Shader Clock N/A N/A 1214MHz 1544MHz Boost Clock 1019MHz 1058MHz N/A N/A Memory Clock 6.008GHz GDDR5 6.008GHz GDDR5 3.414GHz GDDR5 4.008GHz GDDR5 Memory Bus Width 2 x 256-bit 256-bit 2 x 384-bit 384-bit VRAM 2 x 2GB 2GB 2 x 1.5GB 1.5GB FP64 1/24 FP32 1/24 FP32 1/8 FP32 1/8 FP32 TDP 300W 195W 375W 244W Transistor Count 2 x 3.5B 3.5B 2 x 3B 3B Manufacturing Process TSMC 28nm TSMC 28nm TSMC 40nm TSMC 40nm Launch Price $999 $499 $699 $499\n\nFirst and foremost, the GTX 690 won’t be launching until this Thursday (May 3rd), and while we won’t be able to publish our review until then NVIDIA has provided a bounty of information on the GTX 690 ahead of the formal launch. Specs wise – and something they’re trying to make clear from the start – unlike what they did with the GTX 590 NVIDIA is targeting close to full GTX 680 SLI performance here. As GK104 is a much smaller and less power hungry GPU from the get-go, NVIDIA doesn’t have to do nearly as much binning in order to get suitable chips to keep their power consumption in check. With GTX 690 NVIDIA will be able to reach their target TDP of 300W with all functional units enabled and with clockspeeds above 900MHz, which means performance should indeed be much closer to the GTX 680 in SLI than the GTX 590 was to its SLI counterparts.\n\nAltogether, for the GTX 690 we’re looking at a pair of fully enabled GK104 GPUs (1536 CUDA cores) clocked at 915MHz, paired with 4GB of 6GHz GDDR5 (2GB per GPU) all on a single card. The GPU boost target will be 1019MHz, though until we have a chance to review the card it’s hard to say what the average clockspeeds will be in most games. Taken altogether, this means the GTX 690 should be able to reach at least 91% of the GTX 680 SLI’s performance and probably closer to 95% depending on where GPU boost tops out.\n\nAs for power consumption, NVIDIA is designing the GTX 690 around a 300W TDP, with a typical board power (and default power target) of 263W. Compared to the 375W TDP GTX 590 this will allow the card to be used in more power/cooling limited computers, something NVIDIA lost going from the GTX 295 to the GTX 590. The tradeoff of course being that clockspeeds had to be lowered compared to GTX 680 to pull this off, which is why even with a more liberal GPU boost both the base and boost clocks are slightly below the GTX 680. As always NVIDIA is going to be doing some binning here to snag the best GK104 GPUs for the GTX 690, which is the other factor in bringing down power consumption versus the 2x195W GTX 680 SLI.\n\nWith that said, similar to what AMD did with their dual-GPU Radeon HD 5970 and 6990 NVIDIA is in practice targeting two power/performance levels with the GTX 690: a standard performance level and a higher performance level for overclockers. On the hardware side of things the card itself is equipped with 2 8-pin PCIe power sockets, enabling the card to safely draw up to 375W, 75W over its standard 300W TDP. Delivering that power will be 10 power phases (5 per GPU), so the GTX 690 will have power delivery capabilities nearly identical to the GTX 680.\n\nMeanwhile on the software side the GTX 690 will have an adjustable power target and clock offsets just like the GTX 680. NVIDIA is giving the GTX 690 a max power target of +35%, which given the card’s default power target of 263W means it can be set to draw up to 355W. Until we have a chance to review the card it’s not clear just how many bins higher than the boost clock GPU boost can go, but even if the GTX 690 was unable to quite catch the GTX 680 SLI at standard settings the combination of a higher power target and a core clock offset should be more than enough to make sure it can be overclocked to GTX 680 specs. On paper at least some further overclocking should even be possible, as standard power target for GTX 680 is 170W; so 2x170W for GTX 680 SLI means that all else held equal, there’s still at least 15W of additional headroom to play with.\n\nSpeaking of specifications and performance, for those of you are curious about PCIe bridging NVIDIA has finally moved away from NF200 in favor of a 3rd party bridge chip. With the GTX 590 and earlier dual-GPU cards NVIDIA used their NF200 bridge, which was a PCIe 2.0 capable bridge chip designed by NVIDIA’s chipset group. However as NVIDIA no longer has a chipset group they also no longer have a group to design such chips, and with NF200 now outdated in the face of PCIe 3.0, NVIDIA has turned to PLX to provide a PCI 3.0 bridge chip.\n\nAs for the card’s construction, while we don’t have the complete specifications on hand we know that the basic design of the GTX 690 is very similar to the GTX 590. This means it will have a single axial fan sitting at the center of the card, with a GPU and its RAM at either side. Heat from one GPU goes out the rear of the card, while the heat from the other GPU goes out the front. Heat transfer will once again be provided by a pair of nickel tipped aluminum heatsinks attached to vapor chambers, which also marks the first time we’ve seen a vapor chamber used with a 600 series card.\n\nNVIDIA tells us that they’ve done some further work here to minimize noise by tweaking their fan ducting to reduce obstructions – primarily by eliminating variations in baseplate height that had previously been necessary to accommodate the GPUs – and are claiming that the GTX 690 should be notably quieter than the GTX 680 SLI. The GTX 590 was already a small bit quieter than the GTX 580 SLI, so given the quieter nature of the GTX 680 SLI this is something we’ll be paying particular attention to.\n\nElsewhere, compared to the GTX 590 the biggest change most buyers will likely notice is that NVIDIA has replaced the shrouding material. NVIDIA has replaced the GTX 590’s plastic shroud with a metal shroud, specifically a mixture of cast aluminum parts and injection molded magnesium parts. Ostensibly the use of metals as opposed to plastic further reduces noise, but along with the polycarbonate windows over the heatsinks I suspect this was largely done to further reinforce its ultra-premium nature and to make the card look more lavish.\n\nMeanwhile when it comes to display connectivity NVIDIA is using the same 3x DL-DVI and 1x miniDP port configuration that we saw on the GTX 590. This allows NVIDIA to drive 3 3D Vision monitors over DL-DVI – the first DisplayPort enabled 3D Vision monitors just started shipping – with the tradeoff being reduced external ventilation.\n\nFinally, we have the matter of pricing and availability. In typical NVIDIA fashion, NVIDIA has given us the pricing at the last moment. The MSRP on the GTX 690 will be $999, exactly double the price of the GTX 680. Given what we know of the specs of the GTX 690 this doesn’t come as any great surprise, as NVIDIA has little incentive to price it significantly below a pair of GTX 680 cards ($1000) since performance will be within 10%, particularly since AMD’s own dual GPU card has yet to launch. This makes the GTX 690 the most expensive GeForce ever, eclipsing even 2007’s $830 GeForce 8800 Ultra.\n\nAvailability will also be a significant issue. As it stands NVIDIA cannot keep the GTX 680 in stock in North America, and while the GTX 690 may be a very low volume part it requires 2 binned GPUs, which are going to be even harder to get. We’ll know more on Thursday, but as it stands this will probably be the lowest volume ultra-performance card launch in years. While I have no doubt that NVIDIA can produce these cards in sufficient volume when they have plenty of GPUs, until TSMC’s capacity improves NVIDIA has no chance of meeting the demand for GK104 GPUs, and that bodes very poorly for GTX 690. Consequently while this technically won’t be a paper launch it’s certainly going to feel like one; coupled with the low supply only a couple major retailers will have cards on May 3rd, with wider availability not occurring until May 7th.\n\nWrapping things up, while we have the specs for the GTX 690 this is only beginning to scratch the surface. Specs won't tell you about real world performance; for that you'll have to check back on May 3rd for our complete review.",

In the last article of this series (Part 6, and be sure to check out parts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5!) I talked about “relaunching” my game on Steam as well as break down some of the new Steam features and gave a current total of sales up to that point. For this article I want to discuss some of the bold new Steam initiatives (Steam Refunds), the last Steam Summer Sale, and the lead up to the announcement of the sequel to Cook, Serve, Delicious! and the effect it had on sales as well.\n\nSteamSpy\n\nBefore we get started, I wanted to talk a little bit about SteamSpy, the data tracking website that has used free data available on Steam to compile a fairly accurate picture of sales for nearly any game on Steam. It has, in a way, rendered these kinds of disclosures of Steam Sales somewhat obsolete. You can get a really good basis of how well a game is doing by using SteamSpy, provided it has sold over 30,000 copies (which is where the data becomes more reliable). In fact, when the site first launched I wondered if I should continue doing these articles at all. But ultimately these articles are more about the strategies involved behind the numbers, and give a clearer picture of what they mean.\n\nSteamSpy is insane. I had mixed feelings when it first launched…it felt weirdly wrong to be able to see numbers that no one was privy to unless the dev chose to share them. At the same time, it was incredibly fascinating. How much did certain genres sell? How did some of my favorite games do? How do I stack up to the competition? It’s a goldmine of data to have.\n\nI think it helps that the person behind SteamSpy, Sergey Galyonkin, is a good guy. He does care about the games behind the numbers and wants to make sure people don’t take these numbers at face value, and, as far as I know, accepts requests for games to be taken off his site by the dev. His tracking of CSD is on point: despite a ~11,000 margin of error, the site is off by only ~3,000. Quite amazing given it’s only using freely available data on Steam to get to these numbers.\n\nSales Update\n\nIn the last article I mentioned Battle Kitchen, the big new update to CSD. Since then I released a smaller update adding some new modes and features, such as the Mystery Box Challenge, for free. But by and large the majority of the “big news” was done that November, so in a way CSD was mainly coasting on its own since January.\n\nSince January 29th (date of the last article) up until June 10th (the day before the big Steam Summer Sale) the game sold 4,096 copies on Steam, netting $40,624 in gross revenue. That was a surprising number to hit, given that outside of a Steam Bundle and a few sales there wasn’t a lot of promotions for CSD. I can attribute that to the slow but steady growth across YouTube/streaming, with a few major personalities checking out the game for the first time. The Humble Store added 3,984 copies sold with some major sales promos (not counting the ARGGGHHH! HARD GAMES! Bundle).\n\nDuring these months I was mainly quiet across social media and on the CSD Steam channel. I had, in my mind, wrapped up CSD as far as new content went. I was worried that by not supporting the game for a long period of time that sales would similarly dry up.\n\nWhat I was actually doing since October was working on Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2!! I wanted to tell people I was working on CSD 2, giving my old game a shot in the arm in a way. But simply announcing it wouldn’t really be enough. I wanted to make the biggest splash possible.\n\nThe small problem was that it wasn’t assumed that I was making a sequel…in fact, I had mentioned in a blog post back in 2014 that I most definitely wasn’t making a sequel, that the new game would be entirely different, and in fact put in an easter egg that tied into an achievement in CSD 1 that vaguely talked about a whole new project. All of that changed in late 2014.\n\nCook, Serve, Delicious Presents: This TV Show\n\nBack in 2014 I had several artists working on my new game project, a strategic sim that was a brand new type of game that I was very excited about. I was pouring in thousands, which quickly rose to tens of thousands per month. I had a grand vision of what it would all be, but I knew that with this game (which we’ll call Project CF from here on out) I would essentially be starting over. Anyone who liked Cook, Serve, Delicious wouldn’t necessarily like Project CF. Similarly, I had to target a completely new set of people who liked this genre. But I didn’t mind the challenge, or to put it a better way, I was deliberately ignoring the severity of the challenge.\n\nAn art test from Project CF\n\nOne evening I got an email from a high up person in a major broadcast corporation. He introduced himself and asked if I’d be interested in talking with him more about doing a game specifically for their new games division. It would be a spinoff of Cook, Serve, Delicious, using a well-known television show’s brand and incorporating that style into a brand new game for mobile.\n\nI was floored. I’d rather not say the name of anyone or be specific of the TV show, but it was one of those programs that rescues bars (ahem) and turns it around by the end. It was a hot property, a show that I was actually a fan of, and to do a game based off of it? It seemed nuts to even think about.\n\nI had some preliminary ideas for a sequel to CSD, but I didn’t know how to treat this new game. Would I make the sequel after the tie-in? What if I failed to do a good job tying in the brand…would I lose the very small brand recognition I worked so hard to build in CSD? I’d have to delay Project CF, and after I made this tie-in game, I would probably continue on with a sequel, delaying CF even further. There was so much to think about.\n\nAfter a few emails back and forth, communication stopped on their end for no reason other than, I imagine, just not being as interested as before. It was really just a “what if” scenario as I hadn’t entered into any formal talks (and in fact in December 2014 I found out in an AMA on Reddit that they were going forward with a game based on the app of the TV show, which made more sense).\n\nGoing back into Project CF after those talks was tough. I couldn’t stop thinking about a CSD sequel. I already had some ideas for this tie-in that I would like to see expanded on, and more gameplay ideas came at me every day. It was like a broken pipe that I couldn’t stop.\n\nThen I realized, what am I doing.\n\nProject CF has the potential to be a lot of things, but here I was, ignoring this game that I spent years building, ignoring the potential of making a sequel that can be so much bigger and better, for a game that is completely unproven. Project CF is the kind of game you make when you don’t have too much to lose…and given how much money I had spent so far (close to $60k), I very much had everything to lose. With the project going forward and my estimates of how long it would take me, it would be close to late 2017/early 2018 before I would be able to release CSD 2. What a stupid, dumb move. What was I thinking? Why am I doing this?\n\nSo in September I wrapped up all the art that I had left on the docket for Project CF, put the game on ice and moved forward to CSD 2. I will return to that project for sure, but for now, CSD 2 is getting 100% of my attention. All thanks to that crazy email.\n\nSummer Sale Strategies\n\nWith the summer sale happening early June (and for the first time running during E3) I had a plan. Since CSD was released I had a strategy of maximizing profits with every sale push. This time, it was all about getting new players to try CSD, so that I could maximize the user base when CSD 2 would be announced. That meant trying out some huge new discounts: 75% standard, with the potential 90% off should Steam select the game for a promotional sale during the summer sale.\n\nI got a trailer together and decided that June 2nd would be the day to announce the sequel. That way, plenty of people would be excited about CSD which would roll perfectly into the summer sale, where I would get even more exposure. I figured the weeks before E3 would be quiet since everyone would wait until the start of the show on June 16th. My second plan, revealing the trailer at the PC Gamers Show at E3, fell through when they decided to go for large game reveals only.\n\nI contacted Sony and asked about possibly posting on the PlayStation Blog at the same time, and they let me know it would be doable, but asked if I would consider posting after E3, as there were going to be a flood of announcements around that time. Of course, they were right: those weeks to E3 had a ton of announcements, more than anyone was expecting, including a full trailer in some cases (like Fallout 4). So we set a new date, July 2nd, the day before the American 4th of July holiday. That meant going to the summer sale with no exposure or major promotions other than the discounts. I was worried my plan of getting a larger userbase as a result of CSD 2 being announced would be much more difficult.\n\nThe Monster Sale 2015\n\nAs like any other Steam sale, this summer had a unique “monster game” component where you played a browser game with others to unlock global discounts for the next day. There were the standard daily deals (24 hour promotions on the front page, with another 24 hours in the “in case you missed it” category, followed by the encore promotion at the very end of the sale) and flash sales (12 hours on the main page, then 12 hours in the second page). The Monster Discounts are on the front page for 24 hours, but only if the players unlocked them by meeting various community challenges.\n\nCook, Serve, Delicious was featured in a Monster Discount towards the middle of the sale at 90% off, the lowest it has ever been discounted. I was worried that such a drastic discount would bring in a crowd not usually interested in these types of games, which could possibly lead to bad reviews (I was quite proud of the 96% review score!) Still, I had to build that userbase, especially with the reveal coming up in just a few weeks.\n\nThe discount paid off nicely: the sale brought in $64,184, adding 54,960 new players to the game. The concern I had with reviews was somewhat off base…hundreds of new positive reviews came in, with about a dozen bad reviews, tipping the scale to 95% positive. Losing 1% for that kind of userbase…I think it was worth it!\n\nThe New Game Announcement\n\nNow that E3 and the sale was behind me, I went full speed ahead into planning for the big reveal. Originally I was going to reveal just the trailer, but the full month delay allowed me to add more media, finalize a screenshot, and build a brand new website. It was an immensely better reveal than the one I had planned before E3.\n\nSo, that Tuesday before the Thursday reveal, I teased a new game announcement. It was a lot of fun to make a big deal out of a small little cooking game like mine. But I was incredibly nervous. The run up to that morning, I was asking myself all kinds of questions. Was this the right thing to do? Should I have gone forward with a sequel? What will PlayStation users, who haven’t had access to the first game on consoles, think about this?\n\nAll my fears melted away as the big announcement was posted on the Euro and US PlayStation blogs, and I followed with the trailer, website, and social media splashes. It was insane, fun, and intense all at once. Interestingly, sales didn’t pick up at all that day for CSD as I had assumed they would, but in the later days it started to improve and up till today there’s a higher average daily income than, say, last month. So while it’s hard to pinpoint if it’s the Summer Sale effect or the new game announcement that’s helped improve sales, it’s likely that it’s a combination of both.\n\nThere are, of course, haters that came with the announcement, but I expected this quirky little cooking game to not be embraced by everyone, so I was fully prepared for it. Some comments were snarky, others extremely hateful, but none of them hurtful because they didn’t get to me. I had to actively seek out bad comments, so instead I just let the positive comments come to me instead. It feels much better that way.\n\nThere’s a long road of development ahead, and this announcement is just the start of building a bigger userbase for the next year. It’s gonna be a lot of fun for sure.\n\nSteam Refunds, Steam Broadcasts\n\nSteam is always finding new ways to innovate and change up the market, and the new Broadcast and Refunds initiatives are no exception. While the Broadcast feature is too hard to measure the effects on sales, as there’s definitely a much, much bigger presence outside of Steam via Twitch/YouTube, Steam Refunds have been quite an interesting program.\n\nThe guidelines to be eligible for a refund on Steam are:\n\nIt must not be more than two weeks since the game was purchased\n\nYou must not have more than two hours active in the game\n\nAside from those, you’re free to give any reason why you’d want a refund (and encouraged to do so in the text box that accompanies the request). Whether it doesn’t work, runs badly, or is even plain boring, refunds are granted as long as those criteria are met. The first few weeks of refunds were even more generous however, with some users reporting that games as old as a couple of months or more than two hours logged in were approved for refunds. I’d imagine this was Valve’s way of clearing the deck before they were going to a much stricter set of approvals, though they never actually confirmed it.\n\nThanks to the back end of Steam’s dev portal I’m able to see how many refunds were requested, and even get the reasons behind the requests, as long as the user provided one. The current Steam tally for copies sold on Steam is 240,775, however of those units about 136,000 are Steam based and were potentially eligible for refunds, given the lax period in the beginning where seemingly a majority of refunds were approved. Of those, 786 refunds were requested and approved, a majority of which came from the Steam sale. That’s about 0.6% of the total sales on Steam. Is that good? Bad? Honestly, it’s hard to say.\n\nThere’s lots more data to unpack though: Steam helpfully provides a breakdown of the refunds requested to go along with the comments by the user.\n\nWe can assume that 88 refunds were to simply buy the game at a cheaper price, so I don’t really consider that part of this group. I’m quite proud of the lack of technical problems the game has, with only 40 or less people attributing crashing or technical issues for a refund. Really, the biggest category that I could directly attribute to my game and learn from is the “not fun” category, of which there were plenty of comments.\n\nAll of the comments that I can see are made anonymous, and a lot of them were simply people not having a great time, or realizing it wasn’t their cup of tea. A few had some good points that I plan to visit in the sequel. It was a great way of learning what I did right and wrong in the game.\n\nI think refunds are very much a positive step, and I don’t for one minute have any regrets or anger towards refunding 786 people for whatever reason they have. If you didn’t like it, then I don’t feel comfortable taking your money. It really couldn’t be simpler.\n\nA screenshot of Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2!!\n\nThe Grand Total\n\nContinuing from the last article, the game has a lifetime gross of $797,000 across mobile and PC, and I feel like a million might be possible before the sequel comes out in the next year. Wow, a million in gross…how crazy is that? How CRAZY IS THAT??\n\nI feel that this is the end of what we can learn from Cook, Serve, Delicious! as I start to transition over to working full time on CSD 2. I’m going forward with the idea of building a userbase moreso than profits, so there will be some new sales strategies in the coming months. But it’ll mostly be on autopilot as I get ready to enter a whole new chapter in my career with this new game. Also I definitely plan on continuing these series of articles with CSD 2.\n\nThe success of Cook, Serve, Delicious! is by no means a foreshadowing of how Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2!! will do. CSD was able to grow from people discovering it over the course of several years. CSD 2 won’t quite have that luxury of being “discovered,” especially with it being on PS4, so I have to make sure I hit it out of the park at launch. I want to get stellar reviews. I want the game to be the best cooking game ever made. I want it to be successful right out of the gate. I want to make people happy and read about all the fun times they’re having with friends or enjoying watching streams of people playing the game.\n\nI love what I do, and I love that others have enjoyed what I made. I hope I can do it again. Man, I really, really hope I can do it again.",

Each week, eco-expert Danny Seo offers tips that can make you happier, healthier and more eco-friendly.\n\nRid yard of mosquitoes\n\nMosquitoes bugging you? Stop them at their source: Any standing water in your yard can be a breeding ground for mosquitoes to lay eggs. Drill drainage holes on the bottom of trash cans and recycling bins. Check birdbaths and pet bowls, and overturn unused flowerpots. Mosquitoes need very little water to lay eggs.\n\nPrevent exploding bottles\n\nTo keep your bottles of suntan lotion and aloe from exploding inside your suitcase, let FedEx lead the way. Use those FedEx Tyvek packs in which your shipments arrive. They're watertight and will keep any spills or messes inside the bag and not all over your clothes.\n\nCook s'mores with coals\n\nBarbecuing tonight? Here's a quick, entertaining variation: Once the cooking is done, recycle the hot coals in the grill for dessert. Scoop the hot coals into fireproof bowls and bring out the marshmallows, graham crackers and chocolate bars. Instant s'mores.\n\nUse bandanas as napkins\n\nHere's an entertaining idea: Try bandanas instead of paper napkins when having guests over for a party. They're colorful, reusable, inexpensive and a fun way to dress up a table. You can find bandanas in most discount stores and Army/Navy surplus shops.\n\nMake soap curls\n\nIf you're having guests over, offer them a fresh piece of soap every time they wash their hands. Just grab a bar of glycerin soap (it's clear) and run a vegetable peeler across the top to make soap curls. Place all the curls in a bowl; each curl is just enough for one hand washing.\n\nTry reusable containers\n\nIf you are enjoying a day at the beach, consider using non-disposable containers for packing food. Chinese stacking tins keep sandwiches, pickles and cookies organized and separate from one another. These are easy to carry, with a click-in handle on top. Check out pearlriver.com for a selection of lunch boxes.\n\nWater lawn at sundown\n\nIf you need to water the lawn or outdoor plants, do it at sundown. Watering plants at night is the most ecological method, since there is no sun to evaporate the water immediately. If you have automatic sprinklers, set the timer to water the lawn at night. Not only does this save water, but the plants and lawn will get a proper soaking, too, and will thrive.",

  "latent_1739": "1.\n\nИдея конгресса - «миротворческая». Если посмотреть в список панельных дискуссий, то ясно, что конгресс содержит в себе вопрос: что может сделать гуманитарная интеллигенция двух стран для того, чтобы сохранить какой-то климат доверия между украинским и российским обществом. Сохранить сотрудничество в условиях, когда Кремль непреклонно крушит украинское государство. А само это государство попало в капкан обстоятельств, превышающих его возможности. Предполагается, что с русской стороны приедут некие «мы» - противники агрессивного курса Кремля, противники силовой политики, сторонники территориальной целостности Украины. А с украинской стороны будет некое «мы», которое давно и глубоко связано с русской культурой и искренне переживает разрыв, который возникает из-за агрессивной политики. Безусловно, оба этих «мы» - есть. Если утрировать, то и с русской, и с украинской стороны есть, например, сообщество переводчиков (культура – это в широком смысле слова «перевод»). Украинцы читали Улицкую, а мы читали Жадана.\n\nМы со вниманием относимся к специфическим культурным концептам любого другого народа. И мы - «против насилия». Таково наше общее «мы».\n\n2.\n\nНо что важно: сегодня оба этих «мы» - и украинское, и русское - сиротские. Украинская интеллигенция - сирота. Она предана Западом. Запад - не помог. Это глобальный исторический факт. А русская интеллигенция - сирота перед лицом своего «коллективного Путина», держащего интеллигенцию в случае гнева за «пятую колонну», а в добром расположении духа - за людей, которые в нелепом меньшинстве болтаются под ногами и мелко гадят.\n\nНо мало того, что интеллигенция – предана. И в России, и в Украине встает вопрос и о ее вине. Ведь это именно образованные классы в России в несколько этапов и как бы незаметно для себя за десятилетие опускались все ниже и ниже, соглашаясь на меняющиеся условия игры, предлагаемые Кремлем. Но и в украинских медиа тоже звучит: украинская интеллигенция – как и российская – не сделала того, что должна была бы для того, чтобы «ностальгический советизм» в Восточной Украине никогда бы не стал больше значимым политическим фактором. Каждый из нас, конечно, может сказать о себе – я все эти годы оставался на почве антитоталитарной традиции. Многие делали все, что могли – «Мемориал», Сахаровский центр, центры исторического знания, такие, как РОССПЭН или «Новое литературное обозрение», российские кинорежиссеры сняли сотни игровых и документальных антитоталитарных фильмов. А сколько было сделано в области международного обмена! За десятилетие, я думаю, сотни тысяч студентов, научных работников участвовали в совместных с Германий, Польшей, Францией, США и др. грантовых программах, посвященных исторической памяти, демократическим ценностям.\n\nИ, тем не менее, уже очевидно, что вопрос о вине встанет. Потому что перед нами факт: монстр реваншизма вылез на поверхность, и он определяет теперь и политическую повестку дня в России, и культурную политику. Сейчас горячее время, и украинские интеллектуалы могут с большим основанием обвинять в агрессивности и русский народ в целом, и русскую культуру, в которой сильна тоталитарная закваска. Сегодня Украина драматически теряет государство под давлением Кремля. И Кремль смотрится очень крупно. Но через 10-20 лет все равно встанет и вопрос о собственной ответственности украинского образованного класса.\n\nМы ведь знаем историю европейского антифашизма 20-30 гг. прошлого века. Знаем, как терпели поражение парламентаризм и культура политического консенсуса, как пытались после крушения империй построить инклюзивную политику в новых государствах – и не смогли. Не смогли противостоять «триумфу воли». Значительная часть обществ 12 стран Европы оказалась вовлечена в наркотический транс реваншизма.\n\n3.\n\nЧудовищный цинизм российских аналитиков заключен в настойчивом повторении идеи, что в Украине дефолтное государство, что оно не состоялось вообще за 25 постсоветских лет. Дефолтным оно стало после вмешательства Кремля. До этого здесь было обычное восточноевропейское государство. Украинские образованные классы и в оранжевой революции, и на Евромайдане успешно отстаивали саму идею сменяемости власти, республиканский идеал. А скепсис общества в отношении конкретных фигур политической сцены, так он сегодня примерно такой же и в Чехии, и в Польше, например.\n\nЧасто любят противопоставлять Майдан и Болотную. Украинцы оказались решительнее. Но с точки зрения истории политических систем, истории борьбы за республику – Майдан и Болотная это один и тот же феномен. Это ответ образованных классов на попытку олигархии и бюрократии окончательно узурпировать власть и разрушить сами основания политической самостоятельности общества. Янукович пытался повторить «подвиг разведчика» и рассчитывал прокупить все СМИ, окружить себя верными олигархами, дать им возможность осуществить рейдерскую монополизацию отраслей. Майдан и Болотная – разгромлены по-разному. Но смысл этих событий одинаков: это выражение иммунитета общества, ответ антител на заболевание государственного организма. И оба этих события уже вписаны в политическую историю наших народов. Сейчас кажется, что русское и украинское общества разделены. Но на самом деле оба они объединены. Их объединяет не найденный ответ на путинскую агрессию, направленную против обществ двух стран – и России, и Украины. Подчеркну, это именно целенаправленный удар именно по обществам.\n\n4.\n\nОпросы показывают, что российское общество демонстрирует свои худшие черты: агрессивность, готовность к насилию, пренебрежение всякой инаковостью, патернализм. Из опросов, из чтения полемики в сетях складывается впечатление, что российское общество добровольно и с энтузиазмом погружается в архаику, в варварство, и видит своего Путина великим Чингисханом пространств Новой Евразии. Люди убеждены, что «Крым – наш». Просто наш, и все. А аргументы почему «наш» непрерывно поставляет пропаганда федеральных каналов, радио и массовые газеты. Но в реальном общении каждый из нас видит, что взгляды расходятся внутри одной семьи. Муж говорит: «Крым –наш! Ура». – «Ты с ума сошел, Саша!» - говорит жена. Взрослые дети пишут о том, как они спорят с бабушками, безоговорочно верящими телевидению. Спорят между собой однокашники, коллеги по офису или университетской кафедре. Мужчины настроены триумфально. Но женщины видят в происходящем не геополитику. Они в первую очередь думают о том, что погибнут украинцы и русские. Поэтому не стоит слишком доверять пугающим цифрам, что 85% поддерживают и лишь 12% против. Но даже если подавляющее большинство сегодня верит в правильность действий Кремля в Украине, мы все равно будем смотреть на это позже и как на вину и как на беду российского общества. Кремль проводит масштабную, жесткую, небывалую по насыщенности пропагандистскую спецоперацию против собственного населения. Этой пропагандой затопило общество от края до края. Да, мы стоим на берегу. Кто «мы»? Часть образованного класса, которая не смогла предотвратить беды.\n\n5.\n\nВспомним, как европейские интеллектуалы реагировали на Манхэттен 9/11. На военную операцию в Ираке. И даже – на недавний Occupy Wall Street. Как много было не только блестящих текстов, но и коллективных публичных акций. И заметно, как мало сказано в Европе теми, кто располагает значительным символическим капиталом по поводу Украины и России. Я был на антивоенных митингах в Берлине и Праге. Дело не в том, что они малочисленны. А в том, что в целом европейские интеллектуалы остаются в стороне. Почему? Они в растерянности. И мы знаем, почему. Часть из них настроена настолько антиамерикански, что не знает, как выйти из противоречия: то ли Кремль – это агрессор, то ли Путин смело бросает вызов мировой гегемонии США. Другая часть, видимо, считает, что и от Москвы и от Киева надо просто отгородиться новым «римским валом», а уж как там Москва поступит с Киевом, это не их дело. Третьи считают, что правительства их стран не должны вмешиваться, чтобы не повредить экономической конъюнктуре. Я искренне считаю, тем не менее, что большинство молчит, столкнувшись с реальной проблемой. Трудно найти убедительную позицию для публичного вмешательства с позиций так называемых «европейских ценностей». Европа переживает упадок концептуализации самой себя. И Путин это прекрасно знает и использует. Он ведь прямо через голову правительств в своей «прямой линии» 18 апреля обратился к европейским избирателям, которые скептически относятся и к международным организациям, и к G7 и G20, и вообще ко всей имеющейся глобальной политической архитектуре. Он приветствовал Мари Ле Пен и Орбана как союзников. Европа молчит. Я имею сейчас в виду не правящие круги, а европейское общество, европейские образованные классы. И я говорю не только о протестных акциях. А в первую очередь об усилиях в осмыслении происходящего, дальнейшей судьбы украинского и российского обществ, их места в Европе и мире. Вот где нужна поддержка. Но ее пока нет.\n\n6.\n\nВ этом регионе от Балтики до Балкан в ХХ веке пролилось много крови. Эти земли Восточной Европы историк Тимоти Снайдер в своей недавней книге назвал «bloodlands» - кровавыми землями. И это так и есть. Восточная Европа - это опасные земли. От ХХ века здесь от Терезина до Катыни остались сотни мемориалов и музеев, связанных именно с геноцидом, с массовыми уничтожениями. Даже через 60 лет после окончания длинной европейской войны (1914-1945) на этих землях кое-где не все еще остыло, а лишь покрылось тонкой корочкой.\n\nВот на этих «кровавых землях» Владимир Путин затеял опасную игру в раздел Украины. Все, кто знаком с историей Восточной Европы, прекрасно понимают, насколько это страшная игра. Кремлевская пропаганда рисует в качестве главного врага - США. Но это далекий, метафизический враг. А реальностью является разжигаемый конфликт на одной улице, между соседями. И даже внутри семей. Между однокашниками. В результате врагом оказывается твой одноклассник, а вовсе не солдат НАТО, которого большинство живущих на этих землях видели только в кино. Русские, живущие на Львовщине, или украинцы, живущие в Донбассе, никакого отношения к геополитике не имеют. Но теперь каждый вынуждены «самоопределяться» в том, в чем еще вчера и не требовалось. И это в одночасье охватывает всех. Еще вчера жизнь была наполнена разнообразием, прагматикой любых этнических контактов, дружб, бизнесов, культурных взаимодействий, а сегодня война подталкивает каждого к черно-белому пониманию мира. В обычной жизни жители любой страны Восточной Европы были объединены прагматическим желанием заработать для семей. Одни ориентировались на Запад, другие на Восток. И это не служило основой разделения.\n\nЧавкающая бездна конфликта, подозрений, старых, ушедших в историческую память травм, снова начинает говорить. Ведь депортации, голодомор, насилие НКВД, нацистов, коллаборационистов – все это было.\n\nВот в эти опасные земли Кремль продолжает накачивать энергию конфликта. И он быстро набухает, разрывая Украину на части. Миллионы людей, как это обычно и бывает в таких ситуациях, покидают почву бытового здравомыслия и начинают мыслить «геополитически», погружаются в стихию политических мифов глобального масштаба. Еще вчера это были добрые друзья по кафедре, цеху или офису. Сегодня это люди, которые вынуждены самоопределяться – так же, как это было после Нюрнбергских законов о евреях в Германии и соседних странах. Ты должен либо примкнуть к антисемитской риторике, либо замолчать, либо уехать. Ты должен найти для себя основания далее сосуществовать с откровенно глупыми людьми, которые еще вчера не имели публичного голоса, а сегодня вдруг становятся политическим центром, который орет со всех трибун.\n\n7.\n\nУ нас нет никаких оснований для оптимизма. Нам придется дальше жить и действовать в очень тяжелых и долгосрочных обстоятельствах. Украинскому обществу – в условиях угрозы распада государства и непрерывного давления Кремля. Российскому обществу – в отвратительной атмосфере пропагандистского угара. Для того «мы», которому я принадлежу, схватка происходит, в первую очередь, между «языками описания». Ведь это не русский и украинский народы сегодня по разные стороны линии фронта. И это не конфликт Москвы и Киева. И не конфликт между воображаемыми либералами и консерваторами. Это конфликт двух языков: примитивного языка конфликта, дискурса разделения - и языка политического и культурного разнообразия. Можно лишь с болью думать о том, что и Украина, и Россия сегодня опять оказались в зоне циничного «антропологического эксперимента». И все, что мы можем противопоставить этому пропагандистскому языковому насилию - только речь. Ее богатство, ее сложную традицию. Ее связанность с персональным опытом. Это – живая, свободная речь.

  "latent_1952": "In the back of an empty deli in Brooklyn, two central figures from race riots that broke out 20 years ago last week sat together at a wooden table before a plate of corned beef sandwiches.\n\nCarmel Cato lost his son, Gavin, when the 7-year-old black boy was crushed in an auto accident involving a motorcade of a Jewish religious leader.\n\nNorman Rosenbaum’s brother, Yankel, was stabbed to death in the rioting that followed. Nearly 190 people were injured.\n\nTwo decades after the violence in Crown Heights, the two men say time hasn’t healed their wounds, but they take solace in each other and in the changes in the neighborhood since the riots.\n\n“Today is about commemorating the loss of two lives,” Rosenbaum said on the anniversary last week. “It’s about remembering what racism and anti-Semitism can do to the most sophisticated, advanced democracy known to mankind.”\n\nIt began Aug. 19, 1991. A funeral procession for the death of a rabbi in the Lubavitch community drove by, racing to beat the sunset, and one car fell behind, speeding to catch up. The car jumped the curb and crushed Gavin. A Jewish ambulance arrived and, some witnesses said, tended to the driver but ignored the boy who was crushed underneath the vehicle.\n\nThree hours later, a gang of blacks shouting “Get the Jew!” fatally stabbed Yankel Rosenbaum, a rabbinical student.\n\nDays of rioting from both sides followed. Angry crowds broke windows, looted, shouted “Heil Hitler!” and burned the Israeli flag. The images reverberated around City Hall and the world.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton last week apologized for his role during the unrest, when he led a march of hundreds shouting “No justice, no peace” through the streets. Also, after the riots subsided, at Cato’s funeral Sharpton referred to the neighborhood’s Chassidic Jews as “diamond merchants.”\n\nHis admission of mistakes came in an op-ed published Aug. 21 in the New York Daily News. “Twenty years later, I have grown,” Sharpton wrote. “I would still have stood up for Gavin Cato, but I would have also included in my utterances that there was no justification or excuse for violence or for the death of Yankel Rosenbaum.”\n\nBlacks blamed the unrest on pent-up anger over perceptions that Lubavitchers got preferential treatment from city officials. Jews said it was anti-Semitism, pure and simple.\n\nNorman Rosenbaum and Carmel Cato prefer to say the riots were the result of angry racists taking advantage of a situation, and a failure by law enforcement to shut it down fast enough.\n\nThey say it’s something that would not happen today.\n\n“Now they would listen,” Cato said of police. “They are a different bunch of people now — more aware. We all are.”\n\nThe two men are mirror images: Rosenbaum, pale white, thickly bearded, loquacious, wearing a black suit with a white shirt. And Cato, black, shaven, quiet, wearing a white suit with a black shirt. They sat close together, arms touching, as they spoke, remembering their relatives.\n\nCato was guarded, smiling to himself as he thought about his young son.\n\n“He was quiet, but he was always coming up out of somewhere,” he said. “I wonder how he would have been, grown up.”\n\nRosenbaum said his brother always stood up for the underdog.\n\n“The one thing I know he’d certainly be happy about today is the Cato family and the Rosenbaum family, notwithstanding the tyranny of distances, are good friends,” Rosenbaum said. “And they come together, and in different ways try to give some solace to one another.”\n\nIn some ways, much has changed in Crown Heights, and in the city. Crime in the precinct is at record lows, but still higher than other neighborhoods. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, who was a deputy commissioner at the time, was then tasked with taking over police response two days after the riots started after other tactics weren’t working — and when he did, he swiftly brought order.\n\nKelly said in an interview with TV station New York 1 that the lessons learned helped better prepare the department for the future.\n\n“We realize that we should have acted more quickly in the additional hours of Crown Heights,” he said.\n\nKelly since has instituted regular “disorder” drills where officers respond to mob scenes and bring them under control. And the department’s then-contentious relationship with minority communities has eased — thanks in part to increased community relations and an increasingly diverse department.\n\nLemrick Nelson, then 16, was arrested in the Rosenbaum slaying. He was acquitted of state murder charges but was convicted on federal civil rights charges. An appeals court later overturned the federal conviction, saying the judge had tampered with the racial makeup of the jury.\n\nIn 2003, a new jury found Nelson guilty of violating Rosenbaum’s civil rights. Nelson was sentenced to 10 years in prison but was released within a year because of time he had already served. He was stabbed in the head with an ice pick in a possible road rage incident last September.\n\nThe city settled a civil suit by Jewish leaders in the area for $1.2 million.\n\nCrown Heights is still populated largely by a mix of Caribbean immigrants and an insular Jewish community.\n\nOn Aug. 19, people of all colors and dress milled down the stretch of Eastern Parkway that was the scene of rioting as if it was just another day.\n\nRosenbaum flew in from Australia despite a recent leg operation. He and Cato planned to spend the evening mourning their lost loved ones quietly and in private.",
  "latent_2058": "Scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego and their colleagues are unraveling the mechanisms behind a little-known marine worm that produces a dazzling bioluminescent display in the form of puffs of blue light released into seawater.\n\nFound around the world in muddy environments, from shallow bays to deeper canyons, the light produced by the Chaetopterus marine worm—commonly known as the “parchment tube worm” due to the opaque, cocoon-like cylinders where it makes its home—is secreted as a slimy bioluminescent mucus.\n\nThe mucus, which the worms are able to secrete out of any part of their body, hasn’t been studied by scientists in more than 50 years. But two recent studies have helped reignite the quest to decode the inner workings of the worm’s bioluminescence.\n\nIn one study, published in the journal Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, Scripps Associate Research Scientist Dimitri Deheyn and his colleagues at Georgetown University describe details of Chaetopterus’s light production as never before. Through data derived from experiments conducted inside Scripps Oceanography’s Experimental Aquarium, the researchers characterized specific features of the worm’s light, tracing back its generation to a specific “photoprotein” tied to bioluminescence.\n\n“The fact that the light is produced as a long glow without direct oxygen consumption is attractive for a range of future biotechnological applications,” added Deheyn, whose current work focuses on identifying the specific protein(s) involved in the light production.\n\nThe present study, however, focused on the general biochemistry and optical properties of the light production. “We have shown that the mucus produces a long-lasting glow of blue light, which is unique for this environment where bioluminescence is usually produced as short-lived flashes of light in the green spectrum, especially for benthic (seafloor) species,” said Deheyn, who added that green travels farthest and is therefore the easiest to detect in shallow coastal environments.\n\nAs for the light’s ecological function, the researchers speculate that the luminous mucus may serve as a trap to attract prey, a deterrent to ward off certain unwelcome guests into the worm’s living areas (the glowing mucus could stick to an intruder, making it more visible to its own predators), or possibly serve as a substance to build the worms’ flaky, tube-shaped homes.\n\nThe blue color makes it intriguing and difficult to reconcile with a visual function for shallow animals only.\n\n“However, one can imagine that blue light would work better if the predator is a fish coming from greater depths, or for specific predators for which we still don’t know the visual sensitivity,” concluded Deheyn.\n\nIn a separate study, Deheyn and his colleagues at Connecticut College found that riboflavin, known as vitamin B2 and used widely as a dietary supplement, is a key source of the light production. The study appearing in Photochemistry and Photobiology focused on worms collected by Scripps Marine Collector and Technician Phil Zerofski in the La Jolla submarine canyon off the coast of San Diego, California. The research revealed riboflavin as the major fluorescent compound in all extracts of the worm’s luminescent material, including the glowing slime. Although more investigation is needed, the authors hypothesize that a derivative of riboflavin serves as the emitting force in the worm’s light-production process.\n\nThe authors note that the worms are not able to produce riboflavin on their own—only plants and microbes can—therefore the worms must acquire the vitamin through a food source, the same way humans do.\n\n“We have shown that the bioluminescent light production involves riboflavin, which is key because it means that the worm is relying on an external source,” said Deheyn. “We suggest the light production depends on the worm’s diet, yet it could also involve a symbiosis with bacteria (possibly living in the tube) to provide the riboflavin.”\n\nFurther investigations are targeting intricacies of the chemical reactions behind the light production and methods to synthesize the light production in the laboratory.\n\nThe Air Force Office of Scientific Research’s Natural Materials, Systems, and Extremophiles Program and the Hans & Ella McCollum ’21 Vahlteich Endowment supported the research.",
  "latent_2082": "In 1942, Imperial Japan invaded Singapore and took around 25,000 prisoners. Next was the Philippines.\n\nWith Imperial Japan’s relentless bombardment by planes and heavy siege guns, President Franklin D. Roosevelt did not want General Douglas MacArthur captured, so he ordered him to leave Corregidor, Philippines, and evacuate to Australia. General Douglas MacArthur obeyed, March 11, 1942, but not without promising, “I shall return.”\n\nDuring Imperial Japan’s occupation of the Philippines, they forced Filipino and American prisoners on the horrible Bataan Death March, where over 10,000 died.\n\nWhen he heard of this, General Douglas MacArthur stated, April 9, 1942: “To the weeping mothers of its dead, I can only say that the sacrifice and halo of Jesus of Nazareth has descended upon their sons, and that God will take them unto Himself.”\n\nThe turning point in the Pacific War began June 4, 1942. American code-breakers intercepted intelligence of Imperial Japan’s plans to capture Midway Island and from there, Hawaii and the rest of the Pacific. The outnumbered U.S. Pacific Fleet attempted a desperate ambush of the Imperial Japanese armada, but was losing badly.\n\nWhen the Imperial Japanese fleet suddenly changed its course, the American torpedo dive-bombers searched for it in vain, with many of their escort fighters running out of fuel and ditching in the ocean.\n\nLieutenant-Commander John Waldron, who led the torpedo dive-bomber squadron from the U.S. carrier Hornet, told his men the night before: “My greatest hope is that we encounter a favorable tactical situation, but if we don’t, I want each of us to do our utmost to destroy the enemies. If there is only one plane to make a final run in, I want that man to go in and get a hit. May God be with us.”\n\nWaldron’s squadron was the first to spot the Imperial Japanese fleet. Flying in at low altitude, they suffered the full focus of the Imperial Japanese defenses. Out of 30 of Waldron’s men who took off that morning, only one survived. Lieutenant-Commander John Waldron received the Navy Cross posthumously.\n\nTheir sacrifice was not in vain, as it benefited the other American torpedo dive-bomber squadrons from the U.S. carriers Enterprise and Yorktown, who arrived about an hour later, flying at a much higher altitude.\n\nNavigating by guess and by God, and running low on fuel, Squadron Commander C. Wade McClusky, Jr. decided to continue the search. Through a break in the clouds, they providentially spotted the wake of the Japanese destroyers and followed it to find the Japanese aircraft carriers: Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, and Hiryu. This was at the precise moment when most of the Imperial Japanese “Zero” fighter planes were busy being refueled and rearmed after fighting Waldron’s squadron, or had just taken off to attack the U.S. carrier Yorktown.\n\nIn just five minutes, the screeching American torpedo dive-bombers sank three Imperial Japanese carriers, and a fourth shortly after. In just moments, Imperial Japan’s naval force had been cut in half, resulting in them suddenly being forced to the defensive.\n\nAfter the Battle of Midway, plans were begun to free the Philippines.\n\nPresident Roosevelt said, Aug. 12, 1943: “Three weeks after the armies of the Japanese launched their attack on Philippine soil, I sent a proclamation … to the people of the Philippines … that their freedom will be redeemed. … The great day of your liberation will come, as surely as there is a God in Heaven.”\n\nDiscover more of Bill Federer’s eye-opening books and videos in the WND Superstore!\n\nOn Oct. 20, 1944, General Douglas MacArthur returned to the Philippines with U.S. troops, stating: “People of the Philippines: I have returned. By the grace of Almighty God our forces stand again on Philippine soil – soil consecrated in the blood of our two peoples. We have come, dedicated and committed to the task of destroying every vestige of enemy control. … The hour of your redemption is here. … Let the indomitable spirit of Bataan and Corregidor lead on … Let no heart be faint. Let every arm be steeled. The guidance of Divine God points the way. Follow in His name to the Holy Grail of righteous victory!”\n\nThe same day, President Roosevelt sent a message to General MacArthur: “The whole American Nation today exults at the news that the gallant men under your command have landed on Philippine soil. I know well what this means to you. I know what it cost you to obey my order that you leave Corregidor in February, 1942, and proceed to Australia. … That day has come. You have the nation’s gratitude and the nation’s prayers for success as you and your men fight your way back to Bataan.”\n\nPresident Roosevelt sent the message to Philippine President Osmena, Oct. 20, 1944: “On this occasion of the return of General MacArthur to Philippine soil with our airmen, our soldiers, and our sailors, we renew our pledge. We and our Philippine brothers in arms-with the help of Almighty God-will drive out the invader; we will destroy his power to wage war again, and we will restore a world of dignity and freedom.”\n\nBrought to you by AmericanMinute.com.\n\nDiscover more of Bill Federer’s eye-opening books and videos in the WND Superstore!",

  "latent_2507": "The European Central Bank has surprised financial markets by cutting interest rates in the eurozone to zero, expanding its money printing programme and reducing a key deposit rate further into negative territory as it seeks to revive the economy and fend off deflation.\n\nECB can only buy time, not solve eurozone growth woes Read more\n\nThe ECB chief, Mario Draghi, implied interest rates would stay “very low” for at least another year but played down speculation they could be cut even further.\n\nUnveiling a bigger package of help for the eurozone than investors had expected, Draghi predicted that inflation in the single currency bloc would remain stuck in negative territory over the coming months and cited a host of risks to economic growth from stumbling emerging economies, volatile financial markets and the slow pace of structural reforms.\n\n“Rates will stay low, very low, for a long period of time and well past the horizon of our purchases,” Draghi said, referring to the ECB’s quantitative easing (QE) programme, where the bank pumps money into the European economy by buying bonds from banks, which is expected to run until at least March 2017.\n\nBut asked at a news conference how low the ECB could go on interest rates, he said: “From today’s perspective and taking into account the support of our measures to growth and inflation, we don’t anticipate that it will be necessary to reduce rates further. Of course, new facts can change the situation and the outlook.”\n\nGoing further than economists had expected, the Frankfurt-based ECB cut the eurozone’s main interest rate from 0.05% to zero, initially prompting a sharp drop in the euro against the pound and the dollar.\n\nAs part of a package of measures to revive lending and economic activity in the eurozone, the central bank cut its two other interest rates, expanded QE and announced new ultra-cheap four-year loans to banks, allowing them to borrow from the ECB at negative interest rates.\n\nEurozone GDP and inflation Eurozone GDP and inflation\n\nOn currency markets, there were big swings in the euro as traders sought to establish if the ECB had now exhausted its options or if more stimulus was still to come. On stock markets, share prices were boosted when the rate cuts were announced but gains were cut as Draghi suggested there was no additional help to come.\n\nEconomists said the package of measures announced was more than had been expected.\n\n“The European Central Bank announced a broad attack on below-target inflation, using all monetary policy tools at once to boost the economy and increase inflation,” said Tomas Holinka, economist at economic researchers Moody’s Analytics.\n\n“While the bank has revealed its policy instruments step by step in the past, now it announced all of them – cutting the interest rates, expanding the QE programme and providing long-term liquidity – together.”\n\nGeorge Efstathopoulos, portfolio manager at fund manager Fidelity International, commented: “This is a bold stance from Draghi and the ECB, which should be positive for both financial markets but more importantly the real economy.”\n\nHow the ECB is trying to revive the eurozone Read more\n\nAs expected by markets, the deposit rate was cut by 10 basis points, further into negative territory to -0.4%. The latest cut in the deposit rate means the ECB will be charging banks more to hold their money overnight, with the aim of encouraging them to lend it to businesses. The marginal lending rate, paid by banks to borrow from the ECB overnight, was cut from 0.3% to to 0.25%.\n\nThe ECB expanded QE to €80bn (£61bn) a month, up from €60bn. That was more than the €70bn economists had been expecting, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll of economists. The programme will now include buying bonds issued by companies and not just by financial institutions.\n\nECB (@ecb) Monetary policy decisions https://t.co/eZRPXZcJCy\n\nThe ECB had come under growing pressure to increase support for the eurozone’s flagging economy after the single currency bloc slipped back into negative inflation in February.\n\nBut the latest moves come amid growing scepticism on financial markets that central banks have enough ammunition left to bolster growth and stop falling prices becoming entrenched. The ECB itself is now predicting inflation in the eurozone will be just 0.1% this year, 1.3% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 - all under its target for inflation close to but below 2%.\n\nDraghi echoed comments by his UK counterpart, Bank of England governor Mark Carney, that governments cannot leave central banks to do all the work on driving the economic recovery.\n\nDraghi said: “Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. However, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively.”\n\nThose comments reflected evidence that “the effectiveness of monetary policy is clearly diminishing”, said Alasdair Cavalla at the consultancy Centre for Economics and Business Research.\n\n“Draghi threw down the gauntlet to fiscal policymakers, arguing for infrastructure spending while lowering the ECB’s own growth forecasts,” said Cavalla.\n\nAgainst that backdrop of bleaker growth prospects and falling prices, Draghi had already indicated the central bank would announce fresh stimulus at the conclusion of this week’s policy-setting meeting.\n\nEconomists had widely expected the ECB to expand QE and cut the deposit rate so the reduction of the main interest rate and the marginal lending rate caught markets off-guard.\n\nAlex Edwards, analyst at currency transfer company UKForex, said: “The ECB has delivered nothing more than dovish news. Rates were cut, inflation forecasts slashed and an extra $20bn announced in quantitative easing. Draghi has not left many stones unturned, and the fact he announced this all at once sent the euro spiralling downwards.\n\n“The euro has been extremely volatile since Draghi spoke, and bounced back as quickly as it fell after he also hinted that rates may now be at their bottom. It’s going to be a very bumpy ride for the euro into the end of the week.”",
  "latent_2537": "Modelling and forecasting mortgage delinquency and foreclosure in the UK\n\nJanine Aron, John Muellbauer\n\nMortgage delinquencies and foreclosures have serious implications, not just for the households affected, but for the financial stability of the economy. The solvency of the mortgage lenders is affected, and their ability to extend credit. This column identifies three key drivers of delinquency and foreclosure rates in the UK – the debt service ratio, the proportion of homes in negative equity, and the unemployment rate – and compares the rates with those in the US. It also discusses the data constraints that have hindered previous analyses.\n\nThe contrasts between the US and the UK mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates are striking. The US data in Figure 1 show an unprecedented recent default crisis: annual foreclosures peak at around 5.5% and mortgages payment delinquencies (90 days or more) at around 5%. In contrast, the recent UK data suggest a relatively mild crisis (Figure 2). However, in the early 1990s, the UK delinquency rate for 3-month defaults (comparable to the US 90-day rate) probably peaked at over 5% (just before records began on this measure). Even then, the annual flow into foreclosures was below the levels for a fairly normal year in the US.\n\nFigure 1 US mortgage foreclosure and payment delinquency rates1\n\nFigure 2 UK mortgage foreclosure and payment delinquency rates2\n\nFuster and Willen (2012) study the probability of entering foreclosure proceedings using US mortgage micro-data, and highlight the impact of negative equity and of variations in interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages. We confirm these findings on aggregate UK data. In a new paper, we model jointly two measures of payment delinquency rates and the rate of flow into foreclosure (Aron and Muellbauer 2016). We find that there were three key economic drivers: the debt service ratio (a measure of debt service costs relative to income), the proportion of homes in negative equity (where the value of the home is less than that of mortgage debt), and the unemployment rate. Previous lending quality and access to refinancing possibilities, government income support for borrowers with payment problems, and the forbearance policies exercised by lenders also play a role.\n\nExplaining the lesser crisis in the UK\n\nWith this empirical analysis, the strikingly less severe mortgage crisis in the UK can be explained. With mainly adjustable rate mortgages in the UK, the unprecedented cuts in the base rate in 2008-09 quickly brought down mortgage payments for most borrowers. This supported consumer spending, preventing a deeper recession. House prices fell far less in most of the UK than in the US, partly because there was no pre-crisis building boom, and partly because average lending quality towards the end of the preceding credit boom was better than in the US. With no tax relief allowed on mortgage payments for owner-occupiers in the UK, UK borrowers also had lower incentives to take on higher leveraged debt than in the US. As a result, negative equity was far lower than in the US. Furthermore, our estimates suggest that government intervention in the form of more generous income support for borrowers with payment problems lowered the foreclosure rate by at least 21%, and increased forbearance by lenders lowered the rate by perhaps 13%. The far lower long-run level of foreclosures in the UK is almost certainly influenced by the fact that UK mortgages are ‘full recourse’, meaning that lenders can access the other assets and the incomes of the borrowers for up to seven years until the debt is paid. In contrast, some US states have ‘no recourse’ mortgages – borrowers’ obligations cease after the keys are returned and they effectively walk away from the debt (hence the phrase, ‘jingle mail’). Even in states without such laws, the convention among US lenders appears to be not to attempt full recourse proceedings.\n\nIn the US, with mainly fixed-rate mortgages, debt service ratios did not fall rapidly after the mortgage crisis began. It seems likely that increased payment delinquencies were driven mainly by negative equity – borrowers expecting to foreclose and seeing no point in keeping up with payments – and higher unemployment. The trough-to-peak rise in the unemployment rate was 7% in the US, but 4% in the UK.\n\nWhy the UK’s 2009-11 mortgage crisis was so much less severe than that of 1991-95\n\nWith mainly floating rate mortgages, a serious risk for borrowers is that rates may rise. The UK bank base rate doubled from 7.5% to 15% from 1987 to 1990, following the house price and credit boom of the 1980s, and mortgage rates followed. This was partly induced by the higher rates stemming from German reunification in 1990. With inflation high and the UK in the Exchange Rate Mechanism, it proved impossible to bring rates down rapidly. The UK left the ERM in September 1992, unemployment rose sharply, and house prices experienced substantial falls. We estimate that around 20% of mortgages were in negative equity at the worst point, and payment arrears (delinquencies) reached record proportions (Figure 2). Cumulatively, 3% of mortgage borrowers suffered mortgage repossessions (foreclosures) in the 1990s. The subsequent boom, ending in mid-2007, again increased the proportion of households with overstretched budgets and over-extended debts relative to their assets. However, at its peak in early 2009, the UK repossessions rate reached only about half that of the 1990s repossessions peak. A deeper UK repossessions crisis was avoided mainly through dramatic monetary policy interventions, lenders’ forbearance policy, and increased government income support for those with payment difficulties. A key difference from 1990-92 was that there was low inflation and a flexible exchange rate, and the Bank of England’s policy interest rate (base rate) could be brought down quickly to half a percentage point. This rapidly lowered mortgage rates, and hence the debt service ratio for borrowers, given the predominance of adjustable rate mortgages in the UK. House prices were supported, preventing major rises in the proportion of households with negative equity. This played a key role in stabilising mortgage markets and the wider economy. Indeed, Aron et al. (2012) provide UK evidence for the direct impact of interest rates on consumption and their indirect impact via housing collateral.\n\nFigure 3 illustrates the model-fitted long-run contributions of negative equity, the debt service ratio, and the unemployment rate to variations in the repossessions rate (in logs). Comparing 2009-11 to 1991-96, note the rapid fall of the debt service ratio (and from a lower level), and the shorter duration and lower level of the proportion in negative equity.\n\nFigure 3 Estimated long-run contributions of key explanatory variables to the log repossessions rate\n\nMotivation and innovations in our study\n\nIn the absence of micro-data in the public domain, we estimated new aggregate models for the UK’s mortgage repossessions and arrears with quarterly data for 1983-2014 that were motivated by a conceptual double trigger framework for foreclosures and payment delinquencies (Aron and Muellbauer 2016). An important innovation is that difficult-to-observe variations in loan quality and access to refinancing, and the shifts in lenders’ forbearance policy, are estimated by common latent variables in a system of equations for arrears and repossessions. This greatly improves on the flawed but widespread use of loan-to-value measures. We also introduce, for the first time in the literature, a theory-justified estimate of the proportion of mortgages in negative equity as a key driver of aggregate repossessions and arrears. This measure is based on an average debt-to-equity ratio, corrected for regional deviations, and uses a functional form for the distribution of the debt-to-equity ratio checked on Irish micro-data from the Bank of Ireland, and Bank of England snapshots of negative equity (e.g. Bank of England 1992). We further systematically address serious measurement bias in the ‘months-in-arrears’ measures, neglected in previous UK studies. Finally, a universal assumption in previous UK studies (e.g. Brookes et al. 1994) of a proportional relationship between repossessions and arrears is relaxed in our system.\n\nArrears and repossessions are estimated jointly in a system of equations together with ‘loan quality/credit access’ (the LQ function) and forbearance policy proxies (the FP function). The LQ indicator measures the impact on current rates of repossessions and arrears of variations in earlier lending standards, in access to refinancing, and in government income support for borrowers with payment difficulties. The FP proxy captures ‘leniency’ of lenders that lowers the rate of repossession but raises the rate of arrears. The LQ and FP functions are mainly linear combinations of time dummies. Cross-equation constraints are imposed on the arrears and repossessions equations through the common LQ and FP functions. This latent variables approach improves on the widespread use of loan-to-value measures for first mortgages as indicators of loan quality, as these are not comparable over time and omit further advances of credit. The resulting functions in Figure 4 satisfy the priors for ‘loan quality/credit access’ and forbearance policy, in terms of the dating of shifts and the expected effects on repossessions and arrears, as explained in our paper.\n\nBy including these proxies for ‘loan quality/credit access’ and forbearance policy, just five variables are needed in the parsimonious empirical model to explain the history of arrears and repossessions over 1983-2014 and to assess future trends. Highly significant effects on aggregate rates of repossessions and arrears are found for the aggregate debt-service ratio, the proportion of mortgages in negative equity, and the unemployment rate. Economic forecast scenarios to 2020 highlight risks faced by the UK and its mortgage lenders, illustrating the usefulness of the approach for bank stress-testing. Figure 3 illustrates one forecast scenario to 2020.3 The demonstrated sensitivity of the outlook to variations in interest rates through the debt service ratio is particularly striking. The mortgage default module in one of the more developed models for financial risk assessment – the RAMSI model developed at the Bank of England (Alessandri et al. 2009) – could be considerably improved using the approach in our paper.\n\nFigure 4: An annotated version of forbearance and ‘loan quality/credit access’ functions4\n\nNotes: FAS = Financial Services Authority; ISMI = Income Support for Mortgage Interest; SMI = Support for Mortgage Interest.\n\nMacro- versus micro-data on mortgage default and delinquency in the UK and the US\n\nA careful study of the aggregate data is pertinent in the UK, given the paucity of micro-data on mortgage defaults in the public domain. By contrast with a long history of US empirical literature on borrower mortgage default or lender foreclosure, the set of UK empirical studies on repossession and arrears is strikingly limited. Reviews of the US literature into the 1990s on mortgage default and delinquency (e.g. Quercia and Stegman 1992), and a special focus on empirical testing of option theoretic models of default (Vandell 1995), reveal even then a wealth of micro-data based studies from both lender and borrower perspectives. The limited quality and availability of corresponding micro-data sets in the UK has constrained the possible analyses. The only micro-candidate for a random sample is the British Household Panel Study (BHPS), but these data are sparse and untimely, and there are problems drawing aggregate implications from them. This accounts for the small number of (predominantly macro-based) UK empirical studies, employing a hybrid of the recent default/delinquency theories in reduced form regression models.\n\nQuercia and Stegman (1992) characterise the evolution of mortgage default studies in the US in a typology of three generations. The first generation, from the 1960s onwards, focused from a lender’s perspective on simple correlations or empirical regression models capturing, at loan origination, the characteristics of the mortgages (e.g. loan-to-value ratio, interest rate and mortgage term) and of borrowers (e.g. family size, location, marital status, junior financing and characteristics of employment) that might be correlated with later default. A second generation of empirical models derived from theoretical models that instead emphasised factors influencing the borrowers’ decisions on payment, prepayment, delinquency, or default. A special case is the large literature on option theoretic models from the mid-1980s, in its simplest form abstracting from transactions costs (‘frictionless’ models), where prepayment is treated as a call option and default as a put option in a competitive market. Such models predict immediate default if a property’s value drops to the level of the mortgage value minus a small margin depending on house price volatility (‘ruthless default’; see Vandell 1995). These models exclude borrower characteristics. Related studies suggest a role for ‘trigger events’ (Riddiough 1991), or crises affecting income (such as divorce or loss of employment), that when intersecting with marginal equity, may precipitate the move from a delinquent state with negative equity to default. This introduces a role for ability-to-pay factors in addition to equity. The so-called third generation of models mainly represent a technological improvement on the second generation models in applying proportional hazard models to estimate default probabilities, and utilising a measure of mortgage risk that better reflects lenders’ concerns: expected mortgage loss rather than default rates, as in most second generation studies.\n\nThe predominant empirical model in the literature stems from the second and third generational research and finds an important role for net equity in default risk, but also some evidence for borrower effects and transactions costs, though these effects are less well understood Examples focused on the subprime crisis are Foote et al. (2008), Gerardi et al. (2008), Bajari et al. (2009), Haughwout et al. (2009) and Bhutta et al. (2010). However, as Bajari et al. make clear, the neglected factors of lending quality or credit constraints do not find an obvious place in the utility-maximising framework underlying second generational and option theoretical models. These require an extension to such models.\n\nThese US studies are entirely based on micro-data. Deriving aggregate implications from such studies is far from straightforward. One problem is that most micro-data sets are not representative of all US households with mortgages. A second problem is that, in most studies, data on debt levels are restricted to the initial loan and do not capture later, additional borrowing or refinancing. A third problem is that structural changes in lending conditions may have altered loan conditions in ways not captured by observables. Also, if changes in the macroeconomic environment are tracked by time dummies in micro-panels, then macro implications from such studies are not fully identified. Despite the now widespread availability of loan level data, it can be argued that analysis of aggregate data in the US would be a useful complement. Loan level datasets in the US do not equal the universe of all loans. Securities data cover only a subset of the market, which before 2002 was a small subset; service data are broader, but only reliable from 2005 and cover only two-thirds of the market. For a long national time series, the only option is the Mortgage Bankers Association National Delinquency Survey (NDS), from the early 1970s, but this only provides the sort of aggregates we use for the UK. With a combination of Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) price indices (back to the 1970s), the Federal Reserve Financial Obligations Ratio (back to 1980) and the NDS, one could construct a model of aggregate delinquency rates for the US going back at least as far as 1980.\n\nIn our study, aggregate debt data used to measure debt service ratios and to infer negative equity includes further loans. The latent variable approach to imputing loan quality, access to credit, and policy shifts is designed to capture structural changes affecting loan defaults, jointly with the key macroeconomic variables. Data on defaults by vintage of issue would be particularly helpful to enhance our models, particularly at the level of individual lenders, where bank stress-testing is required. The ‘loan quality/credit access’ shifts then could be better identified, and with such data, it should also prove possible to better link lending quality measures with observable loan characteristics. The modelling framework, with some adaptation, is also suitable for drilling down further to the level of individual loan histories, where the estimated ‘loan quality/credit access’ and forbearance policy dummies would be valuable controls to analyse time-varying drivers of arrears and repossession transitions.\n\nModels linking macro-variables and micro-credit indicators with rates of mortgage default potentially have much to offer the stress-testing systems currently under development by central banks and prudential supervisors (see Foglia 2009), and would also be highly relevant for developing early warning systems. One priority for future work is to endogenise house prices and the aggregate mortgage stock – checking for possible feedbacks from repossessions, and perhaps arrears – onto house prices and the mortgage stock, so capturing an important linkage in the financial accelerator (discussed further in Duca et al. 2010).\n\nAuthors’ note: Support is acknowledged from the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG) for whom the authors forecast UK arrears and repossessions during 2010-2014; the Economic and Social Research Council via the UK Spatial Economics Research Centre; and the Open Society Foundation and Oxford Martin School.

  "latent_2604": "Why CIOs Have to Work Harder Than Other Executives\n\nI was having dinner with a CIO who had retired after a long and distinguished career. The conversation had been mostly small talk, but suddenly a thought occurred to him, and he sat up straight in his chair.\n\n“Why is it,” he asked vehemently, “that CIOs have to work so much harder than every other executive at making their role in the business understood?”\n\nIt was a rhetorical question, but I made an attempt to answer it anyway. “It’s partly because of the ‘magic’ around IT that I’ve described in my book,” I said. “Business executives don’t have a fundamental understanding of what IT is all about, and they compartmentalize IT and use the CIO as an intermediary. They talk to the CIO, and they rely on the CIO to translate what they need into the technical double-talk they think is used in the IT organization. It’s like the wizard role I talk about in my book; the CIO is perceived as the chief wizard, but everything inside the wizard’s organization is too mystical for business people to understand.”\n\n“But that’s crazy,” he answered. “You don’t see the same sort of attitude toward other complicated parts of the business. Business executives go out of their way to learn all of the important aspects of finance and accounting. They don’t view the CFO as an intermediary – they know what the CFO has to do and they hold the CFO accountable for doing it. Finance is just as complicated as IT, but business people take classes in it until they understand it.”\n\nI paused to reflect on his statement. He was right – you never hear about CFOs looking for “alignment” with the business, nor do you hear about alignment issues in other parts of the business. I searched my brain for an answer. What’s fundamentally different between finance and IT?\n\nI thought about the classes he mentioned. “I don’t think the classes in IT really teach the right things to business people,” I conjectured. “Introductory finance classes cover fundamental accounting principles, income statements, balance sheets, double-entry accounting, budgeting and capitalization. The more advanced finance classes cover sources of business funding, and the use of various approaches to underwrite the day-to-day financial needs of the business, and to reduce business risk through diversification and the use of offsets.”\n\n“IT classes on the other hand,” I continued, “cover things like computers and data storage, networking and software development. If finance were taught the same way then they would teach you how to use a spreadsheet, how to close out a financial period, and how to write an annual report. IT classes emphasize tools, while financial classes emphasize principles and how to apply the principles to the business. IT principles that are important to the business – like the ones in my book – seldom get taught.”\n\nI went on, “Finance also has a uniform way of presenting its current position – a standard scorecard using well-understood definitions of balance sheets and income statements. IT has nothing like that; there is no uniform way to present the status of IT. There is no standard for an enterprise architecture view of the systems in a business. There is no standard way to represent the status of IT projects. There is no standard for showing the state of IT infrastructure, revealing areas of risk and areas of excessive investment.”\n\n“OK,” he answered, “Maybe you’re right about finance, but what about other complicated parts of a business? What about operations in a manufacturing business? Or research and development in a pharmaceutical company? Or even marketing in a consumer products company? There are no standard ways to show the state of those parts of a business. They’ve each got complicated things going on, but they aren’t viewed as mystical by the CEO.”\n\n“That’s an interesting point,” I said. “Let’s go through your examples one by one. In a manufacturing business you can portray the process with a diagram showing inputs and outputs: you put raw materials in, you ‘turn the crank,’ and you get manufactured products out the other end. Sure the turning-the-crank part is complicated, but it can usually be represented in some sort of high-level process diagram, and then you can ‘drill down’ to show more and more detail underneath each part of the process diagram.”\n\n“When a CEO looks at the diagram,” I went on, “he or she can see the fundamental manufacturing process. Bottlenecks – or limits to production – can be represented in the diagram, and anyone can see where you could invest to make the process smoother. So even though manufacturing is often complicated, in almost every case someone goes to the trouble of using a pictorial representation of the manufacturing process to convey simple information about the status. The CEO may not understand all of the technology used in manufacturing, but each piece of manufacturing equipment can be viewed by the CEO as a ‘black box’ in the diagram with inputs, outputs and operating characteristics.”\n\n“Your second example was R&D in a pharmaceutical company,” I continued. “R&D is generally viewed by business executives using the classic ‘investment portfolio’ model: each R&D investment can be viewed as having an investment amount, a risk, and a probable return. The probabilities of the success of each R&D investment will vary greatly, but taken together, the R&D investments will generally provide a payback to the company. It’s like drilling oil wells: You know you’re not going to hit oil with every hole you drill (although you use science to help you pick the very best spots), but you know that you’ll hit oil on some reasonable percentage of the holes you drill, and that makes it all worthwhile.”\n\n“What was your last example again?” I asked.\n\n“Marketing in a consumer products company,” said the CIO. “Surely you’ll agree that marketing isn’t viewed as mystical.”\n\n“Well, it’s complicated,” I said. “But again, it’s like R&D investment or drilling oil wells: You invest in various marketing campaigns, and you hope to find a few that will generate a significant increase in your sales revenue. Then you fine-tune them to maximize the revenue.”\n\n“The trick with marketing,” I said laughingly, “is to figure out whether a revenue increase is in fact related to a marketing campaign at all. At least with oil wells, you know which wells are producing oil. With marketing, you’re never quite sure which marketing campaigns cause your sales increase. It’s mystical, all right, but it’s more like gambling than investment.”\n\n“I see your point,” said the CIO, “but I still don’t understand why CEOs can’t relate to IT. If they can deal with manufacturing and all its complexities, and if they can cope with R&D and marketing with all of their uncertainties, then why can’t they just treat IT like any other part of the business?”\n\n“Maybe it’s because they just don’t want to,” I ventured. “It’s like having a car mechanic to take care of your car. If you trust the mechanic then you don’t have to worry about how the car works, and so you don’t bother learning.”\n\n“But that’s terrible,” exclaimed the CIO. “IT isn’t just about mechanics – it’s about all the data and information processes in the business. Isolating IT as if the IT organization is just a bunch of infrastructure mechanics is like closing your eyes to all of the wonderful contributions that can be made by IT throughout the business. It’s as if the CEO is assuming that everything is good enough ‘as is,’ and IT’s job is just to take requests from various business units. That’s not the way to get the most out of IT.”\n\n“You’re right, of course,” I replied. “but in a lot of companies, the view of IT as a trusted mechanic – dismal as it is – is just an aspiration. In many companies IT is treated as a mechanic, but without the trust. That makes things even worse: You take requests, you’re not involved in business strategy discussions, and your organization isn’t trusted to deliver what’s been requested. In those companies there’s an adversarial relationship between IT and other business organizations. I’ve worked with a few companies like that, and it’s no fun.”\n\n“I’ve seen a few of those myself,” said the CIO. “In a situation like that you have to first build a trusting relationship between IT and the business. Only then can you try to take IT into more of a strategic role.”\n\n“So let’s get back to the original question,” continued the CIO. “Why is it that CIOs have to work so much harder than every other executive at making their role in the business understood?”\n\n“Your guess is as good as mine,” I concluded. “But it’s a shame, isn’t it?”\n\n[Note: I really was at a recent dinner with a retired CIO, and he really did ask the question mentioned in this article. The conversation started out the way I describe, but the rest of this hypothetical conversation took place later in my head. It’s a lot harder to come up with good answers on the spur of the moment.]",
  "latent_2614": "Three members of Congress have applied for visas to visit Iran later this month to serve as volunteer monitors of Iran’s upcoming elections.\n\nReps. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), and Frank LoBiondo (R-N.J.) applied for the visas at the Iranian Interests Section of the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, which serves as Iran’s de facto DC diplomatic headquarters. They explained their actions in an open letter to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps commander Maj. Gen. Ali Jafari. The congressmen wrote that they were excited to observe Iran’s parliamentary elections, scheduled for February 26. “What a historic occasion,” they wrote.\n\nWe look forward to seeing Iranian democracy in action. It would be a shame if there weren’t any Americans present to validate that the elections were free and fair, for the first time in the clerical regime’s history.\n\nThey went on to add that they were concerned by reports that Iran’s Guardian Council disqualified the applications of 99% of reformist and moderate candidates last month, and said that they would “welcome the opportunity to be convinced that these elections will be fair and free.”\n\nThen-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was re-elected in 2009 in a vote that was largely believed to be fraudulent. The dissatisfaction with the results of that vote led to the Green Movement, a wave of protests that was brutally suppressed. Ahmadinejad’s election challenger remains under house arrest six years later.\n\nThe congressmen’s letter also explained that while in Iran, they would like to meet with American citizens currently being detained by the government, receive a military briefing to understand Iran’s side of the story after the detention of U.S. Navy sailors last month, and visit Iranian nuclear facilities to ensure that the Islamic Republic is complying with the terms of last year’s nuclear deal.\n\n“It is critical that we, as members of Congress, visit Iran and verify whether or not this country will uphold the terms of the nuclear deal,” Pompeo said in a statement. “It is also important to have Americans present to observe if Iran’s elections are free and fair. If Iran is truly a partner in peace, as President Obama and Secretary Kerry claim, then Iranian leaders should have no problem granting our visas and arranging the requested agenda. I look forward to receiving a timely response from Iran.”\n\n“For the past year, we have been repeatedly assured by President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei of a new era of openness and cooperation between the United States and Iran,” LoBiondo added. “In the spirit of such openness and cooperation, my colleagues and I should be able to visit Iran and see firsthand what we have requested to review, including the upcoming Iranian elections. Approving the visa applications of Member of the U.S. Congress would be a sign of good faith from the Iranian government.”\n\nIn response, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the chairman of the Iranian parliament’s committee on national security and foreign policy, replied that the congressmen have no right to make such requests because Iran has “transparent” elections, the semi-official PressTV reported on Sunday.\n\n“Elections in the Islamic Republic of Iran need no international oversight and in case of any need [for monitoring], that [monitor] will definitely not be the United States,” Boroujerdi said. He added that the three members of congress had no right to ask permission to monitor the elections because Iran “has the most powerful democracy in the region and our elections are quite transparent and in line with international regulations.”\n\n[Photo: Mohamad Sadegh Heydari / Wikimedia]",

  "latent_2847": "For months, critics and candidates have been publicly denouncing what they view as open favoritism of the Democratic National Committee (and particularly DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz) toward Hillary Clinton. Even DNC members have objected to the role of the DNC and the view that it is trying to guarantee that Clinton is the nominee. Despite fairly universal criticism of the favoritism showed Clinton (and opposition showed Sanders), Wasserman Shultz and DNC officials publicly denounced any such suggestions of working against Sanders. Now, with the Wikileaks postings, various emails prove that the DNC has been actively working to undermine Sanders and advance their chosen candidate of Hillary Clinton. What continues to shock me is the unblinking dishonesty of Washington. Absent this Wikileaks disclosure, officials would have continued to deny that they secretly undermined all challengers to Clinton. It is sheer mendacity of the power elite in this city that is so chilling.\n\nWikiLeaks posted an email from Mark Paustenbach, the Democratic Party’s national press secretary and deputy communications director, to other staffers discussing how they could create an anti-Sanders narrative that portrays his campaign in disarray and not an acceptable option for voters.\n\nBrutal: What Trump Just Released on Obama is Going Viral\n\nCould You Replace All Your Wedges With One Club?\n\n“Erase” Your Eye Bags & Wrinkles In Just 1 Minute!\n\nSponsored by Revcontent\n\n“Wondering if there’s a good Bernie narrative for a story, which is that Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess. . . “Specifically, DWS had to call Bernie directly in order to get the campaign to do things because they’d either ignored or forgotten to something critical. She had to call Bernie after the data breach to make his staff to respond to our concerns. Even then they didn’t get back to us, which is why we had to shut off their access in order to get them to finally let us know exactly how they snooped around HFA’s data. “It’s not a DNC conspiracy, it’s because they never had their act together,” Paustenbach continued.\n\nOther emails shows collusion with the Clinton campaign and even an effort to start an attack against Sanders on the basis of his religious beliefs. For example, a May 2016 message from DNC CFO Brad Marshall suggested that the party should “get someone to ask” Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders about his religious beliefs.\n\nFrom:MARSHALL@dnc.org\n\nTo: MirandaL@dnc.org, PaustenbachM@dnc.org, DaceyA@dnc.org\n\nDate: 2016-05-05 03:31\n\nSubject: No shit\n\nIt might may no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.\n\nThe email was sent to DNC Communications Director Luis Miranda and Deputy Communications Director Mark Paustenbach. It’s unclear who the “someone” in this message could be — though a member of the press seems like a safe bet. A request for comment sent to Marshall was not immediately returned.\n\nSo here you have not only a high ranking DNC official actively working to discredit Sanders (while the DNC is expressing shock over suggestions of favoritism) but suggesting a despicable attack based on his religious beliefs. The emails show both an campaign against Sanders and the falsity of statements made to the public.\n\nA reply to Marshall’s email from DNC CEO Amy Dacey read only “AMEN.”\n\nSo it appears that religion runs deep among the DNC staff . . . at least when it comes to destroying Sanders and rigging the election for Clinton. The planned use of a candidate’s religious beliefs or agnostic views against him is a disgraceful and dishonorable act for any party. All of the officials planning such an attack (or staying silent with knowledge of such an attack) should be fired.\n\nAt a minimum, in my opinion, Wasserman Schultz should resign in light of these emails and the now reaffirmed allegations of bias at the DNC. Furthermore, these officials should be immediately held accountable if the DNC wishes to regain any semblance of being an honest broker for democratic voters.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nReddit\n\nFacebook",

  "latent_2908": "Syrian anti-regime protesters carry a picture of President Assad that reads, \"Leave. We don't trust you. You will leave and we will stay because Syria is ours. Enough of injustice and killing,\" during a rally in the southern suburb of Maadamiya, Damascus, Syria in July 2011. (Photo: AP)\n\nThe following is the Afterword to Charles Glass’s new book Syria Burning from Or Books. In it, Glass puts the failure of the Syria revolution into a broader historical context where the United States, with its European and Arab allies, have manipulated and subverted movements for change in the Middle East for decades. You can buy Syria Burning here.\n\nCould Syria’s revolution have been different? At its birth in the spring of 2011, it promised hope for a better, freer life for Syria’s people. Syrian aspirations resonated with lovers of liberty everywhere: an end to governmental corruption and arbitrary arrest; an independent judiciary; a free press; equality before the law; abolition of torture; genuine elections leading to legitimate authority; and democratic institutions responsible to the governed. The state responded with arrests and violence. Dissidence evolved into war. Those who eventually captured the revolution dropped its original objectives in favor of supplanting a secular dictatorship with a dictatorial theocracy. The revolution was defeated from within, albeit with much assistance from outside powers motivated by anything but the good of the Syrian people.\n\nThirty-five years earlier, a coalition of progressive movements in neighboring Lebanon issued similar demands for reform. It may be helpful to recall what happened in Lebanon during a 15-year civil war that, despite an estimated 150,000 deaths and the transfer of populations into sectarian ghettos, left the corrupt antebellum system intact. In 1975, the year that Lebanon’s war erupted, there seemed nothing incongruous about a revolution led by what the French press called Islamo-progressites. The world had yet to witness the Islamic revolutions in Iran, Sudan, Libya, Egypt and Yemen. Those movements were more reactionary than progressive, less liberating than despotic. Yet, in those naïve times, progress and Islam did not seem self-contradictory. Indeed, Lebanon’s Christian parties, despite having sponsored social security and pension reform in parliament, resisted change, while Muslim militias waved the banner of revolutionary progress. It was a time when a Marxist historian, Maxime Rodinson, could write about Islam both critically and sympathetically without fear of assassination.\n\nRevolutions that begin with the goal of liberating people from the dead weight of an oppressive past often lead to a more oppressive present. Ideals give way to expediency. Those most likely to seize control of popular forces are pitiless rather than compassionate, well financed rather than independent, more conspiratorial than collaborative. Those who trust their fellow revolutionaries suffer for it, while the victors are those who first destroy the enemies on their own side. So it was in Lebanon; so it would be in Syria.\n\nThe Palestinian commando groups that had been expelled from Jordan in 1970 took their revolution to Lebanon, where it flourished. Initially secular, democratic and socialist, the Palestinian national movement threatened the sectarian, dictatorial and pseudo-capitalist oligarchies of the Arab world more than it ever did its ostensible enemy, Israel. The rich Arab oil states, notably Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, funded nationalist Palestinians like Yasser Arafat of Al Fateh as a counterweight to the more dynamic socialist movements led by George Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh. The leaders of the Popular and Democratic Fronts for the Liberation of Palestine happened to be Christians and secularists, whose followers included more Muslims than Christians. The princes, sheikhs and mullahs of the Arabian Peninsula rejected them and their philosophy. Saudi financing enabled Arafat’s Fateh, with its incoherent ideology and tensions between its secular and Islamist adherents, to claim the leadership of all Palestinians. Al Fateh used Saudi money to dominate its rivals in the Palestinian movement and to lead the Lebanese Left to self-destruction.\n\nThe idealists who demanded structural change in Lebanon’s body politic lost ground to the partisans of sectarian identity. From seeking an end to the distribution of political spoils from the presidency down to postal clerks by sect, they demanded merely a larger share of the spoils for Muslims, specifically Sunni Muslims from outside the traditional elite that had shared power with the Maronite Christians since the state’s independence. Instead of making all Lebanese equal before the law, as the socialists had proposed, they would recalibrate the distribution of state offices to reflect changed demographics. What had been a principle surrendered to the familiar horse-trading that Lebanon had inherited from the Ottoman Empire and the French Mandate. It was barely reform, certainly not worth killing or dying for.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the Left in Lebanon, as in Chile and other countries where popular movements challenged oligarchies dependent on the United States, met overwhelming external resistance. The US approved Saudi Arabia’s policy of co-opting and taming the Palestinian revolution and, with it, Lebanon’s National Movement. Saudi Arabia would go on to fund opposition to social change as far afield as Nicaragua, Afghanistan and, most recently, Syria.\n\nAs well as bolstering nationalist opposition to socialism, Saudi Arabia used the Islamists to undercut nationalism. Islamic revanchist movements funded by Saudi Arabia’s oil wealth resisted economic and social reform in Gamal Abdel Nasser’s Egypt in the 1950s and opposed education for women in Syria 20 years later. In Lebanon, they failed to represent the most impoverished segment of society, the Shiite Muslim peasantry whom Israel in its military onslaught against the Palestinians was exiling to the shanty towns of Beirut’s southern outskirts.\n\nArab nationalism, with its commitment to equality among Muslims, Christians and Jews, died in the Arab versus Arab bloodletting on the streets of Beirut in the 1970s. One motivating idea remained: Islam in political forms dictated by Saudi Arabia for the Sunnis and by Iran, after its 1979 revolution, for the Shiites. A political division within Islam that had lain dormant for centuries would torment Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, Bahrain, Syria and the eastern province of Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn the spring of 1976, the western half of Beirut was infected with the revolutionary ethos that saw the rich, like Italians fearful of the Brigate Rosse in the same era, hiding their jewelry and luxury cars from the envious glare of a roused proletariat. There were echoes of Orwell’s Catalonia in both the idealism of young zealots and the cynicism of power-hungry aspiring dictators. The US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, recognized the threat to American dominance, as he did in so many other countries, and fashioned a solution in the form of a Syrian invasion to protect the embattled old guard and control the excesses of the Palestinian-Lebanese rebels. The revolution died, but the war raged for another 14 years. The war ended, but only after two Israeli invasions and countless massacres. Foreign powers imposed a settlement at a conference in Taif, Saudi Arabia, in October 1989. By then, most Lebanese were willing to accept any outcome that allowed them to drive to work without fear of snipers, car bombs, artillery or kidnapping.\n\nLebanon, like Syria, saw democratic, secular dreams vanish into a sectarian maelstrom that ravaged the country and left it vulnerable to foreign invasion and local brutality. Yes, Lebanon’s old system encouraged corruption. Yes, there was injustice. Yes, a majority suffered from inequalities. Yet changing the system was no excuse to shred the fabric of a society that, for all its flaws, was tolerant of different creeds and political beliefs. Two revolutions perished in Lebanon, the Palestinian and the Lebanese. Security became more important than freedom, if only because so much freedom permitted the anarchic rule of kidnappers, gangsters, drug dealers, gun runners and fanatics. In the absence of central authority, the only states on Lebanon’s borders, Syria and Israel, occupied different halves of the country. The only militia to survive the war as an armed force was Hezballah, a sectarian grouping of religious Shiite Muslims that represents Iran and the perpetuation of sectarian politics in Lebanon.\n\nOne way to view the fanatic Islamicization of the Syrian revolution after 2011 is that it was the inevitable form of a rebellion inspired and financed by Saudi Wahhabism that sought not democracy but the elimination of rule by Alawite “infidels.” Another is that fratricidal violence marginalizes moderation, renders compromise impossible and pushes forward the most brutal actors. What was more surprising than the rise of fanatics within the revolution was that such disparate opposition forces had found any common ground at all. Like the leftists opposed to the Shah of Iran in 1979, Syria’s democrats saw their Islamist allies dispose of them and their beliefs when they were no longer needed. If the regime fell, the victors would replace it with a theocratic dictatorship that would purge the country of its diversity, its minorities, its dissidents and its tolerance.\n\nThe Syrian revolution lacked strategic vision because it began without any objective beyond reforming or replacing a regime that had nurtured as many allies as enemies. Too many rebel leaders sold themselves, as most Palestinian leaders did, to external paymasters for any one of them to establish popular, unifying credentials. Hundreds of armed groups came into being, sponsored by the United States, Britain, France, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey. The regime, which had almost 50 years to perfect mechanisms of control, played its cards better than rebels with no experience of government, no roots in social work and little experience of combat. Fighters with battle scars from Chechnya, Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Algeria and Libya dominated the rebel side of battlefield. When they trod across the border into Iraq and threatened American interests, the Obama administration responded with air strikes. Yet it did not admit it was wrong about Syria, the strength of the regime or the relative strength of fanaticism within the opposition. That would have meant admitting it was wrong to assume the regime was so unpopular and weak it would fall with a small push before the opposition turned from early reformist demands to radical Islamism.\n\nRobert Ford, the former US ambassador to Syria who had championed the revolution and encouraged its militarization, was a rare official who admitted that the policy he had espoused was mistaken. He told a conference in Washington in January 2015, after nearly 200,000 Syrian deaths and the displacement of a third of the population, “The people we have backed have not been strong enough to hold their ground against the Nusra Front.” If the US could not achieve its goals in Syria, he added, “then we have to just walk away and say there’s nothing we can do about Syria.” This is rich coming from an ambassador whose policies helped to create the fanatic groups controlling large regions of Syria and Iraq. To America’s policymaking adolescents, the world is a plaything to abandon when it breaks.\n\nThe rebels, using weapons made in America, paid for by Saudi Arabia and funneled through Turkey, imposed a vision of society that took no account of Syrian diversity and mutual respect among its peoples. Syria, as history records, welcomed the Armenian victims of Turkey’s genocide after the First World War and had long been home to heterodox forms of Islam. The goal of the self-proclaimed Islamic State and Jebhat an-Nusra was to make Syria something it never was: an extension of Saudi Arabia. No one heeded Nietzsche’s warning, quoted early in the revolution by Masalit Mati, writer of the satirical, anti-Assad Top Goon puppet show: “Be careful when you fight the monsters, lest you become one.”\n\nThe United States, with its European and Arab allies, had its own purposes in Syria. It strains belief that the US, Saudi Arabia and Qatar opposed Bashar al-Assad because he was a dictator or because his cousins were taking the lion’s share of the country’s wealth. The countries that crushed popular dissent against the royal family in Bahrain could not claim to believe in democracy for any Arab country. The US opposed Assad, as did the Saudis and Qataris, because he would not relinquish the alliance with Iran that gave him a strategic asset against Israel. Israel had occupied part of Syria since 1967 and showed no sign of relinquishing its hold or permitting the exiled inhabitants and their descendants to return. The Arab monarchies, which had sought to dominate Syria since it achieved independence from France in 1946, saw in Iran an adversary for control of Syria and, through Hezballah, Lebanon. To remove Assad was to eliminate Iranian influence in the Arab world.\n\nIn the midst of the Syrian war and despite Israel’s desire to humiliate Iran, the US opened a door to the regime in Tehran. Negotiations to regulate the Iranian nuclear program improved relations between the longtime adversaries. As American business scented an opportunity to return to the lucrative Iranian market, the raison d’être for America to eliminate Iran’s only Arab ally evaporated. US policy in Syria has floundered ever since.\n\nHopes for a negotiated end to the war receded with the deterioration in America’s relationship with Vladimir Putin’s Russia, Assad’s only ally apart from Iran and the regime in Baghdad, over Ukraine and the eastern expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The US, Russia, the Syrian regime and much of the Syrian opposition came to Geneva in January 2014 with no plan, no inclination to end Syrian agony and no purpose other than pushing their own goals to the detriment of a population that was enduring the daily reality of death, maiming, exodus and oppression from both camps. The dominant force in the Syrian revolution proclaimed itself a caliphate, beheaded innocent prisoners, raped and enslaved women, hurled young men from towers because of their sexual preferences and burned alive a young Jordanian soldier who fought for his country. This is where superpower, Turkish and Arab policies have led. Where will they take Syria next?",

  "latent_3087": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair offered on Friday to recognize pilot unions for the first time in its 32-year history in a last-minute attempt to avert its first-ever pilot strike.\n\nThe move convinced Italy’s largest pilot union to suspend a four-hour strike planned for Friday afternoon, but it was unclear if other unions would call off strikes planned for next week in Ireland and Portugal.\n\nInvestors also took fright at the potentially major change to the business model at Europe’s largest low-cost carrier, with Ryanair shares tumbling as much as 9 percent to 14.90 euros.\n\nWith his offer, Chief Executive Michael O’Leary is reversing a policy at the heart of the ultra low-cost model he developed to turn a small Irish regional airline into Europe’s biggest by passenger numbers. He was once quoted as saying he would rather cut off his own hand than recognize unions.\n\n“Recognizing unions will be a significant change for Ryanair, but we have delivered radical change before,” O’Leary said in a statement. “We hope and expect that these structures can and will be agreed with our pilots early in the new year.”\n\nThe pilots mobilized after Ryanair in September announced the cancellation of around 20,000 flights, which it blamed on a lack of standby pilots due to a failure in its rostering following a rule change by Irish regulators.\n\nPilot groups complain of a toxic work atmosphere and have said Ryanair is facing a major staffing shortage, but management has repeatedly denied this and says it offers some of the best pay and conditions in the sector.\n\nManagement was quick to reassure investors there would be no major changes to Ryanair’s business model based on filling seats irrespective of how low the fare and that it might be easier to attract pilots once unions were recognized.\n\nBut analysts said the move introduced significant uncertainty in terms of both staff costs and possible future disruption by emboldened employees.\n\n“It adds complexity, it adds uncertainty, and you can’t put a number on that,” said Mark Simpson at broker Goodbody.\n\nRelated Coverage German pilots' union ready for talks with Ryanair next week\n\nInvestec, though, said it saw the share price move as a buying opportunity and that it would not shift its target price from 19 euros.\n\nURGENT MEETINGS\n\nRyanair sent a letter to unions in Ireland, Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal at 0800 GMT on Friday to offer talks to formalize recognition and asking for confirmation that industrial action would not proceed.\n\nThe move comes after Ryanair pilots in several countries threatened to strike in the busy run-up to Christmas.\n\nWhile Italian union ANPAC suspended a strike due to take place between 1400 and 1800 GMT on Friday, the FIT-CISL transport union, which represents a smaller number of Italian pilots and some cabin crew, said the planned four-hour strike on Friday would go ahead.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Ryanair’s concession would be enough to stop a 24-hour stoppage by pilots in Ireland and Portugal on Dec. 20.\n\nANPAC and Irish union IALPA asked for urgent meetings with Ryanair, while British pilot union BALPA said it accepted the offer to start talks, describing the company’s change of heart as welcome. Other unions said they were considering their position.\n\nA Ryanair spokesman said “the sensible course of action” for both ANPAC and IALPA was to meet the airline on Wednesday, the day their strikes are due to take place, but to call off the threat of disruption before then.\n\nThe spokesman added that if other pilot unions approached management about recognition, it would consider their request.\n\nThe company will “wait and see what comes” before deciding about recognizing unions in other parts of the company, Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson told Reuters.\n\nA Ryanair commercial passenger jet is seen at Barcelona El-Prat Airport in Barcelona, Spain, October 10, 2017. Picture taken October 10, 2017. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard\n\nWilson said, however, he did not expect management would deal with an unofficial pan-European pilot body, the European Employee Representative Council (EERC), that pilots have formed in recent months, describing it as “unworkable.”\n\nManagement will, though, be open to talking to pilots about their demand to introduce local contracts rather than the Irish contracts used across Ryanair’s European bases.\n\nWilson said there was no reason to think costs would increase as a result of the move, but declined to comment on how the events of recent months might impact profitability.",

  "latent_3315": "R is for “Rightsizing.” Read past Blogging from A to Z Challenge posts by clicking here.\n\nEver heard of the term “rightsizing?”\n\nIn the business world, companies often use the term in place of downsizing because it sounds less drastic. It’s the process of restructuring by cost costing and reducing the workforce. The end goal of rightsizing in this sense is achieving maximum profits.\n\nIn my former world of city management, the term rightsizing describes street design. It’s a process of reconfiguring the layout of a street to essentially serve all modes of transportation — pedestrians, bicyclers, commuters, public transportation users, and individual drivers.\n\nIn the home building industry, rightsizing is not downsizing and simply moving into a ranch-style home once you’ve reached the empty-nester phase. Rightsizing here is the concept of making better use of existing spaces in your home. There is a mass movement to build smaller, “smarter,” durable, and resilient homes.\n\nNow my doctor probably wants me to work on rightsizing my body — lose a few pounds, exercise more, eat healthier, etc. I know little about this definition of rightsizing. Period. Full stop. Let’s move on.\n\nAs Earth Day passed by this week, I pondered this term rightsizing and how it applies for us inhabitants of Das Schmidt Haus, especially in relation to Care for God’s Creation, one of seven key themes at the heart of Catholic social teaching. Yesterday my daughter came home from preschool so excited to tell me it was Earth Day. “Mom, mom, mooooomm! Do you know what day it is today? It’s Earth DAAAAAAAAY! Let’s do something fun for Earth Day.”\n\nWell, this event director had nothing earthy planned and I wasn’t about to get crafty simply because the calendar read April 22, Earth Day. And this is not because I don’t believe in the principles of Earth Day. Remember, I’m the mad housewife who has been known to rescue cardboard, aluminum, and other recyclable materials from my neighbor’s garbage bins and place them in my recycling bin so those materials can have a proper burial — earth to earth, ashes to ashes, and dust to dust. Care for the earth is not just an Earth Day slogan; it is a requirement of our faith. We are called to protect people and the planet, living harmoniously with all of God’s creation.\n\nSo how are my actions matching that call? What am I doing to rightsize my behaviors in response to our Church’s instructions? Beyond recycling, I’m not really doing that much. So yesterday I wrote out some thoughts and set goals for our family to work on throughout the year. Here they are.\n\n1. Walk to the neighborhood stores\n\nWe live within walking distance, as in under .5 of a mile, to a major grocery store, a Walgreens, several restaurants, convenience store, bank, movie rental store, and on and on. There is absolutely no reason, in decent weather, we cannot walk to these locations to buy the household necessities, specifically the grocery store. Walking to the grocery store leads to having only so much room in my arms or stroller to carry items back home. This leads to only purchasing the necessary items, which then leads to less spoiling, throwing out, and wasting of food. Bonuses: supporting local business and getting a bit of exercise and fresh air are feel-good things, too.\n\n2. Garden\n\nBuild a vegetable garden and grow tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, peppers, and lettuce. And radishes. Oh yes, radishes. Finally looks like we’ll get a break in the weather this weekend, allowing us to plan and prepare some garden spaces.\n\n3. Compost\n\nBuild a compost pile to recycle food scraps and other biodegradable waste. Plus I just read that Chick-fil-A’s bags and waffle fry & nugget boxes can be composted, too. SCORE! If we eat fast food, it’s typically Chick-Fil-A. (Like I need another reason to continue patronizing them!)\n\n4. Declutter\n\nLast week we received notification from the county assessor that our home’s assessable value was once again devalued. Since purchasing the home in 2007, the home’s assessable value has decreased by nearly 10%. At the price point of our home, 10% is essentially equal to the all the equity we’ve invested. Like it or not, we are in this home for a while, so it seems like a good time then to apply the “rightsizing credo” to our home: simplify, declutter, organize, store things properly, and donate excess to Goodwill or the Habitat for Humanity ReStore. We can live with less, so much less. And with another bambino on the way, now is a great time to repurpose our living spaces.\n\n~ ~ ~\n\nSo there you have it — four “Care for God’s Creation” goals for Das Schmidt Haus. Does a list seem better to end at five? Well, I don’t have five, so four it is for now. Help me round it out. What are some lifestyle behaviors you practice in the spirit of Care for God’s Creation?",

That relationship could look very different depending who leads the party next, after Stephen Harper.\n\nTo be clear, there is no leadership race officially underway. Harper continues to say he will run in the next election. Nonetheless, and perhaps it was a coincidence, this weekend Manning Conference delegates got a chance to compare four more-or-less viable candidates to lead the party into its post-Harper era -- whenever that begins.\n\nOption 1: James Moore, the fast talker from B.C.\n\nTo date, Kim Campbell is the only British Columbian ever to lead a federal conservative party -- for about six months. Were Industry Minister James Moore to succeed Stephen Harper, he would hope to last a little longer at the top.\n\nOnly 37-years-old, Moore would nonetheless be a serious contender, says Maclean's political editor Paul Wells.\n\n\"James Moore is a peculiar figure in this government,\" says Wells. Socially liberal, he was an early supporter of gay marriage. Having served five years as the country's Heritage and Official Languages minister, he is impeccably bilingual and well respected in Quebec.\n\nHe is also a confidante of the prime minister, a relationship rendered in some detail in Wells' book, The Longer I'm Prime Minister. Wells, affectionately described by one former PMO staffer as \"the Bard of the Bubble,\" describes Moore's key role in convincing Harper to prorogue Parliament in 2008 as saving the government in the face of a Dion-Layton-Duceppe coalition.\n\n\"He is someone whose clout within this government is substantially greater than his age or his experience,\" says Wells.\n\nHe's also a compelling speaker. In a speech at this weekend's meeting, Moore chose an example from his own riding to illustrate his love for Canada and the conservative worldview.\n\n\"Terry Fox is buried half a mile from where I live, in a very humble little cemetery. This kid ran -- actually, he hopped -- a marathon a day. To try and raise $20 million for cancer research. One dollar for every Canadian.\"\n\n\"The greatness of Canada is not a politician who stands up and says, 'Dig me, I passed a law.' The greatness of this country are individual Canadians who stand up and do great and remarkable things. And what we as a government ought to do is to have the framework in place that empowers citizens... not punishing them when they succeed, with high taxes.\"\n\nIt's not clear how tax policy either punished or empowered Fox's Marathon of Hope, but Moore's thundering paean had conference delegates leaning forward in their seats.\n\nThe MP for Port Moody-Westwood-Port Coquitlam is uniquely attuned to the political realities of his home province. Talking about resource projects, he sounds very different from cabinet colleagues like, say, Joe Oliver.\n\n\"Sometimes it's hard for people who are locally affected to see the national benefit. Equally, it's hard for people who see the national benefit not to appreciate the local consequences of these projects,\" Moore tells me.\n\n\"The broader Canadian family needs to realize that if these projects are going to go forward, all people have to see the benefit of it, or at least have an ability to have some of their fears and concerns addressed through the process.\"\n\nIt's for those reasons, Moore says, that his government rejected Taseko's New Prosperity Mine, despite support from the province. It's clear he played a key role in the decision.\n\nOption 2: Jim Prentice, the tree-hugging banker\n\nDescribed as the de facto deputy prime minister, Prentice served as minister for aboriginal affairs, industry and environment, and chair of Harper's operations committee, before leaving in 2010 to take an executive position at CIBC. He's also, by his own description, a passionate angler and outdoorsman who is deeply preoccupied by what he sees as a false choice between energy development and the environment.\n\nIn a speech at the Manning Conference, Prentice again criticized the current administration's approach to pipeline politics. \"Mark my words. There will be no exports of Canada's oil from the west coast, nor [liquefied natural gas] terminals, unless we strike meaningful economic partnerships with First Nations.\"\n\nThe party's perceived indifference on the environment, Prentice warned, will hurt both Canadian industries and the Conservatives' political future.\n\n\"Around the world, the wave of concern over climate change crested a number of years ago. I know that. I was in Copenhagen. I have the scars to show for it. But those who are paying attention can see that the next wave is building again. And the wave will come. And trust me, when it crests on Canada's shore it will be at its highest point.\"\n\nPrentice made some delegates visibly uncomfortable, but he has many admirers. \"I thought it was a solid speech, showing that it's possible to reconcile resource development with environmental protection -- and conservatism with conservation,\" said Mark Cameron, a former senior advisor to Harper and policy director in the PMO.\n\n\"I think this government has done more than it gets credit for when it comes to working with First Nations -- the recent agreement on aboriginal education being a good example -- but it needs to do more,\" wrote Cameron in an email to The Tyee.\n\nFormer cabinet minister Chuck Strahl, now a lobbyist for pipeline company Enbridge, says Prentice is the kind of leader who could help reboot that relationship.\n\n\"You go to First Nations and say, what do you think? Was he a good Indian Affairs minister? They'll say, 'He's one of the good guys.' On the environment, he's one of the good guys. And when he left, everyone in the House, from all the parties, said he's one of the good guys.\"\n\nOption 3: Brad Wall, the Prairie populist\n\n\"Are you learning French?\" one reporter asked Brad Wall after he drew a standing ovation for his speech, titled Canada: Food and Energy Superpower. We should start acting like it.\n\n\"No,\" replied Wall. \"I'm still learning English.\"\n\nAfter a few giggles, the reporter tried again. \"Am I to understand that if you're not learning French, you're not interested in the leadership?\"\n\n\"I have the best job in Canada already,\" replied Wall. \"I think people should be asking Stephen Harper, why don't you want to be premier of Saskatchewan?\"\n\nWith a 64 per cent approval rating, the Saskatchewan Party leader is the country's second-longest serving first minister. Under his administration the province has reduced its debt, and is on track to deliver its seventh consecutive balanced budget.\n\n\"None of them balanced themselves,\" he quipped Friday -- a shot at Justin Trudeau that drew a predictable roar of approval.\n\nAll of this is possible thanks to a booming resource sector in Saskatchewan, and bumper crops. But there's a problem: rail cars can only carry one thing at a time.\n\nThese days CP and CN would rather carry oil. With a record wheat harvest and cold temperatures shortening trains, a backlog of grain has developed between Saskatchewan and the ships waiting to export it off Vancouver and Prince Rupert. Farmers are furious. Customers are fed up.\n\nSo Wall supports pipelines. Any and all pipelines, apparently. He criticized Trudeau again for supporting Keystone while opposing Northern Gateway. For Wall, pipelines are good if they take bitumen off the rails. And environmental initiatives are great, so long as they give the United States \"more elbow room\" to approve pipelines.\n\nAnd don't forget, folks, the Roughriders never won a Grey Cup under a CCF government.\n\nWall's populism can stray into provincialism -- an illustration, perhaps, of why no Canadian premier has yet gone on to become prime minister. But he's much liked inside and outside the conservative movement.\n\nOption 4: Jason Kenney, minister for curry in a hurry\n\nAt last year's Manning Conference, then-minister of Citizenship and Immigration Jason Kenney was described in the corridors as \"the Anointed One\": Harper's chosen successor. This year, as the Toronto Star's chief political writer Susan Delacourt puts it, \"Jason Kenney is up to something. I just can't figure out what.\"\n\nThere's no doubt Kenney would be a formidable contender for the leadership. He already rakes in twice as much money in his Calgary riding as Harper's next door. What's more, a significant chunk comes from donors in the Greater Toronto Area -- a legacy of his legendary ethnic outreach efforts in the lead-up to the 2011 election.\n\nDelacourt says if Kenney has his eye on one ministerial portfolio, it would be Finance, currently held by Jim Flaherty. It's an open question whether Flaherty will run again. Meanwhile, Kenney seems to go out of his way to frustrate his senior colleague.\n\nFor one, Kenney broke ranks and called on Toronto Mayor Rob Ford to resign, which Flaherty saw as an incursion onto his municipal turf. Worse, it was an insult to an old family friend. On the floor of the House of Commons, Flaherty was so angry he told Kenney to \"Shut the f--k up\" about Ford.\n\nAt the Manning Conference alone, Kenney announced he'd reached deals with every province but Quebec on the Canada Job Grant -- after Flaherty suggested the feds would have to go it alone. Then Kenney declared his unqualified support for income splitting, a key Conservative campaign promise that Flaherty has recently questioned.\n\nKenney, a bachelor, would derive no personal benefit from the tax break. Indeed, some pundits say his marriage status could be an impediment to leadership in a movement that remains centred on the traditional family.\n\nCertainly he is the candidate most closely associated with Harper, and with Harper's hyper-partisan, controlling approach to government.\n\nThe minister can certainly be credited with inspiring the tactics that led to B.C. Premier Christy Clark's own \"ethnic outreach\" scandal, and the controversy over her exclusive media availabilities for \"ethnic press.\"\n\nDelacourt says the word in Ottawa is that Kenney, like Lord Varys in Game of Thrones, has built his own network of informants. \"I'm told if there's a meeting on Parliament Hill, Jason has a person in there to tell him what's happening. Paul Martin's people did much the same thing.\"\n\n\"He's getting himself ready for something, but it may not be leadership,\" says Delacourt. \"I may be with the crowd that thinks he's going to be the kingmaker.\"\n\nNext steps\n\nRegardless of who leads the federal party into the next election, Preston Manning reminds conservative campaigners they will never really get a chance to coast.\n\nFirst there are the fall municipal races in Vancouver and Toronto, where pollsters, organizers and data gurus connected to Manning's centre are already hard at work -- in Vancouver, for the NPA, and in Toronto, for Ford opponent John Tory.\n\nBut beyond individual elections, Manning says the primary job of the movement is to train and organize, year in and year out -- so conservative candidates can win more often at every level of government.\n\n\"You've seen that Canadian Tire commercial that says, 'There is no such thing as an unassisted goal.' It's true,\" said Manning in his closing address. \"If there was only one function that the conservative movement could perform on behalf of the parties and those who seek elected office, I suggest that it should be the promotion and delivery of training.\"\n\nManning sees the current dip in support for the Conservative Party as cyclical. Enough Canadians share core conservative values, he believes, that a movement built to represent them should win more often than it loses.\n\nBut values alone aren't enough. Speeches and conferences are only a start. Ultimately, each individual voter has to be identified and coaxed to the polls. That work is never done.\n\nManning's goal is that no matter who puts on the captain's \"C\" after Harper, the team behind them will be ready.",

(Photo: John Moore, Getty Images)\n\nJohn Kasich is using his starkest terms yet to distinguish himself from Donald Trump, as the Republican primary moves to states where Kasich has his best — and, perhaps, final — shot of consolidating the anti-Trump forces.\n\nPoliticians who take approaches such as Trump's \"feed their own insatiable desires for fame and for attention,\" Kasich said Tuesday in New York City. \"That could drive America down into a ditch and not make America great again.\"\n\nKasich was careful in his speech Tuesday not to name the GOP front-runner, but his critiques of \"disturbing\" individual policies made it clear Trump was the target of his speech.\n\n\"A political strategy based on exploiting Americas instead of lifting them up inevitably leads to division, paranoia,\" Kasich said. \"This path to darkness is the antithesis of all that American has meant for the last 240 years.\"\n\nThe Ohio governor is entering two must-perform weeks for his campaign. He trails his rivals, Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, by several hundred delegates. His presidential hopes rest on a bid to carry on until the GOP convention in July in Cleveland, where he hopes to win over GOP votes in the case that no one wins a majority of delegates during state-by-state primaries.\n\nBut to make it to Cleveland, Kasich must build on his delegate total, giving voters and, more importantly, donors the impression that he has a chance to pull off the convention win. He also needs to finish ahead of Cruz in some states, calling into question the Texas senator's burgeoning status as the alternative to Trump.\n\nModerate, urban voters in New York, which votes next week, and in several other East Coast states, which vote April 26, offer Kasich his best chance of gaining some momentum. In New York, for instance, Kasich is fighting to stay ahead of Cruz, with both candidates polling around 20%, while Trump leads polls with about 54% in his home state.\n\nTo that end, Kasich's political action committee and campaign are running commercials in New York and Pennsylvania, despite already low bank accounts. Kasich's speech Tuesday, given to the Women's National Republican Club and livestreamed by several news outlets, also offered the cash-strapped campaign half an hour in free exposure in the media-obsessed state of New York.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1N6NcDJ",

Robert Hanashiro/USA TODAY\n\nBut the better fuel economy comes at an extra price premium\n\nMike Cairns, Chief engineer for Chrysler Group?s Ram truck division with the new Dodge light duty Ram 1500 diesel pickup. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro USA TODAY) Story Highlights Ram has put a diesel engine back in light-duty pickup truck\n\nIt get better gas mileage than a V-8 with V-6 fuel economy\n\nBut it comes at a hefty price premium\n\nWESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. — It has taken years, but at last, diesel engines are back in light-duty pickups.\n\nChrysler Group's Ram division has a new six-cylinder diesel that will go into the 1500 pickup early next year. Nissan plans to follow with a V-8 diesel engine for its Titan pickup. And surely, Ford and General Motors are watching from the wings.\n\n\"They've all got their toes in in the water,\" says Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the Diesel Technology Forum, a diesel advocacy group.\n\nBut diesel engines are more costly, and it's yet to be seen whether truck buyers will swallow the higher sticker price in exchange for fuel savings.\n\nYet, the advantages can't be ignored. Diesel engines are more fuel efficient, even after accounting for the higher cost of diesel fuel. They have better low-end torque, which means better towing power, often a critical factor in pickup purchases.\n\nBuyers of full-size trucks look up to owners of heavy-duty pickups, or even huge commercial trucks, the majority of which are diesels. Call it a macho thing.\n\nAutomakers tried diesels in light pickups a generation ago, from Chevrolet to Isuzu. But they came in era when fuel prices were lower, and technology to get the most out of them had yet to come along.\n\nToday, big improvements are giving diesels another chance. For instance, the 3-liter V-6 Ram diesel will be paired with an eight-speed transmission, which is aimed at taking greater advantage of the engine's lower-rev pulling power.\n\n\"The name of the game is making larger vehicles more relevant,\" says Ram President Reid Bigland at an event here north of Los Angeles to show off the new engine. \"You make them more relevant by making them more fuel efficient.\"\n\nThe Ram diesel, dubbed the EcoDiesel, hasn't yet received its official mileage ratings for the pickup. But in the Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV, where the same diesel is being made an option, it is expected to be rated at 30 miles per gallon on the highway. By contrast, the Ram 1500 pickup, with a 5.7-liter V-8 Hemi, gets 22 mpg on the highway. There is a lot of room if the new diesel pickup comes close to the Jeep.\n\nThe pushback comes with a price. The diesel will cost $2,860 more than the same truck with the Hemi, which itself carries a $1,900 premium over the standard Pentastar V-6 engine.\n\nThe diesel \"has the capability of a V-8 with the fuel economy of a V-6,\" says Bob Hegbloom, a Ram truck director. The truck drove as quietly as one with a gas engine, its diesel nature only truly noticeable as the truck accelerated, where the extra torque is fully on display. The engine develops 240 horsepower and 420 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThe engine is made in Italy, where Chrysler parent Fiat is based.\n\nObservers think Ram could potentially have hit on its hands. \"It's going to be huge,\" says Karl Brauer, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book, who took a turn driving the new truck. \"At the end of the day, it's a pricey option,\" but truck buyers already know the benefits and will be willing to fork over the extra cash.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1f3LT6F",
  "latent_3796": "Fundamentally, I am a proponent of the Paleolithic diet. However, much depends on the specifics of the Paleo diet in question. The designation seems to be somewhat open to interpretation -- and thus the dietary devilry may reside in the details.\n\nThat, in essence, is the punch line for this piece -- and I provide it right away as a bow to a recent correspondent who reminded me that busy readers want the take away, right away. I do, however, hope you hang in there for the rest. Assuming so, let's start this tale at the beginning.\n\nIn June of this year, U.S. News & World Report published a ranking of diets for weight loss and health promotion. They circulated the contestants to a panel of 22 judges, all with relevant expertise, who scored each diet in multiple categories. Scores were tallied and winners declared. The overall winner for weight loss was Weight Watchers. The Paleo diet fared rather badly.\n\nShortly after the rankings were published, I was contacted by ABC News and asked to comment on why the Paleo diet had been scored so poorly and what I thought about it. My first comment was that I was one of the 22 judges, and that I had not scored the Paleo diet poorly. I went on to say that I considered a true \"Paleo diet\" -- with an emphasis on eating foods direct from nature and more plants than animals -- a good idea. I also noted that the name could mask a host of ills, such as a diet of hamburgers, hot dogs and bacon.\n\nApparently, the gist of my comments as quoted by ABC News suggested I was a general critic of the Paleo diet, and also conveyed my impression that our ancestors actually ate more plants than animals.\n\nThis resulted in correspondence from Loren Cordain, a Professor in the Department of Health and Exercise Science at Colorado State University, who has published extensively on our Stone Age diet and its implications. Prof. Cordain's note was very civil, but nonetheless a chastisement of my excessive emphasis on gathering over hunting, with a cc to a veritable who's who in paleoanthropology.\n\nI explained to Prof. Cordain, and the others listening in, that I am a proponent of our true ancestral diet, while dubious about its many modern variants. The notion -- expressed in much of Prof. Cordain's own work -- that our ancestors ate a lot of meat, has invited modern carnivores to run up their \"Paleo diet\" banner and claim to be eating under it.\n\nBut they are not, because modern meat is not Stone Age meat. There were no wild corned beef, salamis or pastramis in the Stone Age, so processed meat is certainly off the Paleo diet menu. There were no grain-fed cattle; no pigs fed slop; and no domesticated feed animals raised without demands on their muscles, either.\n\nThe flesh of animals our ancestors ate was generally quite lean, often with fat content around 10 percent of calories or lower. That fat was far more unsaturated than the fat in most modern meats as well and even provided some omega-3.\n\nProf. Cordain noted that the flesh of grass-fed cattle approximates the Paleo experience, albeit imperfectly. Game does so even better. I concur -- but how much of this is there in the modern food supply? In my experience, many people who use the Paleo diet as justification for carnivorous preferences simply eat more of the kind of meat they tend to find. And generally, they are not finding antelope.\n\nThe issue of animal vs. plant foods remained, however, and I was fully prepared to simply respond with \"mea culpa\" (I know when I'm out of my weight class!), when Dr. S. Boyd Eaton of Emory University was gracious enough to contribute his views. While many papers examining the proportion of hunting to gathering are based on averages among modern-day hunter gatherers in diverse locales, Dr. Eaton has focused on African populations thought to most closely approximate the original human experience. Dr. Eaton's work suggests a plant:animal calorie ratio of 1:1.\n\nWhich, in essence, suggests that any apparent differences I had with Prof. Cordain were a bit about semantics (volume vs. calories), and a bit about which data to emphasize. Since plants tend to be energy-dilute and animals energy-dense, to get a 1:1 calorie ratio means a much greater than 1:1 ratio of plant food volume to animal food volume. It means quite a lot of gathering along with the hunting. Mostly plants, in other words, is not demonstrably wrong. Seemingly in the company of Dr. Eaton, I think my original assertion defensible.\n\nOf course, the true beginning of a story about our Stone Age diet resides not with U.S. News & World Report, but in the Stone Age. The Paleolithic era, spanning our use of rough stone implements, extends some 4 million years into the past.\n\nWe may reasonably limit ourselves to the latter half of that span and focus on the emergence of our Homo erectus forebears, thought to be the first highly effective human hunters, roughly 2 million years ago. Our own species, sapiens, arose roughly 300,000 years ago and our particular subspecies, sapiens sapiens, roughly 30,000 years ago. Agriculture was not part of the human experience until roughly 12,000 years ago -- and once it was, nothing was ever the same. But that's a story for another time.\n\nThe Stone Age thus provided several thousand millennia to shape the adaptations of our genus, and several hundred to shape those of our species. We carry the genes of the well-adapted, because ancestors not well-suited to survive, reach adulthood and make babies ... make very poor ancestors. Like all modern creatures, we are the posterity of pre-modern creatures who \"had the stuff,\" and paid it forward.\n\nAmong the stuff that mattered was the capacity to extract all necessary fuel from available foods. This is very easy to understand at the extremes: a person who required for their survival a nutrient not found on this planet, would not survive on this planet. A person who could not tolerate a nutrient essential for survival, such as water, similarly would not survive. While this is so obvious as to be trivial, it conceals a subtlety: food came first, physiology came after. There were plants before there were creatures that could survive by eating plants. There was water before there were creatures that needed to drink water.\n\nAnd the same extends to every detail of dietary intake. We are adapted to survive on protein, carbohydrate and fat because those are the three kinds of macronutrients this planet provides. We \"need\" iron and calcium and essential amino acids and potassium and vitamin C -- because the food supply available to us on this planet provides them. If it did not, we could not possibly need them and be here to talk about it. Other creatures that needed what the planet did provide would be here in our place.\n\nIt just stands to reason that the diet that shaped our physiology in the first place would tell us something about the diet for which that physiology is best suited now. If you find that hard to swallow, consider how we decide what to feed animals in a zoo. To my knowledge, no clinical trials are involved in which the lions are tried on a diet of hay and the koalas on a diet of mackerel. Instead, the animals are all given food approximating what they were eating in the wild -- their native diet. If this is relevant to every creature on the planet, how likely is it that it would be irrelevant to us?\n\nThis, then, is the basic argument for the \"Paleo diet.\" But there is more to consider. Throughout much of the Stone Age, mean human life expectancy was all of about 20 years and the life span extended only to about 40. While it makes sense that our native diet is apt to be good for us, we cannot conclude that a diet best suited to a two- to four-decade life is just as good for an eight-decade life.\n\nOur Stone Age ancestors had a high caloric throughput, meaning lots of calories both out and in every day, due to the high energy demands of Stone Age survival. Perhaps consuming 4,000 or so calories a day -- and burning them all -- should be required before the \"Paleo diet\" label truly pertains.\n\nDr. Eaton among others suggests that our Paleolithic ancestors consumed as much as 100 grams of fiber daily, from a variety of plant foods eaten in large enough quantities to fuel that high energy demand. If 100 grams of fiber a day were required to defend a Paleo diet claim, there would be very few signed up.\n\nIn reality, virtually no one today practices anything close to a true Stone Age diet and no one at all practices such a diet perfectly. When was the last time you saw a mammoth?\n\nWhen the Paleo diet label is used to justify a diet of sausages and bacon cheeseburgers, the concept has wandered well off the reservation. When used as guidance away from processed foods and toward a diet based on a variety of plants, nuts, seeds, eggs, fish and lean meats (preferably wild game), it is eminently reasonable, and no doubt a vast improvement, over the typical American diet. Stone Agers did a lot more running than we do and most certainly did not run on Dunkin'!\n\nWe don't know that even a well-practiced Paleo diet is the \"best\" choice for health, as compared to a Mediterranean diet, a traditional Asian diet, a mostly-plant diet, or a well-balanced vegan diet. We do know that a population of some 7 billion people cannot eat as much meat as a population in the millions did, without doing the irreparable harm to the planet that is already far advanced.\n\nThat our native diet is relevant to our health seems little less than self-evident. That we can't get back to the Stone Age from here is equally so. Exactly how we apply lessons from the past to our current dietary practices will decide whether effects on our future health, and that of our planet, are as hoped- or otherwise. So the details matter; let's chew on them carefully.",

Audrey Hepburn sang the Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini composition in the film \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\"\n\nWilliams' recording career reached superstar status in 1963 when his album \"Days of Wine and Roses\" spent 16 weeks at the top of the U.S. music charts.\n\nHis variety TV show, which promoted the careers of many other artists including the Osmonds, won high ratings and three Emmys.\n\nSinger Ray Stevens, who was managed for years by Andy's brother Don, called him \"one classy guy.\"\n\n\"He was a marvelously talented and generous performer who in 1970 entrusted his nationally acclaimed TV show and audience to a green kid from Georgia,\" Stevens said. \"That kid was me, and he changed my life.\"\n\nWilliams hosted the first live Grammy Awards telecast at the Hollywood Palladium in 1971. He went on to host for seven years straight.\n\n\"The entertainment industry has lost a giant piece of its living history today, but Williams' legacy will forever be enshrined in the annals of music and television,\" said Neil Portnow, the president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. \"Our deepest condolences go out to his family, friends, and all who will miss this American treasure.\"\n\nThe singer hosted five Christmas television specials, between 1973 and 1985, along with seven other television specials, the first in 1959 and the last in 1987.\n\nWilliams, who also had a home in La Quinta, California, is survived by his wife of 21 years, Debbie, and his three children with French singer Claudine Longet -- Robert, Noelle and Christian.\n\nHe was married to Longet from 1961 until their divorce in 1975. A year later, she was charged with the fatal shooting of her boyfriend, Olympic skier Spider Sabich.\n\nWilliams stood by Longet, who claimed the shooting was accidental. She spent a month in jail.\n\nWilliams' Branson theater was the first non-country venue built in the small Missouri tourist mecca.\n\nHe was born on December 3, 1927, in Wall Lake, Iowa, where he began singing with brothers Bob, Dick and Don in a Presbyterian church choir led by their parents.\n\nWilliams was just 8 when he made his professional singing debut with the Williams Brothers Quartet. The brothers were regular performers on radio station WHO's \"Iowa's Barn Dance Show\" in Des Moines. Their popularity grew, taking the brothers to national stations, including WLS in Chicago and WLW in Cincinnati.\n\nDoris Day was his friend when they were both young and living in Cincinnati.\n\n\"He and his brothers sang and, of course, so did I, and often I would go over to their house and we would sing together,\" Day said Wednesday. \"They asked me to join their group, but my vocal coach thought I should be out on my own, and so that's what I did.\"\n\nSmokey Robinson said Williams \"befriended me when I was just a teenager starting out in show business, and we remained friends throughout the years.\"\n\n\"I regret that we didn't have the chance to spend more time together,\" Robinson said. \"He was one of the great voices and great people of our time.\"",

  "latent_3994": "Have you caught the Benedict Cumberbatch bug or not sure what all the fuss is about when it comes to the Sherlock and Star Trek star? Whether you’re a so-called ‘Cumberbitch’, ‘Cumberbunnie’, ‘Cumberperson’ or simply ask ‘Cumber Who?’ there’s no denying his popularity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBehavioural Psychologist Jo Hemmings (johemmings.co.uk) and body language and behaviour expert Judi James tell RadioTimes.com how Cumberbatch’s body language and facial expressions give us clues as to why he’s so popular…\n\nJH: “Whether he’s playing Sherlock Holmes, another role or just being himself, Cumberbatch’s body language is guarded, yet rich in expression. No extraneous flamboyant gestures for this man. Every move he makes and every look he gives seem direct and to the point.”\n\nJJ: “Cumberbatch was a taste you had to acquire. I think acquiring him as a taste makes you feel just a little bit superior. It’s like drinking a fine wine or eating a piece of Stilton. It might not be great at first but after a while you feel immensely smart and superior that you do actually prefer him.”\n\nJH: “His gestures and facial expressions are both purposeful and powerful. That combined with his strong and intriguing (almost asexual features) and deep, purring, authoritative voice make him a sex god – especially in a world seemingly filled of shallow and pretty boy band types.”\n\nJJ: “Cumberbatch’s features are just of a completely unusual cast and set. None of his features taken separately should be attractive, and put together initially they’re not handsome, but then they are deeply attractive. You’d actually probably be looking at him thinking ‘what an unusual face’ and then you’d make your own mind up about whether you think it’s attractive or not. It’s a bit like finding that one-off unusual designer outfit.”\n\nJH: “There’s seeming conflict in his body language – in many of his roles, especially Holmes, he often seems careless with his manners, cold and lacking compassion. Yet there is a controlled calmness in his body language and facial expressions, tinged with a little mystique, humour and self-deprecation.”\n\nJJ: “He does play massively intellectual characters, which helps with the charisma. I mean god only know what he’s like in real life. I think we imagine that he’s hugely intellectual, which would add to his alpha credentials. With the Sherlock and Star Trek characters, I think they’re almost like grown-up versions of Robert Pattinson’s character in the Twilight series, Edward Cullen. His characters have this remote, almost cold quality about them- almost non-sexual – and it makes women walk towards them and try and seduce them. We tend to desire the unattainable.”\n\nJH: “Getting to know Benedict would be like unlocking a series of doors and finding an unexpected surprise behind each. Which makes him unpredictable and potentially wild when unleashed – another very sexy trait.”\n\nJJ: “One you’ve realised how gorgeous and adorable he is, I think whatever role he plays it doesn’t matter because he also happens to be a good actor. I think he’ll always have a very similar following.”\n\nJH: “This is a man who seems to be in control and he knows it. That level of self-assured power has always been attractive in a man.”\n\nJJ: “He’s also got a very nice voice and I think that’s underestimated as an attraction. There’s something lovely about the not regularly attractive face with a very deep, intellectual alpha male voice that is fabulous.”\n\nFollow @RadioTimes\n\nAdvertisement",

  "latent_4196": "Testimony from a group of swarthy, hard-faced former burglars, robbers and gangbangers likely made reaching a guilty verdict Monday against former Chicago Police Cmdr. Jon Burge all the more difficult.\n\nReally, though, the trial hinged on the one victim who didn't testify but whose case is responsible for charges finally being brought against Burge: Madison Hobley, the one true innocent.\n\nNotarized answers former Chicago Police Cmdr. Jon Burge gave to legal questions in a wrongful conviction lawsuit filed against him in 2003 by Hobley proved the clincher that caught Burge in the lie he's told for too long.\n\nBurge was found guilty on one court of perjury and two counts of obstruction of justice. He faces 45 years in prison and fines. Free on bond, Burge will be sentenced Nov. 5.\n\n\"I'm elated that a jury of predominately white people have spoken and said it's wrong to torture African-American men,\" regardless of their criminal histories, said G. Flint Taylor, a Chicago attorney who represents several Burge torture victims.\n\nA giddy Rob Warden, executive director the Northwestern University Center on Wrongful Convictions, said: \"I find it difficult to be rooting for the prosecution. If this hadn't happened, it would have been a tremendous setback\" in addressing pending torture claims. \"Some people will be getting out.\"\n\nFormer suspects, medical and legal professionals who testified, and photos, contradicted the white-haired, patrician Burge's confident assertions in Judge Joan Lefkow's courtroom that he'd never engaged in torture and the notarized interrogatories he signed in 2003 were confusing to answer.\n\nVictims testified Burge or officers working for him employed a menu of torture techniques: using pinchy alligator clips to administer electro-shock, and shocking their genitals and other body parts with probes, smothering them with plastic bags, strapping them to a radiator and scorching them, and playing Russian roulette. One witness, Andrew Wilson, testified from the grave, as Judge Lefkow allowed a federal agent to read previous testimony Wilson had given.\n\nSo if a parade of former and dead criminals, and suspected bleeding-heart liberals in the form of a jail doctor and defense attorneys, made it difficult to believe anything other than Burge and his underlings -- called the A-Team -- were just trying to do their jobs, the written record laid bare the big lie.\n\nIn Hobley's case, the only thing the then-26-year-old was \"guilty\" of was cheating on his wife, as former Chicago Reader writer John Conroy so eloquently illustrated in a May 2000 piece examining how Hobley ended up on Death Row after his wife and toddler died in a South Side fire. Investigating police said Hobley's motive was to get rid of his wife and baby so he could resume a relationship with a former mistress. In truth, police falsified and withheld evidence.\n\nPardoned by George Ryan in 2003, Hobley sat on death row more than a decade after he was tortured -- beaten and bagged -- into confessing to setting the East 82nd Street apartment fire on January 6, 1987 that killed his family and several neighbors. In 2009, the city of Chicago settled Hobley's wrongful conviction suit for $1 million.\n\nOutside the courtroom Monday, onlookers expressed joy that a jury with only one black person finally validated what millions of dollars in special investigations and reports have said all along: Jon Burge routinely tortured and abused black male suspects in his custody during his tenure at Chicago's Area 2 on the South Side.\n\n\"A lot of really good police officers go out every day to protect the citizens of Chicago,\" said Ald. Ed Smith (28th) who attended the trial daily. \"The few bad apples that have caused pain to the city of Chicago, that has to be stopped.\"",
  "latent_4337": "Monday night, amid the intensification of scandal surrounding the Trump campaign’s potential collusion with Russia, President Trump made time to participate in the “ultimate selfie.” In the background of a photo taken by Baptist pastor Robert Jeffress, Trump is talking to two major evangelical leaders: prosperity gospel proponent Paula White and Baptist pastor Jack Graham, who prayed for Trump in a much-tweeted “laying-on of hands” earlier this week.\n\nJeffress’s selfie was taken during an impromptu meeting with Trump and a number of high-profile evangelical figures who were invited to the White House but not necessarily expected to meet the president.\n\nMeanwhile, though the White House faced a barrage of questions about Donald Trump Jr.’s conversation with Russian operators this week, Trump sat down with controversial televangelist Pat Robertson as his first one-on-one interview with a non-Fox News interviewer since early May.\n\nThe contents of the interview were likewise somewhat counterintuitive. The interview hardly focused on religion itself, as one might expect, aside from a cursory mention of Trump’s desire to abolish the Johnson Amendment. Instead, the interview seemed to be an opportunity for Robertson to throw Trump softballs over Russia as he told the president, “I want you to know there are thousands of people praying for you and holding you up all the time.”\n\nOne reading of Trump’s meetings with several evangelical leaders this week is that he’s simply playing to his base, as he always has, reminding evangelicals once more that he’s their “unwavering ally.”\n\nYet the optics here are far more extreme than they have been previously. It’s one thing for Trump to send Vice President Mike Pence to a Focus on the Family event. It’s another thing entirely to be pictured receiving the “laying-on of hands,” a prayer tradition that is particularly, though not exclusively, associated with Pentecostal traditions of faith healing (it is, for example, less far often associated with Trump’s own stated denomination of mainline Presbyterianism).\n\nSuch an honor to pray within the Oval Office for @POTUS & @VP . pic.twitter.com/JrDOSJyFeN — Johnnie Moore ن (@JohnnieM) July 12, 2017\n\nLikewise, Robertson isn’t just any controversial Christian preacher but one wedded specifically to an apocalyptic tradition of interpreting the arc of history as directly traced by God. To put it simply: He believes bad things (destructive hurricanes, diseases) happen because God gets angry at humans’ sinful actions, while also simultaneously subscribing to the notion that historical chaos is itself desirable insofar as it points to an ideal end: Christ’s second coming and reign on earth.\n\nWithin the general contours of Robertson’s theology, any political chaos can be understood eschatologically — with reference to the “end times” — and within a cosmic context. It’s a necessary battle between good and evil, one in which the forces of Christ will ultimately prevail.\n\nSimply sitting down with Robertson, of course, doesn’t mean Trump (or his handlers) believes such a theology. Yet by embracing the optics — Trump welcoming the idea that being “prayed over” serves as a rhetorical countervailing force to an FBI investigation — Trump and his handlers are dog-whistling. By appealing not just to his evangelical base but to a theological, even apocalyptic reading of history, and Trump’s role in it, Trump is not merely legitimizing alternative facts but, more dangerously, writing alternative sacred history. He is cast a religious martyr, or someone who, though assailed on (in their view, bogus) legal or circumstantial grounds will be vindicated through divine favor.\n\nMany religion writers, including ThinkProgress’s Jack Jenkins, have written extensively about Trump’s creation of a new kind of civic religion, blending his natural egotism with religious rhetoric that both fires up his base and legitimizes the extremity of his actions. As Jenkins puts it, Trump “appears to be arguing that America will be protected by God because he is president.” He can pull out of the Paris climate agreement; he can host a fundraiser at his own hotel. To Trump’s supporters who subscribe to his nascent, implicit political theology, his actions are legitimate because they’re his actions. His success is evidence of God’s favor; his actions, in turn, are justified by his prior success.\n\nBut this week, Trump has gone even further, essentially creating a double narrative of his Russia troubles. Rather than legitimizing himself legally, he is legitimizing himself spiritually. He paints himself as a victim of “fake news,” one for whom public photo ops of prayer meld without distinction into condemnations of the mainstream media. Trump’s choice to be interviewed by Robertson at such a politically delicate time plays neatly into that narrative.\n\nTrump’s bold embrace of certain evangelical leaders — and his implicit legitimization of their philosophy — may be more troubling than it first appears. By cleaving his audience so neatly into a dichotomy of “fake news” and “honest Christians,” Trump is signaling to his evangelical supporters that the crisis of his presidency is not simply another entry into political history, but a step toward the second coming of Jesus Christ.\n\nPat Robertson made a name out of perpetuating a particularly extreme version of the theology that God directly acts in human political history\n\nRobertson embraces the view that God specifically reacts to whether he is pleased or displeased with individuals or governments. For one example, Robertson famously said Disneyland welcoming private LGBTQ group bookings for “gay days” could cause natural disasters. An endorsement from (and of) Robertson, therefore, can also be seen as a tacit endorsement of a particular understanding that God regularly interferes in human affairs.\n\nBiblically speaking, particularly in the Old Testament, there are plenty of examples of God doing just that, but Robertson is nevertheless extreme among Christians for the intensity of his emphasis. He, like a small subset of evangelical Christians, embraces dispensationalism, or the idea that human history is divided into particular “eras” according to God’s plan, culminating in a second coming and, in some traditions, a thousand-year reign of peace.\n\nAs Anbara Khalidi, a former research associate in theology at Wadham College, Oxford, and an expert in apocalyptic American theology, told me, Robertson essentially “expects conditions on earth to deteriorate until the point at which Jesus will return to rescue his 'saved' before the true years of apocalyptic deterioration,” a philosophy she described as “pre-millennial dispensationalism.”\n\nShe continued, “Trump's polarizing effect on American politics therefore fits neatly into Robertson's prophetic framework, which paradoxically anticipates chaos as a manifestation of God's control over human history. Provocation of the liberal media, energetic self-justification, and unapologetic dominion over an ultimately doomed planet are the hallmarks of premillennial dispensationalist preachers like Robertson, rendering him the natural choice for an exercise in Trump's self-promotion.”\n\nIn other words, Robertson’s worldview helps explain Trump — as well as Trump’s chaotic relationship with Russia and with the press. By placing Trump’s scandal in a wider apocalyptic context, Robertson creates a sense of logic to Trump’s behavior and potential scandals. Whether they agree with Robertson’s views, observers are invited to do more than dismiss Trump’s waning popularity, or potential collusion, as “nothingburgers,” because of how they fit into his broader context.\n\nIn this case, Trump’s decline, in some respects, is considered a good thing: as evidence of a divine hand in the world. If Trump is under attack by the liberal media, he’s just playing into some evangelicals’ interpretations of biblical ideas of the good king whose circumstances are against him. He’s the “suffering servant” of the Book of Isaiah. We can see this dynamic, too, in the tweets of those who visited the White House on Monday — like pastor Jack Graham, who likewise cast his presence at the White House in the language of spiritual warfare.\n\nWe are fighting massive spiritual battles in the world and the warfare is prayer — Jack Graham (@jackngraham) July 12, 2017\n\nRobertson, Trump, and a potentially dangerous narrative\n\nNow, most evangelical Christians aren’t dispensationalists. Few people are likely to be convinced that Trump is a divine instrument who weren’t already prone to thinking so. But by conflating religious identity, a narrative of legitimacy on the part of Trump, a narrative of delegitimization of the press, and biblical interpretations through which those already prone to defend Trump can bolster their existing defense on a cosmic scale, Trump is doing more than holding on to his base. He’s mobilizing them. If the worst happens, and Trump does find his presidency under threat, he can rely on supporters who not only think the media is peddling fake news but also see that news as an apocalyptic threat to their fundamental identity as believing Christians.\n\nYet in both Protestant and Catholic circles, some — including representatives of Pope Francis — are wary of this kind of rhetoric. In an article last month by two allies of Pope Francis, the Jesuit Antonio Spadaro and Presbyterian pastor Marcelo Figueroa in La Civiltà Cattolica, both warned against an easy binary division of politics or religion “that divides reality between absolute Good and absolute Evil.” Referring to apocalyptic evangelicals, they write:\n\n“Theirs is a prophetic formula: fight the threats to American Christian values and prepare for the imminent justice of an Armageddon, a final showdown between Good and Evil, between God and Satan. In this sense, every process (be it of peace, dialogue, etc.) collapses...And the community of believers (faith) becomes a community of combatants (fight).\n\nSuch a perspective can be dangerous. It raises questions like, if the world is doomed, why should we care about the niceties of Trump’s health care policy? while transforming the mucky business of politics into an apocalyptic blockbuster: a thrilling “good and evil” battle that Trump’s base can get behind. And, more unnerving still, it could legitimize violence in defense of Trump’s wavering presidency.\n\nThis isn’t necessarily Trump’s conscious doing. It’s the (Catholic) Steve Bannon, after all — with a tendency toward apocalyptic narratives and inclination to stoke absolutism — who seems a more likely architect of such a strategy. In fact, that’s why he’s called out specifically in La Civiltà Cattolica’s text.\n\nBut whoever is behind it, the seemingly “family-friendly” optics of Trump’s newfound religiosity are far more unsettling than they are conciliatory. After all, the only way to go from here is apocalypse.",
  "latent_4417": "They played under the Friday night lights, and now they are headed to the big time. These are the Top 5 former Texas High School players who were taken in this weekend’s NFL Draft.\n\nAndrew Luck, QB (Stanford, Houston Stratford)\n\nPick 1 (Indianapolis Colts)\n\nScouting Notes: We’ve had a pretty good idea since last April who the first pick in the 2012 Draft would be. Luck is a prototypical pro-style passer who has been NFL-ready for two seasons. The brain, the arm, and the intangible qualities are impossible to overlook, but sometimes we forget that Luck is an extremely (almost freakishly) dominating athlete. His 40 time at the combine (as tested on new equipment, almost universally thought of among scouts as “slower timing”) was only .8 seconds off of Cam Newton’s 2011 performance. He also compared favorably to Newton in the broad jump (10 feet 4 inches to Newton’s 10 feet 6 inches) and the vertical leap (36 inches to Newton’s 35 inches).\n\nRobert Griffin III, QB (Baylor, Copperas Cove)\n\nPick 2 (Washington Redskins)\n\nScouting Notes: Redskins Owner Dan Snyder is a short, angry man, but RG3’s Pro Day performance was enough to make him feel 10 feet tall and bulletproof. While many did not have Griffin on their initial 2012 big boards prior to the 2011 season, his Heisman campaign and continued development as a pass-first QB with superior mobility have launched him to the top of the best two QB class we have seen in decades.\n\nRyan Tannehill, QB (Texas A&M, Big Spring)\n\nPick 8 (Miami Dolphins)\n\nScouting Notes: While I am not as sold on Tannehill as many NFL Draft analysts, I do realize the value that front offices place on the position, especially given the reduced price of rookie players under the new scaled wage system in the CBA. A calculated risk for a possible future franchise QB is much easier to take in 2012 than ever before. Tannehill has had 19 career starts at QB. As a former WR, obviously he has a clear, real-time understanding of the route tree and above-average athleticism. He has a clean, high release and gets plenty of zip on passes between the hashes. He struggles going to his second read, and has been known to make unwise decisions at crucial times in games, helping the Aggies to blow four double-digit halftime leads in 2011. He puts too much air under balls thrown on out routes past 18 to 20 yards, which is a pick-6 waiting to happen in the NFL.\n\nI believe Tannehill actually benefited greatly from his fifth metatarsal break (foot) in January. Unlike Nick Foles (Arizona) and Kellen Moore (Boise State), Tannehill did not have the opportunity to prove scouts right in their initial assessments of him being the product of a system predicated on short passes and screens. Tannehill did not have to throw to unfamiliar receivers at the Senior Bowl, or in the pressure cooker environment of the Combine. Instead, he watched his draft stock inflate until his Pro Day where he threw 58 scripted passes to his teammates under the watchful eye of his private QB coach, Chris Weinke.\n\nMichael Brockers, DT (LSU, Houston Chavez)\n\nPick 14 (St. Louis Rams)\n\nScouting Notes: The first thing you notice when standing next to Michael Brockers (outside of his pure immense presence) is the length of his arms. They look like 35-inch-long octopus tentacles with big mitts on the end. He can play at both the 3- and the 5-technique, which make him a fit within multiple schemes. He was double-teamed in college with a much higher frequency than Fletcher Cox (Mississippi State) who seems to be a hotter name at the DT position right now.\n\nBrockers is a menace against the run, has strong hands like Casey Hampton, and plays extremely violently in short areas. He has one of the most powerful and explosive shoulder-punch moves that I have seen, because he places the initial jolt of power to the opponent’s chest almost like a forklift technique, then attaches to the blocker on his play-side shoulder and drives. This is very disruptive to running lanes. Brockers’ reach makes him impossible to get proper positioning on in the run game, but he does not represent the threat as a disruptor in the passing game that Fletcher Cox or Dontari Poe (Memphis) have the potential to. His initial explosion is unrivaled in this draft, though, and he is a scary man. Just the kind of DT that new Rams HC Jeff Fisher loves\n\nKendall Wright, WR (Baylor, Pittsburg)\n\nPick 20 (Tennessee Titans)\n\nScouting Notes: Wright was another player who did not participate in the Senior Bowl due to injury (ankle), but was available to test at the NFL Combine where scouts were shocked to learn he measured in at 5 feet 10 inches. He compounded this disappointment by turning in a very slow looking 4.61 40 time. Wright told me at his Pro Day (where he ran a 4.46 and a 4.41) that he was not prepared for the three-second pause required in Indianapolis prior to starting the sprint. He was disappointed in the time and said he had not run a 4.6 “since the fifth grade.\"\n\nWright does “play bigger” than 5 feet 10 inches, and shows flashes of a player that could be very much like Santonio Holmes or Steve Smith in the right situation. He was always productive and is a natural hands catcher unlike Justin Blackmon (OSU). He is not a great route runner, but he is a fearless route runner. There are some concerns regarding Wright. It has recently come out that he tested at 16% body fat at the Combine. Teams generally like WRs in the 10, maybe 11% area. His body style is interesting and unique. I would describe him in plain clothes as being very “tube-like” through his trunk. Two NFC West scouts agreed with me that he “plays bigger than he is” and they expressed worry about his ability to stay healthy at the NFL level. I personally believe he will be a very good NFL receiver at the Z.\n\n[Alex Dunlap is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America, the host of RosterWatch on 104.9FM ESPN Radio Austin, founder of Rosterwatch.com, and a featured expert contributor to the FantasyPros.com network.]",
  "latent_4453": "Today’s guest post comes from my friend Mason Slater. Mason is a husband to Melinda, a seminary student, a youth pastor, a blogger and a freelance writer in the Mecca of Christendom, Grand Rapids, Michigan. He blogs at New Ways Forward. (Add him to your Google Reader; he's one of my favorites!)\n\n***\n\nSo this past week Rachel has been blogging about how faith changes our relationships, which has been brilliant because I can very much relate. I’ve gone though many of those same changes (and in many ways still am), and that process has transformed my relationships in significant ways.\n\nI want to focus here on the relationship that has been the most difficult for me to work out—my relationship with my church.\n\nWhat do we do when we begin to come to different conclusions about faith and practice than are taught by our faith community?\n\nWe have plenty of options, but I’m going to look at them under two categories: We can leave, or we can stay.\n\nIf you find yourself in this dilemma, I can’t tell you exactly what to do because I don’t know your story. But I can tell you mine.\n\nIn college I began to push back against the mostly Baptist faith with which I had been raised. I studied for myself and was exposed to more of the world. In retrospect, there was probably more grace given to me than I realized at the time, but it didn’t feel that way. (That said, calling someone a heretic for rejecting Left Behind eschatology is hard to do graciously). The more I asked tough questions the more my questions were either dismissed as a phase or I was told I needed to just believe the Bible.\n\nBut I did believe the Bible. I just didn’t see how it was saying the sorts of things I’d been taught.\n\nSo I left.\n\nBut not all at once. Over time I stepped back bit by bit from the many ways I was involved in the church, until one day I walked out the doors knowing I wouldn’t return.\n\nI tried other church communities which did not look at all like the one I had left, and I tried no church community at all. Each path had its own ups and downs, but over time I was faced with a decision I did not expect: Did I want to go back—not to the same church, but to one similar to it?\n\nI had to make this decision because I was offered a position on staff as a youth pastor on staff at exactly the sort of church I’d left. I thought it would be an easy decision, but it wasn’t.\n\nAfter much thought and prayer, my wife and I decided that this was exactly where we needed to be. The institution and tradition still don’t fit us exactly, but that really isn’t the point. We love the people and have a role to play there now.\n\nThat role? To be the voice I wish I had heard at that point in my journey. Not in the sense of acting a part, pretending to be on the same team while secretly indoctrinating people into images of myself. No, I simply pray that I might be able to help the people I work with see that this Gospel story is deeper, farther reaching, and more beautiful than any of us had imagined.\n\nIt can be a difficult path to walk. More than a couple times in the past six months I thought I was going to be Chad Holtz-ed (see how I did that?) over some of what I’ve said or written, but so far it’s all working itself out for what I hope is the best for all involved.\n\nYes, I still have the same disagreements theologically and socially, but I’m learning to put them in their proper place. I’ve made peace, more or less, with my story. There are areas in which I push back, but I’m glad to play the role I’ve been given—to try to share a bigger picture of God and his saving work from within this tradition.\n\nWhen I walked out those doors years ago I never thought I’d be back, but I am, in a way. And I’m happy to be, because if there’s no voice to tell these kids there is more to the story, when they walk away it might be for good.\n\nSo when you are faced with that choice, to walk away or stay for God-knows-what reason, just remember you’re not alone. You’re not alone because many of us have faced that choice and in our brokenness tried to choose a path with some level of grace. And, you’re not alone because there is likely someone else like you or me a few pews down.\n\nLeaving might be the right choice, but if you stay there is a role to play in that path as well. It’s at least worth thinking about.\n\nGrace and peace.\n\n***\n\nYour turn.\n\nHave you ever faced a big decision about possibly leaving a church? How did you make that decision?",
  "latent_4490": "For other people named Robbie Robertson, see Robbie Robertson (disambiguation)\n\nJaime Royal \"Robbie\" Robertson,[1] OC (born July 5, 1943), is a Canadian musician,[2] songwriter, film composer, producer, actor, and author. Robertson is best known for his work as lead guitarist and primary songwriter for The Band, and for his career as a solo recording artist.\n\nRobertson's work with the Band was instrumental in creating the Americana music genre. Robertson has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Canadian Music Hall of Fame as a member of the Band, and has been inducted to Canada's Walk of Fame, both with the Band and on his own. He is ranked 59th in Rolling Stone magazine’s list of the 100 greatest guitarists.[3] As a songwriter, Robertson is credited for writing \"The Weight\", \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\", \"Up on Cripple Creek\", \"Broken Arrow\", \"Somewhere Down the Crazy River\", and many others. He has been inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, and received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Songwriters.[4]\n\nAs a film soundtrack producer and composer, Robertson is known for his collaborations with director Martin Scorsese, which began with the rockumentary film The Last Waltz (1978), and continued through a number of dramatic films, including Raging Bull (1980) and Casino (1995). He has worked on many other soundtracks for film and television.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nRobertson was born Jaime Royal Klegerman on July 5, 1943. He was an only child. His mother was Rose Marie Chrysler, a Cayuga and Mohawk[5] woman who was raised on the Six Nations Reserve southwest of Toronto, Ontario. Chrysler lived with an aunt in the Cabbagetown neighborhood, and worked at a jewelry plating factory. Robertson's biological father was a Jewish professional gambler named Alexander David Klegerman.[citation needed]\n\nKlegerman was killed in a hit and run accident while changing a tire on the Queen Elizabeth Way; this incident occurred while Robertson was still an infant. Robertson's mother married co-worker James Patrick Robertson, who adopted Robertson. Robertson's parents continued to work at the jewelry plating factory where they met, and lived in several homes in different Toronto neighborhoods while Robertson was a child.[6]:55[7]:65\n\nHis mother often traveled with him to the Six Nations Reserve to visit their family. It was here that Robertson was mentored in playing guitar by family members, in particular his older cousin Herb Myke. He became a fan of rock 'n' roll and R&B through the radio, listening to disc jockey George \"Hound Dog\" Lorenz play rock 'n' roll on WKBW in Buffalo, New York, and staying up at night to listen to disc jockey John R.'s all-night blues show on WLAC, a clear-channel station in Nashville, Tennessee.[8]:56[9]:65–66\n\nEarly career [ edit ]\n\nWhen Robertson was 14, he worked two brief summer jobs in the traveling carnival circuit, first for a few days in a suburb of Toronto, and later as an assistant at a freak show for three weeks during the Canadian National Exhibition. These experiences led later to the Band song \"Life is a Carnival\" and to the 1980 movie Carny, which he would produce and in which he was a lead actor.[10]\n\nHe began playing in bands in 1957 with his friend Pete \"Thumper\" Traynor, who would later found Traynor Amplifiers. His first band with Traynor was called Robbie and the Rhythm Chords, who became Robbie and the Robots after they saw the film Forbidden Planet and took a liking to the film's character Robby the Robot. Traynor customized Robertson's guitar for the Robots, fitting it with antennae and wires to give it a space age look. After Robbie and the Robots, he played with Little Caesar and the Consuls, and with the Traynor-led combo the Suedes, which featured Scott Cushnie on piano.[8]:56–57[7]:66[11]:15\n\nWith Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks [ edit ]\n\nAfter the Suedes opened for the Arkansas-based rockabilly group Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks at Dixie Arena, Hawkins hired Robertson for the Hawks' road crew.[12] Hawkins recorded two songs co-credited to Robertson, \"Hey Baba Lou\" and \"Someone Like You\", for his album Mr. Dynamo (1959), and brought Robertson to the Brill Building in New York City to help him choose songs for the rest of the album.[1]:14–15[7]:66–67[11]:45–46\n\nRonnie Hawkins performing live in 2014. Hawkins hired Robertson as a member of his backup band the Hawks in 1960.\n\nHawkins hired pianist Scott Cushnie away from the Suedes, and took him on tour with Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks in Arkansas. When the Hawks' bass player left the group, Cushnie recommended that Hawkins hire Robertson to replace him on bass.[11]:49, 51–52[13]\n\nHawkins invited him to come to Arkansas, and then flew to the UK to perform on television there, leaving Robertson in Arkansas with the Hawks. Meanwhile, Robertson spent his living allowance on records and practiced intensively each day. Upon returning, Hawkins hired him to play bass. Cushnie left the band a few months after joining them.[13] and Robertson soon switched over from bass to playing lead guitar for the Hawks.[1]:20–22[7]:68–70, 75 Robertson soon developed into a guitar virtuoso.[14]\n\nRoy Buchanan, a few years older than Robertson, was briefly a member of the Hawks and became an important influence on Robertson's guitar style: \"Standing next to Buchanan on stage for several months, Robertson was able to absorb Buchanan’s deft manipulations with his volume speed dial, his tendency to bend multiple strings for steel guitar-like effect, his rapid sweep picking and his passion for bending past the root and fifth notes during solo flights.\"[15]\n\nDrummer/singer Levon Helm was already a member of the Hawks and soon became close friends with Robertson.[7]:76 The Hawks continued to tour the United States and Canada, adding Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, and Garth Hudson to the Hawks lineup in 1961.[16]\n\nThis lineup, which later became the Band, toured with Hawkins throughout 1962 and into 1963.[7]:95, 100 They also hired the saxophone player Jerry Penfound and later Bruce Bruno, who were both with the group in their intermediary period as Levon and the Hawks.[17][18]\n\nRonnie Hawkins and the Hawks cut sessions for Roulette Records throughout 1961–1963, all of which Robertson appeared on. The sessions included three singles: \"Come Love\" b/w \"I Feel Good\" (Roulette 4400 1961); \"Who Do You Love\" b/w \"Bo Diddley\" (Roulette 4483 1963); and \"There's A Screw Loose\" b/w \"High Blood Pressure\" (Roulette 4502 1963).[11]:420[19]\n\nWith Levon and the Hawks [ edit ]\n\nThe Hawks left Ronnie Hawkins at the beginning of 1964 to go on their own.[20] The members of the Hawks were losing interest in playing in the rockabilly style in favor of playing blues and soul music. In early 1964, the group approached agent Harold Kudlets about representing them, which he agreed to do, booking them a years' worth of shows in the same circuits as they had been in before with Ronnie Hawkins. Originally dubbed The Levon Helm Sextet, the group included all of the future members of the Band, plus Jerry Penfound on saxophone and Bob Bruno on vocals.[7]:105–106\n\nBruno left in May 1964, and at that time the group changed their name to Levon and the Hawks. Penfound stayed with the group until 1965.[17] Kudlets kept the group busy performing throughout 1964 and into 1965, finally booking them into two lengthy summer engagements at the popular nightclub Tony Mart's in Somers Point, New Jersey,[8]:64–66, 68 where they played six nights a week alongside Conway Twitty and other acts.[21]\n\nThe members of Levon and the Hawks befriended blues artist John P. Hammond while he was performing in Toronto in 1964.[11]:84–85 Later in the year, the group agreed to work on Hammond's album So Many Roads (released in 1965) at the same time that they were playing the Peppermint Lounge in New York City.[8]:65 Robertson played guitar throughout the album, and was billed \"Jaime R. Robertson\" in the album's credits.[7]:110\n\nLevon and the Hawks cut a single \"Uh Uh Uh\" b/w \"Leave Me Alone\" under the name the Canadian Squires in March 1965. Both songs were written by Robertson. The single was recorded in New York[8]:66 and released on Apex Records in the United States and on Ware Records in Canada.[22]:95 As Levon and the Hawks, the group cut an afternoon session for Atco Records later in 1965,[11]:81 which yielded two singles, \"The Stones That I Throw\" b/w \"He Don't Love You\" (Atco 6383) and \"Go, Go, Liza Jane\" b/w \"He Don't Love You\" (Atco 6625).[11]:420 Robertson also wrote all three of the tracks on Levon and the Hawks' Atco singles.[22]:95\n\nWith Bob Dylan and the Hawks [ edit ]\n\n1965–1966 World Tour [ edit ]\n\nToward the end of Levon and the Hawks' second engagement at Tony Mart's in New Jersey, in August 1965, Robertson received a call from Albert Grossman Management requesting a meeting with Bob Dylan.[22]:21[23] The group had been recommended to both Grossman and to Dylan by Mary Martin, one of Grossman's employees, who was originally from Toronto and was a friend of the band.[8]:68–69[24] Dylan was also aware of the group through his friend John Hammond,[8]:69 whose album So Many Roads members of the Hawks had performed on.\n\nRobertson agreed to meet with Dylan. Initially, Dylan intended to just hire Robertson as the guitarist for his backup group. Robertson refused the offer, but did agree to play two shows with Dylan, one at the Forest Hills Tennis Stadium in Forest Hills, New York on August 28, and one at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles on September 3. Robertson suggested they use Levon Helm on drums for the shows.[25]:5\n\nRobertson and Helm performed in Dylan's backup band along with Harvey Brooks and Al Kooper for both shows. The first at Forest Hills received a predominantly hostile response, but the second in Los Angeles was received slightly more favorably.[8]:70 Dylan flew up to Toronto and rehearsed with Levon and the Hawks September 15–17, as Levon and the Hawks finished an engagement there, and hired the full band for his upcoming tour.[11]:96–99\n\nBob Dylan and the Hawks toured the United States throughout October–December 1965,[26]:8–9 with each show consisting of two sets: an acoustic show just featuring Dylan on guitar and harmonica, and an electric set featuring Dylan backed by the Hawks. The tours were largely met with a hostile reaction from fans who knew Dylan as a prominent figure in the American folk music revival, perceiving his move into rock music as a betrayal. Helm left the group after their November 28 performance in Washington, D.C. Session drummer Bobby Gregg replaced Helm for the December dates, and Sandy Konikoff was brought in to replace Gregg in January 1966.[11]:105, 109\n\nDylan and the Hawks played more dates in the continental United States in February–March 1966 of the 1966 world tour, and then played Hawaii, Australia, Europe, and the UK and Ireland, from April 9 – May 27. Drummer Sandy Konikoff left after the Pacific Northwest dates in March,[8]:74 and Mickey Jones replaced him, staying with the group for the remainder of the tour. The Australian and European legs of the tour received a particularly harsh response from disgruntled folk fans, and the May 17 Manchester Free Trade Hall show, best known for an angry audience member audibly yelling \"Judas!\" at Dylan, became a frequently-bootlegged live show from the tour;[27]:73–76 it was eventually released officially as The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The \"Royal Albert Hall\" Concert.[28]:4 The European leg of the tour was filmed by documentary filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker, and the footage was edited into the documentary Eat the Document.[28]\n\nOn November 30, 1965, Dylan cut a studio session with members of the Hawks,[29] which yielded the non-LP single \"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\" Dylan completed the Blonde on Blonde album in Nashville in mid-February 1966, employing Robertson for one of these sessions, which took place on February 14.[30]\n\nThe \"Basement Tapes\" period [ edit ]\n\nMusic From Big Pink was written. The \"Big Pink\" house in 2006. \"Big Pink\" was the house where Bob Dylan and the Band's Basement Tapes were recorded, and the music from the Band albumwas written.\n\nOn July 29, 1966, Dylan sustained an injured neck from a motorcycle accident, and retreated to a quiet domestic life with his new wife and child in upstate New York.[31]:216–219 Some of the members of the Hawks were living at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City at the time,[31]:220 and were kept on a weekly retainer by Dylan's management.[24]\n\nIn February 1967, Dylan invited the members of the Hawks to come up to Woodstock, New York to work on music.[24] Robertson had met a French-Canadian girl on the Paris stop of Dylan's 1966 world tour,[32] and the two moved into a house in the Woodstock area.[11]:135 The remaining three members of the Hawks rented a house near West Saugerties, New York that would later be dubbed \"Big Pink\" because of its pink exterior.[31]:220–221\n\nDylan and the members of the Hawks worked together at the \"Big Pink\" house every day to rehearse and generate ideas for new songs, many of which they recorded in \"Big Pink\"'s makeshift basement studio.[11]:137 The recordings were made between the late spring and autumn of 1967.[33] Previous Hawks member Levon Helm returned to the group in August 1967.[22]:27 By this time, Robertson's guitar style had evolved to be more supportive of the song and less devoted to displaying speed and virtuosity.[15]\n\nIn time, word about these sessions began to circulate, and in 1968, Rolling Stone magazine co-founder Jann Wenner brought attention to these tracks in an article entitled \"Dylan's Basement Tape Should Be Released\".[33][34]\n\nIn 1969, a bootleg album with a plain white cover compiled by two incognito music industry insiders featured a collection of seven tracks from these sessions. The album, which became known as The Great White Wonder, began to appear in independent record stores and receive radio airplay. This album became a runaway success[27]:42–46 and helped to launch the bootleg recording industry.[35]\n\nIn 1975, Robertson would produce an official compilation, The Basement Tapes, which included a selection of tracks from the sessions. An exhaustive collection of all 138 extant recordings was released in 2014 as The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete.[33]\n\nWith the Band [ edit ]\n\n1967–1968 (Music From Big Pink) [ edit ]\n\nRobbie Robertson performing live with the Band\n\nIn late 1967, Dylan left to record his next album, John Wesley Harding (1967). After recording the basic tracks, Dylan asked Robertson and Garth Hudson about playing on the album to fill out the sound. However, when Robertson heard the tracks, he liked the starkness of the sound and recommended that Dylan leave the songs as they were.[11]:147–48 Dylan worked with the members of the Hawks once again when they appeared as his backup band at two Woody Guthrie memorial concerts at Carnegie Hall in New York City in January 1968.[22]:29 Three of these performances were later released by Columbia Records on the LP A Tribute to Woody Guthrie, Vol. 1 (1972).[36]\n\nOver the course of the \"Basement Tapes\" period, the group had developed a sound of their own, and Grossman went to Los Angeles to shop the group to a major label, securing a contract with Capitol Records.[22]:22, 28 The group went to New York to begin recording songs with music producer John Simon. Capitol brought the group to Los Angeles to finish the album.[37] The resulting album, Music From Big Pink,[38] was released in August 1968.[39]\n\nRobertson wrote four of the songs on Music From Big Pink, including \"The Weight\", \"Chest Fever\", \"Caledonia Mission,\" and \"To Kingdom Come\". Robertson is listed in the songwriting credits as \"J.R. Robertson\". Robertson sang lead vocal on the track \"To Kingdom Come\"; he would not sing on another Band song released to the public until \"Knockin' Lost John\" on 1977's Islands.[11]:158[37] Two of Robertson's compositions for the album, \"The Weight\" and \"Chest Fever\", would become important touchstones in the group's career. \"The Weight\" was influenced by the films of director Luis Buñuel, in particular Nazarín (1959) and Viridiana (1961), and reflects the recurring theme in Buñuel's films about the impossibility of sainthood. The song portrays an individual who attempts to take a saintly pilgrimage, and becomes mired down with requests from other people to do favors for them along the way. The mention of \"Nazareth\" at the beginning of the song refers to Nazareth, Pennsylvania, where the C. F. Martin & Company guitar manufacturer is located; it was inspired by Robertson seeing the word \"Nazareth\" in the hole of his Martin guitar.[1]:20 Although \"The Weight\" reached #21 on the British radio charts,[40] it did not fare as well on the American charts, initially stalling at #63.\n\nHowever, the song gained traction due to more successful covers by Jackie DeShannon (US #55, 1968), Aretha Franklin (US #19, 1969), and the Supremes with the Temptations (US #46, 1969), as well as to the song's inclusion in the movie Easy Rider (1969), which became a runaway success. \"The Weight\" has since become the Band's best known song. It has been covered by many artists, appeared in dozens of films and documentaries, and has become a staple in American rock music.[11]:168–173[22]:32[41][42]\n\nWhen Music from Big Pink was released in 1968, the Band initially avoided media attention, and discouraged Capitol Records from promotional efforts. They also did not immediately pursue touring to support the album, and declined to be interviewed for a year.[22]:38 The resulting mystery surrounding the group led to speculation in the underground press.[37] Music from Big Pink received excellent reviews, and the album influenced many well-known musicians of the period.[citation needed]\n\n1969 The Band [ edit ]\n\nThe Band in 1969, Robertson is second from the right\n\nIn early 1969, the Band rented a home from Sammy Davis Jr. in Hollywood Hills, and converted the pool house behind it into a studio to recreate the \"clubhouse\" atmosphere that they had enjoyed at \"Big Pink\" previously. The band began recording every day in the pool house studio, working on a tight schedule to complete the album.[11]:176–178 An additional three tracks were recorded at The Hit Factory in New York in April 1969.[38] Robertson did most of the audio engineering on the album.[22]:41\n\nThe Band began performing regularly in spring 1969, with their first live dates as the Band being at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco.[43] Their most notable performances that year were at the 1969 Woodstock Festival and the UK Isle of Wight Festival with Bob Dylan in August.[11]:201–245\n\nThe Band's album The Band was released in September 1969, and became a critical and commercial success. The album received almost universal critical praise, peaked at #9 on the US pop charts, and stayed in the Top 40 for 24 weeks.[44]:25 The Band works as a loose concept album of Americana themes,[45] and was instrumental in the creation of the Americana Music genre.[38] It was included in the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry in 2009.[46]\n\nThe song with the strongest cultural impact on The Band album was \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\". The song tells a fictional story of a Confederate citizen's experiences at the end of the American Civil War, and features actual historical events worked into the song to create a larger American mythos. Although the Band's original version was not released as a single, a cover version by Joan Baez went to #3 on the charts in 1971 and helped to popularize the song.[11]:192–193[47]\n\nSeveral other tracks from The Band received significant radio airplay, and would become staples in the group's concert appearances. \"Up on Cripple Creek\" peaked at #25 in late 1969 in the United States, and would be their only Top 30 hit there.[48] \"Rag Mama Rag\" reached #16 in the UK in April 1970, the highest chart position of any single by the group in that country.[40] \"Whispering Pines\", co-written by Richard Manuel, was released as a single in France in 1970,[49] and would become the title of a 2009 book about Canadian contributions to the Americana music genre by Jason Schneider.[8] On November 2, 1969, the Band appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show, one of only two television appearances they would make.[22]:45\n\n1970–1973 (Stage Fright through Moondog Matinee) [ edit ]\n\nOn January 12, 1970, the Band was featured on the cover of Time magazine.[50] This was the first time a North American rock band featured on the cover of the magazine.[51]\n\nThe Band rented The Woodstock Playhouse in Woodstock, New York with the intent of recording a new live album there, but the city council voted against it, so they recorded on location, but without an audience. Robertson handled most of the songwriting duties as before.[11]:235–236 Robertson brought in Todd Rundgren to engineer the album which was recorded in two weeks' time.[52] These sessions became their third album, Stage Fright, which would become the Band's highest charting album, peaking at #5 on September 5 and staying in the Billboard Top 40 for 14 weeks.[44]:25\n\nRobertson performing live with the Band in 1971\n\nThe Band's next album, Cahoots, was recorded at Albert Grossman's newly built Bearsville Studios and was released in October 1971. The album received mixed reviews, and peaked at #24 on the Billboard charts,[22]:54–58 only remaining in the Billboard Top 40 for five weeks.[44]:25\n\nCahoots is notable for its cover of Bob Dylan's \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\", as well as for featuring the concert favorite \"Life Is a Carnival\". The inclusion of \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\" came about when Dylan stopped by Robertson's home during the recording of Cahoots and Robertson asked if he might have any songs to contribute. That led to Dylan playing an unfinished version of \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\" for him. Dylan completed the song soon afterward, and the Band recorded it for the album. \"Life Is a Carnival\" features horn parts written by producer and arranger Allen Toussaint. It would be the only track from Cahoots the group would keep in their set list through to The Last Waltz concert and film.[22]:54–55\n\nThe Band continued to tour throughout 1970-71.[43] A live album recorded at a series of shows at the Academy of Music in New York City between December 28–31, 1971,[43] was released in 1972 as the double album Rock Of Ages.[53] Rock of Ages peaked at #6, and remained in the Top 40 for 14 weeks.[44]:25\n\nAfter the Academy of Music shows, the Band again retreated from performing live. They returned to the stage on July 28, 1973,[43] to play the Summer Jam at Watkins Glen alongside the Allman Brothers Band and the Grateful Dead. A recording of the Band's performance was released by Capitol Records as the album Live at Watkins Glen in 1995.[54] With over 600,000 people in attendance,[55] the festival set a record for \"Pop Festival Attendance\" in the Guinness Book of World Records. The record was first published in the 1976 edition of the book.[56]\n\nIn October 1973, the Band released an album of cover songs entitled Moondog Matinee,[22]:69[53] which peaked at #28 on the Billboard charts.[44]:25 Around the time of the recording of Moondog Matinee, Robertson began working on an ambitious project entitled Works that was never finished or released. One lyric from the Works project, \"Lay a flower in the snow,\" was used in Robertson's song \"Fallen Angel\", which appeared on his 1987 self-titled solo album.[53]\n\n1974 Reunion with Bob Dylan (Planet Waves and Before the Flood) [ edit ]\n\nIn February 1973,[57]:2 Bob Dylan relocated from Woodstock, New York to Malibu, California.[58] Coincidentally, Robertson moved to Malibu in the summer of 1973, and by October of the year the rest of the members of the Band had followed suit, moving into properties near Zuma Beach.[citation needed]\n\nBob Dylan and the Band performing at the Chicago Stadium in Chicago, Illinois , on the 1974 reunion tour, Robertson is second from the left\n\nDavid Geffen had signed Dylan to Asylum Records, and worked with promoter Bill Graham on the concept that would become the Bob Dylan and the Band 1974 Tour. It would be Dylan's first tour in more than seven years.[citation needed]\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Graham took out a full page advertisement for the Bob Dylan and the Band tour in the New York Times. The response was one of the largest in entertainment history up to that point, with between 5 and 6 million requests for tickets mailed in for 650,000 seats. Graham's office ended up selling tickets off on a lottery basis, and Dylan and the Band netted $2 million from the deal.[8]:298[11]:284–286[22]:70\n\nAmongst the rehearsals and preparations, the Band went into the studio with Bob Dylan to record a new album for Asylum Records that would become the Bob Dylan album Planet Waves (1974). Sessions took place at Village Recorder in West Los Angeles, California, from November 2–14, 1973.[59] Planet Waves was released on February 9, 1974. The album was #1 on the Billboard album charts for four weeks, and spent 12 weeks total in the Billboard Top 40.[44]:25 Planet Waves was Bob Dylan's first #1 album,[60] and the first and only time Bob Dylan and the Band recorded a studio album together.[11]:287\n\nThe 1974 tour began at the Chicago Stadium on January 3, 1974, and ended at The Forum in Inglewood, California on February 14.[61] The shows began with more songs from the new Planet Waves album and with covers that Dylan and the Band liked, but as the tour went on, they moved toward playing older and more familiar material, only keeping \"Forever Young\" from the Planet Waves album in the set list.[62] Dylan and the Band played a number of tracks from the controversial 1965–1966 World Tour, this time to wildly enthusiastic response from the audience where there had been mixed reaction and boos a mere nine years previously.[11]:291\n\nThe final three shows of the tour at The Forum in Inglewood, California were recorded and assembled into the double album Before the Flood.[61] Credited to \"Bob Dylan/The Band\", Before the Flood was released by Asylum Records on July 20, 1974. The album debuted at #3 on the Billboard charts, and spent ten weeks in the Top Forty.[44]:26\n\n1974–1975 (Shangri-La Studios, The Basement Tapes, and Northern Lights – Southern Cross) [ edit ]\n\nFollowing the 1974 reunion tour with Bob Dylan, rock manager Elliot Roberts booked the Band with the recently reunited Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.[43] On September 4, both artists played Wembley Stadium in London, appearing with Jesse Colin Young and Joni Mitchell.[11]:308–310[63]\n\nThe entrance to Shangri-La Studios in 2016. The Band had the ranch house on the Shangri-La property converted into a recording studio in 1974.\n\nAfter moving to Malibu in 1973, Robertson and the Band had discovered a ranch in Malibu near Zuma Beach called \"Shangri-La\", and decided to lease the property. The main house on the property had originally been built by Lost Horizon (1937) actress Margo Albert,[64] and the ranch had been the filming and stabling site for the Mister Ed television show in the 1960s. In the interim, the house had served as a high-class bordello.[65]\n\nThe album release of The Basement Tapes, credited to Bob Dylan and the Band, was the first album production that took place in the new studio. The album, produced by Robertson, featured a selection of tapes from the original 1967 Basement Tapes sessions with Dylan, as well as demos for tracks eventually recorded for Music From Big Pink album. Robertson cleaned up the tracks, and the album was released in July 1975.[8]:298[11]:311–13\n\nShangri-La Studios proved to be a return to a clubhouse atmosphere that the Band had enjoyed previously at Big Pink, and in the spring of 1975, the group began work on Northern Lights – Southern Cross, their first release of original material in four years.[citation needed] One of the best known tracks on the album is \"Acadian Driftwood\", the first song with specifically Canadian subject material. Robertson was inspired to write \"Acadian Driftwood\" after seeing the documentary L'Acadie, l'Acadie (1971) on Canadian television while in Montreal.[8]:298–299[22]:77–79 Two other notable tracks from that album are \"It Makes No Difference\" and \"Ophelia\".[citation needed]\n\nNorthern Lights – Southern Cross was released on November 1, 1975. The album received generally positive reviews,[8]:300 and reached #26 on the Billboard charts, remaining in the Top 40 for five weeks.[44]:26[66]\n\n1976 (Islands and The Last Waltz concert) [ edit ]\n\nThe Band began touring again in June 1976, performing throughout the summer.[43] The members of the Band were splintering off to work on other projects, with Levon Helm building a studio in Woodstock and Rick Danko having been contracted to Arista Records as a solo artist.[67]\n\nWhile on the summer tour, member Richard Manuel was involved in a boating accident that severely injured his neck, and ten dates of the 25-date tour to cancel.[8]:300–01[11]:324–5 It was during this time period that Robertson introduced the concept that the Band would cease to operate as a touring act. According to Robertson, the group's mutual agreement was that they would stage one final \"grand finale\" show, part ways to work on their various projects, and then regroup.[22]:82[68][69] Helm later made the case in his autobiography, This Wheel's on Fire, that Robertson had forced the Band's breakup on the rest of the group.[70]\n\nConcert promoter Bill Graham booked the Band at the Winterland Ballroom on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976. The show was intended as a gala event, with ticket prices of $25 per person. The event would include a Thanksgiving dinner served to the audience, and would feature the Band performing with various musical guests.[67] The onstage guest list included Ronnie Hawkins, Muddy Waters, Paul Butterfield, Dr. John, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Van Morrison, Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, and others.[71]\n\nThe Last Waltz concert on November 25, 1976 The Band with musical guests performing \"I Shall Be Released\" atconcert on November 25, 1976\n\nRobertson wanted to document the event on film, and approached director Martin Scorsese to see if he would be interested in shooting the concert.[72][73][74]:73–74 The Winterland concert was called The Last Waltz. Robertson and Scorsese developed a 200-page script for the show, listing out in columns the lyrics of the songs, who was singing what part, and what instruments were being featured. It included columns for the camera and lighting work.[73]\n\nScorsese brought in all-star cameramen such as Michael Chapman, László Kovács and Vilmos Zsigmond to film the show in 35mm.[72][73] John Simon, producer on the Band's first two albums, was brought in to coordinate rehearsals and work as musical director.[75] Boris Leven was brought in as art director. Jonathan Taplin assumed the role of executive producer, and Robertson worked as producer of the film.[11]:336\n\nRehearsals for The Last Waltz concert began in early November. Warner Bros. Records president Mo Ostin offered to finance the production of The Last Waltz film in exchange for the rights to release music from The Last Waltz as an album. However, the group were contractually obligated to supply Capitol Records with one more album before they could be released to work with Warner Bros. So in between rehearsing, the Band worked on the studio album Islands for Capitol. Robertson wrote or co-wrote eight of the ten tracks. One of the songs, \"Knockin' Lost John\", features Robertson on vocals, and was the first Band song Robertson had sung on since \"To Kingdom Come\" from Music From Big Pink. \"Christmas Must Be Tonight\" was inspired by the birth of Robertson's son, Sebastian, in July 1974.[11]:336–8[22]:82\n\nThe Last Waltz concert event took place on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976. Approximately five thousand people were in attendance.[76] The event began at 5 pm, beginning with the audience members being served a full traditional Thanksgiving meal at candlelit tables, with a vegetarian table serving an alternate menu as an option. The Berkeley Promenade Orchestra played waltz music for dancing afterwards. The tables were cleared and moved at 8 pm. At 9 pm, the Band played songs for an hour, beginning with \"Up On Cripple Creek\". Just after 10 pm, Robertson introduced Ronnie Hawkins, the first onstage guest, with a succession of guest stars appearing with the group until just after midnight.\n\nThe group took a 30-minute break, during which several Bay Area poets performed readings of their poems. After the break, the Band returned to the stage, performing, among other songs, a new composition entitled \"The Last Waltz Theme\" that Robertson had just completed less than 48 hours prior. Bob Dylan was brought in at the end of this second set, performing several songs, and finally being joined with the other guest stars for a finale performance of \"I Shall Be Released\". This was then followed with two all-star jam sessions, after which the Band returned to the stage to close the show with one more song, their rendition of \"Baby Don't You Do It\".[11]:351[68]\n\n1977–1978 (The Last Waltz film and album) [ edit ]\n\nAfter The Last Waltz concert event was finished, director Martin Scorsese had 400 reels of raw footage to work with,[76] and began editing the footage. The film was then sold to United Artists. In the meantime, Robertson and Scorsese continued to brainstorm more ideas for the film. In April 1977, country singer Emmylou Harris and gospel vocal group the Staple Singers were filmed on a sound stage at MGM performing with the Band. Emmylou Harris performed on \"Evangeline\", a new song written by Robertson, and the Staples Singers performed on a new recording of \"The Weight,\" which they themselves had recorded a version of in 1968.[11]:352–53[22]:85–87[74]:73–74 Scorsese's next idea was to intersperse the concert footage with interviews of the Band that told their story. Scorsese conducted the interviews.[citation needed]\n\nThe Last Waltz album was released by Warner Brothers Records on April 7, 1978, as a 3-LP set.[77] The first five sides feature live performances from the concert, and the last side contains studio recordings from the MGM sound stage sessions.[78] The album peaked at #16 on the Billboard charts, and remained in the Top 40 for 8 weeks.[44]:26\n\nThe Last Waltz film was released to theaters on April 26, 1978.[79] The film fared well with both rock and film critics. Robertson and Scorsese made appearances throughout America and Europe to promote the film.[11]:361 Over time, The Last Waltz has become lauded by many as an important and pioneering rockumentary. Its influence has been felt on subsequent rock music films such as Talking Heads' Stop Making Sense (1984), and U2's Rattle and Hum (1988).[80]\n\nProduction and session work outside of the Band 1970–1977 [ edit ]\n\nSinger-songwriter Jesse Winchester performing in 2011, Robertson produced his self-titled debut album in 1970\n\nRobertson produced Jesse Winchester's debut self-titled album, which was released in 1970 on Ampex Records.[81] The album features Robertson playing guitar throughout the album, and co-credits the track \"Snow\" to Robertson as well.[82]\n\nRobertson played guitar on ex-Beatle Ringo Starr's third solo album, Ringo (1973), performing with four-fifths of the Band on the track \"Sunshine Life For Me (Sail Away Raymond)\".[83][84] Robertson contributed a guitar solo on the track \"Snookeroo\" on Starr's fourth album, Goodnight Vienna (1974).[85]\n\nRobertson played guitar for Joni Mitchell on the track \"Raised on Robbery\", which was released on her album Court and Spark. In 1974, Robertson also played guitar on Carly Simon's version of \"Mockingbird\", which featured Simon singing with her then-husband James Taylor.[86]\n\nIn 1975, Robertson produced and played guitar on singer/guitarist Hirth Martinez's debut album Hirth From Earth. Bob Dylan had heard Martinez, and recommended him to Robertson. Robertson identified strongly with Martinez' music, helped him to secure a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records, and agreed to produce Martinez' debut album. He also played guitar on Martinez' follow-up album, Big Bright Street (1977).[11]:321–322[87][88][89]\n\nIn 1975, Eric Clapton recorded the album No Reason to Cry at the Band's Shangri-La Studios with help from members of the Band.[11]:326 Robertson played lead guitar on the track \"Sign Language\".[90]\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Robertson connected with singer Neil Diamond, and the two began collaborating on a concept album about the life and struggles of a Tin Pan Alley songwriter. The resulting album, entitled Beautiful Noise, was recorded at Shangri-La Studios in early 1976. It reached #6 on the Billboard charts and remained in the Top 40 for sixteen weeks. Robertson produced the album, co-wrote the track \"Dry Your Eyes\" with Diamond, and played guitar on \"Dry Your Eyes\", \"Lady-Oh\", and \"Jungletime\". He produced Diamond's live double album Love at the Greek (1977), which was recorded in 1976 at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles. Love at the Greek reached #8 on the Billboard charts and remained in the Top 40 for nine weeks.[11]:321–322[44]:89[91]\n\nIn 1977, Robertson contributed to two album projects from the Band alumni. Robertson played guitar on \"Java Blues\" on Rick Danko's self-titled debut album, and also played guitar on the Earl King-penned \"Sing, Sing, Sing\" on the album Levon Helm & the RCO All-Stars.[7]:273[92]\n\nAlso in 1977, Robertson contributed to the second self-titled album by singer-songwriter Libby Titus, who was the former girlfriend of Levon Helm.[7]:213, 279–280 Robertson produced the track \"The Night You Took Me To Barbados In My Dreams\" (co-written by Titus and Hirth Martinez), and produced and played guitar on the Cole Porter standard \"Miss Otis Regrets\".[93]\n\nFilm career 1980–1986 [ edit ]\n\nCarny (1980) film and soundtrack [ edit ]\n\nAfter the release of The Last Waltz, MGM/UA, who released the film, viewed Robertson as a potential film actor, and provided Robertson with an office on the MGM lot.[32][94] During this time, Martin Scorsese's agent, Harry Ulfand, contacted Robertson about the idea of producing a dramatic film about traveling carnivals, which Robertson was drawn to because of his childhood experiences working in carnivals. The screenplay for the film Carny was directed by documentary filmmaker Robert Kaylor.[citation needed]\n\nAlthough Robertson was initially only intended to be the producer of Carny, he ended up becoming third lead actor in the film, playing the role of Patch, the patch man. Gary Busey played \"Frankie\", the carnival bozo and Patch's best friend. Jodie Foster was selected to play the role of Donna, a small town girl who runs away to join the carnival and threatens to come between the two friends. The film cast real life carnies alongside professional film actors, which created a difficult atmosphere on set.[10][95] Carny opened to theaters on June 13, 1980.[96] Also in 1980, Warner Bros released a soundtrack album for Carny, which is co-credited to Robertson and composer Alex North, who wrote the orchestral score for the film. The soundtrack was rereleased on compact disc by Real Gone Music in 2015.[10]\n\nEarly collaborations with Martin Scorsese 1980–1986 (Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, The Color of Money) [ edit ]\n\n\"He's a frustrated musician, and I guess I was a frustrated filmmaker. So it was a perfect connect.\" —Robbie Robertson, on his working relationship with Martin Scorsese[97]\n\nAfter the production of Carny was completed, Robertson flew to New York to assist Martin Scorsese on the music for the film Raging Bull (1980).[10]\n\nRobertson and Scorsese would have a long-running working relationship. The former would find and/or create music to underscore the latter's films. Raging Bull was the first of these collaborations. Robertson credits his work on Raging Bull for sparking his interest in the work of sourcing and underscoring music for movies.[97][98]\n\nRobertson supplied three newly recorded instrumental jazz tracks for sourced music, which he also produced. These three tracks feature Robertson playing guitar, along with performances from the Band alumni Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel. One of the tracks, \"Webster Hall\", is co-written by Robertson and Garth Hudson.[99] Robertson also worked with Scorsese on selecting the film's opening theme music, choosing the intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana by Italian opera composer Pietro Mascagni.[97] The soundtrack was finally released by Capitol Records in 2005 as a 37 track, 2-CD set.[99]\n\nRobertson worked with Scorsese again on his next film, The King of Comedy (1983), and is credited in the film's opening credits for \"Music Production\".[100] Robertson contributed one original song, \"Between Trains,\" to the film's soundtrack. The song was written in tribute to \"Cowboy\" Dan Johnson, an assistant of Scorsese's who had recently died.[11]:379 Robertson produced the track, sings lead vocals, and plays guitar and keyboards; the Band alumni Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel appear on the track was well. A soundtrack album for the film was released by Warner Bros. in 1983.[citation needed]\n\nIn June 1986, Robertson began working with Scorsese on his next film The Color of Money.[101] In addition to sourcing music for the film, Robertson also composed the film's score;[102] it was the first time Robertson had ever written a dramatic underscore for a film.[103] Robertson brought in Canadian jazz composer Gil Evans to orchestrate the arrangements.[104]\n\nThe best known song on The Color of Money soundtrack is Eric Clapton's \"It's in the Way That You Use It\", which was co-written by Robertson. \"It's in the Way That You Use It\" reached #1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart in January 1987.[105] Robertson produced a song for the film with blues player Willie Dixon[106] entitled \"Don't Tell Me Nothin'\"; Dixon's track was co-written with Robertson. The Color of Money's soundtrack album was released by MCA Records.\n\nSolo career [ edit ]\n\nGeffen Records period [ edit ]\n\nRobbie Robertson (1987) [ edit ]\n\nRobertson began work on his first solo album, Robbie Robertson, in July 1986 after signing to Geffen Records. Robertson chose fellow Canadian Daniel Lanois to produce the album. Much of the album was recorded at The Village Recorder in West Los Angeles, California. He recorded at Bearsville Studios near Woodstock, New York, and also in Dublin, Ireland with U2, and in Bath, England with Peter Gabriel. He employed a number of guest artists on the album, including U2, Gabriel, the Bodeans, and Maria McKee.[101][103] Garth Hudson and Rick Danko also made appearances on the album. Robertson wrote one track, \"Fallen Angel\", in honor of Richard Manuel,[103] after his passing in March 1986.[11]:384\n\nReleased on October 26, 1987,[107] Robbie Robertson peaked at #35 on the Billboard 200, remaining in the top 40 for three weeks.[44]:260 The album charted even higher in the UK, peaking at #23 on the UK Albums Chart and remaining on the chart for 14 weeks.[108] Robbie Robertson received overwhelming critical acclaim at the time of its release,[109] being listed in the Top-Ten Albums of the Year by several critics in Billboard magazine's 1987 \"The Critics' Choice\" end of the year feature.[110] The album was listed as #77 in Rolling Stone's 1989 list \"100 Best Albums of the Eighties.\"[111]\n\nRobertson had his single largest hit in the UK with \"Somewhere Down The Crazy River\", which features his spoken word verses contrasted with singing in the choruses.[103] The song reached #15 in the UK Hit Singles chart, and remained in the chart for 11 weeks.[108] The video for \"Somewhere Down The Crazy River\" was directed by Martin Scorsese, and features Maria McKee in an acting role.[112]\n\nIn the US, Robbie Robertson produced several hits on the Billboard Mainstream Rock charts, with \"Showdown At Big Sky\" coming in the highest (#2) and \"Sweet Fire Of Love\" the second highest (#7).[113] The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for \"Best Rock / Vocal Album\",[114] and was certified gold in the United States in 1991.[109] In Canada, Robertson won Album Of The Year, Best Male Vocalist Of The Year and Producer Of The Year at the Juno Award ceremony in 1989.[115]\n\nIn 1991, Rod Stewart recorded a version of \"Broken Arrow\" for his album Vagabond Heart.[116] Stewart's version of the song reached #20 on the Billboard 100 chart in the US[117] and #2 on the Billboard Top Canadian Hit Singles chart in Canada.[118] \"Broken Arrow\" was performed live by the Grateful Dead with Phil Lesh on vocals.[119]\n\nStoryville (1991) [ edit ]\n\nStoryville was released on September 30, 1991.[120] Robertson headed to the bayou to collaborate with some of the city's natives like Aaron and Ivan Neville and the Rebirth Brass Band. Once again, Robertson brought in Band alumni Garth Hudson and Rick Danko as contributors.[121] The album reached #69 on the Billboard 200 chart.[122] Storyville received numerous positive reviews, with Rolling Stone giving it 4 1/2 stars out of 5,[123] and the Los Angeles Times awarding it 3 stars out of 4.[124] Two tracks from the album, \"What About Now\" and \"Go Back To Your Woods\", charted on the Billboard Mainstream Rock charts at #15 and #32 respectively.[113] The album was nominated for Grammy awards in the categories \"Best Rock Vocal Performance (solo)\" and \"Best Engineer\".[114]\n\nProduction and session work 1984–1992 [ edit ]\n\nIn 1984, Robertson co-produced the track \"The Best of Everything\" with Tom Petty for the Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers album Southern Accents.[125] Robertson also worked on the horn arrangements for the track, and brought in Band alumni Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson as guests.[126][127]\n\nIn 1986, Robertson appeared as a guest on the album Reconciled by the Call, playing guitar on the track \"The Morning\".[128]\n\nAlso in 1986, Robertson was brought on as creative consultant for Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll (1987), a feature film saluting Chuck Berry.[129] Robertson appears in film, interviewing Chuck Berry, and then playing guitar while Berry recites poetry.[130]\n\nIn 1988, Robertson collaborated as a songwriter with Lone Justice lead singer Maria McKee. One of the songs, the co-wrote \"Nobody's Child\", was released on McKee's self-titled debut album in 1989.[131][132]\n\nIn 1989, Robertson recorded and produced a new version of the Band's \"Christmas Must Be Tonight\" for the Scrooged soundtrack. In 1990, Robertson appeared as a guest on the Ryuichi Sakamoto album Beauty, playing guitar on the song \"Romance\". He also contributed to the world music video and album production One World One Voice.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1992, Robertson produced the song \"Love in Time\" for Roy Orbison's posthumous album King of Hearts. \"Love In Time\" was a basic demo Orbison had recorded that was believed to be lost, but had just recently been rediscovered. Robertson set about augmenting Orbison's basic vocal track with new arrangements and instrumentation, with the intent of making it sound like the arrangements were there from the beginning instead of later additions.[133]\n\nLater solo albums [ edit ]\n\nMusic For The Native Americans (1994): In 1994, Robertson returned to his roots, forming a Native American group the Red Road Ensemble for Music for the Native Americans, a collection of songs that accompanied a PBS television documentary series. Like his songs, \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,\" and \"Acadian Driftwood,\" Robertson touches on history that connects to his life and family. The Battle Of Wounded Knee and the near extinction of the buffalo in the United States are outlined in the song, \"Ghost Dance.\"[134] Robertson was recognized with a Juno Award for Producer of the Year.[115] The international success of \"Mahk Jchi (Heartbeat Drum Song)\" inspired a concert in Agrigento, Italy, celebrating Native American music. Robertson headlined the festival along with other Native American musicians, and portions of the live performance appeared in the PBS documentary.[citation needed]\n\nContact From The Underworld Of Redboy (1998): On Contact from the Underworld of Redboy, Robertson departed from his typical production style and delved deep into a mix of rock, native and electronic music. He employed the services of Howie B, DJ Premier and producer Marius De Vries (Björk, Massive Attack).[citation needed]\n\nThrough the songs on the album he takes a close look at native traditions like Peyote Healing. The racial epithet in the album's title comes from an experience when Robertson was referred to as \"Red Boy,\" by some bullies, while playing with his cousins.[135] He sampled a young Native American singer from the 1940s which he got from the Library Of Congress on the album's opening track, \"The Sound Is Fading.\" Also included is an interview from prison with Leonard Peltier set to a soundscape provided by Robertson on the song \"Sacrifice\".

(Plus, as I’ll suggest later, it’s well worth becoming familiar with the contents of your Python installation).\n\nAnd with this tutorial, you’ll be running code right from the start. No need to page through syntax definitions or battle with compiler errors.\n\nSince the best way to learn a language is to use it, the tutorial invites you to play with the Python interpreter as you read.\n\nIf you have a programming background you can complete the tutorial in a morning and be using Python by the afternoon; and if you haven’t, Python makes an excellent first language.\n\nA tutorial cannot cover everything, of course, and this one recognises that and points you towards further reading. The next place to look, it says, is the Python Library Reference. I agree.\n\nThe documentation index suggests you:\n\nkeep this under your pillow\n\nIt’s a reference. It documents use of the standard libraries which came with your Python installation. I’m not suggesting you read it from cover to cover but you do need to know where it is and what’s in it.\n\nYou should definitely read the opening sections which cover the built-in objects, functions and types. I also suggest you get used to accessing the same information from within the Python interpreter using help : it may not be hyperlinked or prettily laid out, but the information is right where you need it.\n\n>>> help(dict) Help on class dict in module __builtin__: class dict(object) | dict() -> new empty dictionary. | dict(mapping) -> new dictionary initialized from a mapping object's | (key, value) pairs. | dict(seq) -> new dictionary initialized as if via: | d = {} | for k, v in seq: | d[k] = v | dict(**kwargs) -> new dictionary initialized with the name=value pairs | in the keyword argument list. For example: dict(one=1, two=2)\n\nThe Language Reference claims to be:\n\nfor language lawyers\n\nbut I’m not sure that’s true. Readable and clear, it offers a great insight into the language’s design. Again, you may not want to read it straight through, but I suggest you skim read it now and return to it if you find yourself confused by Python’s inner workings.\n\nThe Python Cookbook is the first slab of treeware I’m recommending. Yes, Active State provides a website for the book, which has even more recipes than the book and is well worth a visit, but I’d say you want the printed edition. It’s nicely laid out and provides clear examples of how to use Python for common programming tasks. Alternative approaches are discussed. You can dip in to it or read the sections most relevant to your particular domain. This book teaches you idiomatic Python by example and, remarkably, it actually benefits from being written by a large team of authors. The editors have done an excellent job.\n\nIncidentally, if you’re wondering why I claim Python is a high-level language and C++ isn’t, just compare the contents of the Python Cookbook with the contents of its C++ counterpart. Both books weigh in at ~600 pages, but the C++ one barely gets beyond compiling a program and reading from a file.\n\nThis one’s a presentation David Goodger gave at a conference last year. I wish he’d written it and I’d read it sooner. If you care about code layout, how you name things etc. but don’t want to waste time arguing about such things, then you probably want to go with the native language conventions. Python has a well-defined style and this presentation describes it well, connecting and summarising the contents of several other references.\n\nThe next version of the Python documentation (for versions 2.6 and later) has a HOWTOs section. A. M. Kuchling’s Functional Programming HOWTO is a MUSTREAD, especially for anyone coming from a language with weak support for FP. Python is far from being a pure functional programming language but features like list comprehensions, iterators, generators, even decorators, draw direct inspiration from functional programming.\n\nIf you took my advice and skim-read the Library Reference, you may have skipped past a small module (mis?)filed in the Numeric and Mathematical Modules section. Now’s the time to go back and study it. It won’t take long, but these itertools functions are, to me, the epitome of elegance and power. I use them every day, wish they were promoted to builtins, and most of my interpreted Python sessions start:\n\n>>> from itertools import *\n\nThe pure-python modules and test code in your Python installation are packed with good, readable code. If you’re looking for example code using a particular module, have a look at that module’s unit tests.\n\nI’ve mentioned Python versions a few times in this article. Although Python takes stability and backwards compatibility seriously, the language has updated every year for as long as I’ve been using it. Generally, the changes are backwards compatible so, for example, 2.1 code should work fine in 2.5, but it’s important to stay current.\n\nDo you write code like this?\n\nanag_dict = {} words_fp = open(\"wordlist.txt\", \"rt\") for line in words_fp.readlines(): word = line.strip().lower() chars = [] for ch in word: chars.append(ch) chars.sort() key = \"\".join(chars) anag_dict.setdefault(key, []).append(word) words_fp.close() anagrams = [] for words in anag_dict.values(): if len(words) > 1: anagrams.append(words)\n\nThen you should find out about list comprehensions, the built in sorted function, and defaultdicts — introduced in Python 2.0, 2.4, 2.5 respectively!\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict anag_dict = defaultdict(list) with open(\"wordlist.txt\", \"rt\") as words_fp: for line in words_fp: word = line.strip().lower() key = \"\".join(sorted(word)) anag_dict[key].append(word) anagrams = [words for words in anag_dict.itervalues() if len(words) > 1]\n\nThe with statement, incidentally, appears in 2.6, which is in alpha as I write this. Get it now by:\n\nfrom __future__ import with_statement\n\nAnyway, the point of all this is that A. M. Kuchling writes up what’s new in each Python revision: think of it as the release notes. As an example, here’s What’s New in Python 2.5. Essential reading.\n\nI’ve only mentioned one book on this reading list. There are plenty of other decent Python books but I don’t regard them as essential. In fact, I’d rather invest in an excellent general programming title than (for example) Programming Python.\n\nWhy? Well, partly because of the speed at which the language progresses. Thus the second edition of the Python Cookbook — the single book I regard as essential — did a great job of being 2.4 compliant before 2.4 was even released, which definitely extended its shelf-life; but it has nothing to say about Python 2.5 features, let alone Python 2.6 and the transition to Python 3.0. And partly because the books all too easily become too thick for comfortable use. Python famously comes with batteries included, but full details of their use belongs online.\n\nI do own a copy of Python Essential Reference by David Beazley. It’s the second edition and is now woefully out of date (covering Python up to version 2.1). I did get good use out of it, though. It’s well designed, beautifully written and laid out, and, weighing in at fewer than 400 pages, comfortable to read and carry. Somehow it manages (managed, I should say) to pack everything in: it’s concise, and it recognises that the online documentation should be the source of authoritative answers. Despite this, I haven’t bought the third edition. Partly because I don’t really need it, partly because it’s now a Python point revision or two out of date, and partly because it’s expanded to 644 pages.\n\nThere’s nothing controversial here. The Zen of Python should whet your appetite, and the next three items are exactly what you’ll find at the top of the Python documentation home page. Others may argue Python in a Nutshell deserves a place, or indeed the hefty Programming Python, and they’re certainly good books.\n\nI’d be more interested to find out which non-Python books have improved your Python programming the most. For myself, I’ll predictably pick Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.\n\nThe anagrams puzzle comes from Dave Thomas’s CodeKata, a nice collection of programming exercises. The solutions presented here gloss over a few details and make assumptions about the input. Is “face” an anagram of “café”, for example? For that matter, what about “cafe” and “café”. Or “isn’t” and “tins”? What if the word list contains duplicates? These issues aren’t particularly hard to solve but they do highlight the dangers of coding up a solution without fully specifying the problem, and indeed the difference between a “working” solution and a finished one.\n\nHowever, I just wanted a short program to highlight advances in recent versions of Python, and in that light, here’s another variant. (My thanks to Marius Gedminas for spotting a bug in the code I originally posted here.)",
  "latent_4549": "NOT FOR the first time in recent months, an Italian media source yesterday revealed embarrassing details of a flourishing gay “scene” within the Holy See in Rome.\n\nCarmelo Abbate, an undercover reporter from weekly news magazine Panorama, provides in its latest issue graphic detail of a month-long series of gay parties and brief encounters in and around the Holy See, featuring openly gay priests.\n\nAbbate, who introduced himself into the community thanks to an (unnamed) gay friend, begins his latter-day Decameron with a party in the Testaccio area of Rome.\n\nHe and his friend were invited to the party by a French priest, referred to as Paul, whom the friend claims he first met in a sauna. After watching two semi-naked, oiled and muscular gay dancers go through their routine, Fr Paul climbed up on stage for what the reporter calls a session of “Dirty Dancing For Three”.\n\nThat first night ended with Fr Paul spending the night with Abbate’s friend. The Panoramaarticle is accompanied by clandestine photos allegedly depicting the said Fr Paul in striped boxer shorts in the friend’s bedroom on the morning after.\n\nThe article goes on to detail homosexual encounters with two other Rome-based priests, “Carlo” and “Luca”, passionate encounters that are also photographically documented. After sex, Fr Luca, for example, proudly shows off his clerical vestments, walking around the bedroom half-naked. Fr Carlo claims that “98 per cent” of the priests he knows are homosexuals.\n\nThe reporter’s friend says he knows many priests who frequent gay spots such as the Coming Out bar near the Coliseum.\n\nFr Paul and the friend begin a relationship via affectionate text messages. At one point the priest explains he has “to say Mass this evening at six o’clock but I’ll say a prayer for you, if you like”.\n\nAt the Testaccio party, a Sardinian claims he has come to Rome just for the party, and asks: “Did you meet Fr Paul when you went to confession?”\n\nThere was no official Vatican response to the Panoramaarticle yesterday, but the pope’s man in the diocese of Rome, namely the vicariate of Rome, Cardinal Agostino Vallini, issued a statement condemning the “double life” of certain priests and adding: “Coherence calls for them to come clean. We do not wish them any ill but we cannot accept that because of their behaviour, the honour of all priests is besmirched.”\n\nSergio Rovasio, secretary of the radical group Certain Rights, said: “Finally, a piece of investigative journalism which documents something which anyone who frequents gay spots in Rome knows only too well – namely, there are a lot of priests who attend these places and who have sexual encounters without seeming to be minimally worried by the evident hypocrisy of what they preach by day and what they do by night.”\n\nLast March the Vatican was shaken by media reports claiming disgraced papal gentleman Angelo Balducci, now in prison, had been active in a gay prostitution ring which also involved subsequently dismissed Vatican chorister Chinediu Thiomas Ehiem.",
  "latent_4558": "This article is about the card game. For the night club, see Fluxx (nightclub)\n\nFluxx is a card game, played with a specially designed deck published by Looney Labs. It is different from most other card games, in that the rules and the conditions for winning are altered throughout the game, via cards played by the players.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nFluxx was created by Andrew Looney on July 24, 1996 as the first game for his and his wife's part-time game design company, Looney Laboratory.[2][3] The original print run was for 5,000 units[2] and was released in 1997.[3]\n\nThe game was successful and was licensed a year later to Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) for wider distribution. ICE went bankrupt two years later and Looney Labs resumed publication and distribution.[4] By March 2001, Labs was considering putting out another standalone deck version called Fluxx++ using card created by the Fluxx playing community with Fluxx Blanxx and Fluxx: Goals Galore, an expansion consisting of goal cards, based on its Origins 2000 5 Goal cards promo pack.[5] Labs created Fluxx Lite, a slimmed down 56 card deck to lower the price for discount superstores, in design by March 2002.[6]\n\nIn 2003, Amigo Games, a German game company, licensed and published a German language version of Fluxx.[7] The in design Fluxx Reduxx was indefinitely placed on hold as of July 14, 2005 to focus on EcoFluxx. Looney Labs registered the Fluxx trademark.[8] By October 2005, Stoner Fluxx had been released and EcoFluxx was in play testing, and scheduled to be released later that month[9] followed by Family Fluxx.[10]\n\nIn November 2006, Looney Labs issued a Spanish language edition of the game.[7] The October 10, 2007 release of a zombie-themed version brought the first of a new card type, the Creeper[11] and Ungoal.[12] In 2008, Toy Vault and Looney Labs co-published and released Monty Python Fluxx.[13] Fluxx edition 4 was released in December 2008 and was the first set to have the Meta Rule subtype card, which stemmed from a Fluxx Tournament rule.[14]\n\nIn 2008, Zombie Fluxx won the Origins Award for Traditional Card Game of the Year.[15] Stoner Fluxx was placed back in print under the Full Baked Ideas imprint of Looney Labs on November 13, 2009 after being out of print for four years. Full Baked was launched with expectation of a future release of a drinking variant and other mature subject versions.[16]\n\nTwo variants were re-released on March 5, 2010, EcoFluxx and Family Fluxx, with Eco being a new edition.[10] In February 2011, the Surprise subtype of cards were introduced in the Pirate Fluxx themed variant.[17] In March 2011, the German language version 2nd edition was released by Pegasus Games.[18] By May 2011 over 1 million decks of all Fluxx versions had been sold while Pirate Fluxx was getting into bookstores that month.[19]\n\nOn August 1, 2012, Looney Labs got a simplified, less expensive general market version with redesigned packaging of Fluxx into Target stores.[2] For the summer 2012, Fluxx was number 10 in ICv2's Top 10 Card/Building Games (hobby channel).[20]\n\nA Cartoon Network version of the game was made available as a Target exclusive from mid-August 2014 until Easter 2015, while in July the Regular Show Fluxx was released to the hobby market.[21] The fifth edition of the regular Fluxx game was made available beginning in 2014 as the 4.0 edition ran out. Looney Labs teamed up with The Doubleclicks for a Fluxx theme song.[22]\n\nA new expansion of the game, Fluxx Dice, plus two new licensed variants were scheduled to be released in the summer of 2015.[23] With a delay of the first variant to be released at the polled requested of the retailers, Looney Labs pushed back the dice and the other variant to stagger the releases to spread out the impact.[24]\n\nA series of educational variants were released in 2017 and 2018.[25] In partnership with Gale Force 9, two Fluxx versions of Star Trek will be released in August 2018.[26]\n\nGame description and play [ edit ]\n\nThe first edition deck consists of 84 cards with four types of cards: Keepers, Goals, Actions, and New Rules. While the game begins by requiring players to simply draw and play a specific number of cards, the mechanic mutates when a New Rule card is played. The card may change the number of cards drawn or played per turn, the number of cards held per hand, or the Keepers played.[9] The Goal cards change the Keepers needed to win the game.[2] Games last from 5 to 30 minutes.[27]\n\nLater sets sometimes included new card subtypes, depending on the theme of the set. These include included Creeper cards that block or make goals more difficult to obtain;[10] Ungoal cards, which have conditions where the game ends with no winner;[12] and Surprise cards, a 2011 addition, which allow players to negate other types of cards which could prevent a victory and can be played at any time, though they have other effects when played on one's own turn.[17]\n\nThe first Fluxx tournament at Origins 1997 had an extra rule calling for an increase in the Basic Rules each time the deck was reshuffled which was kept for future tournaments. On August 28, 2008 via their Wunderland blog, Looney introduced \"Meta Rule\" cards for players to print at home and add to standard decks[28] or place in the primary deck Edition 4.0.[14]\n\nEarly edition decks had 84 cards[9] while newer standard decks have 100 cards,[29] while Lite versions (Family, Spanish, SE) consist of 56 cards.[10][30][31]\n\nCard sets [ edit ]\n\nEditions [ edit ]\n\nFluxx 3.1 cards look similar to earlier versions.\n\nFluxx 1.0 (1997) first released version; monochrome, poker-sized cards\n\nFluxx 2.0 (1998) published by Iron Crown Enterprises; [4] new card layout, use of color, bridge-sized cards\n\nnew card layout, use of color, bridge-sized cards Fluxx 2.1 (2002) reprint of 2.0 with minor changes\n\nFamily Fluxx ( November 2005 ) initially designated as Fluxx Lite then Fluxx Jr. before being released, [10] [30] is a full-color \"family friendly\" 56 card edition, with family bonuses, [31] re-released on March 5, 2010 , [10] currently (by July 2015 ) out of print [32]\n\n( ) initially designated as then before being released, is a full-color \"family friendly\" 56 card edition, with family bonuses, re-released on , currently (by ) out of print Fluxx 3.0 (many cards removed and added, to improve balance) manufactured by Cartamundi\n\nFluxx 3.1 ( 2005 ) new style Basic Rule card, two cards removed, one card added; manufactured by Cartamundi [8]\n\n) new style Basic Rule card, two cards removed, one card added; manufactured by Cartamundi Fluxx 4.0 ( December 2008 ) card number increased to 100, all color, introduction of Meta rule in any set and creepers in primary editions [14]\n\n) card number increased to 100, all color, introduction of Meta rule in any set and creepers in primary editions Fluxx SE ( August 1, 2012 ) a Target Stores exclusive \"basic entry\" edition of the game, with simplified rules and exclusive cards, [2] manufactured by 360 Manufacturing\n\n) a Target Stores exclusive \"basic entry\" edition of the game, with simplified rules and exclusive cards, manufactured by 360 Manufacturing Fluxx 5.0 (2014)[22] removal of all creepers[33] and several other cards, 17 total, replaced by new Goals, Actions, and New Rules cards\n\nLanguages [ edit ]\n\nFlux Spanish ( Fluxx Español! ; November 2006 ) Looney Labs, [7] a 56 card set with 6 new Goals, a new Keeper and a new Rule [31]\n\n; ) Looney Labs, a 56 card set with 6 new Goals, a new Keeper and a new Rule German Fluxx first edition (2003; based on 3.0 card set) by Amigo Games [7] Second edition ( March 2011 ; based on 4.0 card set) Pegasus Games [18]\n\nfirst edition (2003; based on 3.0 card set) by Amigo Games Japanese Fluxx (based on 3.0 card set) HobbyJapan\n\n(based on 3.0 card set) HobbyJapan Dutch Fluxx (based on 5.0 card set) PS Games\n\n(based on 5.0 card set) PS Games Portuguese EcoFluxx, released in Brazil[7]\n\nVariants [ edit ]\n\nZombie Fluxx cards in play, including New Rules (yellow) and Goals (pink). cards in play, including New Rules (yellow) and Goals (pink).\n\nThere are also versions of Fluxx that have been released using entirely different themed sets of cards while playing by the same set of rules.\n\nFully Baked Ideas imprint\n\nStoner 2nd Edition ( November 13, 2009 ) with 5% of proceeds going to end marijuana prohibition groups; [16] 100 cards\n\n2nd Edition ( ) with 5% of proceeds going to end marijuana prohibition groups; 100 cards Drinking ' (July 24, 2017)[46]\n\nEducational sets[25]\n\nMath ( March 9, 2017 ) [47]\n\n( ) Chemistry ( May 25, 2017 ) [48]\n\n( ) Anatomy (April 5, 2018)[25]\n\nMany of the version can be combined with each other to make a \"mega Fluxx\" deck (as all these versions have the same card back style).[10]\n\nExpansions [ edit ]\n\nSeveral expansions have been produced, including:\n\nFlowers and (a gift set with a \"bouquet\" of six plush \"Happy Flowers\", a Fluxx 3.0 deck and an exclusive \"Flowers\" promo Keeper card) [49]\n\n(a gift set with a \"bouquet\" of six plush \"Happy Flowers\", a 3.0 deck and an exclusive \"Flowers\" promo Keeper card) Fluxx Blanxx , a set of blank cards for creating one's own custom additions (see above).

The board is separated into 9 movable tiles with four spaces each except for the start tile with the initial set up of 3x3 square. Besides the Keeper spaces there are 1 octagon space per title and two teleport spaces for the whole board. Moving on to one teleport space allows the player to move to the other teleport space. The octagon may hold any number of pawns while the keeper spaces can only have one with an incoming pawn pushing out the current pawn. There are two peg boards that track, the number of goals needed to win and current rules.[39]\n\nAll start with a hand of three cards and a color card in face up to indicate the pawns they control. The each get to make a free rule change. New general rules affecting the tiles include rotation, moving and allowing wraparound tile movement. The game only has Action, Goals, New Rules and Leaper type cards. Action cards can change force a change in player color. A Leaper card counts as a card play but allows you to move a pawn to the item on the board. Goals cards are stacked near the board with top most card the current goal.[39]\n\nPromotional cards [ edit ]\n\nLooney Labs gives away promotional cards related to Fluxx at conventions such as Gen Con and Origins. They have given away cards such as Composting and Jackpot, which later appeared in EcoFluxx and Family Fluxx respectively. They have also given away promo cards for Christmas to members of their online mailing list and in High Times magazine.

However, both Volity.net and CCG Workshop are no longer operating.[53]\n\nIn December 2012, Fluxx was released by Playdek as an app on iOS operating systems (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Apple TV) by purchasing it from the Apple App Store. It uses the \"mass market\" deck developed for Target Stores, removing some of the more esoteric themes (such as Cthulhu) and complex rule cards.[54]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nThe base game won the Mensa Select Game Award in 1999.[55] Rick Loomis comments: \"Fluxx makes a good game for a group that has one of those annoying 'I-must-win-every-game' types. The rest of you can enjoy yourselves as the game spins out of his control (as it surely will) and perhaps he'll eventually learn to lose gracefully. Meanwhile, Fluxx will be busily exercising everyone's logic synapses as you attempt to deal with the chaotic situations that occur because of the cheerful clash of rules.\"[56]\n\nAn ICv2 review of the Batman variant by Nick Smith gave it 4 out of 5 stars as \"The Fluxx series of games is not for everyone.\" But the game worked well with the Batman theme: \"The game-themed victory conditions are good, and the thematic elements were very well thought out. This may be the best-designed Fluxx set in some time, and it can be a lot of fun for casual fans to try to achieve the thematic victory conditions.\"[1]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

  "latent_4652": "Yellen Hikes Interest Rates for THIRD TIME Since Trump Elected President – But Only Once in Obama’s 8 Years\n\nGuest post by Joe Hoft\n\nIn the past 10 years there have been only four Fed Funds rate increases.\n\nThree of those increases have occurred since President Trump won the election on November 8th, 2016.\n\nNo Fed Funds Rate increases took place between June 2006 and December 2015. CNBC reported in December 2015 that President Obama oversaw “seven years of the most accommodative monetary policy in U.S. history” (from the Fed). Finally, in December 2015 after the Fed announced its first increase in the Fed Funds rate during the Obama Presidency, it was reported that:\n\nGiven the economic outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic conditions, the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ¼ to ½ percent,” the FOMC’s post-meeting statement said. “The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative after this increase, thereby supporting further improvements in labor Premarket conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.”\n\nThe only other Fed Funds Rate increases since 2016 were after President Trump was elected President. The Fed Funds Rate increased on December 14, 2016, on March 15th, 2017 and yesterday June 14th, 2017 by .25% .\n\nThe Fed Funds Rate greatly impacts the economy:\n\nLower interest rates usually spur the economy by making corporate and consumer borrowing easier. Higher interest rates are intended to slow down the economy by making borrowing harder.\n\nSo again the question is whether the Fed is trying to negatively impact President Trump’s economic recovery from the abysmal Obama years (Obama was the only President where the GDP growth rate never broke 3% ) or is the economy just so much better now that President Trump has taken office?\n\nWe suspect both.\n\nPresident Obama’s policies were so horrible that the historically low Fed Funds Interest rate was needed to keep the economy alive.\n\nAlso, President Trump’s policies of lower taxes, repealing and replacing Obamacare and slashing regulations all will lead to economic prosperity for the United States.",
  "latent_4679": "Since finishing my first year of my PhD, I have been spending some quality time with my computer. Sure, the two of us had been together all throughout the academic year, but we weren’t doing much together besides pdf-viewing and type-setting. Around spring break, when I discovered you can in fact freeze your computer by having too many exams/section notes/textbooks simultaneously open, I promised my MacBook that over the summer we would try some new things together. (And that I would take out her trash more.) After that promise and a new sticker addition, she put away the rainbow wheel.\n\nCut to a few weeks ago. I had a blast from the past in the form of a Twitter notification. Someone had written a post about using R to analyze the TV show Friends, which was was motivated by a similar interest that drove me to write something about the show using my own dataset back in 2015. In the post, the author, Giora Simchoni, used R to scrape the scripts for all ten seasons of the show and made all that work publicly available (wheeeeee) for all to peruse. In fact, Giora even used some of the data I shared back in 2015 to look into character centrality. In reading about his project, I could practically hear my laptop humming to remind me of its freshly updated R software and my recent tinkering with R notebooks. So, off my Mac and I went, equipped with a new workflow, to explore new data about a familiar TV universe.\n\nWho’s Doing The Talking?\n\nGiven line by line data on all ten seasons, I, like Giora, first wanted to look at line totals for all characters. In aggregating all non-“friends” characters together, we get the following snapshot:\n\nFirst off, why yes, I am using the official Friends font. Second, I am impressed by how close the totals are for all characters though hardly surprised that Phoebe has the least lines. Rachel wouldn’t be surprised either…\n\nRachel: Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go. Phoebe: Ehh!! Rachel: Honey, come on! You live far away! You’re not related. You lift right out.\n\nWith these aggregates in hand, I then was curious: how would line allocations look across time? So, for each episode, I calculate the percentage of lines that each character speaks, and present the results with the following three visuals (again, all non-friends go into the “other” category):\n\nTell me that first graph doesn’t look like a callback to Rachel’s English Trifle. Anyway, regardless of a possible trifle-like appearance, all the visuals illustrate dynamics of an ensemble cast; while there is noise in the time series, the show consistently provides each character with a role to play. However, the last visual does highlight some standouts in the collection of episodes that uncharacteristically highlight or ignore certain characters. In other words, there are episodes in which one member of the cast receives an unusually high or low percentage of the lines in the episode. The three episodes that boast the highest percentages for a single member of the gang are:\n\n“The One with Christmas in Tulsa” (41.9% Chandler) “The One With Joey’s Interview” (40.3% Joey) “The One Where Chandler Crosses a Line” (36.3% Chandler).\n\nSimilarly, the three with the lowest percentages for one of the six are:\n\n“The One With The Ring” (1.5% Monica) “The One With The Cuffs” (1.6% Ross) “The One With The Sonogram At The End” (3.3% Joey)\n\nThe sagging red lines of the last visual identify episodes that have a low percentage of lines spoken by a character outside of the friend group. In effect, those dips in the graph point to extremely six-person-centric episodes, such as “The One On The Last Night” (0.4% non-friends dialogue – a single line in this case), “The One Where Chandler Gets Caught” (1.1% non-friends dialogue), and “The One With The Vows” (1.2% non-friends dialogue).\n\nThe Men vs. The Women\n\nNow, how do the line allocations look when broken down by gender lines across the main six characters? Well, the split consistently bounces around 50-50 over the course of the 10 seasons. Again, as was the case across the six main characters, the balanced split of lines is pretty impressive.\n\nNote that the second visual highlights that there are a few episodes that are irregularly man-heavy. The top three are: “The One Where Chandler Crosses A Line” (77.0% guys), “The One With Joey’s Interview” (75.1% guys), and “The One With Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.” (70.2% guys). There are also exactly two episodes that feature a perfect 50-50 split for lines across gender: “The One Where Rachel Finds Out” and “The One With The Thanksgiving Flashbacks.”\n\nSay My Name\n\nHow much do the main six characters address or mention one another? Giora addressed this question in his post, and I build off of his work by including nicknames in the calculations, and using a different genre of visualization. With respect to the nicknames – “Mon”, “Rach”, “Pheebs”, and “Joe” – “Pheebs” is undoubtably the stickiest of the group. Characters say “Pheebs” 370 times, which has a comfortable cushion over the second-place nickname “Mon” (used 73 times). Characters also significantly differ in their usage of each others’ nicknames. For example, while Joey calls Phoebe “Pheebs” 38.3% of the time, Monica calls her by this nickname only 4.6% of the time.\n\nNow, after adding in the nicknames, who says whose name? The following graphic addresses that point of curiosity:\n\nThe answer is clear: Rachel says Ross’s name the most! (789 times! OK, we get it, Rachel, you’re in love.) We can also see that Joey is the most self-referential with 242 usages of his own name – perhaps not a shock considering his profession in the entertainment biz. Overall, the above visual provides some data-driven evidence of the closeness between certain characters that is clearly evident in watching the show. Namely, the Joey-Chandler, Monica-Chandler, Ross-Rachel relationships that were evident in my original aggregation of shared plot lines are still at the forefront!\n\nComparing the above work to what I had originally put together in January 2015 is a real trip. My original graphics back in 2015 were made entirely in Excel and were as such completely unreproducible, as was the data collection process. The difference between the opaqueness of that process and the transparency of sharing notebook output is super exciting to me… and to my loyal MacBook. Yes, yes, I’ll give you another sticker soon.\n\nScreen fades to black Executive Producer: Alex Albright\n\nShow Me the Code\n\nHere is the R Notebook for this project. Here is the Github repo.",

  "latent_4801": "Rarely does one see a more perfect illustration of the Obama administration’s tortured relationship with Wall Street.\n\nOn August 9, the Justice Department and the SEC both announced [3] the end of investigations into potential criminal behavior related to Goldman’s handling of mortgage-backed securities in the runup to the financial crisis. That same day, the Center for Responsive Politics reported [4] that Goldman employees had switched from giving 75 percent of their campaign donations to Democratic candidates in 2008 to giving 70 percent of of their donations to Republicans in 2012.\n\nThat’s called having your mortgage fraud [5] cake and eating it too.\n\nWhether motivated by sheer pique at Obama’s mildly derogatory comments about “fat cat” bankers, or annoyed by his calls to raise their taxes back to the perilous heights of the Clinton years, or simply incensed at Dodd-Frank’s potential inroads against Goldman’s profit machine, the much-put upon employees of the world’s most famous investment bank are giving Democrats the cold shoulder. And at the very same time, a Democratic administration is sending up the white flag of surrender, acknowledging that it simply can’t bring Wall Street to account for its misdeeds before and during the financial crisis.\n\nAnd misdeeds there were. The 635-page Levin-Coburn report [6] on the financial crisis released in April 2011 makes that clear beyond any reasonable doubt. Goldman knew that the mortgage-backed securities it was packaging together were crap, sought out suckers to sell the trash too, and cashed in by betting that the products they were packaging and selling off would implode in value. Sure, everyone on Wall Street was engaged in the same games — the big difference with Goldman was that they were much, much better at it, and got out while the getting was still good.\n\nUnfortunately, what seems clearly obvious to the normal person does not appear to translate into a slam-dunk court case, in the judgment of Department of Justice prosecutors faced with the daunting prospect of tackling the best-money-can-buy legal defense sure to be marshaled by Goldman. There’s surely a nugget of truth there — Wall Street did a very effective job in the 80s and 90s of ensuring that the rules governing their behavior were as lax as possible. But it still feels pusillanimous. And the cowardice completes a circle — because one of the key reasons why Goldman’s campaign contributions are now flowing to Romney is his promise to repeal the Obama administration’s primary effort to prevent future financial sector misbehavior — Dodd-Frank.\n\nSource URL: http://www.alternet.org/obama-surrenders-goldman-sachs\n\nLet’s keep this award-winning site going!\n\nYes, audiences applaud us.

  "latent_4931": "A recent \"undercover enrollment\" investigation conducted by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that pretty much anyone can sign up for Obamacare and receive taxpayer funded incentives without having to worry about pesky little details like proving citizenship, identity or income-based needs. In fact, the study found that every single one of its 15 fictitious Obamacare applications were actually approved for coverage despite intentional application omissions, fictitious identification and citizenship documentation, etc. Moreover, all of the applications were also approved for federal subsidies which totaled $60,000 per year.\n\nPer the GAO:\n\nOur undercover testing for the 2016 coverage year found that the eligibility determination and enrollment processes of the federal and state marketplaces we reviewed remain vulnerable to fraud, as we previously reported for the 2014 and 2015 coverage years. For each of our 15 fictitious applications, the marketplaces approved coverage, including for 6 fictitious applicants who had previously obtained subsidized coverage but did not file the required federal income-tax returns. Although IRS provides information to marketplaces on whether health-care applicants have filed required returns, the federal Marketplace and our selected state marketplace allowed applicants to instead attest that they had filed returns, saying the IRS information was not sufficiently current. The marketplaces we reviewed also relaxed documentation standards or extended deadlines for filing required documentation. After initial approval, all but one of our fictitious enrollees maintained subsidized coverage, even though we sent fictitious documents, or no documents, to resolve application inconsistencies. For each of our 15 fictitious applications, the federal or state-based marketplaces approved coverage at time of application—specifically, 14 applications for qualified health plans, and 1 application for Medicaid. Each of the 14 applications for qualified health plans was also approved for APTC subsidies. These subsidies totaled about $5,000 on a monthly basis, or about $60,000 annually. These 14 qualified-health-plan applications also each obtained CSR subsidies, putting the applicants in a position to further benefit if they used medical services.\n\nOf the 15 fictitious applications submitted by the GAO, all 15 were initially approved for coverage and subsidies. That said, 3 fictitious enrollees were subsequently kicked out of the exchanges after payments were not processed correctly. Frankly we're shocked that payment is even necessary...these exchanges are heartless.\n\nAll but one of our fictitious enrollees maintained subsidized coverage, even though we sent fictitious documents, or no documents, to resolve application inconsistencies.\n\nOf the 15 applications submitted, 4 intentionally omitted income tax return documentation required to approve income-based subsidies. Despite the omission, the GAO found that all 4 enrollees were able to obtain and maintain healthcare coverage and subsidies.\n\nFor the other 8 applicants, the GAO made up identities to test whether people submitting fake citizenship and/or social security documentation or those applying for coverage in multiple states could still receive coverage. Turns out that every single one of these applications was also approved and all but 1 was able to maintain coverage. Moreover, these seven successful applicants were able to obtain subsidies totaling about $33,000 annually.\n\nThe following chart highlights, by individual, what fictitious documentation was submitted to each exchange and when \"required\" documentation was simply withheld all together.\n\nJust to highlight why we should care, the GAO points out that roughly 1.4mm people received Obamacare subsidies in 2015 even though they had failed to submit required tax information. But it's only $4BN...just a tiny needle in the federal government's haystack of fraud and abuse.\n\nOf course, the California exchange attempted to discredit the GAO study by pointing out the small sample size.\n\nDear California, we too would be worried about the small sample size but for the fact that 100% of the fictitious enrollees were able to get coverage and subsidies...that's relevant.\n\nHouse members Fred Upton (R-Michigan) and Kevin Brady (R-Texas) commented on the new GAO study to CNBC:\n\n\"It's deja vu all over again as it seems the situation only continues to get worse, and we all are paying the price,\" said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich. \"The nonpartisan watchdog reports underscore that there is still tremendous weakness in how the federal marketplace operates and immediate action must be taken to ensure all avenues for fraud are impossible.\" \"When a fire is raging, the first thing you do is grab a hose — but there is no urgency by the administration,\" Upton said. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said, \"This report unfortunately tells us more of what we already know — that the Obamacare federal exchanges have been riddled with problems since Day One.\" \"The fact that the exchanges are so susceptible to fraud is just further proof that the president's health-care law is not working as promised — and wasting billions of taxpayer dollars in the process,\" Brady said.\n\nAnd, of course, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services maintain that they have a \"robust verification process\" aimed at \"protecting taxpayer dollars.\"\n\n\"The marketplace takes seriously the responsibility to protect taxpayer funds, while making coverage available to eligible people. We have a robust verification process to make sure people get benefits they are eligible for while protecting taxpayer dollars.\" \"Within HealthCare.gov we have multiple checks to verify that applicants provide correct eligibility information on their applications, and GAO deliberately circumvented those checks by giving false information, which is against the law for actual applicants.\" \"We appreciate the work the GAO and HHS Office of Inspector General to improve marketplace operations and take action when provided with recommendations or other information. That's why we have repeatedly requested, and remain disappointed, that we still have not received specific details or recommendations from the GAO relating to their fraudulent applications. Specific and actionable information will enable us to analyze and understand what occurred and whether we can make improvements to our processes or procedures.\" \"As recommended by the GAO, we are applying their marketplace Fraud Risk Assessment to areas of eligibility and enrollment to identify and prioritize key areas for potential risk in the marketplace. We are also working closely with issuers through the Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership to identify trends, schemes and specific bad actors.\"\n\nWell, HHS and CMS, if 100% of people can scam their way through your \"robust verification process\" we would hate to see the results of a half-assed effort on your part.\n\nThe full study from the GAO can be read below:",

When people talk about comics, they often attribute the work solely to the writer of the project, and artists are rarely credited as co-authors of the work. The comic book medium has a substantial issue with artists getting the credit they deserve.\n\nYou may be wondering why that is a bad thing. Consider how many news stories you’ve read about creators being harmed as a result of ownership issues. Think back to the many creators having health issues they can’t afford. It’s awful and heartbreaking, but here’s another question: how many times has it been an artist in this situation? Why is it that so many illustrators tend to be the ones forgotten over time? How is that possible in comics, a visual medium?\n\nConsider this: you spend a year drawing an epic science fiction story. You design the characters, the spaceships, the aliens, and the technology. You spend 10 months barely seeing your friends and rarely getting out of the house in order to keep up with the schedule and to do the best pages you can. Eventually, the book is announced and the headline reads “WRITER’S SCI-FI PROJECT.” Pages of your artwork illustrate the piece, but there’s no mention of who drew them. Now imagine the project is adapted into a film, video game, or TV show and is consistently credited as WRITER’S SCI-FI PROJECT with no mention of you or your work. This is a regular occurrence.\n\nEverywhere I look—from press releases announcing movie deals to reviews on comic sites—this issue rears its ugly head. It started driving me crazy. So like any brilliant hero of our age, I took the issue to the internet! I started cataloging examples whenever they’d arise with the hashtag #ArtCred on Twitter.\n\nThere are many explanations for this common phenomenon. Many comics reviewers lack the vocabulary to speak about art in a critical way, and instead bury the art in a single paragraph with rote commentary. The proliferation of double-shipping books at Marvel and DC, books that rotate art teams while keeping the writer consistent, train the reader to see the artist as secondary to the process. Even the generally higher output of a writer compared to an artist leads to higher visibility and better name recognition.\n\nThat’s not to say artists are blameless. We have an awful habit of devaluing ourselves. We undervalue our work and shy away from attention, even though we secretly crave it. But in this day and age, if you’re not seen to be doing the work, then you’re not considered to be part of the process.\n\nWhat can we do about this? To start, I would look to the work colorists have done in the past couple of years. They organized and became vocal. Colorists pushed for cover credits on DC and Marvel books, and were successful in their efforts. Like colorists, we need to talk openly about this and support each other’s efforts. Your favorite comics are built on the hard work of artists, and to not appropriately credit them devalues the work itself. Watchmen would not be the book it is without Dave Gibbons. The same can be said for Wes Craig’s work on DEADLY CLASS, or Fiona Staples’ work on SAGA. Artists are co-authors of the work, and for them to be seen as anything less damages the medium we love so much.\n\nAs creators of comics, the only currency we have is the quality of our work and our back catalog. We need to be careful about the projects we take. Strive to work on signature projects, works that are appreciated as the result of singular voices joining in a unique collaboration.\n\nCredit is important. It helps build our bodies of work, aids fans of your first book in checking out your next one, and gives you a solid foundation, regardless of the writer you work with. Getting credit means that if your work is adapted to other mediums, you are part of the process. Artists need to stand in front of the work and make sure we’re seen as co-authors. We need to lead by example.\n\nIf artists were considered creators on the same level as writers—no more, no less—then they would be able to build more solid and reliable careers. Artists would have the resources necessary to train the next generation and build properties from the stories and characters they co-created. Relegating artists to being small cogs in the machine of making comics is to deny to ourselves what is truly great about the medium.\n\nOne of the most important shifts in comics happened when the Image Comics founders told the big companies that they weren’t working for them anymore and created a fair deal for creators that has had a profound effect in our industry ever since. We should remember the power we have and what can be achieved if we work together.\n\nAfter all, drawing is creating too.\n\nDeclan Shalvey is the award-winning co-creator of the ongoing series INJECTION (written by Warren Ellis, colored by Jordie Bellaire, and lettered by Fonografiks) and the upcoming crime graphic novel SAVAGE TOWN with Philip Barrett, featuring colors by Bellaire and letters by Clayton Cowles.

It's not just to skewer the skin-baring cover illustration of Poul Anderson's Young Flandry (although that was certainly part of it). It's all part of Jim C. Hines' charity poses drive to support the Aicardi Syndrome Foundation.\n\nAicardi Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that causes a number of complications, including brain malformation, developmental delays, and seizures. Hines has friends whose children suffer from this condition, including a friend whose daughter recently passed away due to complications from Aicardi Syndrome. The Aicardi Syndrome Foundation funds research into treatment and helps parents of sufferers connect with researchers and with one another at an annual conference. Hines decided to launch a donation drive for the foundation in December, with different rewards for different goals. What, pray-tell, would those rewards be? Hines would duplicate the poses on various scifi, fantasy, and comic book covers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee, about a year ago, Hines posted a series of photographs of himself posed as the women on various book covers as a comment on the way women are frequently depicted in genre fiction. (To contrast the female poses, he also took a series of photos of himself duplicating male cover poses.) As part of this charity drive, he asked donors what covers they would like to see him duplicate. Among the winners were Catwoman Vol. 1, the Esther Friesner-edited Fangs for the Mammaries, and Pip Ballentine and Tee Morris' Phoenix Rising. Occasionally John Scalzi would get in on the fun, challenging Hines to a pose-off. And man, can Scalzi pose.\n\nIf he raised more than $5,000, Hines vowed to gather John Scalzi, Pat Rothfuss, Charles Stross, and Mary Robinette Kowal at ConFusion to duplicate the cover of Young Flandry, and this weekend he made good on that vow. In total, Hines raised $15,405 for the Aicardi Syndrome Foundation, and he's looking to make a 2014 pose calendar. Of course, even if you missed the donation drive, you can still donate to the foundation.\n\nIt's nice to see authors poking a bit of fun at sexist cover conventions while raising money for a good cause.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGroup Cover Pose Reveal!

  "latent_5372": "CNET\n\nBoth the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One will be here in a matter of days -- November 15 for the PS4 and a week later for the Xbox.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you should rush out and buy one.\n\nEven if you're excited about the next wave of console games, signs are pointing in flashing red neon to wait. You could -- and probably should -- wait until next year to enjoy the fruits that these consoles will hopefully bring.\n\nI'm not saying that I don't feel somewhat excited about the potential for new gaming consoles. I just know, based on what I've been seeing, that the future won't be arriving in 2013. The future path for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 is a long one, and one that still has more questions than answers.\n\nBottom line: you're probably better off waiting. Here's why.\n\nThe year's best games won't be available on the new consoles.\n\nBioShock Infinite. Grand Theft Auto V. The Last of Us. None of these will be available -- or announced -- for the Xbox One or PS4, at least not yet. And while many of this fall's top games -- Call of Duty: Ghosts, Battlefield 4, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, Madden 25, both NBA games -- will be released on next-gen hardware, you'll still get a really good version of all of these games on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.\n\nThe PS4 and Xbox One aren't backward-compatible, either.\n\nI'm sure you already know, but the PS4 and Xbox One can't play PS3 and Xbox 360 games right now, and they can't even load up previous online-purchased downloaded games via PSN or Xbox Live Arcade. So, if you want to enjoy one of the games like Grand Theft Auto V (or any other game in your current collection), you've got to keep your other game console plugged in, too.\n\nNone of the exclusive next-gen launch games has that 'must-have' buzz.\n\nWhat do you want to see on a brand-new game system with new graphics? Odds are, it won't be here this year. All of the most promising games -- Watch Dogs, Titanfall, Infamous: Second Son, Destiny -- have slipped to 2014, leaving a very mixed bag for both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 -- unless you're looking for a handful of games already coming out for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but with a bit of extra graphics polish. Sports games might benefit most, but it'll be hard to get excited about \"must-have\" killer PS4 and Xbox One games.\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nSeveral online streaming services and features won't be available at launch.\n\nRemember Gaikai, Sony's game-streaming technology for the PlayStation 4? It won't be here this year. Microsoft's own TV and living-room-dominating strategy is also shaping up to be more of a slow-baked process, if you're waiting for all the pieces to fall in place.\n\nBoth the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 have an excellent assortment of apps and services, covering most major streaming-video packages, cable apps, and sports. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 will have their own collection of apps that will undoubtedly grow to be better than current-gen over time, and it looks like both consoles will cover most of the major bases, but they won't immediately have everything the last-gen consoles already do.\n\nThe Xbox One has an impressive set of starting apps, but they'll be unrolled between now and spring 2014. Sony's initial streaming apps look promising, but the much-hyped and more exciting game-streaming and sharing capabilities of Gaikai on the PS4 won't be around, according to Sony, until 2014.\n\nCNET\n\nFirst-wave hardware and software's always a mixed bag.\n\nSome software's bound to be buggy. Expect at least six months of troubleshooting, where you, the early adopter, will be the test subject. That's what buying early tech does to a person.\n\nYour friends won't be playing online on these new consoles yet.\n\nSocial gaming and online gaming is useful when everyone is online together. Your friends won't be next-gen this fall -- or at least, not all of them. That may not matter if you can find some cross-compatible games, but it's still more of a challenge.\n\nWe don't know which one is better.\n\nHey, guess what? We haven't reviewed either console yet. Who knows what the PS4 and Xbox One will really be like? Maybe one will be miles ahead of the other. Maybe it'll be too close to call. Over the next six months, however, a better picture will emerge. You'll know which console has the games you like, and which one is working better for what you need. With two consoles so close to each other in spirit, it makes sense -- unless you're dead set on PlayStation or Xbox as a platform -- to wait and see how it all shakes out.\n\nThey'll still be here next year, and they'll be an even better value.\n\nBy mid-2014, you can expect the first big wave of PS4 and Xbox One games that really shine to start emerging, making these consoles a lot more palatable. At least, we hope so. But either way, these consoles aren't going anywhere. Wait six months, wait a year, and see what these systems produce in terms of games and apps, and make a decision then. You have lots of games to play until then, and there are few big premium games this year that you'll be missing out on for the Xbox One and PS4.\n\nThat's my plan, anyway.",
  "latent_5613": "Almost exactly a year ago the Director of Security for Google Apps, Eran Feigenbaum, was telling anyone who would listen that the geographical location of data in the cloud wasn't a priority issue and that people should focus their concerns on the privacy and security of that data instead. Feigenbaum even went as far in one online interview as to suggest that to do otherwise was an \"old way of thinking\" at the time.\n\nWell I'm sorry Eran, but you were wrong then and you are wrong now.\n\nIt's easy to dismiss fears about data sovereignty as being very last century, especially when you consider that everything moved around across the Internet is broken down into packets of data which are routed all over the planet in order to arrive at their destination. That is, after all, how the Internet works and it would be a massive fail if your data could only travel within the boundaries of your national borders.\n\nI have heard this 'how stuff works' argument used to support the case for borderless, universal storage within the cloud all too often. But that doesn't mean I think it is correct. Confusing the temporary movement of fragmented data with the permanent storage of the whole thing is quite ridiculous.\n\nIt's quite one thing to send a file from one desktop to another via the Internet without having to worry unduly about it being intercepted by The Powers That Be as it travels through their jurisdiction. It is quite another to store that file on a server located in a country where it could be legally, and relatively simply, seized by law enforcement agencies for myriad reasons. Yes, United States of America, I am talking about you here.\n\nAnd it's not just some paranoid privacy freak sitting here saying this, data protection legislators say it as well. While the truth of the matter is that for many folk the location of their data is, indeed, no biggie the same is not true of certain industry sectors nor of businesses of a certain size.\n\nThe bottom line being that any UK business holding data about third parties is legally responsible for that data under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998. If that data, in the cloud, is stored outside of the UK then your business remains responsible for it. This is not so easy to ensure when the physical location of the data will be critical in determining who actually has control over it, and who has the right to access it.\n\nOf course, data sovereignty is nothing new and has been an issue since the first cheap offshore data centres hit the scene many, many years ago. The thing is, that in the rush to jump on the cloud bandwagon the wheels seem to have fallen off the sovereignty argument for many organisations. Which is both weird and worrying when you consider how popular the cloud storage model has become in such a short time, and how bullish governments have become with regards to accessing all data under the guise of terrorism detection.\n\nJurisdictional issues cannot be ignored, no matter how complex they become. This has not been lost on the UK government which understands that personal information held by the public sector must be hosted within national borders, and as it moves towards increased use of cloud services then so the drive in demand for in-country hosting amongst private sector companies could follow.\n\nThe argument being, and this one I agree with, that developers of such storage facilities will want to ensure that in-country hosting can be guaranteed in order to prevent losing business, or at least prevent certain types of data storage from being a no-go area. Already some of the biggest cloud providers are finding that they are excluded from bidding for services within the public sector as they don't have any data centres in the UK.\n\nAs services such as the HM Government CloudStore get established, and noticed, so the potential for private sector adoption of a UK-orientated cloud will emerge. Location has always been important, it remains important in the cloud and before long British business will start to have a real choice when it comes to determining the sovereignty of their cloud-based data stores.",
  "latent_5697": "Anti-war soldiers headed a protest against the NATO summit in Chicago on May 20. Thousands poured through the streets in the largest anti-war demonstration seen in the United States for some time.\n\nThe turnout was inspired by the Occupy movement that broke out last year, which helped legitimise street protest again.\n\nFrom conflicting accounts, the march involved about 10,000 people.\n\nSee also:\n\nSYRIZA to anti-NATO protesters: 'Bring the war home!'\n\nA contingent of soldiers organised by Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW) marched at the front. Most wore their combat fatigues, and some were in dress uniform.\n\nAs they marched, they chanted rhythmically in unison, military style, including the words: “No NATO, No war, we don’t work for you no more!”\n\nMarching with the veterans were Afghan women from Afghans for Peace.\n\nAt the end of the march, kept far away from the NATO meeting by a huge police mobilisation, the soldiers came forward one by one to give short, emotional speeches to an attentive crowd, explaining why they were there.\n\nSome confessed to taking part in war crimes against the Iraqi and Afghan people. Others denounced the lies they once believed about the wars — lies they came to understand on the ground.\n\nMany apologised to the Iraqi and Afghan people and asked for forgiveness.\n\nA few were suffering severe mental anguish from what they saw and did, only to be given no or inadequate treatment for their war-caused mental problems when they returned.\n\nAfter each speech, the veterans threw their medals, including one they had all received for taking part in the phony “war on terror”, into the street towards the NATO summit meeting.\n\nOne vet said he was representing deserters who can’t come back to the US — and threw the medals they had given him.\n\nAfter “retiring” an American flag they had carried through the streets, they gave the folded flag to a woman whose soldier son committed suicide upon coming back, an all-too-common tragic consequence of the wars.\n\nThen the veterans held a “reconciliation” ceremony with the Afghan women, who had carried an Afghan flag on the march. The women also spoke.\n\nOne, Suria Sahar, told the crowd: “All we have is this flag, but not our sovereign land.\n\n“I’d like to direct my message to the NATO representatives here in Chicago today. For what you’ve done to my home country, I’m enraged; for what you’ve done to my people, I’m disgusted; for what you’ve done to these veterans, I’m heartbroken.”\n\nSoldiers hurling their medals and ribbons back at the war makers recalled the time in 1971 when Vietnam War veterans did the same.\n\nAfter the main march dispersed, about 1000 protesters tried to move closer to the NATO meeting and were met with a vicious police attack.\n\nThe cops waded into the crowd, clubs swinging, injuring many. Teeth were broken and heads bashed.\n\nVideos from cell phones as well as television cameras recorded the police riot. The National Lawyers Guild, which had lawyers present to represent the protesters, said more than two dozen demonstrators had sustained serious injuries.\n\nThe cops tried to grab cell phones recording the melee, smashing some. But they couldn’t grab them all.\n\nThe protests were originally scheduled to greet not only the NATO summit, but also the meeting of the big imperialist countries in the G8, which was also to be held the week before the NATO meeting.\n\nThis would be more convenient for the G8 heads of state, who would attend both meetings.\n\nBut as it became clear that there were going to be big protests in Chicago, the G8 meeting was moved at the last moment to Camp David, in a secluded area in Maryland on the East Coast.\n\nPro-austerity German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her collaborators didn’t want footage of the G8 meeting to include big protests and police riots.\n\nBut there were many protests and meetings in the week leading up to the big march that zeroed in on aspects of the world capitalist crisis.\n\nOne of these was a march of 3000 organised by National Nurses United calling for a “Robin Hood” tax on Wall Street and opposition to the cutbacks in health care hitting workers and the most needy the hardest.\n\nThe police made many preemptive arrests in the weeks leading up to the big march, targeting people who looked like they were “out of towners”.\n\nThe National Lawyers Guild is defending about 100 people who were arrested, including on the march.\n\nThe most ominous arrests were of three people — Brian Church, 22, from Florida; Jared Chase, 27, from New Hampshire; and Brent Betterly, 24, from Massachusetts. The three were arrested earlier in the week, along with at least six others who were later released.\n\nThe three are charged under a local law with plotting to commit “terrorism”. The details remain obscure, but the National Lawyers Guild has taken on their case.\n\nThe announcement of the charges was made on May 19, the day before the big march. The purpose of the arrest couldn’t be clearer: to smear the protest with the charge of “terrorism”.\n\nThe use of the “war on terror” to attack those in the US who protest government policies has expanded beyond frame-ups of Muslim Americans to attacks on socialists.\n\nLast year, anti-war activists from Freedom Road Socialists were arrested by the FBI and charged under the Patriot Act with aiding terrorism because of their pro-Palestinian views. Their case is winding through the courts.\n\nNow the Chicago police are using the same tactics to smear anti-war and Occupy activists.\n\n[Barry Sheppard was a long-time leader of the US Socialist Workers Party and the Fourth International.

Screenshot/WWE via Yahoo\n\nEarlier this year, Yahoo News’ Michael Isikoff wrote about Donald Trump’s 1980s relationship with Robert LiButti, a frequent customer at Trump’s Atlantic City casinos who was later imprisoned and identified by New Jersey regulators as an “associate” of Mob boss John Gotti. The Trump Plaza casino was actually fined $200,000 for telling black employees to stay away from LiButti, who was apparently known for making belligerent racist and sexist remarks when he lost money. LiButti’s daughter says her father had a long-standing personal relationship with Trump, but Trump denied knowing him in 1991 and said this year he doesn’t remember him:\n\n“If he was standing here in front of me, I wouldn’t know what he looked like,” Trump told the Philadelphia Inquirer when he was first questioned by Johnston about LiButti, in 1991.\n\nEarlier this year, when questioned again about LiButti by Yahoo News, Trump emailed a reporter: “During the years, I very successfully ran the casino business, I knew many high rollers. I assume Mr. LiButti was one of them, but I don’t recognize the name.”\n\nThe idea that Trump wouldn’t have recognized LiButti in 1991 and simply can’t remember him now was never particularly plausible given the testimony of LiButti’s daughter, a 1991 book written by a Trump casino manager that describes Trump and LiButti agreeing on the sale of a race horse, and a 1990 state police wiretap in which LiButti mentions a conversation he had with Trump aboard a helicopter. (LiButti died in 2014.) But it’s now even less plausible, since Isikoff has uncovered video of LiButti attending a WrestleMania event in Atlantic City in 1988 with Trump and his then-wife Ivana:\n\nIn the video, LiButti can be seen alongside Trump as the real estate mogul greets the ring announcer, sportscaster Bob Uecker, and later as Trump kisses on the cheek special guest Vanna White. LiButti can also be seen sitting during the match in a front-row seat alongside Trump and his then wife, Ivana.\n\nTrump’s spokeswoman, in response, seemed to imply that it’s somehow a coincidence that Trump and his wife were seated at an Atlantic City event next to a Trump casino client who other individuals have said was personally close to Trump at the time:\n\nThis was obviously a massive event, which took place decades ago. Mr. Trump attended many similar events with thousands of people during this time period.\n\nLiButti is only one of the many individuals with personal histories of criminal activity and fraud with whom Trump has been closely associated over the years:\n\nMaybe they can all have a reunion in the White House.",
  "latent_6078": "The concept of sanctuary cities is deeply embedded in Western tradition. In biblical times, shelter was offered even to those who might have qualified as “bad hombres” in the eyes of President Trump. Killers, for example. If the crime lacked intent, they could flee to havens specifically designated in Deuteronomy and the Book of Joshua.\n\nSkip ahead 3,500 years or so and societally sanctioned refuge is proving as powerful a concern for Americans today as it was for the ancients. Sanctuary cities — and counties and states — loom large as Mr. Trump seeks to vastly expand and speed the deportation of undocumented immigrants while threatening to withhold federal money from localities that refuse to cooperate with immigration officials.\n\nTo switch the biblical reference point to Ecclesiastes, there is no new thing under the sun, certainly not in regard to sanctuary. Retro Report, video documentaries examining major news stories of the past and their continued relevance, begins a new series by recalling the so-called sanctuary movement of the 1980s, which put church and state in conflict with each other over the fate of Central Americans fleeing civil wars and pleading for asylum in the United States. Those refugees found President Ronald Reagan’s White House no more eager to open its arms than the Trump administration is now to embrace Syrians seeking shelter from carnage back home.\n\nThe Reagan administration supported military governments in El Salvador and Guatemala, viewing them as bulwarks against pro-Communist insurgencies. And so it played down widespread human rights outrages by those regimes and affiliated death squads. When Salvadorans and Guatemalans tried to enter the United States, claiming a fear of persecution in their homelands, they typically were labeled “economic migrants,” not political refugees.",
  "latent_6112": "Hey craft brewer, need a reason to punch a wall? I’m sure you don’t—small business owners have plenty of frustrations on a day-to-day basis. But just in case you do, consider searching “kegs” on Craigslist, restaurant auction sites, or similar by-owner marketplaces. Chances are the query will reveal one or two of your kegs, in good condition for sale from a private seller. That is the best-case scenario. You might also find that your once “good condition” cooperage has been transformed into some amateur artist/BBQ master’s custom keg smoker or bird bath. Yep, I repeat: having to consider buying your own property back from someone, in good condition, is the best-case scenario.\n\nKeg loss is as big of an issue in our community as it was back when I wrote about it for CraftBeer.com in Kegs: You’re Renting, Not Buying. In responding to comments at the bottom of the post, it became apparent that the idea of a keg deposit is probably the least understood process for consumers in regards to beer. Many simply cannot comprehend that a keg deposit is a good faith promissory note that they will return the shiny outer shell of a beer purchase. Instead, many seem to believe that they have the option to either get their 50 bucks back or to turn that shell into lawn furniture. You and I know that is not how it’s supposed to work.\n\nWhile it is baffling that consumers misunderstand this simple process highlighting the wonders of trust and good faith, misguided homebrewers or anybody with a dremel aren’t the only ones to think that cooperage grows on trees. Restaurants and bars can also be offenders when it comes to keg misuse. Take this email I received from a member brewer asking me to revisit the issue:\n\n“Here at [123 Brewery] we’ve seen our kegs turned into lighting fixtures, coffee tables, bar stools, and most recently (today) we saved one that was being converted into a urinal. It was a brand new keg with less than one turn in the market. I had to stop myself from doing the blog post myself because I didn’t want to embarrass one of our top accounts…”\n\nThere is really no excuse for beer lovers or bar and restaurant owners to keep and mutilate kegs. A retail establishment that places a unit price on anything they can has an understanding of who owns that keg and how much it actually costs. The bottom line is, whether you’re an account or a consumer, that keg you cut up amounts to stealing—plain and simple.\n\nThe Brewers Association is aware of how big and complicated the issue of keg loss is and in previous years has worked with members of the beer community to find ways to reunite brewers with their kegs. It is estimated that keg loss costs each brewery between $.46 and $1.37 per barrel of beer they produce. At that rate, keg loss cost craft brewers in the United States upwards of over $33 million in 2015. The keg repatriation site KegReturn.com was set up to help see that lost kegs have a channel to be returned to their owners. In 2015, the Brewers Association called upon eBay to stop facilitating the sale of stolen brewers’ property, and this year joined forces with MicroStar, which estimates it receives 5,000 kegs that are not part of its leased keg network, to help reunite kegs with their owners.\n\nAll of this is for naught when a restaurant, bar, or otherwise ally of craft brewers decides that what their establishment really needs is a dozen chopped-up kegs for their restroom renovation. Just like the moral in my CraftBeer.com post, this is a basic, Golden Rule type of a situation where we all know that people are mostly good, but sometimes make bad decisions. My hope is that this article circulates as a reminder to the industry to do what is right, to educate others on this issue, and to get this to stop.\n\nNeed a refresher on how you fit into the equation?

He’s a KGB officer. That’s what they do. They recruit assets, and I think some of that experience and instincts of Putin is coming to play here in his managing a pretty important account for him, if I could use that term, with our president.”\n\nClapper has been highly critical of Trump, calling a campaign-style rally the president held in Phoenix over the summer “scary and disturbing.”\n\n“I worry about, frankly, the access to nuclear codes,” he said in August. “In a fit of pique, if he decides to do something about Kim Jong Un, there’s actually very little to stop him.”\n\nClapper had previously served under President George W. Bush as undersecretary of defense for intelligence.\n\nObama appointed him as director of national intelligence, a Cabinet-level position, in 2010 over the objection of some lawmakers who wanted a civilian in the role. At the time, Obama praised Clapper’s “willingness to tell leaders what we need to know even if it’s not what we want to hear.”",
  "latent_6352": "MEMPHIS – With the new fiscal year beginning in July, the city of Memphis is scrambling to put together a new budget. As part of his budget proposal, Mayor A. C. Wharton wants to close seven public libraries. If the mayor’s budget is approved, it will reduce Memphians’ library access by nearly 25 percent.\n\nAccording to City Councilman Lee Harris, “Initial budget proposals suggest closing seven libraries. Five have been named.” The libraries slated for closure are the downtown Cossitt Library, Poplar-White Stations, Levi, Gaston, and Highland branches.\n\nOn a recent visit, 5 minutes after opening, the Levi branch in southwest Memphis was clearly busy. Each of the branch’s 10 computers was in use and half a dozen visitors perused the stacks or read quietly. The Levi branch offers a Preschool Storytime and a Gang Awareness Program, and boasts an extensive African-American fiction collection.\n\nMichael Gray walked up the sidewalk towards the library with a laptop bag slung over his shoulder. Michael “lives right around the corner” and was able to walk to the library. If the Levi library were closed he is “not sure where else he could go for free Internet.” Michael defies the stereotype that young men only use the Internet for entertainment. He was here this morning, his first visit to the library, to try to find affordable housing.\n\nThe Gaston branch in south Memphis is larger and better equipped than Levi. To the right of the entrance a community information board is thick with fliers and posters offering everything from a “Get Energy Smart” workshop to on-site voter registration. Like the Levi branch, Gaston is a hive of activity as school-age children type busily on the computers or sit in clusters reading.\n\nSharing the building with a Head Start pre-school for low-income families, it is clear that the Gaston branch is a vital resource for its community.\n\nAfter a morning spent studying African-American historiography and philosophy in preparation for a course he will take at Princeton this fall, Ernest Davis shared his thoughts on the proposed closure of Memphis area libraries. Davis, the first African-American dean at the University of Memphis, said “there is a need” for the Gaston branch. The retired dean put it succinctly: “Everybody does not have a computer or access to books and that is part of the problem: they need this.”\n\nDowntown at the Cossitt Library, Assistant Librarian Merlynn Clemons took time out of her busy day to talk about the Cossitt Library’s rich history and vital role in the downtown community. Clemons said the Cossitt branch has “visitors from around the world.” Many are tourists who come to the library to check their email and communicate with their friends and family while abroad. If Cossitt were closed, she said, “people would have to go to Gaston or Benjamin Hooks [three to five miles away] for free computer access.”\n\nIn the five years she has worked at Cossitt, Clemons has seen a steady increase in traffic. According to her, “on average there are 50 people in the library” at all times from open to close. In no small part, she attributes the rise in traffic at her branch to the growing trend of “the population moving downtown.”\n\nClemons observed that many of the people who use the Cossitt branch, “walk here on their way to work.” She believes that closing the downtown branch “would create a void” in the downtown community and in the lives of her patrons. “People would not have anywhere to go.”\n\nClemons says public libraries are vital for the future of Memphis. “One of the main purposes we serve is for schoolchildren to do their homework,” she said. Many students enrolled in Memphis City Schools live below the poverty line. “If you close the libraries,” she wonders, “what do poor kids do?”\n\nFounded in 1888, the Cossitt Branch Library was “the first public library in the city of Memphis” and has been the scene of many historic events, Clemons noted.\n\nIn the 1920s Richard Wright, author of “Native Son” and “Black Boy,” and Harlem editor of the Daily Worker, wanted to read books that were only available at the Cossitt Library but he “wasn’t allowed to enter because of segregation laws,” according to a library fact sheet. So Wright “forged a note from his white employer so he could access his desired books.”\n\nClemons paused in a huge room with floor-to-ceiling windows that has been badly damaged by water. “Most people don’t even know this exists,” she said.\n\nPhoto by Emmaline Raines.",
  "latent_6416": "The plan to buy commercial paper was formulated amid cascading losses in global stock markets, as the banking crisis spread across Europe and investors feared dire consequences for the world economy. The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 800 points before a late recovery, finishing down 369.88, below 10,000 points for the first time since 2004.\n\nEven before bankers on Wall Street reached their desks on Monday, European stocks were plunging. The Russian stock market dropped 19.1 percent, the biggest decline since the fall of the Soviet Union. Major indexes in London and Frankfurt lost more than 7 percent; stocks in Paris fell by 9 percent. Stocks in Latin America and other emerging economies took their worst collective tumble in a decade.\n\nVolatility reached the highest level in two decades, and oil prices fell below $90 for the first time since February.\n\nThe contagion moved to Asian with the Nikkei index of Japanese stocks closing down 3 percent and the Hang Seng index of stocks in Hong Kong fell 4.9 percent. But shares rebounded Tuesday morning in Europe, with the FTSE up 1.2 percent in London, the CAC 40 was up 1.7 percent in Paris, and the DAX in Frankfurt was slightly higher.\n\nInvestors around the world are worried about what the evaporation of credit will do to an already-weakened global economy.\n\n“There is a growing recognition that not only has the credit crunch refused to be contained, it continues to spread,” said Ed Yardeni, an investment strategist. “It’s gone truly global.”\n\nIn the United States, consumers appear to be significantly curbing spending; last month, employers cut more jobs than any month in five years. The $6 decline in oil prices, which settled at $87.81 a barrel, stemmed in part from fears that demand will slacken in the face of a deteriorating economy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Fed plan is intended to renew the flow of credit on which the economy depends. Under its plan, the central bank would buy unsecured commercial paper, essentially short-term i.o.u.’s issued by banks, businesses and municipalities.\n\nThe market for that kind of debt has all but shut down in the last week, with many major corporations unable to borrow for longer than a day at a time, as banks become more fearful of giving out cash. The volume of such debt totaled about $1.6 trillion as of Oct. 1, down 11 percent from three weeks earlier.\n\nThese credit fears persisted over the weekend despite the $700 billion bailout package that Congress approved last week.\n\nThe cost of borrowing from banks and corporations remained high on Monday, increased in part by a series of high-profile bank bailouts in Europe, where governments scrambled to save several major lenders from collapse.\n\nThe United States government appears to be pressing ahead with other radical efforts to shore up the financial system, even wading into corners of the markets where it has rarely interfered.\n\nBuying commercial paper could open the Fed to difficult conflicts of interest, because it would be juggling the goals of protecting its investment portfolio with its traditional goals of promoting stable prices and low unemployment.\n\nPhoto\n\n“The Federal Reserve really would become the buyer of last resort, trying to jump-start the commercial paper market by taking on credit risk,” said Vincent Reinhart, a former top Fed official who worked under Alan Greenspan, a former Fed chairman, and Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman now.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has already stretched its resources to the limit by providing hundreds of billions of dollars in short-term loans to banks, Wall Street firms and money market funds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Monday, the Fed announced that it would once again redouble one of its key emergency lending programs, increasing the size of its Term Auction Facility to $600 billion, from $300 billion. On top of that, the central bank plans to provide an additional $300 billion to banks to meet their end-of-the-year cash needs.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Aside from Monday’s auction, auctions for 28-day and 84-day loans are planned Oct. 20, Nov. 3, Nov. 17, Dec. 1, Dec. 15 and Dec. 29. Auctions for the shorter loans will be Nov. 10 and Nov. 24.\n\nTo pay for its burgeoning responsibilities, the Fed has no choice but to keep printing more money. To prevent that flood of new money from reducing the central bank’s overnight interest rate to zero, the Fed also announced on Monday that it would start paying interest on the excess reserves that banks keep on deposit at the Fed.\n\nPaying interest on reserves allows the central bank to set a floor on interest rates and retain at least some control over monetary policy.\n\nIn its announcement on Monday, the Fed said it would pay an interest rate of 1.25 percent —three-quarters of a point below its target of 2 percent for the overnight Federal funds rate.\n\nBut the possibility of propping up the vast market for commercial paper could represent an undertaking even broader than the Treasury Department’s plan to buy as much as $700 billion in mortgage-backed securities.\n\nIn statements on Monday morning, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury said they were “consulting with market participants on ways to provide additional support for term unsecured funding markets.”\n\nBy referring to “unsecured funding markets,” policy makers signaled that they wanted to intervene directly in the credit markets. Officials said on Monday evening that they wanted to finish a plan as quickly as possible, perhaps as early as Tuesday.\n\nBut the effort is fraught with legal complexities. Though the Federal Reserve has sweeping power to create money and lend it out, experts said it was normally prohibited from buying assets that could lose money.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne way around that legal limitation would be to provide money to a separate legal entity that would do the buying and investing on the Fed’s behalf. That would be similar to Maiden Lane Funding L.L.C., a special-purpose entity that officials created last spring to hold $29 billion in hard-to-sell securities from Bear Stearns.\n\nBut so far, the myriad efforts by government regulators to shore up confidence have seemed to yield little relief among investors, some of whom believed the actions have taken on a haphazard air.\n\n“People are slowly but surely coming to the realization that playing ‘Whack-a-Mole’ with each of these issues as they arise, on an ad hoc basis, doesn’t get the job done,” said Max Bublitz, chief strategist at SCM Advisors, an investment firm in San Francisco.\n\nOn Wall Street, Monday was a frightening day for investors — the type of day where a 369-point deficit in the Dow is considered a relief.\n\nA broad sell-off began at the opening bell and intensified throughout the morning. After 2 p.m., the Dow was down a hair over 800 points, worse than the 777-point drop one week earlier.\n\nBut around 2:30, investors began to hunt for bargains, sending the Dow briefly back above the 10,000 mark, before finishing the day at 9,955.50. The broader stock market closed down 3.9 percent, as measured by the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. Shares of financial firms, manufacturing outfits and industrial companies all fell sharply. The Dow has lost 1,187 points, about 10.7 percent, and the S. & P. almost 13 percent in a week.\n\nThe sharp slide on Monday came despite assurances from President Bush that it would “take a while to restore confidence to the financial system.”\n\n“We don’t want to rush into this situation and have the program not be effective.”\n\nFollowing are the results of Monday’s Treasury auction of 72-day cash management bills and three-month and six-month bills.",

  "latent_6552": "The United States and Canada have plenty of reasons to be afraid of the (oil rich) Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, so they are doing their utmost to address their perceived problem.\n\nThe US, in particular, fears that Venezuela's social democracy will set a dangerous precedent, and that, if allowed, other countries will follow suit. They also fear the status quo, wherein they are denied control over Venezuela's oil reserves (the world's largest).\n\nThe Bolivarian revolution itself, initiated by late president Hugo Chavez in 1998 and continuing with president Nicolas Maduro, is emblematic of the US' s \"problem\", even as the legitimacy of the revolution is beyond dispute:\n\nChavez, who died of cancer on Tuesday, March 5, 2013, won 18 of 19 contested elections in a country whose electoral system was described by former US president Jimmy Carter as \"the best in the world\".\n\nAn icon of the Bolivarian revolution, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans mourned the loss of their leader at his funeral.\n\nThough Maduro, Chavez's successor, isn't as popular, he still managed to win two national elections within the last year, including 76 per cent of mayoralties two months ago.\n\nCorporate media, a core agency of western propaganda, has demonized Chavez for years, and continues to ignore or minimize the matrix of converging impulses that make the Bolivarian revolution an on-going success, so a list of the revolution's stellar accomplishments will surprise many people who live in North America.\n\nSome of the Bolivarian Revolution's accomplishments are listed below:\n\n-Between 1998 and 2011, the poverty rate dropped from 49% to 27.4%\n\n-Venezuela's extreme poverty rate dropped from 11.4% to 6.9% in ten years\n\n-Venezuela reduced its extreme poverty rate from 6.3% to 5.5% in 2013 alone\n\n-Venezuela now boasts the lowest Gini coefficient in Latin America (a measure of income inequality, lower numbers mean less inequality)\n\n-Venezuelans have access to free and universal healthcare\n\n-Access to quality education (at all levels) is guaranteed for all\n\n-Food is deemed affordable\n\nFrom 2006 to 2011, Venezuela moved up 7 spots in the United Nations' Human Development Index , to 73 out of 187 countries\n\nUnfortunately though, the U.S. is notoriously persistent, and quite expert in the arts and sciences of illegal regime change. Consequently, they are engaging in destructive, anti-democratic efforts to unseat the Maduro government, by employing \"soft coup\" strategies --- for the benefit of the U.S, and the Venezuelan \"elites\".\n\nThe CIA, in partnership with local elites/oligarchs, is orchestrating the coup, as they most recently did in Honduras, and as they have done for decades throughout the world.\n\nThe objective of coups is to create destabilization in the target country which creates popular discontent, a precursor to illegal regime change. Tactics employed include these:\n\n-Economic destabilization\n\n-Media manipulation\n\n-Violent protests\n\nEconomic destabilization occurs when foodstuffs are hoarded, burned, or sent out of the country, as is currently happening. It also occurs when capital leaves the country (i.e the wealthy move their monies to other countries), when prices are falsely inflated, and when the power grid is disrupted.\n\nMedia is manipulated when peaceful protestors are depicted as being violent (through the use of misleading videos or doctored photos), when the number of opposition protestors is mischaracterized as being larger than it is, or in a myriad of other ways in which media messaging communicates false perceptions, as it does everywhere.\n\nOpposition protests are always violent (in keeping with the coup formula), they have starting and ending times, and they occur in the wealthier areas, (because they do not have the support of the less affluent). Likewise, opposition protestors, sometimes armed, barricade streets, and occupy public spaces.\n\nAll of the destabilization tactics are designed to convey the impression that the government is incompetent, and that it needs to be changed. Ultimately, though, widespread support is needed, and in this respect, the opposition -- though well-funded by the U.S. -- has so far failed.\n\nIf the coup does succeed, it will be another victory for graft and corruption over democracy and the rule of law.\n\nMark Taliano attended a conference organized by Raul Burbano of Common Frontiers.\n\nSpeakers included Pablo Vivanco from the Hugo Chavez peoples' defense front, Maria Victor Paez from the Circulo Bolivariano, Louis Riel and Beatrice Santiago from the Latin American and Caribbean solidarity network and Camilo Cahis from HOW campaign.

  "latent_6698": "Every year, I renew my vows with the U.S. Open Cup.\n\nIt’s my favorite competition in U.S. Soccer, partly because it’s such a survivor. Every generation of top-flight American soccer seems to throw up some new suicidal tendency in the name of progress, but throughout it all, the U.S. Open Cup has chugged along with a cockroach’s instinct for surviving corporate paternalism, immigrant ghettos, the rampant free market, wartime and just plain old indifference.\n\nI’m writing just before the final of this year’s competition, on the way to Kansas City to see the hosts play New York Red Bulls. I’m thinking about some of the cities I’ve encountered on previous Open Cup trips: Frisco, Chester, Richmond, Brooklyn, Sandy, Boston. Territories that intersect with the current MLS superstructure of U.S. club soccer, but don’t wholly overlap. Cities where I’ve watched teams like Brooklyn Italians, Icon FC, Richmond Kickers, Jersey Express and New York Pancyprian Freedoms try to punch above their weight, or at the very least remind the only option for top-flight soccer in the U.S. that “We are here.”\n\nAnd that’s the appeal of the Cup, for me. Just for what it is and how it has persisted on the map, it can’t be denied.\n\nPick a side Is winning U.S. Open Cup more important to Sporting or New York?\n\nIn recent years, the rumblings beneath MLS have become more pronounced, as NASL and USL have jockeyed for position and as the calls for pro/rel have moved from tin hat Twitter agitation to at least something like a coherent critique of MLS’ too frictionless relationship with U.S. Soccer.\n\nIn the conversation around that, any one faction likes to play the role of hero: MLS advocates persisting with the line that the closed league is the only sustainable solution for the U.S. sporting context; NASL advocates arguing the dubious line about the free market as panacea for everything; USL advocates arguing that the developmental benefits of MLS B teams outweigh the suspicion the league is bulking up on water weight.\n\nThey are all positions that have some virtue. None are wholly coherent, and none can truly lay claim to that much-abused term: authentic. But the Open Cup, for all its compromises, format tinkering, crappy coverage and apparent brittleness, is the single most authentic, coherent structure in this manufactured landscape.\n\nEmbedded video for Why the Open Cup is the most authentic referendum on U.S. soccer\n\nAny faction claiming to be the conscience of the sport in the U.S. is suspect, especially the ones that shout the loudest. But the Cup is the conscience of the sport without announcing itself as such. It carries all the trace elements of the history of the game in this country, acts as an annual litmus test for where the current tiers of the game are, and manages to be somehow platform-agnostic in the process. It’s been won by MLS teams for every year of the league’s existence — other than a memorable win by Rochester Rhinos in 1999 — yet it’s made a habit of keeping those teams honest. This year, Cincinnati was the latest lower division team to knock off multiple MLS teams en route to the semifinals.\n\nIt would ultimately fall short, after leading the Red Bulls 2-0 in front of over 30,000 fans. But Cincinnati had made its point about broader sporting and audience viability, as other teams had before it. One of the beauties of the Open Cup is that it can accommodate those sort of claims without being dominated by them. The New York Cosmos, for example, could reappear for their second incarnation and embarrass some local neighbors in the competition for a couple of years, yet when they started to describe the Open Cup as a vehicle to Champions League, the competition had a way of refusing to be co-opted.\n\nIt means that Eric Wynalda could play the gadfly with Cal FC and deliver a hefty dose of schadenfreude for those skeptical of the current technical development structure in this country without quite making a mockery of the competition. The Open Cup has room for dissent, insurgency, shocks and anomalies, yet somehow, when you look back on the bracket each year, the collection of results always seem to cohere to where we are, if not where we should be.\n\nAnd don’t think it means nothing to the MLS teams who get to the final, even if, historically, the early rounds have been treated with a kind of affected indifference. An Open Cup campaign can revive the most moribund campaign — just ask Ben Olsen, whose historically inept 2013 D.C. United team somehow contrived to win the competition.\n\nOr ask Peter Vermes the significance of the competition. When his Sporting KC team ended Seattle’s run of Open Cups in 2012, it won its first trophy under Vermes, and would follow it with the following season’s MLS Cup. And after serial losses to Houston in playoff scenarios, Vermes would credit the Open Cup win as granting the self-belief needed to get his side past the Dynamo. This Wednesday represents a chance to win the trophy for the third time in the last six years.\n\nJesse Marsch, the Red Bulls coach, will note the Open Cup’s catalytic effect on Sporting’s recent history with interest. He may have won a Supporters Shield with the Red Bulls in 2015, but like every Red Bulls coach before him, he has not cracked the code for knockout soccer. The Red Bulls have been in indifferent form in recent weeks, but if they can recapture the spirit of that comeback win in Cincinnati, who knows where they could kick on to from here.\n\nWe’ll find out the latest winner soon, and add them to the list that includes Bethlehem Steel, Fall River Marksmen, Maccabi Los Angeles, Brookhattan and myriad others — a seam running through any meaningful story you could tell about the history of the game here.

Celebrities are lending their names to public awareness campaigns, and more than 40 states have banned the practice. A new study surveyed 1,000 drivers and found that 98% of those who text everyday and drive frequently say the practice is dangerous. Still, nearly 75% say they do it anyway.\n\n“There’s a huge discrepancy between attitude and behavior,” says David Greenfield, a University of Connecticut Medical School professor who led the study. “There’s that schism between what we believe and then what we do.”\n\nThe lure of text messages is actually a lot like the appeal of slot machines, Greenfield explains: both can be difficult compulsions to overcome for some people. The buzz of an incoming text message causes the release of dopamine in the brain, which generates excitement, Greenfield says. If the message turns out to be from someone appealing, even more dopamine is released.\n\nCurbing this compulsion could take years for the text-obsessed, and doing so might resemble efforts to stop drunk driving, Greenfield says.

Used for the first time in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, midi-chlorians were a genetic and biological component to a character's affinity with and ability to use the Force.

The high midi-chlorian count in Anakin Skywalker's bloodstream was said to indicate he was the \"chosen one.\"\n\nBut since, that \"dirty word\" has been mostly ignored. It got a bit of a mention in Revenge of the Sith and a cursory mention on Star Wars: The Clone Wars, the first animated series showrun by Dave Filoni, who is now exploring the Force in new ways on Star Wars Rebels.

That’s true, even in the days of midi-chlorians, which everybody is afraid to talk about, but I’m not,\" Filoni told Comicbook.com at a press roundtable. \"What that tells you is – when I was a kid, I believed that everybody probably had the Force, and they just didn’t believe – midi-chlorians actually prove that theory out. We all have them, just to differing degrees. “For a long time I’ve used someone like Bruce Lee as an example. He has, if you like, a lot of talent for martial arts – or a very high midi-chlorian count. If I train in martial arts, can I learn martial arts? Yes, I can improve my midi-chlorian count in that discipline. Will I be as good as Bruce Lee? No, that’s not my talent. We were always able to find real-world equivalencies to Star Wars to make comparisons that make it feel like it’s a real thing. When I talk about Force sensing, I talk about when you are standing somewhere and you don’t know but you feel someone standing behind you. It’s all extensions of those things on a much broader level. The Jedi and Sith have one way of interpreting that.\"",
  "latent_6973": "Marc Serota/Getty Images\n\nIn a monumental offseason that saw NBA mammoths LeBron James, Chris Bosh and Amar'e Stoudemire all change uniforms, no team can be confident that their superstar will stay with them long-term.\n\nAnd with Carmelo Anthony all but guaranteed a divorce with the Denver Nuggets, there aren't many superstars outside of Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, Dirk Nowitzki, Paul Pierce and Tim Duncan that have stayed with their teams for the entirety of their careers.\n\nWith that being said, Orlando Magic superstar center Dwight Howard can opt out of his contract after next season and be a part of the summer 2012 free-agent class. And after the Miami Heat's league-shifting moves, Orlando's goal of winning a championship is quickly evaporating as the league is becoming more and more competitive.\n\nThe Magic have made it to the Eastern Conference Finals two consecutive years, however, their road to return will be much tougher than previous years. The Heat's additions of James and Bosh have almost guaranteed they will be in title contention for the next six years. The Chicago Bulls greatly improved over the offseason and have a large window with the core of their lineup being young, and the Atlanta Hawks are always a threat with their solid core.\n\nAnd those are all teams that can be very competitive for years to come. That's not even mentioning the veteran Boston Celtics, who currently hold the East's best record and have been to the NBA Finals two times in the last three years. They will certainly be able to hold their own at least another year.\n\nSo that means, there are four teams who can all potentially be in the way of Orlando's road to win the franchise's first NBA championship.\n\nAnd Dwight Howard knows this. So that begs the question, could Superman be the Carmelo Anthony saga all over again?\n\nAfter the Magic were defeated by the Lakers two years ago in the NBA Finals, they made a major move in acquiring Vince Carter, hoping he would be the piece that took them to the next level. However, the Magic were stopped short by the Celtics in last year's East Finals. And only 27 games into this season, Magic GM Otis Smith realized VC would not be enough either and saw it fit to shake up his team's core.\n\nOrlando got rid of Carter and brought in Gilbert Arenas, Jason Richardson and former Magic Hedo Turkoglu in order to better their title shot.\n\nHowever, the Magic currently sit in the fifth spot in the East and in third place in the Southeast Division, four-and-a-half games behind the Heat. They seem far off from the 2009 Magic team that went to the NBA Finals. That team was confident, effective and threatening. They had so many weapons to attack opposing teams with and looked to be the East's team of the future.\n\nNow, their window to win a trophy is quickly closing with the Eastern Conference vastly improving and the impending Dwight Howard free-agency situation.\n\nThe Magic's blockbuster deal earlier this season makes them a much stronger team and adds more weapons, but do they really have what it takes to beat Miami or Boston in a seven-game series?\n\nWhile that's for up for debate, Howard has to be thinking of the state of the Magic franchise and be wondering if they're going to have enough firepower to compete with the likes of Miami and Chicago in the East and Oklahoma City and LA in the West for the next three to five years.\n\nIf the Magic don't win a title this year or next year, Howard will be entering his 10th season without a championship ring on his finger. And considering he is a seven-footer, his knees will naturally start to deteriorate, which means his window for a ring is also shrinking.\n\nBeing that Dwight is a huge competitor and hungry for a title, it's easy to see that he might be following the same path of LBJ, Bosh and potentially Carmelo.\n\nThe 2012 season could easily turn into an exact replica of this season's drama but replace Carmelo Anthony with Dwight Howard. If the Magic don't have a title, Howard trade rumors will consume the headlines.\n\nThe fact is it's only a matter of time before Howard starts makes some serious statements about how the Magic will need to improve, how \"all he cares about is winning \" and little hints that he's not content with the direction of Orlando.\n\nAre Arenas, Richardson and Turkoglu really the answer? Can they really propel the Magic to championship heights and give them the talent to take down Boston, Miami and Chicago?\n\nIn Arenas's 23 games since being dealt to Orlando, he is averaging 8.7 points on 37 percent shooting, four assists and 0.9 steals in a reserve role. With his $17 million contract, those numbers don't quite match the production, and Arenas is only getting older. It appears he is not ever going to return to the All-Star he once was.\n\nJason Richardson is arguably the Magic's biggest acquisition. He can create his own offense, hit clutch shots and has shown just how effective he can be in the postseason (remember with Phoenix last year). His numbers have stayed relatively the same since the trade.\n\nThe return of Turkoglu has also been a significant addition for the Magic. He really helps spread the floor for Orlando and makes them a much better passing team. He can hit the three-ball and the forward just works so much more effectively in the Magic's system compared to his previous teams, Toronto and Phoenix.\n\nStill, with the addition of these three players, the Magic don't even have a top four spot in the East. While they are only a half of a game behind Atlanta for the four spot, they are going to have trouble catching Miami for the top spot in the Southeast. The Heat have seemed to figure out how to play regular season basketball and have the ability to go on long winning streaks, which will create separation from the rest of the division.\n\nThis all means that Orlando has very little room for error from now until Dwight's contract expires. The Magic are burying themselves deep into luxury tax and taking risky deals in hopes they can keep Howard.\n\nThe fact is the thought of Shaquille O'Neal leaving for the shiny lights of LA over a decade ago will forever be in the Orlando front office's memory, and they simply can't afford for something of that nature to happen again. It's an all too scary thought.\n\nHoward is so beloved in Orlando, and he literally erases the memory that the team made such a monumental mistake in loosing one of the most dominant centers of all time in Shaq. Losing Howard would be a loss of epic proportions- similar to Cleveland losing LeBron this past summer.\n\nThe Magic have already used their Plan B by making the trade for Arenas. So, if this doesn't work out, they really don't have much of a bail out.\n\nSo, the Magic are depending on this current roster to win a title within the next two years and make it impossible for Superman 2.0 to leave Orlando in the chase for a ring somewhere else.\n\nWhile everyone is focused on the whereabouts of Carmelo this year, it could be only a matter of time before the same conversation is surrounded by Howard and the Magic. The possibility of losing their fun-loving, charitable, fan-favorite and utterly dominant superstar center is becoming more than just a worry. It's becoming a reality.",

John McCain assure the FEC he did not act improperly by signing a loan agreement that could have forced him to remain in the race -- even if he had no chance of winning -- in order to be eligible for public matching funds to repay the loan. As Media Matters for America has noted, Mason has stated that McCain cannot opt out of public financing in the primary without FEC approval, as McCain has attempted to do, meaning that every day that McCain spends beyond the limits of the public financing system -- which he has already exceeded -- he could be breaking federal law. The Post did not mention that Bush withdrew Mason's renomination despite reporting: \"The six-member panel has been unable to consider action this election year because only two commissioners were left after three recess appointments expired in December. ...

Earlier this year, the Democratic National Committee filed a complaint with the FEC over McCain's loan and on Tuesday it sued in federal court to compel the FEC to investigate the matter.\n\nThe Post also failed to mention Mason's withdrawn renomination to the FEC in a May 17 article, as Media Matters noted at the time.\n\nThe June 25 Post article by reporter Matthew Mosk, in its entirety:",

The woman's vote, the Hispanic vote, media bias, a poor campaign message, Tea Party extremism, Romney too moderate, hurricane Sandy, New Jersey governor Christie, even voter suppression -- the list goes on and on.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhile all of these factors did come into play, the truth may be that the single most significant factor is what the Republican establishment did to one of its own candidates, Dr. Ron Paul, and his many ardent supporters.

For that, the GOP has no one to blame but itself and very few in either party or the media seem to want to mention the Ron Paul factor.\n\nIn the Republican primary, Ron Paul's delegates and supporters were systematically shut out of the process, yet Karl Rove has the nerve to say on Fox news that President Obama won by \"suppressing the vote.\" Take a closer look at your own party, Karl.\n\nRon Paul brought the youngest delegation in the history of the Republican Party to the convention (RNC) in Tampa in August.

  "latent_7331": "Kotaku East East is your slice of Asian internet culture, bringing you the latest talking points from Japan, Korea, China and beyond. Tune in every morning from 4am to 8am.\n\nLast generation's PSP was a bastion of great music games with titles like Lumines and Project Diva—in addition to re-releases of classics like PaRappa the Rapper and Gitaroo Man. However, one music series has been often overlooked, despite having some of the best music games around: DJMax. Why has it been snubbed? Probably because of the fact that, of the series' seven PSP titles, only two have been released in the West. But now, with the release of DJMax Technika Tune, the Korean-made series has the opportunity to capture the musical souls of Vita owners starved for more quality titles.\n\nGood — A Great Set List\n\nDJMax games have always had great track lists, and Technika Tune is no exception. The music ranges from K-Pop and Rap to Classical and Techno. Not only is the music good, but each of the game's 54 songs has its own FMV music video playing in the background.\n\nBut the real selling point of the game's music is that there are several songs performed by KARA, one of South Korea's most popular K-Pop girl bands. They are so popular here in Japan, that despite having zero interest in K-Pop, I was already familiar with nearly every song of theirs included in the game—well, the Japanese language versions anyway.\n\nGood — Tailor-Made for the Vita\n\nHaving played several of the past DJMax titles, I was reasonably sure I knew what to expect in Technika Tune: the same old gameplay I remembered with upgraded graphics and new songs. I couldn't have been more wrong on that first expectation. Instead of following the PSP game model which used the PSP's face buttons, it builds on the system from the latest DJMax arcades and uses the Vita's touch screens to great effect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe game plays a lot like Elite Beat Agents and involves your touching the screen in the right place at the right moment. Unlike the Nintendo DS, however, the Vita's touch screen allows for more than one touch at a time, dramatically changing up the gameplay. But better still, the game also utilizes the rear touch screen, stepping up the challenge even more when the game's harder modes involve using both screens at the same time.\n\nGood — Customize How You Play\n\nLuckily, if using both screens at once seems a bit intimidating (because it is), beginners will find the game more than a little understanding. On the easiest mode, the game uses only the front touch screen when playing. On the medium and hard difficulties, however, using the back screen becomes more and more common. However, if you just aren't able to get the hang of the back touch screen but still want to play the harder versions of each song, you can turn off the back screen in the options menu and still enjoy all that the game has to offer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMixed — A Crazy Learning Curve\n\nOn the easiest mode, experienced music game players will have little trouble playing through any song. However, the moment the back touch screen comes into play, even the most\n\nAdvertisement\n\nexperienced players will be left with previously unthought-of questions like \"How, exactly, do I hold this thing?\" Even after figuring out a way to be able to hit anywhere on front screen with two different fingers at the same time and still be able to tap the back screen, I had to devote hours to my technique before I was even moderately proficient at it. And I feel that it would take many more before I'd be ready for the hardest mode.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nDJMax Technika Tune is a fantastic music game and sits with Gravity Rush and LittleBigPlanet as one of the best titles on the Vita. It has a great sound track—especially if you love K-Pop—and it is one of the first games to use all of Vita's capabilities to great effect. If you have even a passing interest in music games, you should definitely keep an eye out for Technika Tune when it releases in the West later this month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDJMax Technika Tune was released on September 20, 2012, in Korea and September 27, 2012, in Japan for the PlayStation Vita. It will be released in North America on October 26, 2012.",

There is the innocuous pizza shop where dialing the right number in their phone booth lets you through a secret door into the pub. Or the various hole-in-the-wall places where you add your number to a wait list and hope for a call.\n\nAnd then this, the now-defunct bar inside an abandoned water tower in Chelsea, requiring one to following a winding path up through a deserted building to find a surprise at the top.\n\nPer the New York Times (images by Benjamin Norman), “The Night Heron was an invitation-only nightclub held illegally in a water tower atop a vacant building in Chelsea.” Guests had to make their way through a deserted building, then climb up a ladder to reach their destination.\n\nAll-nighters were common for this bustling little sweet spot, with last guests being let in as late as three in the morning. Live music reverberated within the wooden slats of the tightly-packed circular interior, with bottles of whisky reinforcing the retro (albeit a bit hipster) vibe of the whole affair. Alas, all good things must come to an end – particularly when they are a little less than legal in the first place.",

They’ve been ramming though the Tea Party agenda on everything from voting rights, and reproductive rights to economic policies - often with little or no debate. For example, their tax reform bill was introduced Monday, was passed by both houses and was on the Governor’s desk on Wednesday. Debate on this bill that reverses 80 years of tax policy in North Carolina got a whopping 25 minutes of debate before initial passage in NC’s Senate. Their first attempt to shut down most of North Carolina’s reproductive health facilities was passed by both houses in a Sharia law bill within 24 hours vetoed, passed again, this time in a bill regulating motorcycles and signed by the Governor within 8 days.\n\nIf nothing else, this contradicts the “government is bad” mantra Republicans trot out every time they obstruct laws in D.C. They seem rather fond of government and can pass laws very quickly when the introduced in the middle of the night, they don’t bother to let critics know about proposed laws until the last minute and limit debate on major laws.\n\nRepublicans insist that their policies provide corporations with an incentive to create jobs. Why are fewer people working in North Carolina? The number of employed people fell by 10,598 last month alone according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAccording to the stats, North Carolina’s labor force was comprised of 4,766,300 people in January. Last month, North Carolina’s labor force consisted of 4,709,300 people. During that time frame, Republicans proposed a constitutional amendment aside from the already existing right to work for less law. They passed the strictest restrictions on unemployment benefits in the country, provided corporations with financial incentives or bribes and reduced corporate taxes to create jobs in North Carolina.\n\nEarlier this week, the Republican controlled legislature introduced and passed a major restructuring of NC’s tax code in both Houses within 2 days, with virtually no debate on this major law.\n\nAll of these very Republican “pro-business” policies weren’t enough incentive for The House of Raeford which announced earlier this week that it would close its Hoke County plant at the end of this month increasing the number of unemployed North Carolinians by 950. It doesn’t look like corporations based in other parts of the country are looking for a space on North Carolina’s job creation dance card either.\n\nDespite policies that Republicans claim create jobs, North Carolina’s labor force keeps shrinking and the state has the fifth highest unemployment rate in the country. So what are we to make of ever shrinking labor force and stats that suggest a lower unemployment rate? The one thing that Republicans in North Carolina did accomplish is a lower unemployment rate this year than for the same time last year and an overall downward trend in the unemployment rate over the past several months.\n\nOf course, when combined with the fact that North Carolina’s labor force is shrinking, the reduced unemployment rate doesn’t mean there are fewer unemployed North Carolinians. It only means that North Carolina’s unemployed are giving up on finding work. That’s hardly an endorsement of the Republican theory on job creation. Not only do Republican policies in North Carolina mean people will work for less, there is also less work. So again, Republicans where are the jobs?\n\nImage Blue NC",

  "latent_7856": "Russia’s President Vladimir Putin (center) speaks with chief rabbi of Russia Berl Lazar (left) and head of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia Alexander Boroda (right) in Moscow on April 14, 2014. Photo by Alexei Nikolsky/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMoscow’s Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center is an impressive place. Original artifacts, film clips, and interactive displays take visitors on a tour through centuries of Judaism’s rich but tragic history in Russia, from the Middle Ages to the czarist-era pogroms to the Holocaust to the repression of the Stalin era to the mass emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Then it just sort of ends.\n\nThere’s a panel featuring photos of Vladimir Putin with Jewish leaders, a small display on the Russian Jewish diaspora featuring Little Failure author Gary Shteyngart as an example of a “successful, integrated Russian Jew,” and that’s about it. An exhibit on post-perestroika Jewish life is planned for some time in the future, but for now, the museum gives the impression that Judaism in Russia is a subject of historical interest rather than an ongoing story.\n\nTechnically speaking, there are four “official” religions in Russia: Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Judaism. But given that almost 70 percent of Russians identify as adherents to the Russian Orthodox Church, it’s pretty apparent that one religion is more “official” than others.\n\nThe smallest of the four is Judaism. There are fewer than 200,000 self-identified Jews in Russia today—less than the number of pagans—though the number of Russians from Jewish backgrounds who no longer identify with the religion is likely much higher. They are what remains after a mass exodus that saw more than 2 million Jews leave the countries of the former Soviet Union shortly before and after its collapse, mainly for the United States and Israel. Given that most Russians with Jewish backgrounds range from casual observers to entirely indifferent to their religion, it’s a bit unexpected that their official representatives hail from one of the more doctrinaire sects of Orthodox Judaism. You may be surprised to learn, too, that those representatives are quite close with President Vladimir Putin.\n\nRegardless, it’s quite clear that we are not at a high point of Russian Jewish culture. You could argue, though, that for the Jews who are left, things aren’t that bad. Recent years have seen a great deal of government-supported synagogue construction, and a small but growing number of Jews are attending services.\n\nAnd while there were fears after the fall of the Soviet Union that rising Russian nationalism would lead to an upsurge in anti-Semitism, that never really materialized. “After the collapse of the USSR, the number of cases of anti-Semitism have been steadily dropping on an annual basis over the last 10 years,” says Yury Kanner, head of the country’s largest secular Jewish organization, the Russian Jewish Congress.\n\nThere is certainly anti-Jewish sentiment in Russia, but the country is far from an outlier in that regard. Anti-Semitic incidents have been on the rise in a number of European countries, including France, Germany, and Italy. Much of this is related to tension between Jewish and Muslim communities and criticism of Israel, which isn’t a particularly salient issue in Russia. Anti-Semitic far-right parties have also made troubling election gains in countries like Greece and Hungary. Ultra-nationalism is an issue in Russia as well—a controversial far-right rally was held in Moscow on Nov. 4—but when this manifests itself as racism or xenophobia, it’s more typically directed against the predominantly Muslim migrants from the Caucasus and Central Asia, perhaps because they’re far more numerous than Jews.\n\nWhatever his many other sins, even Vladimir Putin’s harshest critics concede that he’s not an anti-Semite. As the New Republic’s Julia Ioffe notes, a number of his closest confidants, as well as the Judo teacher who served as a mentor and surrogate father, are Jews. He has personally intervened in cases of state anti-Semitism, such as an incident last year in which a teacher was charged with corruption and the prosecution used his Jewish last name as evidence. Putin labeled that “egregious,” and the conviction was overturned soon after.\n\nPutin’s has also generally been supportive of Jewish institutions—one Jewish institution in particular. One of the more intriguing aspects of contemporary Russian Jewish life is the close relationship between the Kremlin and Chabad, also known as Lubavitch, the Hasidic sect known in the United States for its street-corner proselytizing to fellow Jews and reverence for the late Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. Founded in Western Russia in the 18th century, the Lubavitchers decamped to the United States in 1940, setting up their new headquarters in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights neighborhood. The Orthodox Jewish movement has dispatched hundreds of emissaries throughout the world to promote the faith. Just after the fall of Communism and just prior to his own death, Schneerson sent Rabbi Berel Lazar to represent Chabad in Russia.\n\nToday, Lazar, who was born in Italy and educated in the United States, is Russia’s chief rabbi. He appears frequently at Putin’s side at public events, and is the leader of the Federation of Jewish Communities (known by its Russian acronym FEOR), the country’s most important Jewish organization. But the title of Russia’s most important rabbi is not an uncontested one.\n\nAdolf Shayevech, a prominent figure in the community since the late Soviet period, was considered chief rabbi until 2000, and still claims the title. Kanner’s group, the Russian Jewish Congress, also recognizes Shayevech. But since Putin came to power in 2000, he has preferred to work with FEOR. Lazar, who is sometimes referred to as “Putin’s Rabbi,” now sits on the country’s public chamber, a government-appointed oversight committee. Lazar has been nothing but appreciative, praising Putin publicly as a friend of the Jews and calling Russia “one of the safest places for Jews in Europe.”\n\nIn a story that seemed tailor-made to demonstrate the rabbi’s devotion to both his faith and his patron in the Kremlin, it was reported in June 2013 that Lazar had agreed, at Putin’s request, to attend a World War II memorial event hours away from Moscow on a Friday afternoon. When his plane was delayed and arrived back in Moscow just 10 minutes before sundown, Lazar made an eight-hour, 19-mile walk home rather than break the Sabbath. Sources close to the rabbi told the Israeli newspaper Arutz Sheva that his willingness to make the difficult journey was an “example of the special connection between Rabbi Lazar and Russia’s president.”\n\nGovernment support has been good for FEOR, which has restored dozens of synagogues and built Jewish community centers throughout the country. It has also gotten funding to develop the Jewish Museum, which opened in 2012 just around the corner from the organization’s Moscow headquarters.\n\nChabad members—a small fraction of a small religious community—have become the dominant force in Russian Jewish life. “Eighty percent of all synagogues, the rabbis are Chabad,” Rabbi Alexander Boroda, the organization’s chief spokesman, told me in an interview. “But the people who come, many are just young people who want to come and learn something about Judaism.”\n\nBoroda dismissed the notion that there was anything improper about his organization’s close relationship with the Kremlin. “The chief rabbi is the representative of the Jewish tradition,” he says. “It’s the Russian tradition, it’s not like America.” Indeed, a number of other Eastern European countries have chief rabbis, and in Ukraine, as in Russia, it’s a disputed position.\n\nHow exactly has Chabad reached its position of influence? For one thing, it has some influential backers. The Uzbek–Israeli billionaire diamond magnate Lev Leviev was an early and enthusiastic backer of FEOR. Roman Abramovich, the billionaire investor, governor, and owner of the Chelsea soccer team, has also been a backer, donating $5 million to build the Marina Roscha Synagogue.\n\nChabad, which unlike many other Jewish groups is a centrally organized hierarchical organization, also likely looks familiar to the Kremlin. Chabad “replicates in a way the structure of the Orthodox Church,” says Kanner. “There is a center that sends its ambassadors into the communities.”\n\nDavid Shneer, a professor of Jewish history at the University of Denver who was studied the Lubavitchers’ role in Russia, says it also helps that Chabad is a “movement that cultivates ties with political leadership as part of a broader strategy to make a home wherever they happen to be.” He compares this to the medieval practice of shtadlanut, in which European Jews lobbied local rulers for rights.\n\nEven though most Russian Jews aren’t Orthodox, Shneer says it shouldn’t be surprising that the Orthodox Chabad has taken on a leadership role in Russian Jewish life. “Chabad is evangelical Judaism,” he says. “They bring Judaism to people at whatever level they’re at. If they want to light candles, they’ll show them how to light candles. If they want to keep kosher, they’ll show them how to keep kosher. They know that 95 percent of people who attend Chabad events are not at all religiously observant. But their point is to bring a certain kind of Judaism to as many Jews as possible.”\n\nFEOR’s Boroda argues that the approach has brought results. “More people have started going to synagogue,” he says. “We’re seeing a renaissance in Jewish life.”\n\nOf course, with nationalist sentiment running high right now, there are always fears that this could once against manifest itself in hostility to Jews.\n\nA recent report from Kanner’s organization, which often works with the government to combat cases of discrimination, also noted an uptick in anti-Semitic statements from politicians and on state-run media outlets. A recent Russian television documentary about Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told viewers that “one must take into consideration his Jewish origin.” Other media hatchet jobs of foreign leaders or opposition figures have also noted their Jewish roots. There have also been a number of instances in the past year of vandalism of synagogues and cemeteries. Blatantly anti-Semitic comments from low-level politicians are fairly common. A legislator from the ruling United Russia party, for instance, remarked during a debate at the regional parliament in Kaliningrad that Jews “destroyed our country in 1917 and … destroyed our country in 1991.”\n\nEven so, a spokesman for the Russian Jewish Congress told the news agency Interfax that “the role of anti-Semitism in modern Russia has obviously become less noticeable than in the 1990s and 2000s, when it was the principal essence of nationalistic propaganda.”\n\nBut even if life is relatively comfortable for Jews, in contrast to other minorities, that doesn’t mean the community is due for a resurgence. Right now the biggest threat to Russian Judaism may be apathy, not bigotry.\n\nShneer feels that Chabad’s dominance, and the lack of reform or progressive alternatives, is “terrible for the future of pluralistic Judaism in Russia.” Russia is full of people with Jewish or partially Jewish family roots, but after decades of repression and immigration, many have little connection to the religion. On one level it seems unlikely that a branch of Judaism based in part on a rejection of modern society will be the one to bring doubters back into the fold.\n\nKanner, though, says the relative lack of interest in reform or liberal branches of Judaism shouldn’t be surprising, and is rooted in the community’s troubled history. “In Soviet times, we were Jews based on our blood. It was a nationality not a religion,” he says. “The main principle of reformism is that you can be a Jew while also being French or German or whatever. That’s why there was no basis for reformism. In Russia, you are first a Jew, then you are anything else.”\n\nTimes may have changed and the situation may have improved, but the idea that you can at once be a Jew and a Russian will still take time to take hold.\n\nJoshua Keating recently traveled to Russia thanks to a religion reporting fellowship from the International Reporting Project at Johns Hopkins.",

After the city swept out many of the sidewalk food vendors, he could no longer find affordable meals.\n\n“Many people come to visit the area,” Kamruay said. “But they are not happy. It’s an illusion!”\n\nNow he plans to move back to his hometown in the northeast to run his own farm and live quietly with his family – once his children graduate from college.\n\nElsewhere, Thongbai drips with sweat amid the pungent odor of wastewater as she prepares noodles. She laments that, as the area is reinvented as a “creative district,” the moneyed urbanites surging into the area aren’t interested in her fare.\n\n“Those people prefer to eat at luxurious places instead of decrepit food vendors,” she said on a recent visit. “But foreigners don’t care whether it’s an old place or not.”\n\nIndeed, those frequenting her stalls tend to be foreigners, expats, and people living in the area, rather than the new youth hip folk of Bangkok expanding their cosmopolitan frontiers.\n\nThough the goals driving the neighborhood’s makeover are admirable, silent in the conversation about its future are the voices of residents and low-income workers whose ways of life are threatened by the rapid gentrification that is taking hold.\n\nBang Rak is an area of dramatic contrasts. Stately buildings and five-star riverside hotels are at odds with the cart-pushing street vendors, motorcycle taxis and low-income workers eking out enough for a meal at a time in their shadow.\n\nThe relocation earlier this year of the Thailand Creative and Design Center to the austere Grand Postal Building on Charoen Krung Road helped breathe new life into what had been an area in decline.\n\nThe explosion of cafes, restaurants, boutiques, galleries and dazzling luxury condos has caused the upwardly mobile to flock to this suddenly hip neighborhood by the thousands every weekend.\n\nThe neighborhood’s desirability has gotten a boost from concerted efforts to revive it by turning it into an arts district that is a showcase for creativity that drives economic prosperity.\n\nIn Bang Rak, the issue is complicated by many stakeholders. Recently, City Hall forced food vendors out of the street to sanitize the sidewalks. Cultural preservationists see extinction on the horizon for a unique culinary identity.\n\nThe vendors who once dominated the street are now almost gone from sight.\n\n“These vendors need to support their children’s education,” Thongbai said.\n\n“We do not want development, we want happiness,” one resident said, asking not to be named for fear of repercussion. “Who knows. The children of these poor people will probably grow up to become the driving force of the nation.”",

  "latent_8180": "It would seem that the claim of \"fake news\" is true.\n\nCase in point: the media reported that America’s most entertaining circus performed its last show in New York, as Ringling Brothers packed up for good.\n\nWrong!\n\nThat show pales in comparison to the nation’s biggest circus: the Trump Administration, led by the grand ringmaster himself — the President of the United States.\n\nThe unfortunate pattern of Donald Trump is predictable: blurt cringe-worthy things that the base loves but which induce eye-rolls from everyone else; rail against the critics; double down; and then, when credibility seems irreversibly in the tank, make a magnificent speech to bring yourself back from the precipice. Repeat.\n\nMr. Trump’s ability to appear eminently presidential is maddening, as many lament: \"If only he could just control himself, he would be so much more effective; he could be great.\" And that’s not a stretch, as a majority agree with his policies, but continue to have issues with the man.\n\nNothing has changed.\n\nMr. Trump went from accolades for his speech to congress to the butt of late night jokes after tweeting that his Trump Tower office had been bugged by President Obama. Par for the course, he provided zero substantiation.\n\nThe self-induced firestorm resulted in a totally forgotten speech, and loss of much-needed political capital. And yet White House counselor Kellyanne Conway actually wondered why people were no longer talking about his speech. Hello? Earth to Kellyanne…have we met? Such a statement shows the politically naïveté of much of Trump’s staff.\n\nHere’s a look at the brouhaha:\n\nMost assume that if any bugging occurred, it centered around Trump campaign officials possibly colluding with the Russians. Any merit?\n\nDon’t know, but Trump’s advisors have done everything possible to sow seeds of doubt about their truthfulness.\n\nFirst, we had General Michael Flynn, who denied speaking with the Russian ambassador when, in fact, he did. After lying to Vice President Pence, he resigned. Was Flynn incompetent? Yes. Should he have spoken with the ambassador? No. Were his discussions illegal? Absolutely not. When will we learn that it’s not the \"crime,\" but the cover-up, that does us in?\n\nThen we have Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ unfathomable political ineptness. Sessions failed to see the importance of disclosing that he met with the Russian ambassador during the campaign. Had he just stated that he had done so as a U.S. Senator, there wouldn’t have been an issue.\n\nBut then Sessions couldn’t recollect what was discussed. Somehow it didn’t dawn on him that such a statement was the worst possible answer, as it made him appear evasive, and further fueled the Russia issue. Most baffling was Sessions recusing himself without informing the president, causing Mr. Trump to erupt in fury.\n\nThe question stands as to why so many on Trump’s team met with a top foreign leader, especially at a political convention.\n\nWhich brings us to the alleged wiretapping. Here are several plausible scenarios:\n\n1) The Trump offices were never bugged. There are reports that an article referencing the possibility of wiretapping had infuriated the president, and may have led to his unprecedented accusation. If true, it is very troubling, since the president must exhibit better self-discipline. Appearing paranoid is a path to political ruin.\n\n2) The offices were tapped illegally. If so, the perpetrators must be apprehended and prosecuted. Quickly.\n\n3) The offices were legitimately tapped by a non-federal government entity, such as a state’s Attorney General. Why? Who knows? But clearly, one doesn’t get to the level of Donald Trump without associating in some capacity with unsavory individuals: the mob, Middle Eastern sheiks, corrupt union bosses, foreign officials, and other businessmen.\n\n4) Communications could have been tapped because of an ongoing investigation into a foreign power — say, the Russians hacking the DNC’s computers. If foreign targets were in contact with individuals in Trump Tower, then the case for legitimate bugging could well be made.\n\nIt is possible that a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court judge deemed there to be enough evidence to wiretap Trump Tower because some of its occupants came into focus during an investigation. Therefore, such a probe may well have been legitimate.\n\nThere’s an easy way to figure this out: the president can declassify documents. Yet he hasn’t. Why not? And why is he asking congress to investigate if the facts are literally at his fingertips?\n\nThe president’s erratic actions have created yet another pitfall for his agenda. Rather than keeping his powder dry until all the facts were known, Mr. Trump’s impulsive tweeting and unsubstantiated claims have left him walking atop the narrowest of tightropes, with no safety net.\n\nMr. President, please stop clowning around. It’s time to run the country — not a circus.\n\nChris Freind is an independent columnist, television commentator, and investigative reporter who operates his own news bureau, Freindly Fire Zone Media.

New entries cannot be posted to it.\n\nLocation: Москва, Новинский бульвар, дом 25 корпус 1 Как взломать правительство РФ: пошаговая инструкция Почитал фрагмент переписки одного из наших недавно взломанных госдеятелей.\n\nПытался проверить своё изначальное предположение, что причиной взлома послужило банальное разгильдяйство и техническое невежество обслуживающего персонала.\n\nВыяснилось ровно то, что я и предполагал. Пароли от блогов госдеятеля не защищены никакими самыми общедоступными способами дополнительной авторизации (вроде подтверждения входа по СМС). Пароли известны очень широкому кругу сотрудников пресс-службы. Эти сотрудники не отличаются повышенной технической грамотностью, и не имеют никакой должностной инструкции, которая бы обязывала их, например, использовать шифрование при отправке служебной корреспонденции, не пересылать пароли от аккаунтов в открытом виде, и не пользоваться публичными файлопомойками для обмена конфиденциальной информацией. Им даже никто не предписал использовать один на всех, общий почтовый сервис, которым мог бы быть тот же, например, Gmail или Яндекс.Почта, но в собственном домене, одном для всех, с единой политикой безопасности.\n\nВот как выглядит шапка письма, внутри которого пересылается пост госдеятеля ему на утверждение — и, на всякий случай, пароль от блога пересылается в том же письме.\n\nТо есть алгоритм работы над постом был такой.\n\nСперва некий сотрудник (условно: райтер) пишет текст и подбирает к нему иллюстрации. Или наоборот, он монтирует видео, и придумывает к нему подпись.\n\nДальше он должен отправить своё творчество вышестоящему работнику (условно: редактору).\n\nДля этого он сохраняет текст и видео в разные файлы, закрывает их в архив RAR размером 211МБ, и выкладывает этот RAR в открытый доступ на файловый хостинг RedPost компании МТС (где райтер залогинен под своим адресом Gmail).\n\nСопроводительную записку с паролем от блога и своим билайновским номером мобильника он оставляет на том же хостинге. В качестве адресата указывает почтовый ящик редактора на Mail.Ru.\n\nВ скриншоте — шапка уведомления уже от робота RedPost, о том, что адресату (редактору) стал доступен некий RAR, выложенный на сервере до востребования.\n\nПолучив уведомление, редактор не прикасается ни к файлу, ни к письму, а жмёт на Forward, и пересылает публичную ссылку от робота (с запиской от райтера внутри) своему руководителю (условно: главе пресс-службы) на ящик Gmail.\n\nПосле этого глава пресс-службы, тоже ни к чему не прикасаясь, жмёт на Forward и пересылает всю цепочку (письмо райтера, письмо от робота, форвард от редактора) уже своему начальству — тому самому госдеятелю на Яндекс.почту. При этом явно подразумевается, что госдеятель сам скачает RAR с хостинга RedPost, разархивирует его на своём Макбуке, посмотрит видео, одобрит текстовую подпись, а дальше — на выбор. Либо сам зайдёт в свой блог по прилагающемуся паролю и опубликует, либо даст отмашку главе пресс-службы, и команда на публикацию отправится обратным ходом — с Яндекса на Gmail, оттуда на Mail.Ru, оттуда снова на Gmail.\n\nКому-то эта технологическая цепочка может показаться сложной для понимания. Но её и не нужно понимать. Принцип функционирования институтов, которые в 2014 году так работают с файлами, описан в Законе Паркинсона за 40 лет до появления первой веб-почты. Вопрос в другом.\n\nКак я и предполагал, пароль от блога имелся у неограниченного круга лиц, каждое из которых обращалось с этой информацией вполне небрежно. То есть очень велика (порядка 100%) вероятность, что пароль от аккаунта увели совершенно случайно, в ходе банальной фишинговой атаки, среди целей которой не было никаких госдеятелей, а были обычные лохи, кликающие на ссылки и аттачменты без разбора. После чего организатор атаки получил доступ к куче аккаунтов в почтовых сервисах, платёжных системах, онлайн-банкинге и т.п. А тут вдруг приплыл бесплатный бонус в виде пароля от самого популярного русскоязычного микроблога — грех не порезвиться. И порезвились, целых 55 минут. Из чего делаем вывод, что даже такая минимальная защита, как уведомление о новых логинах с незнакомых адресов и клиентов, не сработала. То есть она либо не была активирована вовсе, либо она была привязана к телефонному номеру, владелец которого в тот момент спал, принимал душ, жил личной жизнью.\n\nОстаётся последний вопрос: почему я не верю, что в Твиттере госдеятеля порезвился сам b0ltai, он же «Анонимный Интернационал». А вот ровно потому и не верю, что слежу за их деятельностью. Тот доступ к почте, который они используют для публикации чиновничьей переписки, уже сто раз можно было использовать для дефейса публичных аккаунтов в соцсетях. Но они никогда этого не делали. И если б им вдруг показалось, что в честь данного конкретного госдеятеля они хотят изменить традиции, то они бы, уверяю вас, нашли способ порезвиться от души в его Твиттере. Опубликовать там не пять, а пять тысяч сообщений. Пропиарить свои разоблачения прямыми ссылками. Сделать так, чтобы пресс-служба потратила не 55 минут, а 55 часов на разгребание «левых» твитов.\n\nb0ltai использовал инфоповод со взломом Твиттера на полную катушку, за что честь ему и хвала. Никогда ещё педерасты из ФСО не были так близко к признанию, что в их штат берут только пассивных.\n\nНо по факту самого взлома я уверен, что всемогущества b0ltai тут банально не требовалось. Просто пароль от аккаунта полоскался на ветру. Его нельзя было не проебать — и его банально проебали.\n\nТерпеливым пользователям, дочитавшим до этого места, в утешение могу предложить несколько красивых фоток, всплывших во взломанной переписке. Вот, например, вид на Киевский вокзал и Москву-Сити с вертолёта:\n\nИли вот ещё Поклонная гора:\n\nВ какой-нибудь Венеции или Америке, чтобы такую фотографию сделать, нужно целых 160 долларов вертолётчику за проезд заплатить (в Катманду ещё самолёт для этой цели используют, но те же $160).\n\nА в России ФСО не даст никакому вертолётчику возить туристов над ближней дачей Сталина. Зато у нас любой желающий может взломать аккаунт госдеятеля, и тут уж никакая ФСО не помешает. Потому что вся тема защиты персональных данных отдана в России на откуп жуликам и ворам.

  "latent_8352": "Ian Hawkey looks ahead to Morocco's Africa Cup of Nations match against the Ivory Coast as Hevre Renard looks forward to a reunion with the team he led to the 2015 title.\n\nHerve Renard used to talk, partly in jest, partly to please the media, about his “lucky” white shirt. Crisp, well-tailored, he was recognised for his attire — always the same shirt — on the touchlines of Africa Cup of Nations even before he was better known for his Midas touch.\n\nRenard has been the winning manager at two of the last three tournaments, and on Tuesday he has the opportunity to advance his case for a possible hat-trick in Gabon, and to do so with what will seem like a particular ruthlessness.\n\nRenard is in charge of Morocco, the third different African national team he has managed, and if Morocco beat Ivory Coast in Oyem, he will guarantee a place in the quarter-finals at the expense of the Ivorians. The holders would thus tumble out, just as the hosts, Gabon, already have at the group phase. One or two eyebrows would be raised about hierarchies being upended, forecasts defied.\n\nRenard might raise a single quizzical eyebrow, but, as he has made his reputation by consistently challenging the continent’s status quo, he will be cool in his analyses.\n\nRenard, 48, is the man who guided Zambia to their first ever triumph in the event, in 2012. He stayed in the job for an unsuccessful defence and then moved on to manage the Ivory Coast, tasked with taking a richly talented squad beyond the stubborn rut of near-misses and underachieving that had deprived them of the continental prize.\n\n__________________________________\n\nRead more\n\n■ Ian Hawkey: Heat is on Algeria and Georges Leekens\n\n■ Ghana: Al Ahli’s Asamoah Gyan takes Ghana through\n\n■ Fixtures and kick-off times: Africa Cup of Nations 2017\n\n__________________________________\n\nRenard’s lucky white shirt absorbed some perspiration on the night in Equatorial Guinea when the Ivory Coast at last broke their bad habits, via a penalty shoot-out, to win the 2015 final.\n\nThe Ivorians he confronts now are significantly altered, no longer the group in which Didier Drogba, Yaya and Kolo Toure galvanised the dressing-room and Gervinho danced down the flanks. Yet there are several of Renard’s champions still among them, like Eric Bailly, Serge Aurier, Wilfried Bony and the ageless Salomon Kalou.\n\nTwo months ago, Morocco played Ivory Coast in a World Cup qualifier, a 0-0 draw. “It was emotional to see them again,” Renard said. “But I try to forget all that.”\n\nWhat he will not wipe from his memory is the template he followed in his two success so far at Nations Cups. Morocco began this one with a defeat, to a DR Congo who top the group but who could still be pushed back into third place if they lose to Togo. The Moroccans then showed a marked improvement in beating Togo 3-1 in their second match.\n\nRenard had made changes, and was especially satisfied with his team’s effectiveness from set-pieces. His introduction of Faycal Fajr, the Deportivo La Coruna playmaker, to the starting XI was key to that, Fajr delivering the passes for the two goals that turned a 1-0 deficit against Togo into a winning scoreline.\n\n“Sometimes, at an Africa Cup of Nations, you have to respond to setbacks and just stay solid,” Renard said of Morocco’s tournament so far. “I remember with Ivory Coast last time, we only drew our first two matches and then went through with a 1-0 win the last group game.”\n\nThe Ivorians have again followed that pattern, with draws against Togo and DR Congo, the latter 2-2 after twice falling behind. Michel Dussuyer, Renard’s French compatriot and his successor as Ivory Coast manager, likes to think his team are pacing themselves.\n\n“It is s similar situation to the last Nations Cup, and so I hope history can repeat itself,” he said. “But we are in no doubt we are playing the equivalent of a final against Morocco.”\n\nRenard may have the superior touchline know-how — and indeed a lucky garment — but the new-look Ivory Coast, even without their celebrated superstars of the past, have more big-match pedigree spread through the squad.\n\nAurier, the defender from French champions Paris Saint-Germain, acknowledged there was nervousness among Ivorian supporters about the team’s delicate position, but insisted: “All the noise is coming from outside. We are feeling calm.”\n\nsports@thenational.ae\n\nFollow us on Twitter @NatSportUAE\n\nLike us on Facebook at facebook.com/TheNationalSport",
  "latent_8414": "Patrick McDermott/Getty Images The U.S. Patents and Trademarks Office cancelled the federal trademarks for the Washington Redskins after ruling that the name was \"disparaging to Native Americans.\"\n\nFive Native Americans petitioned the office to cancel six trademarks filed between 1967 and 1990. Under federal law, trademarks that \"may disparage persons or bring them into contempt or disrepute\" cannot be registered.\n\nThe office said in a ruling:\n\n\"We decide, based on the evidence properly before us, that these registrations must be cancelled because they were disparaging to Native Americans at the respective times they were registered, in violation of Section 2(a) of the Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. § 1052(a).\"\n\nEven if the ruling is upheld, the team can still call itself the Redskins. But without the trademarks, anyone can use the Redskins name to sell merchandise. It essentially puts financial pressure on owner Dan Snyder to change the name.\n\nThe entire ruling can be read here. It includes a lengthy discussion, with expert opinions from lexicographers, about the historical origins of the words and its use as an offensive term over the past century.\n\nThe key part of the ruling says that 30% of Native Americans find the name disparaging. The committee describes this as a \"substantial composite\" of Native Americans, which establishes that the name is offensive:\n\n\"The record establishes that, at a minimum, approximately thirty percent of Native Americans found the term REDSKINS used in connection with respondent's services to be disparaging at all times including 1967, 1972, 1974, 1978 and 1990. Section 2(a) prohibits registration of matter that disparages a substantial composite, which need not be a majority, of the referenced group. Thirty percent is without doubt a substantial composite. To determine otherwise means it is acceptable to subject to disparagement 1 out of every 3 individuals, or as in this case approximately 626,095 out of 1,878,285 in 1990. >There is nothing in the Trademark Act, which expressly prohibits registration of disparaging terms, or in its legislative history, to permit that level of disparagement of a group and, therefore, we find this showing of thirty percent to be more than substantial.\n\n\"Respondent has introduced evidence that some in the Native American community do not find the term \"Redskin\" disparaging when it is used in connection with professional football. While this may reveal differing opinions within the community, it does not negate the opinions of those who find it disparaging. The ultimate decision is based on whether the evidence shows that a substantial composite of the Native American population found the term \"Redskins\" to be disparaging when the respective registrations issued. Therefore, once a substantial composite has been found, the mere existence of differing opinions cannot change the conclusion.\n\n\"In view of the above, petitioners have shown by a preponderance of the evidence that a substantial composite of Native Americans found the term REDSKINS to be disparaging in connection with respondent's services during the relevant time frame of 1967-1990. Accordingly, the six registrations must be cancelled as required under Sections 2(a) and 14(3) of the Trademark Act. 216.\"\n\nA similar ruling was made in 1992, according to the office, but the decision was later reversed.\n\nThe cancelled six trademarks all involve the \"REDSKINS\" name: marks on \"THE REDSKINS,\" \"WASHINGTON REDSKINS,\" \"REDSKINS,\" AND \"REDSKINETTES\" were all cancelled. Two old logos, both with \"Redskins\" in them, were also cancelled:",

  "latent_8671": "The “Rise of the Nones” is not the latest science fiction tale of alien invasion. It’s a growing group of people known to demographers and sociologists as the Nones because when asked to identify their religion for a survey or census, they check off the box for “None.”\n\nAlmost two years ago, the Pew Research Centre released a study called ‘Nones’ on the Rise. It analyzed the 46 million people (one-fifth of adult Americans at the time) who answered “None” to the religion question that year. Analysis of Canadian census and survey data finds that one in four Canadians are considered Nones.\n\nWhatever the differences between the two countries, research points to a rapid increase in adults who say they have no religious affiliation.\n\nEven without the statistical data, religious leaders have noticed a thinning of their flocks. It’s not just the well-known contingent of worshippers, who only show up to church or synagogue during Easter and Passover. A growing number, especially young people, are eschewing traditional religious affiliations altogether.\n\nWhat do we know about the Nones? All they have told us is that the have no religious affiliation.\n\nThey are a diverse mix, including but not limited to atheists. Agnostics, of course, and those who would consider themselves decidedly spiritual but not seeking an organized religion. One-time Catholics, lapsed Anglicans, secular Muslims and non-observant Jews. You name it.\n\nToday’s young adults are more unhinged from traditional authorities and institutions than any prior generation of 20-year-olds. They didn’t grow up with religion and have not embraced it as adults. No guilt, no shame, no fear of eternal damnation.\n\nNones tend to be more liberal on social issues, including a significantly higher percentage favouring pro-choice and marriage equality policies.\n\nTheir views of churches and other religious organizations are mixed. A majority agree that religious organizations strengthen community bonds and play an important role in helping the poor and needy. But most also say that religious organizations are too concerned with money and power, too obsessed with rules and too involved in politics.\n\nThe unaffiliated also are more skeptical than others of the idea that houses of worship contribute to solving important social problems, and the notion that religious organizations protect and strengthen morality in society.\n\nAs their numbers grow, will the Nones assume positions of political power? New York City’s new mayor, Bill de Blasio, is perhaps America’s most visible politician whose only religious identity seems to be “spiritual, but not religious.’’ Despite being a more secular country, don’t expect an atheist Canadian prime minister in the near future.\n\nAre we seeing the end of religion as we know it? Hardly. Churches are closing, but organized religion is not dead.\n\nSome church leaders reacted to the Pew Research report with alarm. They saw it as further confirmation of the declining role of religion.\n\nOthers, however, have called for a radical recalibration so that institutional religion can reach out to Nones. Pastor James Emery White of Mecklenburg Community Church in Charlotte, N.C., has written The Rise of the Nones: Understanding and Reaching the Religiously Unaffiliated.\n\nGood luck with that. Seriously. Despite their diversity, the Nones have either decided that there is no God and/or would simply rather sleep in or go for a run on Sunday morning.\n\nTough crowd for conversion to say the least. And growing.\n\nRev. Bob Ripley is a retired United Church minister.\n\nbob.ripley@sympatico.ca\n\nTwitter.com/riplestone",

It has no qualms with killing others and has been doing so for many years. The Black Fog is apparently very old and has been around since the times where Pokémon were treated as gods. Because of it being accustomed to that treatment, it became arrogant and prideful.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Black Fog is described as a high-level Haunter that preys on humans and Pokémon and has been doing so for years. It kills its prey by stealing their souls with its Dream Eater and disappears just after it does so.\n\nThe Black Fog first appears where Sabrina, its latest victim, is sent to the hospital. One of the people who have been combating the Black Fog tells Ash and Brock that the giant Haunter had killed Sabrina's Pokémon when she was younger. Ash, surprised that a kind woman could be filled with feelings like revenge, decides to defeat the Black Fog and free Sabrina from its grasp.\n\nThe statue of a Haunter revealed after its death\n\nAfter making a large Poké Ball designed to capture the monstrous beast, Ash, Brock, and the people who have been fighting the Black Fog all go to its lair to defeat it. While the group distracts the many Gastly that the Black Fog has to keep surveillance, Ash and Brock stay behind to battle the beast.\n\nThey begin battling the Black Fog with their Pokémon but it just easily smacks them around. Eventually, with help from Sabrina and her Abra, they manage to get Black Fog into the Poké Ball and attempt to close it inside. Suddenly, the Poké Ball explodes and the Black Fog escapes into a hole below. They realize that it used Explosion to free itself but in doing so lowered its health down to almost zero and can be captured by a normal Poké Ball.\n\nAsh goes down to battle the Black Fog one last time aided by his Pikachu and Sabrina's Abra. Weakened by using Explosion, Black Fog is forced to defend itself by throwing rocks at its opponent. They easily dodge the rocks and Ash throws an Ultra Ball to capture it after binding Black Fog with Thunder. However, just before the Ultra Ball can reach it, the Black Fog commits suicide with Self-Destruct.\n\nIts death instantly revives Sabrina, who rescues Ash from the collapsing ruins. Sabrina reveals that in the ancient times, Pokémon were once treated as if they were gods and the Black Fog had become accustomed to the treatment so it would rather commit suicide than let itself be caught by a human. Despite hating the beast for over the last ten years, Sabrina cannot help herself from feeling sorry for it and breaks down in tears.\n\nMoves used\n\nTrivia\n\nThe Black Fog may be the counterpart to Sabrina's Haunter. It should be noted that the Haunter in the anime was happy and friendly while the Haunter (referred to as \"The Black Fog\") in The Electric Tale of Pikachu is shown to be evil and destructive; likewise, in The Electric Tale of Pikachu, Sabrina is kind and gentle, while her anime counterpart was cold and callous.\n\nNames\n\nLanguage Name Origin Japanese ブラックフォッグ Black Fog English Black Fog Brazilian Portuguese Neblina Negra Means Black Fog\n\nRelated articles\n\nFor more information on this Pokémon's species, see Haunter.",

  "latent_9144": "The campus sexual-assault controversy is of liberal higher ed’s own making.\n\nFor decades, universities have nurtured the most lunatic forms of feminism, denying the biological differences between males and females, promoting the idea that Western civilization is endemically sexist, and encouraging in their students ever-more-delusional forms of victimhood. It is therefore deeply gratifying to see these same universities now impaled by the very ideology that they have so assiduously promoted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Obama administration has released the names of 55 colleges and universities that it is investigating over their sexual-assault policies, part of an accelerating campaign against universities for allegedly turning a blind eye to the purported epidemic of campus rape. The list is top-heavy with the elite of the elite — Harvard, Princeton, UC Berkeley, Swarthmore, Amherst, and Dartmouth, among others. A more deserving group of victims would be hard to find.\n\n#ad#Parroting over 20 years worth of feminist propagandizing, the White House claims nearly 20 percent of female college undergraduates are sexually assaulted during their college years. To put that number in perspective: Detroit residents have been fleeing the city for years due to its infamous violent crime. And what constitutes an American urban crime wave? In 2012, Detroit’s combined rate for all four violent felonies that make up the FBI’s violent-crime index — murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault — was 2 percent. The rape rate was 0.05 percent. And yet, despite an alleged campus sexual-assault rate that is 400 times greater than Detroit’s, female applicants are beating down the doors of selective colleges in record numbers.\n\nHarvard this year received over 34,000 applications, about half from females, for a freshman class of about 1,600; every other elite college was similarly swamped with female applicants. According to the White House Council on Women and Girls, “survivors” of the alleged campus sexual-assault epidemic “often” experience a lifetime of physical and mental infirmity that includes depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome. How could highly educated baby-boomer mothers, who have spent their maternal years fending off phantom risks to their children from pesticides and vaccines, suddenly send their daughters off to a crime scene of such magnitude, unmatched even in the most brutal African tribal wars? What happened to the Sisterhood? Shouldn’t it be warning its members and forming alternative structures for educating females? Instead, every year, millions of girls walk into this alleged maelstrom of violence like innocent lambs to slaughter. Even more puzzling, every year those same girls graduate from that cauldron of predation in ever more disproportionate numbers, and go on to lead highly lucrative careers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt should not be necessary to tell a feminist that rape is the most violent crime — with the emphasis on crime – that a woman can experience, short of murder. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports list rape as the second most serious violent felony. If the campus feminists really believed that campuses are experiencing an epidemic of criminal sexual assault, they would demand that every campus sexual-assault allegation be brought in criminal court, where the assailant can be sentenced to years in prison if convicted. Instead, they favor secret proceedings before an increasingly byzantine set of campus tribunals made up of judicially clueless bureaucrats and professors whose most severe punishment is expulsion. Imagine if a stranger broke into a female’s dorm room at night and raped her at knifepoint. Would that case be taken to the campus Title IX gender-bias tribunal? Unlikely. If someone were merely robbing females of their iPads at gunpoint around the campus library, that case, too, though far less serious than rape, would most certainly be prosecuted criminally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are several reasons why no one is pushing to bring campus sexual-assault cases to court. It certainly helps that the procedures before college gender tribunals are egregiously stacked against defendants. The Obama administration recently recommended that campuses deny students facing sexual-assault charges the right to cross-examine their accuser, a trend already well underway on campuses across the country. It also wants campuses to use a flimsy preponderance-of-evidence standard for guilt, and to allow repeated proceedings against a student after an initial acquittal, as KC Johnson and Hans Bader have explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe campus sexual-assault tribunal also has a performative aspect: It dramatizes the patriarchy before a sympathetic audience of adults. “Our task is to give voice to the daily forms of violence we too often accept as inevitable,” a Harvard graduate student recently told the New York Times, describing her work protesting Harvard’s sexual-assault policies. The campus sexual revolution began with students’ demand to be free of any intrusive parietal oversight from college officials; now, in a bizarre turnaround, the children of that revolution want colleges to actually write rules for sex and police their enforcement. The colleges are only too happy to comply. In 2013, Yale came up with an embarrassingly graphic set of hypothetical sexual scenarios between gender-unidentifiable students, in an effort to delineate what constitutes permissible sex. One would have hoped that a world-class academic institution would have better things to do. Meanwhile, here is a message to girls: This is sex that we’re talking about, the very realm of the irrational and the uncontrolled. See Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Boccaccio’s Decameron, and Euripides’ The Bacchae (if those texts are still available at your school). Norms of chivalry, courtship, and modesty once tried to channel this primal drive; with those conventions now demolished as sexist, females (and males) are on their own — and often at sea. A highly legalistic definition of consent — the current desideratum of campus sex bureaucrats — is hardly a sufficient substitute for traditional social checks on the sexual instinct and will never be able to regulate the inexpressible and often conflicting emotions around intercourse.\n\nBut the main reason “survivors” don’t demand to bring their cases to criminal court is that they know that what they have experienced is something far more complex and compromised than criminal sexual assault, almost invariably involving mixed signals, ambiguity, and a large degree of voluntary behavior on their part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#page#Girls often drink themselves blotto both before and during parties precisely to lower their sexual inhibitions. The authors of campus-rape surveys discovered early on that when the students whom the pollsters deem rape victims are asked if they think they have been raped, the “victims” overwhelmingly respond in the negative. In the 1986 Ms. survey that sparked the campus-rape industry, 73 percent of respondents whom the study characterized as rape victims said that they hadn’t been raped when asked the question directly. Forty-two percent of these supposed victims had intercourse again with their alleged assailants.\n\nThe alleged campus-rape epidemic could be stopped overnight if women’s advocates sent a simple message to girls: Don’t get drunk and get into bed with a guy whom you barely know. Keep your clothes on and go home to your own bed at night. And most controversially: Demand that any boy court you long enough to reveal his character and his respect for yours before you even think about having sex with him. The feminist advocates are more interested in preserving the principle of male fault, however, than in protecting females from regretted sex. And so rather than sending an unequivocal message of personal empowerment and responsibility, they put the entire onus of sexual responsibility on males, treating females as the invariably helpless victims of the male libido.\n\n#ad#The colleges under investigation by the Department of Education may have sustained a public-relations black eye, but sadly, they will suffer not the slightest drop in their endowments or enrollments. They will even continue to coddle their students’ melodramatic oppression fantasies. The Title IX investigations, triggered by student complaints, are premised on the preposterous conceit that colleges are creating so hostile an environment for females that those females are actually prevented from learning. Here’s how the colleges should respond:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Are you kidding me? Get a grip. This is the most welcoming, safe, lavishly endowed community ever created in human history, where students with the desire to absorb wisdom can do so in leisure, surrounded by supportive faculty and well-meaning administrators. There are millions of girls in Asia who are studying ten hours a day to gain the privilege of learning on an American campus; if they were to come to this ‘hostile’ environment, they would seize every educational opportunity available to them.”\n\nInstead, however, the colleges’ student-services deans and rape counselors, who live precisely for these moments of conflict, will grovel before their accusers and promise to make amends. The New York Times has been hawking an article from Columbia’s student newspaper that purported to expose the college’s inadequate response to sexual assault. The original article triggered campus protests against the administration and penitence from the grown-ups. What it mostly showed, however, was the hold of the gender-studies mentality on far too many students. The student journalists were outraged that the school’s sexual-assault policies refer to “rape” “euphemistically” as “non-consensual sexual intercourse,” and to alleged “rapists” as “respondents.” One “survivor” — “Natalie” (a pseudonym) — complains that a Title IX investigator used abbreviations in taking down her story, resulting in “holes” that made her account not “sound like a strong case” (it probably wasn’t) and keeping her “from having ownership over the retelling of her history with emotional and sexual violence.” Natalie had been in a “fragile state” from a previous “emotionally abusive relationship,” and promptly entered into another “‘destructive and unhealthy’ physical relationship” with another male that was “confusing at best.” That male, the article explained, “often forcefully pinned [Natalie’s] arms back against the mattress during sex; [she] would cry during and after they slept together. Not until months after their break up did Natalie recognize this as non-consensual intercourse.” If Natalie was unhappy with their sexual relationship, she would have been wise to have put an end to it. The Columbia student article provided no evidence of flawed assault policies, beyond the mere fact that the school did not issue guilty findings in Natalie’s case (which she did not fully cooperate with) and one other. The article did, however, reveal the chaotic state of campus couplings in the absence of any normative restraints on casual intercourse, a situation that will claim only female emotional victims.\n\nWhile the legal risks regarding regretted sex are increasingly stacked against male students, it is hard to shed a tear for them, either. They may not be guilty of rape, but they are almost certainly guilty of taking full advantage of the sexual caravansary on campus, and of acting as brutishly as females will allow them to. Males are the main beneficiaries of no-commitment sex, for males and females are not equals on the sexual battlefield. While there may be few actual rape victims on college campuses, there are undoubtedly thousands of girls feeling confused, betrayed, and exploited by callous partners who are blind to their ambivalence and who leave their bed with no emotional pang whatsoever. If male students respond to the one-sided distribution of risk and responsibility by becoming sexual prudes, society will have suffered no loss whatsoever. But don’t count on the male libido to do anything so sane.\n\n— Heather Mac Donald is a Thomas Smith Fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the author of The Burden of Bad Ideas.",
  "latent_9150": "James Comey’s unexpected ouster last Tuesday sent Washington into an unprecedented tailspin as the White House communications apparatus tried to explain away Donald Trump’s seemingly abrupt decision to fire the man heading the Justice Department investigation into his campaign’s alleged Kremlin ties. But, one week later, that scandal seems rather quaint by comparison. In another twist in the seemingly endless Russian melodrama, The New York Times’ Michael S. Schmidt reported that Trump explicitly asked Comey to shutter the F.B.I. investigation into Mike Flynn, his former national security adviser, shortly after his inauguration.\n\n“I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,” the president said, according to a memo that Comey prepared after the meeting, part of which was read to the New York Times by an associate of the former law enforcement official. “He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” Comey reportedly responded, “I agree he is a good guy,” but did not promise to close the probe. The existence of the memo was quickly confirmed by NBC News and The Washington Post. (Trump and his associates have denied any wrongdoing.)\n\nAccording to the Times report, the conversation between Trump and Comey took place in the Oval Office on February 14—the day after Flynn resigned amid scandal following the Post’s report that the former general had misled White House officials, notably Vice President Mike Pence, about whether he discussed election-related sanctions against Moscow with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Comey reportedly informed other F.B.I. officials of the existence of the memo, which sources told the Times was part of a broader paper trail kept by the seasoned law enforcement officer, detailing his interactions with the president. According to those two sources, Comey took detailed notes on every phone call and meeting he had with the president.\n\nThe White House flatly denied the Times report. “While the president has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,” an official said in a statement. “The president has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.”\n\nActing F.B.I. Director Andrew McCabe also denied that the White House or Trump had attempted to interfere with the Justice Department investigation in sworn testimony before the Senate last week. “There has been no effort to impede our investigation to date,” said McCabe.\n\nThe revelation that Trump allegedly asked Comey to close the Flynn investigation is the latest in a string of devastating headlines for the White House. Within hours of Comey's ouster, CNN revealed that federal prosecutors in Virginia had recently issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from associates of Mike Flynn, fueling speculation that Trump dismissed the F.B.I. director over the Russia investigation. The White House press shop subsequently spent the next few days denying that this was the case—arguing that Comey was dismissed for mishandling the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s e-mail scandal, and on the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein—only to be undermined by Trump himself.\n\n“Regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey,” the president told NBC News's Lester Holt. In the interview, Trump created further headaches for his embattled staff when he revealed that he had a private dinner with Comey shortly after the election, during which the president reportedly asked for the F.B.I. director’s loyalty. On Friday, Trump seemingly leveled a threat against Comey when he wrote on Twitter, “James Comey better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” (According to the Times, Trump began his February 14 conversation with Comey by suggesting that the F.B.I. consider jailing journalists who leak classified information.)\n\nThe Trump administration was dealt another blow Monday when the Post reported that the president had revealed “highly classified” information to Kislyak and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov—a move intelligence experts characterized as “a stunning lapse in judgement.”. (The White House has denied that Trump did anything inappropriate during the meeting with the Russian officials.)\n\nThe response from lawmakers on Captiol Hill to the Times report was swift. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was “shaken” by the news and that the “country is being tested in unprecedented ways.” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi warned that if the reports are true, “At best, Trump has committed a grave abuse of executive power. At worst, he has obstructed justice.” When asked during an interview with CNN by Wolf Blitzer whether the Times report could lead to an impeachment process, Independent Senator Angus King conceded, “Reluctantly, Wolf, I have to say yes.” Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said, “We are witnessing an obstruction of justice case unfold in real time.” Obstruction of justice was the first article of impeachment against President Richard Nixon, who resigned from office in 1974 amid a similar controversy.\n\nA number of Republicans, the vast majority of whom stopped short of publicly rebuking Trump over the past week, also began to speak out soon after news of the alleged Comey letter broke. Rep. Carlos Curbelo wrote on Twitter that “If recent allegations are true, they mark the beginning of a new and very sad chapter of scandal and controversy in our country.” House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz told NBC News, “If the memo exists, I need to see it and I need to see it right away,” adding that the subpoena process is already underway. Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also stressed the importance of obtaining the memo. “I think the burden is on the New York Times, if they’re reporting it and they’ve got somebody who’s got the document,” he told Politico. “They need to get the document and get it released.\"\n\nDonald Trump FOLLOW Hillary Clinton FOLLOW Follow to get the latest news and analysis about the players in your inbox.

  "latent_9186": "Nairobi, Kenya - For decades Zakayo Ekeno has walked Turkana County's arid land, herding his livestock, and his father's before that. Yet nothing about the persistently drought-stricken land in northern Kenya could have given him an indication of the wealth beneath it.\n\n\"I have asked myself many times whether anything good can come out of this godforsaken land,\" Ekeno says. Turkana is the most arid and poorest of Kenya's 47 counties and in 2011 almost 9.5 million people of the mainly nomad community here were affected by severe drought.\n\nSo few people could have even dreamt that beneath the sun-scorched, cracked earth was enough water to supply this entire country of 41.6 million people for 70 years.\n\nLast Wednesday, the government and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO)announced the discovery of an estimated 200 billion cubic metres of freshwater reserves in Turkana County's Lotikipi basin.\n\nIt's still early in the day and yet the Turkana are missing from the water dialogue. The government is already talking about supplying the entire country with the ‘new' water, but how much of it will go to the Turkana people? - Ikal Ang'elei, Friends of Lake Turkana\n\n\"Every year our livestock die from lack of water and pasture. We also live in fear of cattle rustlers who steal our animals to replace what they lost. I have been injured during these raids. The water is a solution to this conflict,\" Ekeno says.\n\nUntil now, the UN has categorised Kenya as a chronically water-scarce country, and UNESCO statistics show that 17 million people here lack access to safe water. Kenya currently uses about three billion cubic metres of water a year.\n\nWhile the discovery has been met with excitement, water and environment experts such as scientist Judith Gicharu caution that this East African government has little capacity or legislation to manage this water sustainably.\n\n\"We have the Water Act of 2002 and the Environment Management and Coordination Act of 1999. But they provide no significant policy framework in regard to the management of underground water,\" Gicharu says.\n\nProvisions exist within broader policy frameworks, but do not deal specifically with land use and groundwater management, she says, adding decision-making in groundwater management is \"often not based on any solid regulations\".\n\n\"But even where groundwater provisions exist, they are rarely acted upon. Implementation of whatever provisions exist has been compromised by an overlap of duties amongst various government agencies dealing with water and the environment,\" Gicharu says.\n\nIn Kenya, all water resources belong to the state, and government agencies have to approve and issue permits for water use. But according to a 2011 World Bank report titled \"Kenya - Groundwater governance case study\", there is a limited understanding \"of the land surface groundwater linkage among professionals in the relevant sectors, and as a consequence there is no strategic awareness of the need to protect groundwater resources\".\n\nIkal Ang'elei from Friends of Lake Turkana, a community environmental association, cautions that in the absence of a strong legislative framework that could guide \"how resources are to be exploited and who benefits from them, and in what ways, this natural wealth may not improve the country's fortunes in any significant way\".\n\n\"It's still early in the day and yet the Turkana are missing from the water dialogue. The government is already talking about supplying the entire country with the ‘new' water, but how much of it will go to the Turkana people?\" she asks.\n\nThe water discovery is the second major natural resource find in Turkana County. In March 2012, oil exploration company Tullow Oil announced the discovery of millions of barrels of oil in Turkana County's Lokichar basin.\n\n\"We cannot take the same direction that the oil dialogue has taken. Since the oil in Turkana was discovered, investors have only been interested in finding out when the oil will start flowing. They are not talking about the benefits to the community,\" Ang'elei says.\n\nNorthern Kenya faces extreme drought regularly [GALLO/GETTY]\n\nEconomist Arthur Kimani agrees. \"The government needs to help the community understand that beyond drinking the discovered water, money can also come out of this resource by, for instance, using the water to grow cash crops.\"\n\nAn official in the Ministry of Environment, Water and Natural Resources says the community will soon be receiving the new-found resource.\n\n\"In fact, the Turkana people will get water in the next two weeks. We are also engaging the private sector for partnerships that are economically viable to the community.\"\n\nSamuel Kimeu, executive director of Transparency International, Kenya, says transparency in the management of natural resources is needed in the entire extraction chain. He says not doing so compromises \"the terms of the licenses against the public interest, thus swindling the public of possible revenue\".\n\nKimeu insists that government involvement is key to managing the groundwater supply. He adds that there needs to be public participation in agreeing how this will be done.\n\n\"Many companies tend to work with a small clique of well-connected people to come up with an opaque system of declaring the outputs of what has been extracted and revenues,\" Kimeu says.\n\n\"The formulas of sharing revenue should be openly agreed upon to create the opportunity for public participation and discourage public officials from seeking personal benefits at the expense of the public, particularly the immediate community living in areas where the natural resources have been found.\"\n\nA version of this story first appeared on Inter Press Service News Agency",

  "latent_9705": "The ultimate price ... Dave Duerson in his 1988 heyday. Credit:Getty The Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy - a research facility so clunkily named that it’s unsurprising Duerson used a semi-accurate abbreviation, ‘‘the NFL’s brain bank’’ - sits in the pleasantly green and airy grounds of the Bedford VA medical centre in Massachusetts, about an hour’s drive outside Boston. It was set up three years ago by concerned former athletes who joined forces with Boston University scientists to grapple with the long-term effects of concussions on sportsmen and women, soldiers and other people subjected to brain injuries. Security is tight as you enter the building through heavily bolted metal doors. We pass rooms lined with shelves of jars carrying human brains pickled in formaldehyde. At the end of a corridor, we arrive at a small room into which several stainless steel refrigerators have been packed, one of which is marked: ‘‘Feet first. Head by door.’’ In this morgue the world’s largest bank of athletes’ brains is being stored on dry ice. It has grown exponentially in the past couple of years to include 75 brains, mostly of American football players but also of hockey enforcers - the tough guys who do the bare-knuckle fighting - and of former soldiers caught in bomb blasts. A further 400 living athletes have promised to donate their brains upon death, including some of the biggest names in their sports. They include ‘‘Irish’’ Micky Ward, the boxer played by Mark Wahlberg in the film The Fighter, and American footballers Matt Birk (Baltimore Ravens), Lofa Tatupu (Seattle Seahawks) and Sean Morey (Arizona Cardinals).\n\nHard knocks ... Duerson playing for the Chicago Bears in November, 1988. Credit:Getty Dr Ann McKee, a neuropathologist who jointly heads the lab, retrieves a brain from a plastic container and places it carefully on a workbench. At the request of the family, she will not tell me who the brain belonged to, other than to say ‘‘he was a very skilled NFL player, very well known’’. If you were a fan of American football, I ask her, would you know the name? Dave Duerson holds up his drivers' licence after signing to become an organ donor. Credit:Reuters ‘‘Right,’’ she replies.\n\nMcKee is a world expert on chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a progressive degenerative disease similar to Alzheimer’s in its symptoms - memory loss, irritability, mood changes - but with its own distinct pathology. The disease has long been recognised: it was first described in 1928 and for many years was thought to be confined to boxers, hence the name ‘‘punch drunk’’ syndrome or ‘‘dementia pugilistica’’. But in the past three years, largely as a result of the work of McKee’s brain bank, it has come to be seen as a danger to anyone who suffers repetitive concussions. Their father killed himself and they really didn’t understand why. Now ... they know why. McKee begins her examination of the unidentified football star’s brain by turning it in her surgically gloved hands with the tender concentration of a fruit-lover inspecting a pineapple. ‘‘It’s too small for an adult male’s brain,’’ she says. ‘‘There’s shrinkage pretty much throughout the brain.’’ Using a long knife, she cuts the organ sideways - from ear to ear, as it were - so that the front half is separated from the back. The sliced surface glistens under the morgue’s neon lighting. The dissection reveals three huge holes in the brain - one large triangle right in the centre of the brain, and two ovals parallel to each other at the base. It is apparent that McKee, who has studied more athletes’ brains than probably any other person, is shocked by what she sees.\n\n‘‘This is an extreme case,’’ she says, ‘‘but it is also very characteristic.’’ She points to the triangular hole, consisting of the lateral ventricles, and says it clearly shows ‘‘tremendous disruption’’. There should be a membrane separating the two ventricles, but it has been so battered by the footballer’s repeated blows to the head that only the thinnest of filaments is left. The two oval holes are the ventricles of the temporal lobe and they too are extremely enlarged to compensate for tissue lost from the lobes themselves, another classic sign of having your head bashed repeatedly. ‘‘The temporal lobes are crucial to memory and learning and you can see they are very, very small, as miniaturised as possible.’’McKee takes a deep look at the cross-section of this brain and momentarily appears sad. ‘‘This is a brain at the end-stage of disease,’’ she says.\n\n‘‘I would assume that with this amount of damage the person was very cognitively impaired. I would assume they were demented, had substantial problems with their speech and gait, that this person was Parkinsonian, was slow to speak and walk, if he could walk at all.’’ Without being melodramatic about it, I say, you are holding in your hands an example of the price that is paid for being a professional footballer at the top of his game. She hesitates a second. ‘‘At least in this case, yes,’’ she says. As a kid, Duerson was an exceptional all-round sportsman who could have pursued a career in baseball or in basketball. But it was football that he loved best. He started playing the game aged eight and carried on through school and into the celebrated football college, the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, picking up numerous awards along the way. He had 24 full seasons before he hung up his boots. He tended to play strong safety, a key position at the back of the team that is the last line of defence. He would be lined up against the big offensive players on the opposing side, men who can weigh 135kg and whose job it is to drive and grind their team forward. It was Duerson’s job to stop them, even if that meant crunching head first into the human equivalent of a brick wall.\n\nIt was when he was playing for Notre Dame at the Sugar Bowl, the annual showcase of American college-level football in New Orleans, that he met his wife of 25 years, Alicia. She wasn’t interested in football. But she was instantly struck by him the first time she saw him at a party. ‘‘Dave could walk in and capture a room. He had a lot of charisma, he had a lot of magic to him. He was 1.8m, but the way he carried himself he seemed like a bigger guy,’’ she says when we meet in Chicago. They married in 1983 after he graduated with a degree in economics. He had thoughts of going to law school or entering politics, but the draw of a professional career in football proved irresistible and he was selected to play for the Chicago Bears that same year. Alicia and their four children attended every game. It was hard watching him take a battering in such a physical contact sport, but he was tough and competitive and she comforted herself that it was usually Duerson who delivered the pounding. ‘‘He wasn’t taking the hits, so much as giving them out.’’\n\nBut over the 11 years he played as a professional, the family can recall at least 10 concussions that he suffered on the pitch. That’s the bare minimum, as he may have had many other knocks to the head that weren’t registered. ‘‘He never came off the field and would always continue to play, so a lot of times I wouldn’t learn ’til after the game,’’ Alicia recalls. Duerson would tell her: ‘‘I took a strong hit to the head, I’m a little dizzy, let’s drive home,’’ and would try and shake it off. ‘‘Back then it was a man’s game,’’ she says. ‘‘Gladiator. Ra, ra. He’d say he felt nauseous and need to rest, and go and lie down for a while.’’\n\nWithin days, sometimes hours, he’d be back on his feet and back on the field. For a long time, everything Duerson touched turned to gold. On top of his two Super Bowls, he was declared NFL Man of the Year in 1987 and NFL Humanitarian of the Year the following year. After he retired from the game in 1993 the successes continued. He refreshed his economics degree with a business course at Harvard and entered the food business, purchasing three McDonald’s franchises in Louisville, Kentucky, before setting up his own business, Duerson Foods, supplying sausages to chains. When times were good, they were very good. They owned a house in Highland Park, a leafy town on the shore of Lake Michigan north of Chicago. They travelled the world, flying Concorde. But from around 2005, almost a decade after he had given up football, their fortunes started to turn. It was such a slow process, like watching a child grow, that Alicia hardly noticed at first.\n\nIt started with Duerson making bad business calls in a way that was unlike him. ‘‘He was making hasty decisions. A lot of things that would come natural to him wouldn’t any more. He started to lose his ability to function, to think things clearly through,’’ Alicia says. The business started to suffer, profits to fall and debts to mount. At the same time, Duerson himself began to decline. He had severe headaches with increasing frequency. He would have sharp mood swings, happy one moment, sad or angry the next. He would lash out verbally at those around him. Small things annoyed him, particularly his own inability to do simple things. He would get lost going to places he had been to umpteen times before, as his memory started to fail. Then in February 2005 he was charged with assault after he attacked Alicia in a hotel room in Indiana; she had to have hospital treatment. They separated two years later. By then Duerson had lost everything, not just his marriage. Duerson Foods went bust and he went bankrupt. They had to surrender the house. The celebrity lifestyle that the Duersons enjoyed on the back of his NFL days had entirely vaporised. He took that hard. ‘‘David was so disappointed in himself,’’ Alicia says.\n\n‘‘He was a very proud person, and he couldn’t handle the failure of it. We had built this beautiful life together, and he lost it all.’’ It took McKee about two months to carry out her investigation into Duerson’s brain. The process involved taking many slices of crucial areas of his brain and staining them with a fluid that highlights the buildup of abnormal proteins. The slices are then turned into slides for microscopic study. McKee pulls up photographs of the slides on her laptop. They look like images you might find on Google Earth showing a satellite picture of an island whose coastline is broken up with deep inlets. Much of the coastline and several of the inlets are stained a dark brown. This indicates the presence of tau, an abnormal protein that forms in the brain as a result of a trauma or injury often caused by a blow to the head. McKee explains, the accumulation of tau in nerve cells clogs them up and eventually kills them, and over the years it can spread to neighbouring cells and shut them down too, progressively destroying the brain’s function. ‘‘This amount of damage in a 50-year-old is really profound, it’s huge,’’ McKee says, pointing to the brown inlets on Duerson’s slide.\n\n‘‘To show this degree of degenerative disease at that young age is quite extraordinary.’’ The areas of Duerson’s brain in which she found the accumulations of tau matched perfectly Alicia’s description of his deterioration: there was damage visible to the inferior and dorsal frontal lobes that are crucial in regulating impulsive behaviour, and in the amygdala, which controls emotions such as rage. ‘‘With this kind of injury I would expect the person to display exaggerated and at times assaultive responses,’’ she says. Duerson’s fear, that so many years of taking blows to the head on the football field were catching up on him, was confirmed under the microscope. He did indeed have CTE at an advanced stage. McKee stresses that Duerson’s donation of his brain in a suicide note was not something that they would wish repeated in any way. It was a tremendous tragedy.\n\n‘‘Our first and foremost concern is that in no way do we want this to happen to any other individual. There’s actually great hope for people who are concerned about themselves - this is a very slow-progressing disease and our understanding of CTE is growing every day.’’ But the diagnosis helps understand why Duerson ended his life the way he did. Of the 50 cases that have so far been diagnosed as having CTE at the brain bank, no fewer than 10 of them killed themselves, while others died in strange and violent ways such as wild car chases, gun accidents or drug overdoses. For Alicia Duerson, her former husband’s diagnosis has given her some comfort. ‘‘I’m really glad for our kids, it’s brought closure. Their father killed himself and they really didn’t understand why. Now they know he was sick, they know why.’’ Looking back on all the years on the football field, she’s angry that nothing was ever said about the dangers.\n\nThe NFL has in recent years begun to take CTE seriously, amending its rules and bequeathing the Bedford VA brain bank $1m to fund its research. ‘‘We were never educated about brain injuries,’’ Alicia says. In Duerson’s heyday, she recalls, if a player took a knock, the coach would hold up two fingers and say ‘‘how many can you count?’’, the player would say ‘‘three’’ and the coach would send them back on to the field. ‘‘They treated it like a joke,’’ Alicia says. ‘‘But that wasn’t a joke.’’ Loading\n\nGuardian For help or information visit beyondblue.org.au, call Suicide Helpline Victoria on 1300 651 251, or Lifeline on 131 114.",

Cory Booker (N.J.), the Senate’s only black Democrat, to offer the Redeem Act, aimed at getting juveniles with criminal records back on track. It would automatically expunge the records of nonviolent offenders younger than 15.\n\nAnother bill with Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy (Vt.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, would give judges greater flexibility in sentencing for federal crimes. A measure sponsored with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) would restore voting rights to nonviolent ex-felons. Another piece of legislation, the Reset Act, would classify some drug crimes as misdemeanors and eliminate the sentencing disparity between cocaine- and crack-related offenses.\n\nHis Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration (FAIR) Act would restore the constitutional protection against seizures without due process of law, a practice the American Civil Liberties Union argues goes “hand-in-hand with racial profiling.” He also has legislation with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that would create tax and regulatory incentives for businesses to set up shop in impoverished areas. Paul touted the proposal during remarks to the Detroit Economic Club.\n\nAt the White House picnic last week, Rep. Lacy Clay, the Democrat who represents Ferguson, Mo., approached Paul about working together on the Redeem Act. Clay is also interested in teaming up with Paul on the bill limiting seizures of property from people suspected but not convicted of crimes.\n\nIn the wake of the civil unrest in Ferguson, Clay said the U.S. justice system is on trial, and black voters “want to hear from candidates who can address the issue of having one set of law for all Americans, in other words, equal justice.”\n\nHe says Paul could make surprising gains among black voters, if he were to square off against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential contest.\n\n“At this point, the African-American electorate is looking at all the potential candidates and making a decision based on who works on their behalf,” he said. “Whoever advocates that is going to get African-American votes.”\n\nRepublicans have struggled to connect with black voters in presidential elections. In the most recent presidential elections, the GOP nominee has secured only 5 percent, 1 percent, 7 percent and 3 percent of the black vote, according to Gallup.\n\nPaul was critical of the police response to predominantly black protesters, after a white police officer shot an unarmed black teenager in the St. Louis suburb.\n\n“Anyone who thinks race does not skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention,” Paul wrote in an op-ed for Time magazine.\n\n“Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth,” he wrote.\n\nBut other members of the Congressional Black Caucus insist Paul cannot overcome ingrained antipathy toward the GOP, which they say has been made worse by its sustained assault on the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Paul was not invited to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s annual legislative conference, which begins Wednesday.\n\n“You’re looking not just at the candidate, but you’re looking at the party and the party’s practices and its principles overall. It’s mostly the Republican Party that has been pushing the limits on federal voting rights, the federal voter ID law and eliminating early voting. Those things that would free and help folks to vote,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.).\n\n“The things that he would have to do to get a Republican nomination are the very things that would prevent the black folks from supporting him,” he added.\n\nIn 2010, Paul attracted controversy for remarks he made about the Civil Rights Act in relation to property rights. Paul has since said his comments were misconstrued.\n\nPaul has made a concerted effort to reach out to black communities in the past year.\n\nHe helped open a Republican National Committee office in Detroit geared toward outreach to minority voters and delivered speeches at the Urban League in Cincinnati and at Howard University, a historically black college.\n\nLast week, he attended a forum on governing solutions for urban America with two black Republicans, former Reps. J.C. Watts (Okla.) and Artur Davis (Ala.).\n\nMembers of the black caucus, however, say Paul needs to focus more on changing his own party’s inclination to cut social programs.\n\n“It’s hard for people to take it seriously,” said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), a former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nHe criticized the GOP for trying to cut funding to Pell Grants, which are important to black students. Paul says he wants to eliminate the Department of Education but keep Pell Grants.\n\nCummings also cited Republican opposition to the Voting Rights Act.\n\n“Whether it’s fair to him or not, he gets painted with a very broad brush,” he said. “That’s his biggest problem. He’s part of a party that is not seen as supportive of African-Americans and their children.”\n\nRep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), also former chairman of the black caucus, said it would take years for black voters to overcome their distrust of the GOP.\n\n“He’s trying to send out a signal that he wants to represent more than one segment of the population, and that’s good, but the problem is. it’s going to take three or four elections during which candidates of the Republican Party embrace the kinds of issues he’s embracing and more before African-Americans come to the conclusion that he may be serious,” he said.\n\nBrian Darling, an aide to Paul, said, “If people can dispassionately look at what Rand Paul’s doing and take away the party label, I think they’d be very happy with it. But sadly politics has crept in, and the Democratic Party has put a target on Rand Paul’s back, and they’ve really been going after him. ... They see that he’s promoting real reforms, and it bothers them that members of their own party are joining hands with Rand Paul,” he said.a",

The new card is supposedly a response to AMD’s R9 290X, while replacing a GTX 780 at the same price point.\n\nA member of XtremeSystems forums posted a screenshot of 3Dmark11 benchmark with three scores with GeForce GTX TITAN, AMD Radeon R9 290X and supposedly the GTX 780 Ti.\n\nAccording to this data the GTX 780 Ti would be faster than both cards by few percents in 3DMark 11 (Extreme Preset):\n\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 TI: X5204 (100%)\n\nX5204 (100%) NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN: X4924 (94,6%)\n\nX4924 (94,6%) AMD Radeon R9 290X: X4664 (89,6%)\n\nThe leaker also revealed that is sample is equipped with 6GB memory, we are probably looking at GeForce GTX TITAN refresh with faster clocks. From the information I received it looks like GeForce GTX 780 Ti will consume more power than TITAN, since power section has been redesigned and manufacturers were notified about this change.\n\nSo you are probably wondering how many CUDA cores does GTX 780 Ti have. The rumor has it that we are looking at 2688 cores. Of course 2496 is also possible, but it’s just a speculation. And if you are also wondering why I didn’t post that GPU-z screenshot from Chinese forums, it’s because it was fake.\n\nThe leaker also revealed that the launch may happen even sooner than expected. Does NVIDIA feel threatened by R9 290X? Well I can tell you that even manufacturers had no idea about this card before it was announced, the decision to launch it was made very quickly, that’s also why they cannot make a completely new card, rather than redesign existing model (TITAN).\n\nThe next two weeks should be full of GeForce GTX 780 Ti information so stay tuned for more.\n\nPossible GeForce GTX 780 Ti specifications GeForce GTX 780 Ti GeForce GTX TITAN GeForce GTX 780 Radeon R9 290X GPU Codename Kepler GK110 Kepler GK110 Kepler GK110 Hawaii XT GPU Process 28nm 28nm 28nm 28nm GPU Config 2688 : 224 : 48 2688 : 224 : 48 2304 : 192 : 48 2816 : 176 : 64 Video Memory 3GB / 6GB GDDR5 6GB GDDR5 3GB GDDR5 4GB GDDR5 Memory Bus 384-bit 384-bit 384-bit 512-bit Base Clock 950+ MHz 837 MHz 863 MHz 800 MHz Turbo/Boost Clock 1000+ MHz 876 MHz 900 MHz 1000 MHz Memory Clock 1750 MHz 1502 MHz 1502 MHz 1250 MHz Effective Clock 7008 MHz 6008 MHz 6008 MHz 5000 MHz Bandwidth 336 GB/s 288 GB/s 288 GB/s 320 GB/s Power Configuration 8+6 Pin 8+6 Pin 8+6 Pin 8+6 Pin TDP 270 W 250 W 250 W 300W MSRP $649 $999 $649 $549\n\nSource: XtremeSystems\n\nby WhyCry Tweet\n\nPrevious Post\n\nHIS launches Radeon R7 250 iCooler with Boost Clock Next Post\n\nAMD Radeon R9 290 (non-X) gaming performance leaks out\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",

  "latent_10144": "Shutterstock\n\nMost of us know we could make improvements to our finances. But we’re either not sure where to start, or we’re worried about the time and effort that might be required to make the changes. So we tell ourselves we’ll take a closer look at our money “someday.”\n\nMeanwhile, we waste precious time (time that could be spent saving and building up our wealth) and any existing problems grow even larger. So, by the time we finally face the facts, we can find ourselves with a tangled money mess of debts and missed opportunities that are difficult, and costly, to unravel.\n\nWant to avoid that situation? We’ve pulled together six simple steps you can take to make sure you’re on track—and stay on track—to reach your financial goals.\n\nSave before you have a chance to spend\n\nIf someone gave you $500 and told you to spend it right away, what would you buy? Gene Natali, Jr., senior vice president at C.S. McKee, a Pittsburgh-based investment firm and co-author of “The Missing Semester,” often poses that question when he speaks in front of audiences. “The point is that spending money is easy and immediate and, with technology, it’s effortless.”\n\nSaving money, on the other hand, is much harder for most of us to do. To save like a pro, set up self-billing for savings. “Some financial institutions let you arrange automatic withdrawal from your checking account to a savings account,” says Kevin Gallegos, a consumer finance expert and vice president of operations for Freedom Financial Network. “Record this expense like a bill every month to painlessly accumulate savings.”\n\nYou can up your savings game, too, by putting that money in an investment vehicle, where you have the potential to earn a lot more than the interest you can earn in a savings account. (Speak with a financial adviser about the best choices for you.)\n\nLive ‘as if’ before you upgrade\n\nBefore you close the deal on a major purchase, like a new home or car, live as if you’re making the new monthly payments for three months to ensure you can truly afford this upgrade, suggests Denise Winston, a financial expert in Bakersfield, California, and author of “Money Starts Here! Your Practical Guide to Survive and Thrive in Any Economy.”\n\n“If you’re upgrading your lifestyle—say going from $1,000 in rent to a $1,500 mortgage payment, put the extra $500 in a savings account,” suggests Winston. “You’ll soon know if you can afford the extra amount each month.”\n\nAnother big benefit of putting away this extra money: You’ll be contributing even more to the down payment on whatever biggie item you’re purchasing. “It’ll be a great feeling to have that $1,500 you saved to help close the transaction,” she says.\n\nDon’t overpay in bank fees\n\nYou shouldn’t ever feel married to your bank. If you’re feeling like your bank fees are getting out of control, do some research.\n\n“Ask for the bank’s ‘schedule of fees,’” Winston says. “Otherwise you can easily get blindsided with unexpected fees. A monthly service fee might seem small at $10 a month but that adds up to $120 per year,” Winston says. “Wouldn’t you rather do something else with that money?”\n\nIn addition, pay close attention to overdraft protection. When you open an account, the bank will ask you if you want to opt in or opt out of it. If you opt out that means your bank will deny transactions that will overdraw your account (when you don’t have any money in your account). If you opt in, the bank will ‘cover you,’ but each time you’re overdrawn, it will cost you $35 on average, she says. Ouch.\n\nAnd, while it isn’t easy changing banks—the more products and services you have, the harder it is—it’s worth the effort if you’re losing a lot of money to fees that you could save at a competing bank or credit union.\n\n“The bank wants you to have lots of products so if something goes wrong you’re less likely to leave,” Winston says. “It’s called a cross-sell ratio and bankers have a goal they have to meet.”\n\nTake interest in your interest rates\n\nQuick: Do you know how much you’re paying (or could be) in interest on your loans and credit cards? If not, it’s time to pull out your most recent credit card statements. Why? Worst-case scenario: Let’s say you owe $5,000 on one credit card, can only afford the minimum payment and the card has a 20 % interest rate. It will take you more than 50 years and $27,000 to repay the original $5,000, says Natali—more than five times the amount you borrowed!\n\nThe type of interest rate you have is also important. If an interest rate is “floating,” that means it changes based on an underlying rate that can go up and down. (Specific to student loans, your statement should indicate if it’s ‘fixed’ or ‘floating.’ If not, call your loan provider to clarify.)\n\n“This is great when interest rates are going down, but it’s worth knowing that interest rates are currently at generational lows and the likely next step is up,” Natali says. If it’s fixed, that means it doesn’t change over the life of the loan. Keep in mind that you can always consolidate student loans to under one fixed rate.\n\nUltimately you don’t want to have any debt. But if you do need to take some on, make sure you’re paying the lowest interest rate possible.\n\nKnow what your health plan covers\n\nIf you’re the family breadwinner—or if your spouse is on your health insurance plan—you’ve probably already felt the sticker shock that comes with your monthly premium. “It’s never been more important to pay attention to what your plan covers, not just for your health but for the health of your spouse and, perhaps someday, a child,” says Dan McElwee, a certified financial planner and executive vice president at Ventura Wealth Management, a financial planning firm in Ewing, New Jersey.\n\nIt may feel like a strain, but it’s always a good idea to set aside money for health care before you even decide to have children. Starting a new savings account or earmarking more money toward health care costs six months out will help you rest easy about all the new costs on the horizon.\n\nSave now for later\n\nWe probably don’t need to tell you this (right? right?) but if your company provides an employer-sponsored 401(k) retirement plan, sign up. Now. And make sure to contribute at least as much as your company will match, if there’s a matching program available. “Even if you’re only setting aside a small amount, every bit helps,” says McElwee. “I always advocate investing in a 401(k) as soon as you’re eligible. Saving early allows for both accumulation and compound return.”\n\nNo matter how old you are or how much you’ve saved already, it’s never too late to start saving. Just contribute a little more each month to make up the difference.\n\nAnd if your company doesn’t offer a 401(k), consider setting up a Roth IRA or, if you’re self-employed, talk to a financial planner about setting up a SEP IRA.\n\nRead these related stories:\n\nHow to build wealth at every stage of your life\n\n11 money mistakes you probably don’t know you’re making\n\nGet the most bang for your budget",
  "latent_10187": "After three walk-outs, sit-in, they compete in state festival\n\nBy Diane Bukowski\n\nDETROIT – As the music, arts and drama programs of Detroit Public Schools are eliminated, some students are not taking it lying down. Members of Southeastern High School’s choir won authorization to compete in the Michigan School Vocal Music Association Choral Festival, held Mar. 11, but only after students walked out three times and held a press conference Mar. 9.,\n\n“We’ve been practicing for this whole year, but then they took our music teacher away a month ago, and we were disqualified,” said Porsha Jackson, a soprano vocalist and president of the choir. “Robert Bobb doesn’t care about us, about the young people. We study hard all day, and music is our outlet. I have a music scholarship; we just want our music program back.”\n\nDuring the press conference, Leroy Lewis was notified by Southeastern’s Principal, Sean Vann (brother of the Rev. Edgar Vann), that he would after all authorize the choir to compete despite the lack of their teacher. Lewis said he and several other students had gone to the principal’s office after the press release went out.\n\n“I’m in the choir and drama, and they both were cut,” Lewis, who is a tenor singer and wants to be an actor, said. “But we’re prepared to keep fighting. We want a first-class education just like students in the Grosse Pointe schools. It’s not just Southeastern. It’s all the schools, even Detroit Science and Arts (DSA), which have had their arts programs cut. We already had a series of three walk-outs of about a hundred students, and a sit-in at Southeastern. DPS police maced the kids in the sit-in. heavily. We don’t have anything, the classes are full, and they’ve laid off all but three of our English teachers, but we’re planning more fightbacks.”\n\nDPS police appeared on the scene in the midst of the press conference, ready to force the students off the covered porch of the school into heavy rain, but the police eventually backed off and left.\n\nLewis said funding for Southeastern’s robotics team, which ranks number three in the state, has also been cut. Go to\n\nhttp://wn.com/Robotics_at_Michigan_State_University to watch robotics teams in action.\n\n“Music is my life,” Nicole Smith said. “I have lived and breathed music ever since I was six years old. Once they take out music, how are we going to relieve our stress? They’re messing up our credits and everything.”\n\nWhile the choir students were speaking, members of the Frederick Douglass Junior ROTC team joined the group. They said they had been denied permission to use the gym for their weekly Wednesday inspection, despite the fact they have been using it at that time for a year.\n\n“The principal tried to hold us back from the JROTC academic competition too, but he had to back off because we wrote a letter,” said JROTC student Ryan Fielder. “We are done with being treated like we are worthless, like our talents and aspirations don’t matter or like all we are is a low score on a standardized test. We are the equals of every other student in Michigan and have a right to a decent education and to be treated with respect.”\n\nMonica Smith (shown above at left in earlier protest at WSU), an organizer for By Any Means Necessary (BAMN) was at the press conference with the students. She said that as a result of their press release, an organization had volunteered funds for the choir’s bus to the Mar. 11 competition, which was to be held at St. Joseph Episcopal Church in Detroit.\n\nShe also said that the students’ choir teacher, who was transferred to Catherine Ferguson Academy but only works four days a week there, volunteered to act as their conductor at the competition.\n\nThe elimination of music, drama, ROTC, robotics and numerous other programs all over DPS, as well as the closing of 100 schools and massive lay-offs, are included in the revised deficit elimination plan for DPS for 2011-14, which has been approved and is being enforced by the State Superintendent of Schools. (See story to be published tomorrow on details.)\n\nBut all the students at the press conference left afterwards to go to a meeting to plan further actions against this assault on the children of Detroit.",
  "latent_10189": "When this newspaper published the Premier League team of the first half of the season as judged by its readers, the identity of the player with the highest rating of all came as something of a surprise. Stuart Holden was only just making a name for himself in Bolton, never mind the rest of the country, but Guardian readers were in good company. David Moyes, Mick McCarthy and Owen Coyle only required a brief glimpse of the American in action to be convinced he would make it in England, and all three played a part in helping Holden overcome a series of setbacks to succeed.\n\n\"I wouldn't say I have made it yet,\" the 25-year-old midfielder says modestly at Bolton Wanderers' fog-bound training ground. \"It's nice to get some recognition, but in some ways I still feel I am only just starting out.\"\n\nHolden is in his second spell in England, the first, at Sunderland, having come to naught six years ago through no fault of his own. The club getting promoted was bad enough, he was still waiting to make his Championship debut without the added pressure of a step up to the Premier League, but what sealed his fate was an unprovoked attack in a late night Newcastle taxi queue that left him with a fractured eye socket. Holden had impressed McCarthy, his manager, in a six-month stay, but he was left with little option but to return to the United States and resume his career with Houston Dynamo.\n\n\"David Moyes and Alan Irvine put in a good word for me initially,\" he says. \"They saw me in the Milk Cup in Ireland with the US Under-20 squad and offered me a trial at Everton. They were flying high in the league at that time and didn't have an immediate place in the squad for me, but said I had done well and recommended me to Sunderland. I'll always be grateful for Mick McCarthy giving me the opportunity. The reason it didn't work out was a combination of my unfortunate injury and the team getting promoted.\"\n\nHolden, who holds a British passport as a result of being born and brought up in Aberdeen, performed well enough for Houston to break into the USA national side but, after four years back in Texas, his dream of playing in England was beginning to fade. Then a call came that unexpectedly brought him closer to home than he could ever have imagined. His parents moved to Texas when he was 10 but his paternal grandparents have always lived in Hindley, a small town between Bolton and Wigan. Naturally they followed his career in America but Holden now plays his football so close to where his family is from that his grandfather can pop along to watch him.\n\n\"My grandpa comes to every game he can,\" Holden explains. \"He really likes his football and he offers me a critique after every match. I love that. I'm proud of my heritage and remember my upbringing in Scotland but I have spent the majority of my life in the States, all my teen years and the years I most vividly remember, so I feel that's my country. That's home, that's where I imagine I'll be heading back to once this English adventure is over. I represented the United States at international level and I'm proud every time I put on the American shirt. If I could plan my career ahead, which is something I've already learned you can't really do, I would play football in England until I retire then return home to start a family. For the moment though, it's really nice to have my grandparents and my cousins so close. I wasn't expecting that.\"\n\nCoyle was the Burnley manager when he offered Holden a trial after seeing him on TV. \"The gaffer had seen me playing against the [Los Angeles] Galaxy, it was a semi-final and I had quite a good game,\" Holden says. \"Owen Coyle told my agent he liked me but said he'd need to see me train for a week with the team before doing a deal. So I got on a plane, 1 January last year, to head for Burnley. I got to my hotel and discovered training was not going to take place because of snow. The following day, still snowed in, I found out the gaffer had left Burnley for Bolton.\n\n\"I didn't quite know what to do next. My agent was trying to get Owen Coyle on the phone, to find out what was going on, everything was suddenly in limbo. I didn't know if my trial was on or off. I knew the gaffer liked me as a player but I didn't know if he'd want me around on day one at Bolton. He did, though, and his first day at Bolton was mine too. As he was introducing himself to the players he introduced me to them as well. I just went along with it, I don't know what the guys were thinking, but I knew I had to work hard and make a good impression, so that's what I did. After a couple of weeks I was offered a short-term contract and everything went from there.\"\n\nIt went far from smoothly. Holden had just managed to break into the Bolton side when, playing a friendly against Holland in March as part of the USA World Cup preparations, an ill-judged tackle of the type that earned Nigel de Jong the nickname \"Lawnmower\" left him with a broken leg. That not only put back his Bolton progress, it left him struggling to make the World Cup. He was picked for the squad but only managed a few minutes as a substitute in the opening game against England. He had not fully recovered and was beginning to think luck would always be against him.\n\n\"The night I got the result of the x-ray I just remember thinking: 'Not again',\" he says. \"I had just played my first game for Bolton. I seemed destined to suffer a major setback every time I was playing well enough to get noticed. I was really down but the next morning the gaffer called me when I was flying back to England and told me the club intended to pick up the option on my contract for a further year. For me that was a big lift.\"\n\nHolden is now almost as close to De Jong as he is to his grandparents, though only in a geographical sense. \"I had a thigh strain when we played Man City so I haven't played against him since the injury,\" he says. \"We exchanged a few words when we both did a charity event a couple of months ago but sorry was not among them. My leg was never spoken about. It's up to him whether he wants to apologise, I have had to put the matter behind me. It's better to move on than hold grudges. I would not accuse him of intentionally trying to break my leg, I would just describe it as a reckless tackle. There was a lot of controversy, but you do get reckless tackles in football sometimes.\"\n\nLike De Jong himself, Holden plays with a robustness that belies his size. He hardly conforms to the perceived Bolton stereotype yet has quickly become a crowd favourite at the Reebok despite, or maybe because of, his lack of height and muscle. Surprisingly slight of frame, no one would ever mistake him for a rugby player. \"I might be small but I'm not afraid of tackling or getting about the field,\" he says. \"I like to get on the ball and pass it quickly, and you don't need to be the biggest of guys to do that. As long as you are tactically aware and strong when you go into a challenge you can compete at this level.\"\n\nThe challenge of playing against some of the best teams in the world has inspired him to put in performances that have caught the attention of many. Another tough test awaits against Chelsea on Monday. \"I have always supported Manchester United and playing against greats like Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs was amazing. You don't forget you are up against top players, but at the same time you must regard it as an opportunity to showcase your own ability. We'll be hoping to play in the same way against Chelsea, get them on the back foot if we can. As a player the Premier League is the environment you want to be in. You have great fans, great atmosphere, even the climate is perfect. It might not be so good for living in, but it's just right for running around on grass.\"",

Ron Rivera is adorable right up until the second he punts on 4th-and-1 and Mike Shula starts ordering 13-step drops against Von Miller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour quarterback: HERO.\n\nYes, it’s Shirley Temple addict Cam Newton. This Panthers team is molded in Cam Newton’s image, which means everything has to go exactly right, and exactly as envisioned, or else everyone ends up sulking and bitching for MONTHS. The sturdiness of Cam’s psyche is inversely proportionate to the sturdiness of his body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet’s go back before the Super Bowl, when the Panthers were still an undefeated 13-1 and the Falcons handed them their first loss. These whiny assholes brooded like Christian Bale on a movie set after that game, and it wasn’t even a meaningful loss. One little hiccup and Cam and his team are suddenly as composed as I am after 10 minutes of unsuccessfully trying to reboot the wireless router. WHY WON’T IT WORK?! I’M GOING TO SHOOT MYSELF AND MAKE ALL OF YOU WATCH ME DIE. [Tears out hair clumps].\n\nAt some point this season, Carolina will face adversity and it’ll all break down again, because they are the lamest group of wannabe tough guys in football. Who the fuck drag races with hoverboards? They can’t even threaten Odell Beckham with baseball bats properly. They’ll choke, and Cam will remain one degree separated from every potential hot take known to man. Colin Kaepernick sits for the anthem because CAM HAS ALREADY MADE DISRESPECT FASHIONABLE. Perfectly cromulent thesis, imho.\n\nBy the way, this summer Cam gave an interview to my GQ colleague Zach Baron and promptly covered his ass eight different ways…\n\nDo you have an opinion on Donald Trump? “I don’t. I think he’s an unbelievable businessperson. That’s probably it.” Did you vote for the North Carolina governor that enacted that bathroom law? “Um…that’s too personal. You know, I gain nothing by answering it.” In January, right before the Super Bowl, you said: “I’m an African-American quarterback that may scare a lot of people because they haven’t seen nothing that they can compare me to.” “I don’t want this to be about race, because it’s not. It’s not. Like, we’re beyond that. As a nation.” You really think so? “Yeah.”\n\nBy the end of this season, the Brady mind-wipe will be complete.\n\nWhat’s new that sucks: The statue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are a lot of things I hate about the NFL: Roger Goodell, Packers fans, Dan Snyder, the greater Boston area during any winning or losing streak, Lamar Miller’s uneven fantasy production, etc. There is nothing I genuinely hate more than this statue celebrating Panthers owner and human frown Jerry Richardson. It’s grotesque. I’ve never seen an object in greater need of toilet paper and egg yolks. I want US Special Forces to invade North Carolina, liberate its bathrooms, melt this fucking thing down, and throw Jerry Richardson into it.\n\nDid you know Richardson got this statue for his 80th birthday? Of course he did. For your grandpa’s 80th birthday, he got a 50-percent decrease in Medicare benefits from Pat McCrory. But when you’re Jerry Richardson and it’s your birthday, your millionaire chums—probably using funds from team coffers—buy you a fucking statue surrounded by literal panthers and then post it at the stadium entrance so that every paying customer has to look upon your works and despair. This man is everything wrong with our country. Fuck him.\n\nAnd fuck him twice over for letting Josh Norman go. They didn’t bother to sign Norman to a long-term deal, or keep the franchise tag on him for at least a year, or figure out a way to trade him. They just let a vital piece of a title-contending team walk because, in Jerry Richardson’s worldview, anyone who maybe kinda sorta possibly might fancy himself bigger than the team is a threat to be neutralized. Keep in mind Richardson is the guy who said he forbade Cam from getting any tattoos or piercings on his body if he wanted the team to draft him. Meanwhile, he’s a got MONUMENT of himself sitting out there, and can’t see the irony. In Jerry Richardson’s America, he is the head coach, and everyone else is the presumed beneficiary of his scheme. I want this team to fumble away every Super Bowl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll right, what else happened? Oh, Kelvin Benjamin is now healthy enough to get injured again and make Ted Ginn your horrifying default choice at No. 1 wideout. Cam had a kid and literally named it Chosen. The Supreme Court had to act so that black people in this state could actually vote. Kony Ealy got caught running the Trump University of dog breeding. Greg Olsen won’t dab because he secretly hates the rest of the team. Mike Tolbert is still fat.\n\nWhat has always sucked: Michael Oher! Strap on those skates, amigo!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOher got extended this offseason, by the way. I’m elated. You and I both know that this was an average team disguised as a great one last year. With Oher still around to get Cam killed, and without Norman to anchor the secondary, and with Jonathan Stewart due for a torn meniscus any day now, Carolina will revert back to the norm and become the same, miserable, 8-8 club you never have to worry about. Given the year North Carolina has had, it’s better than those fans deserve. Oh, and your stadium now has upgrades. Like bomb-sniffing dogs! Quite the amenity.\n\nAlso, fuck your airport. That place is a prison.\n\nWhat might not suck: The front seven is still pretty solid, which was part of the reason this team felt they could let Norman go. They felt wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet’s remember some Panthers:\n\n-Rae Carruth\n\n-Fred Lane\n\n-Greg Hardy\n\n-Dwayne Jarrett\n\n-Kerry Collins (back when he was racist)\n\nHear it from Panthers fans!\n\nDavis:\n\nWe lost the biggest game in franchise history to a team that started a puddle of cartilage and bone tissue at quarterback. Also, fuck Greg Hardy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliam:\n\nIn Week 14 last season we beat Atlanta in Charlotte to move to 13-0. Walking to my seats prior to kickoff I passed a guy wearing an Emmitt Smith jersey, a boy wearing an Eli Manning jersey and a woman wearing a Clay Matthews jersey.\n\nJohn:\n\nI’ve been a Panthers fan since their inception when I was at Ft. Bragg and found them fun to watch. I dreamed of a Super Bowl and thought we had it last year watching Cam tear up an admittedly soft NFC South. Then he meets Von Miller and proceeds to shit his pants for 4 quarters. Then he fumbles and acts like he saw a fucking snake on the field instead of the ball. Now I get shit from Cardinals fans. The fucking Arizona Cardinals. Let that sink in. Fuck you Cam. Fuck you Arizona. You’ve crushed my will to live.\n\nAndrew:\n\nThe Panthers suck in part because of the teenagers I teach (in North Carolina, mind you) who ask if I’m a bandwagoner because I cheer for the Panthers. I sat through the 1-15 2001 season—my mother bought me a Panthers sweatshirt for Christmas that year and apologized to me when I opened it—but I have to be a bandwagoner because 90% of the fanbase will evaporate the next time the team goes 8-8. The Panthers suck because half the fanbase was not sold on Cam Newton until he led the team to the Super Bowl, while the other half still isn’t sold on Cam Newton because he didn’t win the damn thing. The Panthers suck because they have existed for 21 seasons, have won 3 straight division titles, but still have not ever put together 2 consecutive winning seasons. Lastly, the Panthers suck because they tie the Carolinas together, like South Carolina is something to be proud of. The last time South Carolina was important to the course of this country, people were allowed to own other people and the South Carolinians threw a bitch fit when it was suggested that maybe that wasn’t OK anymore. Make fun of South Carolina sometime, they’ll ask if you’ve been to Charleston. Charleston is a haughty, overpriced town so far up its own rectum that it should be renamed East San Francisco. The only reason to go to South Carolina is to purchase fireworks that go more than 3 feet off the ground, which are illegal here because the North Carolina state legislature is too busy protecting us from the gays to allow any sort of fun within the borders of our fair state. In conclusion, fuck the Panthers.\n\nMitch:\n\nWe have fans that wear sweater vests to the games and PSL owners that sell all their tickets to opposing fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoey:\n\nPeople in the Carolinas only came to realize this team existed last year. Cam Newton and Luke Kuechly are the only players anybody knows. Anytime a white person makes a play on defense the crowd will scream, “LUUUUUKE” no matter who it was. Cam is one bad game away from every white trash fan demanding we bench him for Derek Anderson or go out and see if Jake Delhomme has anything left in the tank. People won’t stop fucking dabbing. We have to share a team with South Carolina. The owner looks like Mr. Magoo. I had to sit and watch the Panthers lose in what was quite possibly the most boring Super Bowl ever. The one time Cam didn’t recklessly jump headfirst into oncoming defenders was during a fumble in the Super Bowl, fucking bullshit.\n\nBrendan:\n\nDon’t be surprised when the Panthers look average because we are playing teams like Arizona and KC instead of teams like Jacksonville and Tennessee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGerald:\n\nHopefully I’ll be alive when they go to the Super Bowl again in 10 years and lose that one too. I’m one of 12 Panthers fans who actually is from Charlotte. The rest are just Steelers and Bills fans who hopped on the Dabbin’ Bandwagon last winter. The city’s fair-weather fans made buying a new T-shirt a bitch when there was a run on team gear, and nothing was on sale because everybody in Charlotte has too much expendable income and won’t stay with a team that’s losing. Also, Steve Smith will never have his number retired in Charlotte as long as Gettleman is there. Otherwise, classy organization, so sez Peter King.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevin:\n\nFuck Jerry Richardson. Our offense put together one of the most pathetic displays ever in the Super Bowl. I love Cam and have since his first season but when things go wrong with him there’s no chance he turns it around in a game. With most top tier QBs they can have a terrible start to a game and you can still hope they turn it around for one or two drives to pull out a win. Not Cam. I don’t know a single optimistic long-term Panthers fan. We all just expect the good young teams to collapse and then to go through a half-dozen 6-10 seasons. On the field the team isn’t really all that spectacular, despite last year’s success. The OL is garbage (we all know Oher is going to suck balls going forward), the secondary is trash (can you even name a single guy back there?) and almost all of our pressure comes from DTs. We all know Thomas Davis is nearing retirement and then it’s basically Kuechly, Short if they can resign him, and a bunch of nobodies. But most of all seriously fuck Jerry Richardson.\n\nJeffrey:\n\nWhile the first 18 games of last season were a fantastic joy ride, do not forget that this is essentially the same team that “won” a division at 7-8-1 in 2014, only with a slightly upgraded set of retread OTs who impersonated turnstiles and blocking sleds for 60 minutes in the Super Bowl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott:\n\nI was 5 when the Panthers first became a team, not 20 miles away from my parents’ house. I had barely started understanding what sports were, and here I had been graced by the football gods to not only have a team of my own to root for, but the possibility of seeing them play in person. My little 5 year old brain was blown. A team for me to call my own! What a miracle! Surely they would one day win the Super Bowl, and I could say I was a fan from Day 1! They did OK at first, then started to suck quickly. I watched Chris Weinke just up and leave for the Titans. I had a surge of hope in 2004, then Kasay shanked a kick and the goddamn Patriots won it instead. But hey, they made the playoffs in 2009, surely they could- oh, wait, no, Delhomme threw 6 fucking interceptions to the Cardinals. Hey, look! They’re the #2 seed in the NFC in 2013! Maybe with a bye week, they can- oh, fucking hell. God damn Seahawks. I was losing hope. I hadn’t bought a Panthers Jersey in years. But then, a light at the end of this (admittedly brief) tunnel. The Panthers have started 4 and 0! Now they’re 10-0! 14-0! They could make histo- wait, the fucking Falcons? You stomped them 2 fucking weeks ago! OK, it’s not that bad, 15-1 is still a phenomenal record. Whooo! We beat the Seahawks! Damn, we looked awesome against the Cardinals! Could we do it? Could we actually win a Super Bowl? Could my 5 year old self’s dream come true? Could we- OHGODDAMNIT, FUCK! NO! WHY DID YOU DO THAT!?!?!?! NO NO NO NO NO. I thought the Panthers were a gift from the football gods, but it turns out there are no football gods. They were a lie, just like Santa and the Easter bunny and happy endings. All this god damn, hair pulling, ultimately worthless sack of shit team is a way to make clinically dead Jerry Richardson a few more million dollars. I hate this team. I wish with all my heart that the 1995 expansion committee had selected Las Vegas, or Mexico City, or the fucking moon instead of Charlotte.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdam:\n\nIt’s hard to complain about a team that went 15-1 until you remember our owner has been dead for 10 years. Every time they show Jerry in his box I want there to be a little man with a stick poking him in the arm to prove to me he’s alive. I see Jerry was given his own statue with him holding out a football next to two panthers. That’s the kind of reward you get for going toe to toe with Peyton Manning in the great GET OFF MY LAWN duel of the 2011 Lockout. Asking Peyton if he knows how to read a revenue chart when your only experience doing the same involves Excel sheets of Hardee’s franchises from the 1980's is kind of a dick move. This is a guy who hired Dom Capers and John Fox. John Fox said a punt is a good play 10 years ago and we haven’t forgotten that. People forget our Offensive Line is 3 traffic cones and some knuckle tape, but that hasn’t stopped the mouthbreathers from predicting a 25-0 run this season because Kelvin Benjamin is coming back. The knowledge that we’re not called the Charlotte Panthers is the saddest fact in sports. The fact that Jerry has laid out plans to move the team upon his death is the best unkept secret in sports, because no one besides local boy and Hardee’s icon Jerry Richardson would ever put professional football in Charlotte. The only thing we have going for us is rooting for a dead guy to stay alive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJake:\n\nFebruary 7, 2016 was supposed to be the happiest day of my life. The day that our transcendent quarterback ascended to prove all the idiots and racists who have doubted him wrong, And then he went and fucked it up and proved every mouth-breathing dipshit racist Carolina fan right. Fuck this team and fuck Jerry Richardson with his batshit insane Two Panther statue.\n\nGabriel:\n\n1. Our lack of tradition is so palpable that the newest stadium addition is an additional TWO angry panther statues standing next to one of our team’s owner. 2. I live in Chicago and there is no bar that is willing to even take a swing as a Carolina Panther bar. The Panthers’ bar in DC was permanently closed after 5 people were stabbed. Not that many people went before last year, anyway. 3. We lose Super Bowls in psychologically traumatic ways. First, the Shyamalan twist of a kickoff out-of-bounds to lose to Tom Brady, then the slow blunting to death by Peyton Manning? 4. Cam or Luke will get hurt, we’ll lose half our games, and the team will become an afterthought to the headlines of the NBA removing the All-Star game and our legislation passing a bill that all homosexuals will have to wear blue hats. Goddammit.\n\nMichael:\n\nI didn’t think anything could be worse than the SUPER BOWL® against the pats. Then we went and lost to the reanimated corpse of Peyton Manning. Fuck this team AND their new giant panther statutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndrew:\n\nI moved to Denver from Raleigh in November and was giddy that, as I constantly reminded all of my dickbag HB2-loving friends, “None of my hometown teams will even be in the same conference with Denver teams! I can have a whole new world of casual fandom!” Welp, fuck all that shit. I guess drinking enough alcohol to not feel outside temperature anymore is how I handle a Super Bowl loss. Good to know. I hope the man I saw who spent ten minutes roaming around Safeway the week after screaming OMAHA like a goddamn lunatic got leprosy. I hope every man, woman and child I see in Broncos championship gear when I’m out hiking (they legally require you to do that here, I’m pretty sure) falls off the nearest cliff. I hope Von Miller suffers a career ending injury in a tragic chicken farm stampede. Most importantly, I hope insurance covers my broken hands after I punch 14 brick walls when Cam shreds his ACL in front of my own tortured eyes here in this shitass town in Week 1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichard:\n\nYou can’t be the “dab on them folks, too bad they don’t make band-aids for feelings” guy, then get all butthurt when you shit the bed and everyone rubs your nose in it.\n\nJohn:\n\nThe Panthers offense was non-existent in that Super Bowl. Fuck them and our especially our O-line for that embarrassing performance. We had Luke Kuechly, Thomas Davis, Kawann Short, Josh Norman (fuck), and the rest of our amazing defense just waiting to hold things down once we finally got that lead the offense was going to get us. In the end, all they got to do was watch Peyton Manning and his half-arm wheeze his way through a bunch of three-and-out series to his second Super Bowl ring. Orange is a fucking terrible color for a fan base of full of air-deprived hill people. It looks even worse when those same chuckle-fucks are smiling and hugging while sitting next to a bunch of schmucks in black and blue who traveled twice as far to beat the same game, only to see their team turn into back into the pumpkin it was before the season started. Our owner looks like Grumpy Cat. Fuck him and his new statue.\n\nSubmissions for the Deadspin NFL previews are now closed. Next up: Denver Broncos",

The follicle unit is transplanted to the site affected by androgenic alopecia for treatment.\n\n*3 In the hair cycle, the hair follicle repeats cycles of regression and growth at certain intervals, resulting in the renewal of the hair shaft. The follicle formed during the fetal period undergoes regression due to apoptosis, and the follicle dermal papilla cell interacts with the epithelial stem cell, resulting in the regeneration of the variable part of the follicle (hair bulb). The hair cycle of human hair on the head spans 3-7 years.\n\n*4 Most organs are formed from a primordial organ, an organ or tissue in its earliest recognizable stage of development following interactions between epithelial stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells during the fetal period. Because organogenesis occurs during the fetal period, the epithelial / mesenchymal stem cells that have the potential for creating organs are considered to be present only during the fetal period, except for the hair follicle.\n\n*5 Organ primordium technology is a three-dimensional cell manipulation technology for the regeneration of an organ primordium developed in 2007 by Takashi Tsuji and his research group. In this technology, an organ primordium is regenerated by the high-density segmentation of epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells and their subsequent reconstitution within collagen gel.\n\n*6 Induced pluripotent stem cells.\n\n*7 The skin organ system is the largest organ system in human body and is composed of follicles, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, epidermal tissue, dermal tissue, and subcutaneous fat tissue.\n\n*8 RIKEN constructed this facility to enable industry-government-academia cooperative research. Located in Kobe City, Japan, operation began in 2015.\n\nKyocera Corporation (President: Goro Yamaguchi), RIKEN national science institute (President: Hiroshi Matsumoto) and Organ Technologies Inc. (President: Yasuhiro Sugimura) announced today a partnership to develop technologies and products for treating alopecia (hair loss) through the regeneration of hair follicles. The companies aim to put the technologies into practical use in 2020.Common types of hair loss include androgenic alopecia, congenital alopecia, cicatricial or “scarring” alopecia, and telogen effluvium alopecia among women. Currently, it is said that there are more than 18 million patients with alopecia in Japan alone. Because alopecia can influence the quality of life, many diverse treatments, including hair growth formulas, hair loss inhibitors and autografting of individual hair follicles, have been utilized with mixed results. Because no existing treatment — not even surgical autografting — can increase the number of hair follicles, any viable method of regenerating hair follicles has great potential to succeed where other methods fail.The Laboratory for Organ Regeneration (Team Leader: Takashi Tsuji) of the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology (CDB) has demonstrated that the regeneration of many organs, including teeth, hair follicles and secretory glands, is functionally possible. The hair follicle is the only organ known to regenerate repeatedly after birth (hair cycles). In 2012, the research team isolated epithelial stem cells and follicle dermal papilla cells (mesenchymal stem cells)from the follicles of mature mouse whiskers and body hair and used them to develop a technology for the regeneration of follicular primordium by utilizing an “organ primordium technology” previously developed by the same team. Transplanting the regenerated follicular primordium into hairless mice results in the growth of regenerative follicles, thus demonstrating the feasibility of hair shaft regeneration. The transplanted primordium also forms connections with surrounding tissues (arrector pili muscle and nerves) and repeats normal hair cycles. Furthermore, this method allows control of the hair color by adding pigment stem cells, and the number of hair follicles regenerated, elevating its potential for the aesthetic treatment of alopecia. In addition, the RIKEN research team has succeeded in using iPS cells*6 to regenerate functional skin organ systems*7 in mice , including all follicles, sebaceous glands, and skin tissues, thus leading the world in organ regeneration technologyKyocera, RIKEN and Organ Technologies plan to establish cell culture and transplant technologies and develop devices for transplantation, aiming to put the technologies into practical use for the treatment of human alopecia in 2020 in Japan. The RIKEN Integrated Innovation Building (Kobe City, Hyogo Prefecture) will serve as a base for this joint research.Kyocera will lead technical aspects such as the development of cell processing devices, by utilizing its microfabrication and manufacturing technologies which have been cultivated for over 50 years. RIKEN and Organ Technologies will be responsible for the development of follicle-derived stem cell culture / amplification technologies and cell manipulation technologies for clinical application in humans, establishment of production processes, implementation of preclinical studies and other roles.Follicular regenerative medicine will focus on the collection of stem cells from the patient’s own hair follicles, followed by the processing of these follicles and autografting on the same patient. For the treatment of androgenic alopecia (the most common type), a small number of hair follicles will be collected, from which stem cells will be isolated, cultured and amplified to produce hair follicle germ by the established organ primordium method. The regenerated hair follicle germ will be packaged and delivered to a medical facility for use in transplantation therapy for the patient.With the goal of Kyocera becoming the commissioned manufacturer for this method through cooperation with Organ Technologies, the joint research partnership plans to pave the way for commercial viability within a research period of two years, followed by the materialization of the business model of commissioned manufacturing.",

  "latent_10463": "Eric Fehrnstrom, a top aide and political strategist to presumptive Republican presidential candidate former Gov. Mitt Romney (MA), made headlines earlier this year with a gaffe comparing Romney in the primary fight to an “Etch a Sketch” that you can flip over and shake and start over with as a blank slate in the general election. Before he was an adviser to Romney, Fehrnstrom was a political columnist for the Boston Herald. According to a profile in GQ, in 1992, he outed recently-elected Massachusetts Rep. Althea Garrison (R) as a transgender woman, effectively ending her political career.\n\nTo Mara Keisling, director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, the malicious outing and the presence of Fehrnstrom on Romney’s staff is simply unacceptable.\n\n“Privacy for transgender people is a matter of survival, physical and economic survival,” Keisling told Raw Story, “Once you out a trans person, you can’t just ‘Etch a Sketch’ it away.”\n\nFehrnstrom made his name in Boston as a “blue-collar conservative” columnist whose hard-hitting style got him moved from sports reporting to the political beat at the Rupert Murdoch-owned Herald, which was the splashy, tabloid-style counterpart to the more staid Boston Globe. He and his fellow reporter Howie Carr brought what GQ called a “nasty and resentful” tone to the paper’s political reportage, making the Herald a kind of perfect weapon against the 1988 Democratic presidential nominee, gormless former Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis.\n\nIt was for a local official, however, that Fehrnstrom reserved one of his nastiest political hits. Althea Garrison was a Boston politician and activist who was elected as a Republican to the Massachusetts state House in 1992. Two days after her election victory, Fehrnstrom published an article in the Herald announcing that Garrison had been born male.\n\n“I can remember his glee when he found the birth certificate,” said a former Herald reporter named Robert Connolly.\n\nGarrison’s career in politics was over. Speculation had previously gone around the community about Garrison’s gender status, but after Fehrnstrom’s story, it became her defining characteristic to the media. In every mention of her name in the press, her performance as a House member was overshadowed by her gender identity. Howie Carr, who is now a conservative talk show host, wrote in the Herald not long after the outing, “I’ve always liked Althea. She has a big heart. Not to mention big feet. And very, very big hands.”\n\nThe outing of Althea Garrison raises serious questions about the culture of the Romney campaign, where Fehrnstrom operates as a privileged member of the command team and as Romney’s longest-serving, most-trusted political strategist. It has been said that if Karl Rove was “Bush’s brain,” then Fehrnstrom is “Romney’s balls.”\n\nMara Keisling told Raw Story that Ferhnstrom’s campaign against Garrison is “just more bullying. It’s an invasion of privacy. We’ve had five or six hate murders of trans people across the U.S. just in the last six weeks.” She said that these kinds of tactics represent the worst form of transphobia, describing it as “putting people at risk just because you get your jollies from it.”\n\nAlso, in recent days, stories of violent, homophobic “pranks” during Romney’s prep school years have come to light, incidents which the candidate claims not to remember, but for which he issued a shallow, blanket apology, “There’s no question that I did some stupid things in high school and, obviously, if I hurt anyone by virtue of that I would be very sorry for it and apologize for it.”\n\nTo Fehrnstrom, on the other hand, the careers and reputations he savaged were of little consequence. In a 1999 article he wrote for Boston magazine, he said, “In my trade, politics was never personal. Hell, people were rarely people — they were ducks in a shooting gallery.”\n\nAlthea Garrison herself refuses to speak about the experience of being outed by Fernstrom. Raw Story reached her by telephone, but when the former state representative realized that the person on the phone was a reporter asking about Fehrnstrom, she ended the discussion.\n\n“I don’t have time for this today,” she said, and hung up.",
  "latent_10484": "Above is an image of a potential 2013 Vibram FiveFingers model called the Capri. This leather-clad toe shoe is probably the dressiest, most professionally-inspired FiveFingers so far.\n\nHas the time finally come for a five-toed dress shoe for men? A fine Italian-inspired FiveFingers model just might make its way to the market in 2013 ... if we're lucky.\n\nToday's news comes from a release related to the 2013 Pitti* that includes the lone photo (seen above) of a potential Spring 2013 Vibram FiveFingers model presumably for men called the FiveFingers Capri. Constructed with a shiny leather upper and traditional, professional shoelaces, the Capri is looking like it will be the dressiest toe shoes ever made.\n\nMeanwhile, the Capri features a sole that first made its appearance this past Spring (but not in the United States) via the FiveFingers Sorrento (Stay tuned for a review on the Sorrentos from Robert, who snagged a pair via a European retailer).\n\nHere's the press-release from Vibram.com — note the language used reads a bit like a translation (presumably from Italian):\n\nThe new models of spring summer collection, on show at Pitti Immagine 82 (Florence, July 19-22), collection HALL CAVANIGLIA, BOOTH 28B: The model \"Capri\" is the ideal choice for who loves spending time outdoors: the top quality upper in full grain leather, the holes located on the fingers to enhance breathability, the full leather lining and the classic lacing system for easy fit, makes these shoes make the indispensable ally when the mercury rises considerably.\n\nFrom the Naples island to the exclusive French coast: \"Nizza\" is a shoe that was born for relax moments, to enjoy strictly in comfort. Made of soft full-grain and full leather lined, this model presents the “indianino” stitching with fringe, which makes it particularly suitable for a female audience.\n\nOh and what's the mention of the FiveFingers Nizza? Well, given the strange translation (What is \"indianino\"?) and the indication it's for women, your guess is as good as mine.\n\nWhat do you think about the FiveFingers Capri? Would you pick up a pair and wear them with slacks to work? Want them in black?\n\nI definitely want a pair. I've gotten to wear around some pre-production Sorrentos over the last few months and find them to be comfortable and stylish. I dig the sole design you get with the Sorrento (and Capri) which is probably slightly less ground feel than a pair of KSOs with incredible (better than KSO/Classic) toe flexibility. I get a ton of positive comments on them and I think we really missed out in the U.S. by not carrying the line.

  "latent_10587": "Actor told she was over the hill in her mid-30s, as Hollywood finds itself under increased scrutiny for its failure to represent women fairly on screen\n\nMaggie Gyllenhaal was told by a Hollywood producer that she was too old, at 37, to play the love interest of a 55-year-old man, the Oscar-nominated actor has revealed.\n\nIn an interview with The Wrap, Gyllenhaal said her shock at finding herself “over the hill” in her mid 30s soon segued into derision fostered by the farcical nature of the situation.\n\n“There are things that are really disappointing about being an actress in Hollywood that surprise me all the time,” she said. “I’m 37 and I was told recently I was too old to play the lover of a man who was 55. It was astonishing to me. It made me feel bad, and then it made feel angry, and then it made me laugh.”\n\nHollywood's love affair with old dudes romancing young women Read more\n\nThe commonplace practice of casting a much younger female against a much older male has been prevalent since Hollywood’s golden age: Kim Novak was half the 50-year-old James Stewart’s age during filming of 1958’s Vertigo.\n\nRecently, new Bond movie Spectre won praise (not least from the actor herself) for casting 50-year-old Monica Bellucci opposite 47-year-old Daniel Craig. However the movie’s other two “Bond girls”, Léa Seydoux and Stephanie Sigman, are both in their late 20s, and the long-running spy saga has also made a habit of pitching 007 against love interests half his age. Roger Moore, then 57, romanced 29-year-old Tanya Roberts in the Englishman’s final outing as Bond, 1985’s A View to a Kill.\n\nHowever, Hollywood finds itself under increasing scrutiny in 2015 for failing to represent women fairly on screen and behind the cameras. Earlier this month, the American Civil Liberties Union announced it would demand that state and federal agencies investigate why major studio regularly fail to hire aspiring and seasoned female directors for movies, citing “rampant discrimination” in the industry. Meanwhile, a report by the Center for the Study of Women in Television, Film & New Media at San Diego State University found that female actors took just 12% of leading roles in the top 100 domestic-grossing films of 2014.\n\nSicario film-makers faced demands to change female lead role to a man Read more\n\nAt the Cannes film festival earlier this week, the makers of drug-war thriller Sicario revealed they had at one stage been under pressure from producers to rewrite the lead role, a female FBI agent played by Emily Blunt, to make the character male. And research last year found that only 22% of crew members involved in making 2,000 of the biggest-grossing films over the past 20 years were female.\n\nGyllenhaal told The Wrap that despite her recent experience - she did not name the production nor the older male star - she remained hopeful that Hollywood was slowly becoming a better place for women to work. “A lot of actresses are doing incredible work right now, playing real women, complicated women,” she said. “I don’t feel despairing at all. And I’m more looking with hope for something fascinating.”",
  "latent_10589": "Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger is the third main game in Chris Roberts' Wing Commander science fiction space combat simulation video game series, developed and released by Origin Systems. It was a departure from previous games in the series in that it uses extensive live action full motion video to add an interactive movie-style presentation to the space combat gameplay, emphasized by its advertising slogan, \"Don't watch the game, play the movie!\".[2] The game's more than two hours of video featured a number of prominent movie stars including Mark Hamill as Colonel Christopher \"Maverick\" Blair, Malcolm McDowell as Admiral Tolwyn, John Rhys-Davies as James \"Paladin\" Taggart and Thrakhath nar Kiranka, and Tom Wilson as Todd \"Maniac\" Marshall.\n\nGameplay [ edit ]\n\nScreenshot of typical first person gameplay while piloting a ship.\n\nWing Commander is a space combat simulator intercut with live action cutscenes. Gameplay involves completing missions and destroying enemy craft, Wing commander III dispensed with the issuing of medals after such missions and relied more on cutscenes to drive the story along making much more use of CD technology. As the man giving the orders, Blair often gets to choose what ship he will fly, what missiles it will carry, and what wingman (wingmen) he will take with him. As in Wing Commander, some wingmen can be killed permanently in combat. Blair's own call sign remained customizable.\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nThe protagonist of the previous two games is officially assigned a name, Colonel Christopher Blair. Thrakhath nar Kiranka, Crown Prince of the hostile Kilrathi Empire, presides over the execution by disintegration of a group of Terran Confederation prisoners of war. One, however, is left alive: Blair's lover Colonel Jeannette \"Angel\" Devereaux, due to her status among the Kilrathi as a respected warrior. On the planet Vespus, Blair and Brigadier General James \"Paladin\" Taggart inspect the downed wreckage of the TCS Concordia. The carrier is a total loss.\n\nIt is the year 2669, and the Terran-Kilrathi War has been going for over thirty years, with no signs of stopping. Blair, by orders of Admiral Geoffrey Tolwyn, is transferred as Wing Commander to the TCS Victory, a Ranger-class carrier twice as old as Blair. Her captain, William Eisen, has been with her for many years, and is proud of his ship. There are a few old faces—Colonel Ralgha nar \"Hobbes\" Hhallas, and Major Todd \"Maniac\" Marshall—but all the other pilots and staff are people Blair has never met. Among those on board, Blair meets Lieutenant Robin \"Flint\" Peters and Chief Fighter Technician Rachel Coriolis.\n\nThe Victory is assigned to the Orsini System, away from the front. Shortly after Blair's arrival, test pilot Major Jace \"Flash\" Dillon arrives on board the Victory with his prototype warcraft, the F-103A Excalibur heavy fighter. When Flash fails to respond to an attack on the Victory, willfully napping through the crisis, Blair commandeers the Excalibur in defense of the Victory and, in an ensuing argument with Flash, accuses him of being a coward and repeatedly insinuates that he has no flying skills. This angers Flash who challenges Blair to a simulator duel. If Blair wins the duel, he forces Dillon to request reassignment to the Victory's flight wing. Immediately afterward the Victory is rerouted to the Locanda System, where the Kilrathi are deploying a potent pair of new weapons: the \"Skipper\" cruise missile, equipped with a cloaking device, and a genetically-engineered bioweapon for use against the Locanda colonies, the home of Flint. Blair and his wing are scrambled to defend Locanda against several of these missiles. Even if Blair destroys the missiles, Flint breaks formation and attacks the Kilrathi forces in an act of revenge. The player is given the option to follow her, though she returns safely in either case.\n\nThrakhath appears with a squadron of Pakthan bombers and taunts the Victory over subspace radio, calling Blair \"the heart of the tiger;\" the Confed pilots gather the Kilrathi have bestowed this name on him as a sign of respect. Admiral Tolwyn rendezvouses with the Victory, escorted by several destroyers. Tolwyn is responsible for the escort and defense of the TCS Behemoth; an extremely large vessel (essentially a titanic particle accelerator with engines) capable of destroying a planet. Following a successful field test of the Behemoth in the Loki system, the Victory jumps to Kilrah and Tolwyn prepares to use the Behemoth on the Kilrathi home world. Thrakhath's forces attack the Behemoth. A traitor aboard the Victory has transmitted targeting data to the Kilrathi revealing the Behemoth's weakpoints, and the Behemoth is destroyed. Thrakhath then challenges Blair in single combat. He taunts Blair with a recording showing how he personally disemboweled Angel after her colleagues were disintegrated. Blair's instinct is to accept, but Lt. Ted \"Radio\" Rollins warns him that the Victory is leaving the system. When he returns to the Victory, the player chooses between getting drunk or talking to Rachel about his loss. If Blair gets drunk, he must then fly an emergency scramble drunk, with the game controls not responding reliably, making combat virtually impossible.\n\nAfter a retreat to the Alcor System, Paladin arrives. He reveals that before Angel was captured, she transmitted data indicating that the Kilrathi home world is seismically unstable. Paladin suggests a weapon called the Temblor Bomb which, if dropped in the right place, will cause the planet to shake itself to pieces. Before they can complete the bomb, Hobbes kills one of the Victory's pilots, Lt. Laurel \"Cobra\" Buckley, steals her fighter and makes for Kilrathi space with news of the planned T-Bomb attack. Blair has the choice of chasing him or letting him go. If he gives chase, he kills Hobbes, the carrier is attacked, and Lt. Mitchell \"Vaquero\" Lopez is killed in the fight. Either way, afterwards Blair finds Hobbes left a message locker, explaining that he was brainwashed long before he met Blair, and this brainwashing led him to defect to the Confederation. His original personality was reactivated by the code phrase \"heart of the tiger,\" the Kilrathi name for Blair.\n\nBlair has the option to choose to initiate a romance with Flint or Rachel. Flint refuses to fly with him if he chooses Rachel, Rachel refuses to help him with his missile loadouts if he chooses Flint, and both are bitter with him if he chooses neither. Blair launches against Kilrah, with up to three wingmen of the player's choice. This attack comes just as the Kilrathi prepare for a massive and devastating strike against Earth, intending to finally force humanity into submission with the loss of their home planet. After successfully downing Prince Thrakhath above Kilrah (and Hobbes, if he was not killed earlier), Blair descends to the surface and delivers the bomb. The resulting explosion destroys Kilrah and wipes out nearly the entire Kilrathi armada assembled in orbit, but damages Blair's fighter as well; a surviving Kilrathi capital ship tractors him in. Morally devastated by the destruction of their home planet, the Kilrathi, commanded now by Thrakhath's retainer Melek nar Kiranka, surrender to Tolwyn. The surviving Kilrathi begin to colonize a new homeworld and now want to live in peace and harmony with humans while Blair and his romantic interest make plans to start their new lives together.\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nDevelopment [ edit ]\n\nWing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger was developed and released by Origin Systems. Released in 1994 for MS-DOS and Mac OS, in 1995 for 3DO and in 1996 for PlayStation (a Sega Saturn version was also announced[3] and advertised,[4] but it was never released), Wing Commander III made the move from the sprite-based graphics used in previous titles to software-driven texture-mapped polygonal 3D, and used FMV for cutscenes. Wing Commander III featured an entirely new line of ships and fighters, abandoning the technology of Wing Commander and Wing Commander II. Terran Confederation craft were redesigned from \"airplanes in space\", while Kilrathi craft were totally redesigned into asymmetrical ships with prongs, barbs and fang-like surfaces. The new, blockier forms were made necessary by the then-primitive state of polygon graphics, as WCIII was released a few years before the first true 3D video cards and all 3D effects had to be calculated by the CPU.\n\nWing Commander III ultimately cost $4 million to produce.[5]\n\nA number of branching (\"interactive\") conversations allow the player to choose what response his character will give; the choice may affect the other person's attitude towards the character, or even the morale of the entire crew. As such movie content consumes a large amount of data storage, the game was packaged on four CD-ROMs instead of floppy disks, another emerging technology at that point.\n\nA Pentium (then a very high-end processor) was required to get optimum performance out of Wing Commander III. Roberts said, \"We're not afraid to lead hardware sales a little, and we believe that Pentium will soon be the standard.\"[6]\n\nIn June 1995, Atari Corporation realized a deal with EA to bring select titles to the Atari Jaguar CD, with Wing Commander III among the selected games, but this port was never released due to the commercial and critical failure of the Atari Jaguar platform.[7][8][9][10][11]\n\nA novelization by William R. Forstchen and Andrew Keith was published in 1995. A collectible card game adaptation was published in the same year by Mag Force 7 Productions, under the helm of noted science-fiction authors Margaret Weis and Don Perrin. The sequel, Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom, was released in 1996.\n\nAfter the end of the official support by Origin the fan community began to provide support for the game themselves. For instance, the community developed several unofficial patches to enhance the compatibility with newer versions of Windows and newer PC hardware.[12][13]\n\nIn September 2011, the source code of Wing Commander III was handed to the fan community by a former developer for the purpose of digital long-time preservation.[14]\n\nOn September 13, 2011 WC III was re-released on gog.com in the digital distribution.[15]\n\nVersion differences [ edit ]\n\nA number of major changes were made in porting the game to the 3DO. These include:\n\nDifficulty select was removed; the game can only be played at one difficulty, which roughly corresponds to \"Veteran\" in the PC version.\n\nAll stages set on planetary surfaces are cut, and replaced with Full Motion Video cutscenes. Staple mission audio clips (e.g. \"Attack my target\") are used for the dialogue in these scenes.\n\nManual takeoffs are similarly replaced by FMVs. The player starts each mission in open space.\n\nThe left VDU cannot be made invisible.\n\nSeveral enemy types were removed, including all land-based enemies.\n\nA new enemy was added, the gun platform. This enemy is stationary.\n\nThe ejection animation was cut, as was the option to retry the mission after ejecting.\n\nThe player must select a ship as a target in order to communicate with it.\n\nThe bug which prevents the player from accessing the cutscene explaining Hobbes betrayal in the PC version is absent.\n\nThere is a new bug in the first Hyperion mission. Unless all enemies in the mission are destroyed, this mission will register as failed, regardless of whether or not the player successfully used the bomb prototype.\n\nOnly two of the three possible endings of the PC version are accessible. This is because the removal of the planetary sequence makes it impossible to fail the mission in which the Temblor Bomb is planted.\n\nThe scripted deaths of the pilots in the Temblor Bomb mission were cut. Thus, it is possible to complete the mission with all four wingmen remaining.\n\nThe cloaking device works on Hobbes and Thrakhath, and thus the Temblor Bomb mission may be completed without fighting either of them.\n\nThe PlayStation version is much more similar to the PC version, though like the 3DO version it does not carry the bug which blocks off the Hobbes cutscene. Also, unlike either the PC or 3DO versions, it includes considerable load times when navigating the Victory.\n\nNovelization [ edit ]\n\nWhile mostly following the plot outlined above, authors Keith and Forstchen made a number of decisions and changes to increase the tension of the novel. In chronological order:\n\nBlair's Gold Squadron flies Thunderbolts exclusively before transferring over to the new Excaliburs. Green Squadron runs the Longbows, Red Squadron has Hellcats (misprinted as Arrow Interceptors in the book) and Blue Squadron flies Arrows.\n\nFlash arrives, not as a test pilot for the Excalibur, but from the Locanda system as a replacement contributed from a Home Defense squadron. He retains his \"hotshot\" mindset and rank of major, however.\n\nBlair fails to save Locanda.\n\nForstchen-created character Kevin \"Lone Wolf\" Tolwyn makes an appearance as a courier, preparing the Victory for the admiral's arrival. Lone Wolf, now a major, declines to join Blair's wing only because it would pain his uncle.\n\nfor the admiral's arrival. Lone Wolf, now a major, declines to join Blair's wing only because it would pain his uncle.

Flash, flying on Hobbes' wing, is killed in the ensuing fight.\n\n, instead of standing on the 's bridge. Flash, flying on Hobbes' wing, is killed in the ensuing fight. Since Hobbes knows about the Temblor bomb project, there is no question of allowing him to escape. Hobbes uses voice recordings to impersonate Buckley, but when Vaquero (Cobra's wingman) hears what has happened, he engages Hobbes, as per Blair's orders, and is killed just as Maverick arrives.\n\nBlair chooses Rachel.\n\nFlint, Winston \"Vagabond\" Chang and Maniac, the only living Gold Squadron pilots at this point in the novel, fly with him to Kilrah. Vagabond is shot down on the second leg of the journey (though he survives through unspecified means to return in Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom), Flint is killed in space above Kilrah, and Maniac is shot down in the planet's atmosphere. However, Maniac would also return in Wing Commander IV.\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nWing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger was another major hit for the Wing Commander series, the PC versions alone selling over 500,000 copies.[27] It sold over 700,000 copies in total.[5] PC Data, which tracked computer game sales in the United States, reported that Wing Commander III's computer version earned $15.9 million and sold roughly 400,000 copies by October 1999.[28]\n\nA critic for Next Generation gave the 3DO version five out of five stars, chiefly praising the usage of big-name actors in the video cutscenes, which he argued makes the game more realistic and suspenseful and gives a sense that the FMV is enhancing gameplay rather than substituting for a lack thereof. While he noted that the 3DO version lacks the graphical sharpness of the PC version and is less challenging, he concluded that it \"makes a more than acceptable alternative\" for players who cannot afford the expensive hardware required to run the PC version at optimal settings.[22] The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly focused their praise on the high quality of the FMV, which both Al Manuel and Sushi-X said was the cleanest FMV yet seen on either the 3DO or the PC. Ed Semrad and Sushi-X criticized that the control scheme is difficult to master.[18]\n\nReviewing the PlayStation version, a reviewer for Maximum praised the \"intricate\" plot but criticized that the combat is simplistic and dull and that the FMV sequences lack any interaction beyond the occasional multiple choice response.[21]\n\nThe editors of PC Gamer US nominated Wing Commander III for their 1994 \"Best Action Game\" award, although it lost to TIE Fighter.[24] In 1996, Computer Gaming World ranked it as the 54th best game of all time for its \"thrilling space action in the first successful interactive movie\",[25] and the ninth most innovative computer game.[29] In 2011, PC Gamer ranked it 72nd on the list of the 100 best PC games of all time.[26]\n\nEntertainment Weekly gave the game an A.[30]",

Specifically, this amendment would:\n\nRemove the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) limitations on prescription drugs that have been imported from outside the United States;\n\nRequire that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) verify that imported prescription drugs are safe;\n\nBan manufacturers from engaging in actions that reduce the availability of qualifying imported prescription drugs; and\n\nSpecify provisions for Internet purchases of prescription drugs.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) is opposed to drug importation legislation, citing safety concerns, and is on record opposing a similar bill introduced earlier this year.\n\nThe Senate HELP Committee did not pass this amendment: 12 Senators voted NO on the McCain amendment and 10 Senators voted YES. As a result, the version of the health care bill that was reported out of the committee on July 15 did not include this provision.\n\nMAPLight.org's analysis of campaign contributions data reveals that Senators who voted with pharmaceutical manufacturing interests on this committee amendment received almost three times as much money from that industry than those who voted for the amendment. From January 2003 through May 2009, the 12 Senators voting NO on the McCain amendment received an average of $115,116 from the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry; the 10 Senators voting YES received on average $41,975.

  "latent_10659": "I use U.S. census data to perform the first large-sample, nationally representative tests of outcomes for children raised by same-sex couples. The results show that children of same-sex couples are as likely to make normal progress through school as the children of most other family structures. Heterosexual married couples are the family type whose children have the lowest rates of grade retention, but the advantage of heterosexual married couples is mostly due to their higher socioeconomic status. Children of all family types (including children of same-sex couples) are far more likely to make normal progress through school than are children living in group quarters (such as orphanages and shelters).\n\nStudies of family structure and children’s outcomes nearly universally find at least a modest advantage for children raised by their married biological parents. The question that has bedeviled researchers, and that remains essentially unresolved, is why ( Cherlin 1999 ). Some results have indicated that socioeconomic status explains most or all of the advantage of children raised by married couples ( Biblarz and Raftery 1999 ; Gennetian 2005 ; Ginther and Pollak 2004 ), while other scholars have found that family structure has an enduring effect on children net of all other factors ( McLanahan and Sandefur 1994 ; Zill 1996 ). Married couples tend to be the most prosperous type of family unit, and this economic prosperity undoubtedly has certain advantages for children (but also see Mayer 1997 ).\n\nThe debate over same-sex unions and their children draws from and informs a more general literature concerning family structure’s effect on children. The literature on family structure has generally focused on structural variations within heterosexual-parented families, contrasting heterosexual married couples, heterosexual remarried couples, and (presumably heterosexual) single mothers ( Cherlin 1992 ; McLanahan and Sandefur 1994 ). Even though same-sex couples are a small minority of all couples (1% of all couples in Census 2000 were same-sex couples), the inclusion of same-sex couples can provide researchers with more leverage over the key question of how family structure matters in general.\n\nWhat types of outcomes can be expected for children raised by same-sex couples, relative to children in other types of families? The answer is vitally important both for public policy relating to same-sex marriage and adoption ( Eskridge 2002 ; Koppelman 2002 ) and for theories of how family structure matters. Supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage rights agree that the legal issue of same-sex marriage rights should revolve around the question of childhood outcomes for children raised by same-sex couples ( Alvaré 2005 ; Patterson 2002 ). In this article, using data from the 2000 U.S. Census, I examine progress through school—that is, normal progress versus grade retention—for children of same-sex couples compared with children of other family types.\n\nA third relevant comparison for children of same-sex couples are the children living in group quarters because these are the children presumably available for adoption, and because same-sex couples are more likely than heterosexual couples to participate in the adoption market. Some of the difference between children in group quarters and children living with parents and guardians must be due to selection effects: the most troubled children available for adoption may not be adopted and may do poorly in school as a result of emotional or physical disabilities. On the other hand, if gay and lesbian adoptive parents are choosing from the middle or the bottom of the adoptive pool ( Stacey 2006 ), rather than from the population of the most desirable potential adoptees, then the selection effect will be less important. In either case, the census, as a cross-sectional survey, is poorly suited to the analysis of selection effects. Nonetheless, 2000 census data provide strong controls for individual student disabilities, and any comparison between children living with families and children living in group quarters will be made after individual disabilities have been controlled for.\n\nAlong with the standard comparison group of heterosexual married couples, heterosexual cohabiting couples are a second logical comparison group for same-sex cohabiting couples. Both heterosexual cohabiters and same-sex cohabiters are two-parent families living without the rights and benefits of marriage. Certainly, there are differences: for example, heterosexual cohabiting couples can marry if they want to, whereas in the United States at the time of the 2000 census, same-sex couples could not marry. The comparison between children of same-sex cohabiting couples and children of heterosexual cohabiting couples allows for a more specific test of the effect of same-sex parenthood on children, while holding constant legal rights and the number of parents.\n\nThe moral claim for same-sex marriage rests in part on the many practical and psychological benefits of marriage, benefits for which conservative family scholars have made the most careful and enthusiastic case ( Waite and Gallagher 2000 ; Wilson 2002 ). The benefits of marriage, combined with the exclusion of gays and lesbians (and their children) from those benefits, together form one cornerstone of the case for same-sex marriage ( Eskridge 1996 ).\n\nLegal marriage confers a host of protections and advantages to the couples who marry and to their children. Married couples generally share joint legal custody of their coresident children. In a system of employer-based health care insurance, either spouse in a married couple can usually provide health insurance for both spouses and all their children. Marriage is a long-term contract that allows and encourages parents to make long-term investments in their children ( Waite and Gallagher 2000 ). Divorce rights, which are a corollary to marriage rights, provide guarantees for child support and visitation that are intended to minimize the damage of a breakup to a couple’s children. Given the many practical, legal, economic, and social advantages of marriage as a child-rearing family structure, it should come as no surprise that children of long-term married couples have the best outcomes ( McLanahan and Sandefur 1994 ). The various benefits of marriage extend far beyond income, so one would generally expect children in married couples to have advantages, even after socioeconomic status (SES) is accounted for in regressions.\n\nGuo, Brooks-Gunn, and Harris (1996) studied grade retention among urban black children and found that some indicators of parental stress, such as unemployment and welfare participation, were associated with increased grade retention for children; in other words, they found childhood grade retention to be a useful measure of difficulties that the students were experiencing at home. Guo et al. (1996 :218) identified three potential sources of grade retention: “weak cognitive ability, behavioral problems, and lack of engagement in school.” Of these three causes of childhood grade retention, the latter two might be partly associated with the quality of the home environment. Students with learning disabilities or physical disabilities that impact learning are also at risk of grade retention, and this type of grade retention would not be indicative of parenting deficits.\n\nGrade retention (the opposite of normal progress through school) has been increasing in U.S. schools since former President Bill Clinton proposed ending social promotion in schools in his State of the Union Address in 1998 ( Alexander, Entwisle, and Dauber 2003 :viii; Hauser 2001 ). Grade retention is an important childhood outcome because retention in the primary grades is a strong indicator of a lack of childhood readiness for school, and effective parenting is a crucial ingredient in school readiness ( Brooks-Gunn and Markman 2005 ). Brooks-Gunn and Markman argued that the lower school readiness of racial minority children is due, in part, to parenting practices that differ from the authoritative parenting style favored in middle-class white homes ( Baumrind 1966 ; Lareau 2003 ).\n\nUsing data from the U.S. census has several major disadvantages: normal progress through school is the only available children’s outcome, and even this outcome is measured with less precision than one would hope for. Although the census data have several important limitations for the research questions considered here, the strengths of the census data (large sample, national representativeness, and a full array of family structures) address important lacunae in the literature; as such, this study offers a potentially useful new perspective on how family structure matters to children. The census data are far from ideal for the subject under study here, but better data are nowhere on the horizon. 2\n\nTo supplement the existing small-scale studies, I offer a large-sample study of children from the 2000 U.S. census, including 3,502 children of same-sex couples who had been living with both parents for at least five years (2,030 children living with lesbian mothers and 1,472 children living with gay fathers; see ) and more than 700,000 children in Grades 1–8 from other family types. This sample size more than satisfies Nock’s (2001) criteria of 800 as the minimum number of gay and lesbian couples required for statistically useful study.\n\nThe debate over same-sex marriage and gay and lesbian adoption rights revolves around many competing sets of assumptions with political, religious, and ideological axes that cannot be resolved or even fully addressed in this article. To the extent that the debate is empirical—that is, to the extent that disagreement remains over the meaning of the empirical literature on the development of children of same-sex couples—this article offers a new perspective.\n\nAmong the convenience sample studies, several of the most important have been based on samples of women who became parents through assisted reproductive technology (ART; Brewaeys et al. 1997 ; Chan, Raboy, and Patterson 1998 ; Flaks et al. 1995 ). Because individuals who become parents through assisted means can be identified through reproductive clinics—and are therefore easier to recruit than the general population of same-sex couple parents—the literature on same-sex couple parenting has tended to feature studies of the kind of women who can afford ART: white, upper-middle-class women. Nationally representative data tend to paint a different picture: in the U.S. census, same-sex couple parents tend to be more working class and are much more likely to be nonwhite compared with heterosexual married couples.\n\nA third potential weakness of this literature is the narrowness of family structures under study ( Tasker 2005 ). Of the 45 studies listed, only 7 examined the children of gay fathers, and only 2 of these 7 studies had a more traditional family control group built into the study.\n\nA second critique of the literature—that the sample sizes of the studies are too small to allow for statistically powerful tests—continues to be relevant. The mean number of children of gay or lesbian parents in these studies is 39, and the median is 37; both numbers would be slightly lower if studies without comparison groups were excluded. The nationally representative studies in the series found only 44 children who were raised by lesbian couples in the Add Health survey. Golombok et al. (2003) found only 18 lesbian mothers of 14,000 mothers in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, which is why they supplemented this sample with snowball sampling and their own convenience sample. The universally small sample sizes of the studies in the existing literature has left room for several critiques, including the argument that small sample studies would not have the statistical power to identify the effects of homosexual parents on childhood outcomes even if such effects did exist ( Lerner and Nagai 2001 ; Nock 2001 ).\n\nIn 45 empirical studies of outcomes of children of same-sex couples—including all studies listed in Tasker’s (2005) comprehensive survey that examined childhood outcomes, several more recent studies listed by Wald (2006) , all four studies listed by Meezan and Rauch (2005) as the highest-quality studies in this field, 1 and all the more recent studies that cite the earlier ones—none found statistically significant disadvantages for children raised by gay and lesbian parents compared with other children. These studies are listed in table form in a supplement posted on Demography’s Web site ( http://www.populationassociation.org/publications/demography ).\n\nNearly all children of gay and lesbian parents attend schools and live in neighborhoods in which other children overwhelmingly come from families with heterosexual parents. In other words, children of same-sex couples share a common peer and school environment with children of heterosexual couples. To the extent that peer environment is a primary socializing environment for children ( Harris 1998 ; Maccoby 1990 ; for a survey, see Rutter 2002 ), whatever differences sexual orientation of parents makes within the home may well be mediated and diffused by the common peer and school environments that children share regardless of the gender or sexual orientation of their parents.\n\nIn Judith Stacey’s (2006 :39) discussion of gay adoption, she describes the gay men of Los Angeles as having to search through the state’s “…overstocked warehouse of ‘hard to place’ children, the majority of whom . . . have been removed from families judged negligent, abusive, or incompetent. Most of the state’s stockpiled children . . . are children of color, and disproportionately boys with ‘special needs.’” If it is the case that same-sex couples who adopt mainly have access to “special needs” children, the special needs of these children could exert a downward bias on the average outcomes for children of same-sex couples. Fortunately, the census distinguishes between the head of household’s “own children,” adopted children, stepchildren, and foster children.\n\nSame-sex couples become parents in three main ways: through one partner’s (generally prior) heterosexual relationship; through adoption; or through donor insemination or surrogate parenting ( Stacey 2006 ). Same-sex couples cannot become parents through misuse of or failure of birth control as heterosexual couples can. Parenthood is more difficult to achieve for same-sex couples than for heterosexual couples, which implies a stronger selection effect for same-sex parents. If gays and lesbians have to work harder to become parents, perhaps those gays and lesbians who do become parents are, on average, more dedicated to the hard work of parenting than their heterosexual peers, and this could be beneficial for their children.\n\nThe modern reality of same-sex couples raising children long postdates the classical psychological theories of child development (e.g., Freud [1905] 1975 ). Recent research on childhood socialization to gender roles has emphasized peer groups and genetics as much as direct parental influence ( Harris 1998 ; Maccoby 1990 ). In-depth studies of the psychosocial development of children raised by lesbians and gay men has found that these children are normal and well adjusted ( Chan, Raboy, and Patterson 1998 ; Flaks et al. 1995 ; Golombok et al. 2003 ). The existing studies have universally small sample sizes of children, and as I discuss shortly, the literature has critics for this reason.\n\nDATA AND MEASURES\n\nI use age and current grade (variable GRADEATT) from the 2000 U.S. census obtained from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS; see Ruggles et al. 2004) to create a measure of prior grade retention.3 Delayed progress through school (also known as age-grade retardation) is a widely used proxy for prior grade retention (Hauser 2001; Hauser, Pager, and Simmons 2001). A strong correlation between being older than one’s classmates and having been retained a grade in the past can be documented using the October supplements to the Current Population Survey, which has more precise questions about childhood grade retention (although, unfortunately, a much smaller sample size). For example, for 8th grade students in October 2004, 2% of the 13-year-olds had ever been held back a year in school, but 31% of the 14-year-olds had ever been held back (author’s tabulation). The census survey, which occurs 6 months later in the school year (April rather than October), requires a later age cutoff, so I use age 15 as the cutoff age at which 8th graders are considered too old to be making normal progress through school.4 The 2000 U.S. census question about current grade for students collapsed Grades 1–4 into a single category and Grades 5–8 into a single category. Students attending Grades 1–4 can be identified as over-age only if they are too old to be in the 4th grade (i.e., at least age 11), and students attending Grades 5–8 can be identified as over-age only if they are too old to be in the 8th grade (i.e., at least age 15).\n\nThe 2000 census did not include a question about the number of times respondents had been married, so married coresident couples cannot, in general, be distinguished from remarried couples. This problem is mitigated somewhat by the ability of the census to distinguish the head of household’s “own children” from the head of household’s “stepchildren.” The census provides only a cross-sectional snapshot of family structure, which fails to capture the ways in which family changes over time can affect children (Wolfe et al. 1996; Wu and Martinson 1993).\n\nChildren’s tenure within their current family structure can be reasonably assured by limiting the analysis to children and parents who all have at least five years of coresidential stability. If the child and both parents all lived at the same address in 2000 as they did five years earlier, it is likely that the family structure at the time of the 2000 census was also in place five years earlier. For children living in group quarters, five years at the same address indicates long-term residence rather than a brief stay at a shelter. Five years with the same family structure at the same address is long enough to imply that the child’s primary school career through Grade 4, and most of the child’s primary school career through Grade 8, are likely to have been undertaken within the family structure reported to the census in 2000. For children living with single parents, five-year residential stability of child and parent is a bit more ambiguous because we do not know whether or when a partner or ex-spouse moved out of the home.\n\nUnmarried partners were first distinguished from roommates in the 1990 census. For the 2000 census, the Census Bureau changed its long-standing policy by counting self-reported same-sex “married” couples as unmarried partners (Rosenfeld and Kim 2005; U.S. Census Bureau 2001). The recoded “married” couples accounted for roughly one-half of the same-sex partners and 80% of the children of same-sex couples in the 2000 census. The inclusion of the self-reported “married” couples among the same-sex partnered couples is thought to yield a more accurate population count of same-sex couples (U.S. Census Bureau 2001; but see also O’Connell and Gooding 2006).\n\nIn the 2000 U.S. census same-sex couple cohabiting data, self-reported married and self-reported partnered same-sex couples differ in some systematic ways. Not only do the self-reported same-sex married couples have more children than the self-reported same-sex partnered couples, but the self-reported same-sex married couples are more similar to heterosexual married couples along several other key dimensions. For example, the self-reported same-sex married couples are more likely to be white, less likely to be geographically mobile, and more likely to have high incomes (Rosenfeld and Kim 2005). Because the population of same-sex partners in the 2000 census is composed of these two rather distinctive subgroups, every table that includes statistics on same-sex couples and their children includes alternative versions of the same statistics calculated omitting the couples (and their children) whose dual marital status was recoded to indicate whether the results are robust with respect to this underlying diversity.\n\nIn the census data, all married couples are heterosexual married couples by Census Bureau definition. Since the 2000 census, however, several U.S. states and other countries have acknowledged married same-sex couples, so I add the modifier “heterosexual” to “married couples” for clarity.\n\nFirst-Order Predictors of Childhood Grade Retention Because denominator school populations cover four years (Grades 1–4, Grades 5–8), but the students who can be identified as over-age for their grade come only from the last grade of each four-year span (Grades 4 and 8),5 the implied grade retention rate is four times higher than the observed grade retention rate. shows both the observed grade retention rate and the implied grade retention rate for primary school students using weighted data from the 2000 census. suggests that childhood grade retention is correlated with family type. Children of heterosexual married couples had the lowest implied rate of grade retention: 6.8%. Children of lesbian mothers and gay fathers had grade retention rates of 9.5% and 9.7%, respectively. Children of heterosexual cohabiting parents had a grade retention rate of 11.7%, while children of single parents had grade retention rates between 11.1% and 12.6% The differences in childhood grade retention between all types of non–group quarters households were dwarfed by the high rates of grade retention of children living in group quarters. According to , children living in group homes, many of them awaiting adoption or foster parents, had an implied grade retention rate of 34.4%. Children who were incarcerated had a grade-retention rate of 78.0%. Later in this article, I show that the enormous difference in grade retention between children raised in families and children living in group quarters remains even after individual-level student disabilities are accounted for. One way to gauge the advantage of living with families is to note that adopted children (10.6% grade retention) who spent the five years prior to the census living with their adoptive parents and foster children (20.6% grade retention) with five years of residential stability performed considerably better than children who spent the same five years living at a single group-quarters address (34.4% grade retention for noninmates). The performance hierarchy that favors own children, and then (in declining order of school performance) adopted children, foster children, and children in group quarters, confirms the long-standing research finding that children do best when living with parents who make a long-term commitment to the children’s development (Bartholet 1999). Selection bias (wherein the children with the most severe disabilities or children who have suffered the worst abuse are the least likely to be adopted) must also play a role, which unfortunately cannot be quantified with these data. The rest of shows implied grade retention along several other dimensions. Asian American children had the lowest rates of grade retention, and non-Hispanic black children had the highest. Girls were less likely to be held back in the primary grades than boys. Suburban schools had lower rates of grade retention than city schools, which in turn were lower than rural schools. Household SES was a crucial predictor of childhood school performance. In households with income less than $25,000, 12.6% of the primary school students were held back, compared with only 5.3% for children in households with incomes more than $100,000. Householder’s education had an even stronger effect on children’s progress through school: parents who had less than a high school diploma had primary school children who were retained 14.3% of the time, whereas householders with college degrees had children who were retained only 4.4% of the time. shows that the strongest factor in making normal progress through elementary school is living with a family rather than living in group quarters. For children living in a family, whether the family is headed by a heterosexual married couple or by some less-traditional parenting arrangement, the second–most-important factor in childhood progress through school appears to be parental educational attainment.\n\nConsistency With Prior Findings Although the U.S. census data have some limits for the purpose of studying grade retention, the first-order predictors of grade retention from the census are reassuringly consistent with the published research on normal progress through school using other sources. The gender and racial gradients for normal progress through school in are similar to the gender and racial gradients found by the Census Bureau in its analysis of progress through school using data from the educational supplement of the October Current Population Surveys (CPS; Heubert and Hauser 1999:147–54; Jamieson, Curry, and Martinez 2001:3, Table A; Shin 2005:7, Table C). ’s gradients of normal progress through school (versus grade retention) by family type (specifically, single parent versus married parents), household income, student gender, and parental education are entirely consistent with the broad existing literature on grade retention from other data sources, including the following: Dawson’s (1991) study using the 1988 National Health Interview Survey, Tillman et al.’s (2006) study using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, Moller et al.’s (2006:171) results using the National Educational Longitudinal Study, Bianchi’s (1984) analysis of the CPS, and Zill’s (1996) analysis of the National Household Education Survey. I show (in an extended analysis available on request) that the multivariate analysis of grade retention from this same literature is consistent with my multivariate analysis of grade retention using U.S. census data. In all the studies, family SES plays a crucial role in shaping children’s educational experience.",
  "latent_10708": "React-simple-maps is a react component library to help make SVG mapping with d3-geo, TopoJSON, and React easier. One of the strengths of using react-simple-maps is that it gives React full control over the DOM and does not treat the SVG map as a black box. This means that react-simple-maps can easily take advantage of the entire React ecosystem and all the good things that come with it.\n\nReact-simple-maps was partially inspired by the declarative api of Victory charts. If you haven’t heard about Victory , take a look on github, or see the examples and guides on their website.\n\nThe great thing about Victory charts is that it does not have to be used standalone, but that it can be embedded in already existing SVG containers. This makes it possible to combine Victory charts with any SVG visual, e.g. a map ;)\n\nThis tutorial will go over how to combine the two libraries and create the map shown on the cover of this article. If you are just interested in the final code, head on over to the github repo.\n\nHere’s what this tutorial will cover:\n\nAbout the visualisation The repo and the app structure Setting up a basic map (TopoJSON, projection, style) The data Rendering <VictoryPie /> inside <Marker /> components\n\nLet’s get started.\n\nAbout the Visualisation\n\nThe visualisation for this tutorial shows the language distribution in Switzerland by canton. Even though Switzerland has a population of slightly more than 8 million, it has four official languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansh. This results in Switzerland being divided into three distinct linguistic regions, each with its own culture. Romansh constitutes a special case, as it is only spoken by 0.5% of the Swiss population, mostly in the canton of Graubünden.\n\nWhile most cantons will identify predominantly with one language, there are some (Fribourg, Valais, Bern, and Graubünden) that have quite a diverse linguistic environment.\n\nThe Repo and App Structure\n\nIn order to simplify the setup for this tutorial, I will be using next.js to create an app scaffold. To get started, install these dependencies:\n\n$ npm install react react-dom react-simple-maps victory next --save\n\nIn terms of scaffolding, here’s what the app structure will look like:\n\n┬ app\n\n├─┬ data\n\n│ └── index.js\n\n├─┬ pages\n\n│ └── index.js\n\n├─┬ static\n\n│ └── cantons.json\n\n├── node_modules\n\n└── package.json\n\nDon’t forget to add the next dev script in package.json .\n\n// ./package.json\n\n...\n\nscripts: {\n\n\"dev\": \"next\",\n\n...\n\n}\n\n...\n\nSetting up a Basic Map\n\nEvery mapping visualisation starts with a good base map, and a solid TopoJSON file. If you are new to TopoJSON, check out the docs here. If you are new to creating your own TopoJSON files, you can check out my article on How to convert and prepare TopoJSON files for interactive mapping with d3.\n\nThe original shapefile used to create the TopoJSON file came from gadm.org.\n\nThe projection for the map of Switzerland was derived from this block, made by Mike Bostock. In order to use the Albers projection with react-simple-maps , we need to load in d3-geo. Since react-simple-maps uses d3-geo internally, it should already be installed. Using geoAlbers from d3-geo, you can easily create a custom projection, and pass it into the projection prop of <ComposableMap /> .\n\nYou can now run the app. Just type $ npm run dev in the terminal, and go to http://localhost:3000 .\n\nThe Data\n\nThe dataset for this tutorial comes from the Swiss Federal Statistics Office. In order to not mess with asynchronous data loading, this small dataset can be easily converted into a javascript object, and loaded in as a normal script. Here’s an excerpt:\n\n// ./data/index.js\n\nexport const cantons = [\n\n{\n\nid: 25,\n\ncanton: \"Zurich\",\n\ncoordinates: [ 8.6356, 47.3595 ],\n\nlanguages: [\n\n{ name: \"German\", value: 83.1 },\n\n{ name: \"French\", value: 3 },\n\n{ name: \"Italian\", value: 5.9 },\n\n{ name: \"Romansh\", value: 0.4 },\n\n]\n\n},\n\n...\n\nThe data can now be easily imported into the app:\n\n// ./pages/index.js\n\nimport { cantons } from \"../data\"\n\n...\n\nRendering Victory Charts As Markers\n\nThe final step is now to use the data to render out react-simple-maps <Marker /> components and render <VictoryPie /> charts into those markers.\n\nNote: The two <circle /> elements added on lines 67-68 , are just for decorative purposes.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis tutorial covered how to use react-simple-maps together with Victory charts to create a nice little map of Switzerland’s language distribution by canton. The two libraries play well together, so give it a try.

  "latent_10789": "The scene was stranger than it looked, even by Las Vegas standards: Two young men pull up in a U-Haul truck to a motel outside the city. They check in and move a cooler into their room. They appear to be handling something of importance, and look to see if the ice needs replenishing. Inside the cooler is not the makings of epic hangovers but instead an experiment in eternal youth.\n\nTucked within, protected from the desert heat, are more than a hundred tiny pond invertebrates. One of the men, Daniel Martínez, with a Ph.D. in ecology and evolution a month or so old, is rearing these little organisms to test a claim that they somehow stay young all their lives, no more likely to die as years go by as they are early on. They can die, however, from high temperatures or starvation. Leaving the animals on their own for more than a day invites disaster, so if Martínez travels, even stopping for sightseeing with his brother in Las Vegas, all the animals in the aging experiment travel, too.\n\nTheir road trip was in 1993, when the “dogma,” as Martínez recalls, was that evolution would not allow any multicelled organism to escape aging. Just as humans age, the thinking was, other organisms also decline in health as time goes by, with death becoming more and more likely. Yet few people at the time were bothering to document aging in any creatures other than a few standard lab residents.\n\nBiologists have long tracked aging in fruit flies and lab mice (SN: 7/23/16, p. 16), but a bloom of recent data from more diverse organisms is stirring up discussion about how aging could have evolved — and if it’s inevitable. The ongoing studies of Martínez’s pampered pond invertebrates and a massive effort to study aging in a roadside weed are good examples of these provocative approaches. They’re shaking up basic assumptions of a long-standing theory and inspiring new thinking to explain why there’s so much crazy variety in how life deteriorates — or maybe doesn’t.\n\nOld ideas\n\nDeciding whether an organism is aging can get tricky. For humans, the slowing and graying, the wrinkling and creaking are all too obvious. But what about plants? Or fungi? For a metric that applies across many species, evolutionary biologists often focus on how the number of deaths in a population changes over a particular period of time. If this death rate increases as time passes, the organism ages. (In this scheme, life span is irrelevant. A hypothetical species that lives for just a few months but keeps its death rate flat until the end would still be considered “biologically immortal.”)\n\nEarly evolutionary thinkers proposed that aging followed by death is a good thing, another marvel of the mindless force of natural selection. Built into individuals, this inevitable decline kept feeble parents from sapping resources from the young.\n\nBut the idea that aging evolved as a boon for the next generation “is really nonsense,” says Axel Kowald of Newcastle University in England, a biochemist who specializes in the bioinformatics of aging. Among the many objections: It’s hard to see why a lucky few that could live a bit longer and continue to reproduce wouldn’t overtake a population. With more offspring, they’d spread more of their genes. Over time, then, genes for aging should be few, fewer, gone.\n\nOne of the modern mainstream explanations of aging rests on the idea that evolutionary forces lose their power to edit as adulthood stretches on. As genes are copied generation after generation, mutations are made. Natural selection can remove from a population the typos that harm the young; disadvantaged carriers don’t pass those mistakes down to the next generation in much abundance.\n\nMistakes that cause trouble late in life, however, can be almost impossible to purge, argued the late zoologist Sir Peter Medawar, a Nobel laureate who titled his autobiography Memoir of a Thinking Radish. In a 1951 lecture, he explained this approach to aging by whimsically tracing the perilous lives of laboratory test tubes. The mortality rate of these hypothetical test tubes, which for the sake of explanation reproduced more than once in their lives, allowed few tubes to reach old age. Test tubes that don’t reach old age don’t reveal detrimental effects from mutations that act only late in life. Therefore natural selection didn’t have a chance to stop those mutations from being passed down to test tube babies. In a scenario now called mutation accumulation, the late-acting mutations could thus build up and cause the declines of aging, also known as senescence. Natural selection doesn’t weed out these mutations because, Medawar said, wild organisms “simply do not live that long.”\n\nIn a perverse twist on this idea, natural selection might not just allow genes that bring late-life decrepitude to accumulate but also might favor those genes. Evolutionary biologist George C. Williams, later eulogized as a quiet and deep thinker with the look of Abraham Lincoln, argued in 1957 that genes with split personalities, like Jekyll and Hyde, could help explain aging. The benefits of these genes appear early in life and the gene is thus passed to the next generation, with its downside revealed as frailty only late in life.\n\nStory continues below graphs\n\nAll kinds of curves Death rates in humans increase dramatically in later life, leading to an upsweeping mortality curve (far right, 2009 data from Japanese women). But the mortality curves of plants and animals vary greatly, according to a recent data analysis. Hydra don’t appear to age at all, and the death rates of desert tortoises can actually decline later in life.\n\nTill death do us part\n\nIn the 1990s, as the theories were then understood, a widespread idea was that “nothing can escape aging,” Martínez says. Yet as a graduate student at Stony Brook University in New York, he read about some tiny hydra species that had extraordinary powers. These branching bodies can reproduce by budding off clone babies, and they can rebuild themselves after dismemberment. What’s more, they didn’t appear to deteriorate with passing time. Biological immortality was a grand claim for these distant jellyfish relatives, soft translucent stalks a few millimeters tall with a tuft of tentacles wiggling from the top. But no one had done a rigorous test collecting the hydra and tracking their death rates.\n\nImmortal tales Some animals are known for their extreme longevity, or their attention-grabbing ability to escape death. But as with most mysteries in biology, the truth is often more nuanced than the tall tales. — Elizabeth Quill Turtles Turtles and tortoises have come to symbolize longevity, because some species can live over 100 years and don’t appear to age once they reach maturity. But in a recent study tracking painted turtles (one shown above) for more than two decades, researchers found that reproduction and survival rates did in fact decline as the turtles got older. The team attributed the change to human impacts, including roads and boating activity. Jellies The “immortal jellyfish” (Turritopsis spp.) has received a lot of attention, including a profile in the New York Times Magazine. But this hydrozoan, common in the western Mediterranean and Adriatic seas, is something of a cheat. It doesn’t escape aging the way the hydra does, but it can instead reverse its life cycle and then clone itself — a mature medusa reverts to a colonial polyp and then buds off new medusae. Honeybee queens Honeybees haven’t received as much popular credit as they deserve for their antiaging tactics. Despite sharing a genome with other bees in the hive, the queen bee survives 10 times as long and continues to reproduce throughout her life. She somehow avoids the common trade-off between longevity and reproduction and, along with other social insects, poses a challenge for certain aging theories.\n\nMartínez eventually set up 145 Hydra vulgaris in laboratory luxury, where no predator could reach them and they could enjoy catered food all their lives. “When I started doing the experiment, I thought that I was going to prove that hydra could not escape aging,” he says. “A year and a half later I got my Ph.D. — the hydra were still with me.” The expected rise in death rate that characterizes aging organisms still hadn’t started. “I got a postdoc at University of California, Irvine,” he says, “so I crossed the country in a U-Haul truck with the hydra and all my furniture.”\n\nThe truck was supposed to be air-conditioned but wasn’t, and with a hot engine right under the cab, driving a southern route pulling a trailer, Martínez had to keep careful track of ice for the hydra cooler. Plus, there was all the changing of water, the feeding, the raising brine shrimp so the hydra had live prey. This was when the whole party visited Las Vegas.\n\nThe hydra made it. (Martínez, however, no longer even considers a hydra project without a technician to manage their care.) In 1998 he published results of four years of hydra watching. His title was cautious: “Mortality patterns suggest lack of senescence in hydra.”\n\n“I published the paper and forgot about it,” says Martínez, now at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif.\n\nOpinions about the inevitability of aging continued to run strong — as demographer James Vaupel of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany, discovered in 2002. At a workshop on aging in nonhuman species, Vaupel stood up to say that the paper he had found most interesting was one describing mortality rates in a roadside weed. The rates appeared to drop as time passed, leading Vaupel to propose it as a possible case of what he called “negative senescence.”\n\n“My remark was met with ululations of horror, cries of derision, hisses and boos,” Vaupel says. Eminent biogerontologists said that theorist William Hamilton had proved decades earlier that mortality, at least in repeatedly reproductive adults, universally rises with age and “there was no need for the audience to listen to a demographer who didn’t understand biology.”\n\nFurther data on the weed showed a more complex story, but the meeting outcry had a meaningful effect. As soon as Vaupel got back to his Rostock lab, he asked Annette Baudisch, then a new Ph.D. student, to “figure out why Hamilton’s proof was wrong.”\n\nBaudisch published her critique of Hamilton in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2005. Hamilton’s proof could not explain the full diversity of aging, she argued. Some species that keep growing throughout adulthood, tortoises and many plants, for example, might not be included.\n\nThough some researchers believe there’s still much truth to Hamilton’s approach, Vaupel took this conclusion as a cue to go questing for examples of prolonged youth. He talked Martínez into redoing the hydra experiment — but bigger. Instead of four years, the test ran for eight. Instead of 145 animals, the team had multiyear data from 2,256.\n\nThe resulting paper came out last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Two species of hydra, with their many representatives divided between Claremont and Rostock for raising, had continued their usual low-drama lives, feeding and budding off babies but not showing any upsweep in their mortality rates. In 10 of the 12 groups, the annual probability of death stayed around 0.6 percent, and two groups held steady with an even lower annual rate of 0.09 percent.\n\nContinuing the tests until the whole study population died, which would be ideal for tracking the hydra’s entire life history, would take more than 1,000 years, researchers calculate. But eight years of data gave Martínez and Vaupel confidence. The old view that aging is inevitable, the paper declared, “is no longer tenable.”\n\nThe hydra results so far are “solid evidence” that not all species age, Kowald says. And there are other, less-studied candidates for what’s called negligible senescence, too: three-toed box turtles and bristlecone pines, for instance.\n\nInto the wild\n\nThe lab, of course, isn’t where evolution shapes life. Biologists seeking to understand how aging evolved need to know if and how organisms age in the wild, research that is likewise challenging Medawar’s pronouncements.\n\nThe plant study that caused a ruckus for Vaupel was an early version of a test by Deborah Roach, a plant evolutionary biologist now at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Her results from 4,476 ribwort plantains (Plantago lanceolata), set out at a long-term research site in Durham, N.C., had suggested that this common roadside weed was escaping the supposedly inevitable decline of aging. But construction of a new art museum wiped out those plots after less than five years.\n\nAfter moving to Virginia and summoning the resolve to start the experiment again, Roach selected meadows at Thomas Jefferson’s birthplace, close to Charlottesville and under the protection of local historical preservationists. During the years 2000 through 2002, an army of undergraduates set out 30,000 plantains, all of known genetic heritage and marked for individual monitoring.\n\nAfter collecting seven years of data on when plants died, Roach picked up a subtle signal she hadn’t observed in Durham. At first, plantains of different ages had about the same mortality rates, all relatively low, with six-month mortality rates at less than 10 percent. But during the three years that followed, the plantains clearly struggled. Roach suspects soggy winters plus competition from neighboring foliage were to blame. Death rates rose to around 30 percent and — this was the important bit — the death rates climbed higher for the older plants. A population that had looked as if it weren’t physically declining with age showed signs of senescence when the going got tough.\n\nThe results contradict Medawar’s fundamental assumption that life is so short and brutal in the wild that the possibility of seeing frail, aged organisms there would be exceedingly rare. “Now we have a great body of literature showing that in fact there are these old animals out there, these old plants,” Roach says.\n\nStory continues below graphic\n\nShowing their age From 2003 to 2006, ribwort plantains (shown at right) in plots in Virginia faced an uptick in mortality rates. Though rates were mostly similar among age cohorts before and after these years, the mortality rates of older plantains increased more than those of younger plantains during this period. Older cohorts appeared to be suffering more from a stressful environment — clear evidence of aging. Source: D.A. Roach, C.E. Ridley and J.L. Dudycha/Ecology 2009\n\nA 2013 tally by Dan Nussey of the University of Edinburgh and an international array of colleagues documented more examples of aged organisms in the wild — 175 species, in fact, including Dall sheep, antler flies and great tits, among others. A study of painted turtles published June 7 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences added that species to the list, showing that human impacts might inadvertently be nudging an Illinois population toward senescence.\n\nAcross the tree of life, aging now looks more varied than old ideas predicted. Drawing on data for 46 species, Vaupel, Baudisch (now at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense) and 12 coauthors published a paper in 2014 featuring a full page of mortality curves, which track how the number of deaths in a given group changes over time. Many of the organisms show the expected upsweep with time, but other curves are idiosyncratic. The curve of Soay sheep curls concavely downward during early adulthood before rising again to a rounded hilltop in old age. Alpine swifts’ curve looks like a side view of a lawn chair relaxed way back for a summer snooze.\n\nWith mortality data on so few of the species on Earth, it’s too early to pronounce big trends. So far, body size and life span don’t appear to dictate the shape of the curve: The curves of water fleas and lions look remarkably similar. Organisms from different kingdoms can also have similar curves: The curves for desert tortoises and netleaf oaks both tilt downward.\n\n“We’re going to have to figure out what it is about the biology of these species that explains the variety,” Roach says. The new reports, she adds, “are putting a big, bold spotlight on the theories and saying, ‘Hey guys, we need to update.’”\n\nThink again\n\nLast year in Experimental Gerontology, Kowald and Thomas Kirkwood of the Institute for Ageing at Newcastle University proclaimed that Medawar’s idea about natural selection losing its power appears to be “difficult to reconcile” with new research. The discussion on that point isn’t over yet, though.\n\nBaudisch, for her part, would like theoretical frameworks that describe aging (or its lack) as part of the whole topography of change during a life. “Theories that just deal with the end of life don’t speak to all this diversity,” she says. “Physicists don’t make theories that only apply on Sundays.”\n\nOne long-standing approach does offer more of a whole-life framework. Kirkwood proposed the approach, called disposable soma theory, back in 1977. Wild organisms have to split their limited resources between reproduction and maintaining the soma, the nonreproducing parts of the body, he noted. In many cases, the best strategy demands such liberal spending on reproduction that there’s not enough left for full upkeep of the rest of the body. Aging is, in this interpretation, the sum of deferred maintenance.\n\nAustralian Antechinus marsupials and members of two related genera offer the most dramatic example of mammals that forgo upkeep for extravagant reproduction. The climate where these marsupials live supplies a surge of insect nourishment for nursing moms only once a year. The males, roughly the size of mice or rats, grow disproportionately large testes and devote all their resources to vying for fatherhood, Diana Fisher of the University of Queensland in Australia and her colleagues reported in 2013. After healthy males reach adulthood, they stop producing new sperm , start mating and, a few weeks later, are all dead. Their immune systems collapse. A once-per-lifetime bout of intense competition leads males to what Fisher calls “suicidal reproduction.”\n\nThe hydra species in the big lab test pursue a different strategy. Because they can regenerate and reproduce through budding, there is no distinction between reproductive cells and soma. Kirkwood says that the lack of senescence in hydra fits easily with the disposable soma approach. He would bet on their immortality.\n\nHe also thinks the ideas proposed by Medawar and Hamilton still have great value, with “central relevance to understanding aging.” To explain all the recently uncovered variety in aging, researchers may simply need more than these theories. They might need to know, for example, the particulars of a species’ home, be it pond, meadow or bug-rich forest.\n\nUnderstanding these details may or may not allow humankind to do much about the process of aging. But creating better theories might finally reveal how some pale brainless squiggles of pond life may have achieved perpetual youth when humankind, despite all its apparent sophistication, has not.\n\nThis story appears in the July 23, 2016, Science News with the headline, \"Aging's Wild Side.\"",
  "latent_10821": "LAST MARCH , Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley spoke on the Senate floor against a bill aimed largely at reducing mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. He decried the “leniency industrial complex” that would see too many low-level offenders released.\n\nJust a few months later, in a seeming about-turn, he co-sponsored an albeit more limited bill, but with the similar aim of sentencing reform and a higher likelihood of success. “We need this,” said the archetypal tough-on crime Republican. Either, criminal justice reform has become a bipartisan political sine qua non, or Grassley’s reform bill was fiercely limited. Or, a bit of both.\n\nSuch was the landscape of allegedly historic shifts and realpolitikal compromise on criminal justice reform in 2015. All Democratic presidential candidates and most Republicans called for it, specifically but ambiguously citing the need to end mass incarceration. In December, the general counsel of Koch Industries met for the fourth time with White House officials to discuss support for bipartisan reform bills advancing through the House and Senate.\n\nThe House bill, the Sentencing Reform Act, and the Senate bill, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, have passed their respective judiciary committees. Both reduce federal mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenses, lower the sentence for three-strike drug felons from life to 25 years and (importantly) would apply retroactively — so would be applicable to current prisoners to seek early release.\n\nThe bills’ passage would also make retroactive the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, which undid a historically racist and classist disparity in sentencing severity between crack and powder cocaine.\n\nThat such legislation might reach the president’s desk does signal a shift in contemporary U.S. politics. Consensus support for any reform of this sort on Capitol Hill is significant in recent history, but that speaks mainly to decades of political intransigence on the issue. The legislation has limited reach, reducing harsh penalties for a select subset of drug offenders, and is also flawed; both bills introduce new mandatory minimums.\n\nCredit for the modest progress the bills represent certainly belongs to a popular resistance movement powerfully asserting that U.S. criminal justice systematically decimates black life. In June, Politico published an article titled “Riots spur Senate look at sentencing reform.” It was a causal stretch for which I’ll blame the vagaries of clickbait, but it conveyed a kernel of truth. Riots have historically prompted placation-aimed reforms.\n\nAt the same time, decarceration efforts are now more palatable for tough-on-crime politicians, thanks to the existence of a vast nexus of technologies to surveil and control those deemed criminal, offering grim assurance that the carceral state is well-established beyond prison walls.\n\nBut as we head into 2016, an election year hinged on Trumpian racism and bombast could threaten to sideline even the most muted of criminal justice reform bills.\n\nA spokesperson from Grassley’s office told The Intercept that the senator is in discussion with congressional leadership to see the bills put on this year’s truncated agenda.\n\n“There’s a lot of desire and bipartisan support. It’s just a question of whether the calendar and the leadership give it time,” Molly Gill, government affairs counsel with Families Against Mandatory Minimums, told The Intercept. In other words, the proposals painstakingly welded to fit bipartisan accord last year may now need fighting for.\n\nF OURTEEN PERCENT of the 2.2 million people currently incarcerated in the U.S. are in federal prison — half of federal inmates are imprisoned on drug or drug-related charges. For the thousands of inmates who might see their sentences dramatically reduced, the reform would be the very meaning of historic, in rewriting the cruelest fates twisted justice had handed them.\n\nYou may have heard of Weldon Angelos. The story of his 55-year federal prison sentence for selling weed worth about $1,000 while also possessing firearms made him a poster boy for the reform bills on the table. Angelos, music producer of some local fame in Utah, was arrested in 2002 at age 23. Drug-related mandatory minimum charges when firearms are involved (“involvement” given dangerously broad scope in cases like Angelos’) meant the judge was forced to punish him with five decades of time. The judge himself, Paul Cassell, called the sentence “unjust, cruel, even irrational.” The cost to the state would be $1.5 million. If passed, the sentencing reform bills could see Angelos, and others in similar circumstances, leave prison earlier, and judges might no longer have to hand down such “manifestly unjust” sentences, as Cassell put it.\n\nHighlighting cases like Angelos’ is crucial. Cynically: politics needs its anecdotes. Politically: we have to tell prisoners’ stories if we want to undo a penal apparatus that turns millions of people into a silenced, isolated, invisible mass.\n\nBut if Angelos’ story illustrates the merits of proposed reform, others tell of its insufficiency. FAMM, which profiles numerous prisoners, raised the example of Mandy Martinson, currently serving 15 years in federal prison for helping her dealer-boyfriend in exchange for feeding her methamphetamine addiction — a sentence, the nonprofit group notes, longer than the average federal time handed to rapists and racketeers. Martinson’s judge explicitly said the young woman, a recovering addict, posed no reoffending risk.\n\nYet Martinson’s conviction for conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or more of methamphetamine and marijuana puts her in the high-level category untouched by the House and Senate bills. The reforms purportedly are aimed at alleviating excessive punishment for low-level offenders, while keeping “kingpins” and traffickers in check. Martinson’s case illustrates how conspiracy laws could continue to entangle minor players and drug users.\n\n“She personally would not receive relief from the bill’s retroactive provisions, and a future offender who committed the same crime with the same facts today would get the same unjust, counterproductive mandatory sentence,” FAMM’s director, Julie Stewart, said of Martinson. “It is difficult to claim that any proposal that does not fix abuses like this represents meaningful reform.”\n\nAlex Vitale, associate professor of sociology at Brooklyn College and author of City of Disorder: How the Quality of Life Campaign Transformed New York, told The Intercept that “such reforms won’t dismantle the war on drugs so long as the law enforcement apparatus is empowered to follow up on drug users.” Vitale’s view, shared by the Drug Policy Alliance among other decriminalization advocates, is that the use of drugs should be addressed outside the criminal justice system entirely.\n\nAnd this is just to talk of drug offenses. Nine percent of the federal prison population is incarcerated for immigration-related offenses, and according to the Marshall Project, over half of federal criminal convictions last year were for illegal entry or re-entry.\n\nAs Marie Gottschalk, author of Caught: The Prison State and the Lockdown of American Politics, wrote:\n\nWithin the federal prison system, immigrants have been the fastest-growing population, and as a result, Latinos are now the largest population in federal prisons. Like mass incarceration itself, the criminalization of immigrants has simultaneously expanded the carceral capacity of the state and enabled private contractors to profit from the confinement of human beings.\n\nThe bills on the table do not scale back harsh measures for immigration crimes; there’s simply no political will in a climate of festering anti-immigrant rhetoric. This is no minor limitation.\n\nIn terms of the historic legislative structures affected, these reforms far from mark an end to mandatory minimum sentencing laws. The Senate bill creates two new mandatory minimums: five years for providing certain goods or services to terrorists and 10 years for “interstate domestic violence” resulting in death; the House bill increases the penalties for heroin offenses when the drug is mixed with fentanyl, a more potent opioid sometimes added to diluted heroin by dealers.\n\nAnd one of the key promises of the bills, which would see mandatory minimums for low-level nonviolent offenders reduced from 10 to five years, would not be applied to “anyone who refused to give up information about the drug activities of others,” as Mother Jones highlighted. I don’t expect a congressional bill to align with the anarchist dictum of choice for such situations — “snitches get stitches” — but this cooperation detail shows that our lawmakers maintain an interest in using mandatory minimums as a coercive, as well as punitive, tool.\n\nMandatory minimums have undergirded a plague of prosecutorial abuse for years. Prosecutors extract plea bargains, leveraging against the risk of a possible guilty verdict at trial and a fixed, lengthy sentence. Around 95-98 percent of federal cases end with a plea, without trial. The central tenet of the rule of law — the right to a fair trial — becomes irrelevant if coercion renders a trial an unthinkable option. Mandatory minimums are that coercive tool, which the reform bills only slightly blunt in some cases, and sharpen in others.\n\nAMORE INSIDIOUS FRAMEWORK also attends newly buoyant efforts to end mass incarceration. Social control mechanisms — mass surveillance, ankle tagging, coerced drug treatments, and probation systems, to name a few — add to the appeal of decarceration for even the most conservative defenders of a tough-on-crime approach. If prisons, as Michel Foucault suggested, embodied an age of discipline through which hierarchical power could control bodies, and identify “criminal” bodies to control, then contemporary technologies maintain these power relations without the need for brick and mortar.\n\nThe focus of current reform on drug offenses provides prime example. While the battle to decarcerate is only just beginning, non-prison “solutions” for offenders should be scrutinized. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s comments around moving drug addicts out of prisons are the sort of discourse that pique concern. The presidential candidate has vowed to enforce federal marijuana prohibition in the unlikely event of his election. Yet, he said in November, with “drug addicts … we need to start treating them, not jailing them.”\n\nThere’s no inconsistency here: Christie would keep drug users in the realm of the “criminal,” thereby maintaining the persecuted and large subclass of people caught in the carceral system now. He would see them “treated” not “jailed” — an endorsement of coerced drug treatment programs, which may keep people out of cages, but are rife with problems.\n\nAs Michelle Chen noted in a piece for The Nation, “Reform initiatives like rehabilitation and employment programs focus on making ‘corrections’ less punitive. But they maintain the political framework of ‘redeeming’ bad people, rather than dismantling antisocial systems.” Chen points out how a “treatment industrial complex” could, and is already, replacing the prison industrial complex. She adds, “Many of the dollars expected to be ‘saved’ from shuttering prisons may simply be funneled into privatized ‘alternatives to incarceration’ like parole programs and halfway houses.”\n\nNot only is this shift well underway, I’d submit it is among key conditions enabling the political will to reform prisons to arise. As Foucault said with haunting prescience in 1975: “Criminal psychiatry and psychology risk becoming the ultimate alibi behind which the prevailing system will hide in order to remain unchanged. They could not possibly suggest a serious alternative to the prison system for the simple reason that they owe their origins to it.”\n\nPrison reform, even the abolition of brick-and-mortar prisons, is about the crucial goal of removing humans from cages. As an end, even this is insufficient if we are not in the business of setting people free.\n\nHuman rights and criminal defense attorney Moira Meltzer-Cohen told The Intercept that arguments for moving from a prison system to an apparatus of surveillance often place their rationale in the unfortunate fact that we are all surveilled, indiscriminately, already — as if totalized surveillance removed structural discrimination in the U.S. Meltzer-Cohen noted:\n\nThe people who are subject especially to this surveillance, disproportionately are not anyone and everyone, they are traditionally marginalized and over-policed working class communities of color who are funneled into the courts in the first place. And this layer of surveillance is then imposed upon them as though it is a kindness, a lenience or an act of generosity.\n\nA crucial distinction is blurred and missed in the current moment of sentencing reform. Namely, prison reform and criminal justice reform are consistently used interchangeably — and for reasons that make absolute sense right now: Prisons are the leviathan apparatus through which criminal justice now functions.\n\nIf we truly are moving away from mass incarceration, we should remember that criminal justice does not rely on prisons to alienate and oppress. It relies more fundamentally on the category of “criminal,” and who gets to fall into it. It is a category that needs drastic undoing, not reforming.\n\nTop photo: Prisoners from Sacramento County await processing after arriving at the Deuel Vocational Institution in Tracy, Calif., Feb. 20, 2014.",

  "latent_11405": "Hamilton is a city in transition — seemingly on the edge of a new identity.\n\nLook around, and you'll see development almost everywhere, with new buildings, condos, and projects dotting its landscape, and plans for more coming.\n\nBut Hamilton's rich history is also undeniable, as the soul of the city was forged in local steel for decades.\n\nThat history isn't going anywhere — but it is evolving, as old mixes with new.\n\nHere are six places where Hamilton's history is coming together with new ideas, new uses or new realities.\n\nThe train stations and the bar next door\n\nLiuna station was built during the years of 1929-31. (Liunastation.com)\n\nThe area around James and Murray Streets has been a gateway for decades.\n\nLiuna station is its centerpiece. That monolithic building once housed The CN Railway Station, which was built during the years of 1929 to 1931.\n\nClose to 60 years ago, Queen Elizabeth II was just one of thousands of people who made their way into the city through those massive stone pillars. Back then, the station was the first stop for many immigrants on the way into the city, and a new home.\n\nIn 1999, Liuna bought the property, and it's now used as a glitzy space for weddings and events, like the 2015 Juno Awards afterparty. The station even appeared in 2000s superhero smash X-Men.\n\nWhile Liuna Station has new life, trains are still shuttling people back and forth across the street. Years ago, the CN station was shepherding people into the city. Now, Metrolinx is shuttling commuters out.\n\nGO Transit opened its West Harbour station in 2015 — though with only two trains a day, it's far from the bustling station CN would have been in its heyday.\n\nMetrolinx has promised all day service, though the organization has said it might not actually come to Hamilton until 2026.\n\nHamilton's West Harbour GO Station officially opened in 2015. (Adam Carter/CBC)\n\nAlongside the trains, there's another constant — a bar just steps away that has undergone its own transformation.\n\nThis Ain't Hollywood is one of the city's premiere music venues, and its building actually predates the railway station itself as Mackenzie House, opening in 1893.\n\nNow it's a Hamilton counterculture icon, named after a Forgotten Rebels song of the same name.\n\nThe Royal Connaught\n\nThe Royal Connaught stood as a glitzy downtown icon for many years. (Royalconnaught.com)\n\nFew buildings embody Hamilton's rise, fall, and then rise again like the Royal Connaught.\n\nFirst opened as a hotel in 1916, the Connaught was then seen as the city's first skyscraper, and the embodiment of opulence and class.\n\nPoint of view: My name is Kevin and I am a gentrifier\n\nBut through the years, things changed. The hotel was sold multiple times, and fell into disrepair. The Connaught closed in 2008 after going into receivership, and stood for years as a shell of its former self, casting a long shadow over Gore Park.\n\nMultiple plans to restore the building to its former glory fell through — until 2014, when Spallacci Group and Valery Homes teamed up to buy and renovate the crumbling hotel.\n\nThe lobby of the old hotel features original limestone tiles and restored columns. (Cory Ruf/CBC)\n\nNow, the Connaught is one of the frontrunners of Hamilton's condo boom. Cranes are in the sky at levels not seen in years, and the Connaught has been largely restored, with an art deco flair that serves as a nod to the past.\n\nAberdeen Avenue's dystopian future\n\nAberdeen Avenue is one of Hamilton's most picturesque streets. (NHL4Hamilton/Wikimedia commons)\n\nAberdeen Avenue is home to some of Hamilton's most picturesque and historic homes.\n\nNamed after Lord Aberdeen (who was appointed Governor General of Canada in 1893), the lower city street boasts some bonafide mansions, standing with intricate brick facades along the tree-lined, picturesque street.\n\nBut Aberdeen has a darker secret: It's also home to Waterford House, the home of the tyrannical Commander Waterford in the Republic of Gilead.\n\nAberdeen Avenue is shown prominently in the TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood's \"The Handmaid's Tale.\" This home was built in 1893. (MGM Television Entertainment Inc./Relentless Productions)\n\nAt least, it is on the multiple Emmy Award-winning series The Handmaid's Tale.\n\nThere's the old and new — Hamilton's picturesque housing stock, interspersed with its burgeoning film industry.\n\nThe city's credits are becoming too numerous to count, but two of this year's biggest TV shows were filmed at least in part here, with the aforementioned Margaret Atwood adaption and Neil Gaiman's fantasy epic American Gods.\n\nBig time director Guillermo del Toro even called Hamilton a \"powerhouse\" of creativity at TIFF this year, saying he'd like to open his own studio in the city.\n\nThe Waterfront\n\nFor many decades Hamilton's waterfront was known mostly known for two things: heavy industry and intense pollution.\n\nIt was a centre of trade and commercial growth in the mid-1900s, but expansion on the waterfront nearly destroyed area's ecosystem. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the harbour was deemed totally unfit for any recreation because of the abysmal water quality.\n\nBut starting in the 90s, a transformation of the West Harbour began. In the last 30 years, major efforts have been made to change the area, with Bayfront Park, Pier 4 Park and the Waterfront Trail becoming legitimate jewels of the city (though the water quality still leaves a lot to be desired).\n\nThis rendering shows the plan for development at Pier 8. (Forrec Ltd)\n\nNow, the area is set to undergo another massive transformation, with a just-announced plan for the promenade at Pier 8 set to start construction in 2018.\n\nThe plan, from Toronto-based Forrec Ltd, includes a beach, a games terrace, a cafe, and playground space. That's a far cry from the polluted industrial wasteland that once defined the harbour.\n\nThe City Motor Hotel\n\nThe City Motor Hotel's sign was one of the most recognizable in all of Hamilton. (City Motor Hotel)\n\nIt's difficult to find a place that epitomizes Hamilton's seedy side like the City Motor Hotel did.\n\nHookers, cons and cops were frequent visitors to the east-end institution, where Main Street meets the Queenston traffic circle.\n\nTo quote beloved Hamilton columnist Paul Wilson:\n\n\"This was the place where a guest smuggled in a hundred pigeons. Where two guys carried a stolen safe into their room. Where a would-be Ticat who got cut paid his bill at checkout time with a credit card stolen from the general manager of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.\"\n\nYears after it was torn down, the area where the City Motor Hotel once stood will become a stop on Hamilton's LRT system. (Metrolinx)\n\nThe hotel was built in the early 1960s, and though its earlier brochures feel emblematic of the charm of that era, the city bought and tore down the City Motor in 2013.\n\nNow, the area will be part one of Hamilton's most ambitious (or, depending on who you talk to, misguided) transit projects: light rail transit.\n\nThe city's LRT line was originally slated to stop at the hotel's former doorstep, before an extension to Eastgate Square was finalized.\n\nThe city's social housing agency is also proposing almost 100 affordable apartments and townhouses for the property.\n\nEven 10 years ago — if you told someone that the City Motor Hotel would become a stop on the line for a brand new LRT system, they'd likely look at you like you were nuts.\n\nCentury Manor\n\nCentury Manor is one of Hamilton's oldest buildings. (Samantha Craggs/CBC)\n\nIt was Hamilton's first Insane Asylum — and now Century Manor is on the road from ghost story fodder to being eyed for rejuvenation.\n\nOnce known as a cautionary tale \"house on the hill\" from the 1800s where electroshock therapy and lobotomies were practiced, the city is now eyeing the West 5th lands where one of the city's oldest buildings is perched.\n\nThe city has long been interested in the 12 hectares (28.77 acres) of scenic Mountain brow land.\n\nProspective plans have included student housing for Mohawk College and even the anchor for a gondola going to the lower city. There's a precedent for new student housing in the city (with a new tower going up on James Street North), and developers have talked about preserving the building's heritage.\n\nInfrastructure Ontario still owns the land, but there's lots of interest in that much prime space beside a hospital, across the street from a college campus and overlooking Hamilton's escarpment.",

It also creates a vacuum among Senate Republicans for leaders on national security issues. For now, Corker isn't planning on getting involved in either contest.\n\n\"After much thought, consideration and family discussion over the past year, Elizabeth and I have decided that I will leave the United States Senate when my term expires at the end of 2018,\" the Chattanooga Republican said in a statement.\n\nCorker comes from Tennessee's long tradition of establishment Republican figures who came to the Senate with ambitions that went beyond the state's expansive borders. Two of the past five Senate GOP leaders have been from Tennessee, while Corker and Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) are two of the most powerful committee chairmen.\n\nCorker acknowledged that his clout led him to consider breaking his pledge, initially made during his 2006 race, to serve only two terms. \"As we have gained influence, that decision has become more difficult. But I have always been drawn to the citizen legislator model,\" he said in his statement.\n\nIn Tennessee, consensus politics makes a last stand\n\nBut the establishment wing of the Republican Party has been under assault since the tea party movement took hold seven years ago, and even more so in the Trump era, when mild-mannered dealmakers have fallen out of favor with conservative voters who increasingly prefer angry confrontations over ideological outcomes.\n\nCorker faced that dynamic back home over the August congressional break, when he questioned Trump's stability after the president's response to the violence in Charlottesville. \"He has not demonstrated that he understands what has made this nation great,\" he told local reporters.\n\nThat prompted taunting tweets from Trump, who said that Corker was \"constantly asking me\" whether to seek reelection.\n\nCorker wrestled with the decision of whether to run for months, he said, finally coming to peace with the idea of retiring in late August, while at an event in Clarksville. He set a final deadline of Tuesday at noon to make his decision, he said, whatever happened with the health-care vote.\n\n\"I came as a citizen legislator, I did, and hopefully I provided some entertainment for you all by being a person who's not thinking about reelection,\" Corker said during an interview in his office. \"That's the way I came, and I want to depart on that same basis.\"\n\nCorker revealed his plans to retire just hours after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced that he would not hold a vote on the latest bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act because it was destined to fail amid defections from GOP moderates.\n\nCorker's announcement also came just hours before polls closed in the Republican primary runoff in Alabama, in which appointed Sen. Luther Strange lost to Roy Moore, a former state Supreme Court justice. Moore's insurgent campaign emboldened the sort of anti-establishment figures who have made McConnell a target of enmity and who were searching for a primary challenge to Corker.\n\nCorker almost retired in 2012, but he was coaxed into running again when it became clear that he would be the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nThere is a growing fear among Senate Republicans that other incumbents will retire or face heated primary challenges next year.\n\nNext year's Tennessee Senate race will give hard-line conservatives their best chance yet to break through in a state where they have failed in recent primaries for Senate and governor — one of the last holdouts against the tea party wave that has swept other Southern states.\n\nRep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) might try to fill the conservative lane. Former representative Stephen Fincher (R), who retired last year with $2.4 million remaining in his campaign account, could try to run as a tea party hero — he was the first non-Democrat to win his western Tennessee seat since Davy Crockett — but with establishment help as someone who worked well with Alexander and Corker.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lamar Alexander takes shots at tea party in Tennessee primary\n\nSome will look to Peyton Manning, the Super Bowl-winning quarterback who went to the University of Tennessee and retired in early 2016 from professional football. Manning is close to Corker, who brought him to a congressional GOP retreat this year.\n\nCorker's departure will be felt perhaps most acutely in the area of foreign relations, where the Tennessean not only served as his party's top voice in the Senate but has for years been celebrated as one of the GOP's best bipartisan dealmakers.\n\nHe established his chops early in his Senate career when lawmakers ratified the New START treaty, a strategic arms-control pact that regulates the size of the U.S. and Russian nuclear stockpiles. Corker was one of the key GOP players who negotiated changes that made it possible to bring more conservative votes on board.\n\nAs chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Corker also tackled nuclear security, joining with ranking Democrat Benjamin L. Cardin (Md.) to design a bill that gave Congress an opportunity to weigh in on a multilateral deal to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions before it could go into effect.\n\nMore recently, Corker has been the chief go-between for the White House and Congress when it comes to whether the president will certify Iran's compliance with the deal next month — a decision that could kick off a brutal battle on Capitol Hill over whether to reimpose nuclear sanctions against Tehran.\n\nCorker has fallen into the role of liaison between the Trump administration and the Senate on other matters as well, including sanctions, nuclear threats and foreign wars. He speaks with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson constantly and has frequent contact with the president.\n\nAt times, that has meant Corker has been the one holding the Senate back from tackling issues popular with the rank and file. For months, for example, he staved off a burgeoning effort to increase sanctions against Russia — he later explained that he intended to give Tillerson a chance to make a deal with Moscow to improve the bleak war in Syria.\n\nRead more at PowerPost",
  "latent_12178": "The United Arab Emirates plans to send a specialized aircraft to serve as an ambulance for a 14-year-old Pakistani girl shot by the Taliban in case doctors decide to send her abroad for treatment, a Pakistani official said Sunday.\n\nThe shooting of Malala Yousufzai along with two classmates while they were on their way home from school on Oct. 9 horrified people in Pakistan and internationally. She was shot for promoting girl's education and criticizing the Taliban.\n\nThe attack left Yousufzai seriously wounded and sparked calls for the Pakistani government to step up its fight against the militant group.\n\nVisas are being finalized for the air ambulance crew and six doctors who will accompany the flight, Islamabad's Ambassador to the UAE Jamil Ahmed Khan told Pakistan's Geo TV on Sunday. Arrangements have been made to treat the girl at three hospitals in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, he said.\n\nThe UAE Embassy in Islamabad could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nNo decision has yet been taken to send the girl abroad, but the air ambulance is part of the contingency plan, the Pakistani military said Sunday. Yousufzai is being treated in a military hospital, where doctors removed a bullet from her neck. The bullet went into her head before travelling toward her spine.\n\nDoctors reviewed the girl's condition Sunday and are satisfied she is making slow and steady progress, the military said. They will carry out another detailed review Sunday evening.\n\nOn Saturday, the military said Yousufzai remained on a ventilator but was able to move her legs and hands after her sedatives were reduced.\n\nYousufzai earned the enmity of the Taliban for publicizing their behavior when they took over the northwestern Swat Valley where she lived and for speaking about the importance of education for girls.\n\nThe group first started to exert its influence in Swat in 2007 and quickly extended its reach to much of the valley by the next year. They set about imposing their will on residents by forcing men to grow beards, preventing women from going to the market and blowing up many schools  the majority for girls.\n\n... contd.\n\nALSO READ 500 killed in South Sudan after coup attempt\n\nPlease read our terms of use before posting comments",
  "latent_12445": "Nintendo's new NFC figurine line, Amiibo, is launching with Super Smash Bros. for Wii U later this year, and we're finally getting more details on the company's new business model.\n\nThe current packaging of the figurines is shown in the image to the left. Look at those high quality characters! Man, I'm not a huge fan of figurines, but even I think these look sexy. But, of course, beauty comes at a cost, and Reggie has revealed exactly what that price is.\n\n\"You can expect them to be comparable to the Disney and Skylander products that are on the market. [They cost $10 to $15.]\" — Reggie Fils-Aime, COO of Nintendo of America\n\nReggie Fils-Aime went on to go deeper into Amiibo's ideas.\n\n\"There’s three things that we see that make this different, hopefully stronger than the current propositions. First, that it’s Nintendo IP. Secondly, the ability for these to work across multiple games. We think that’s going to be a huge driver – having these figures work with “Mario Kart 8,” work with “Mario Party,” work with “Yoshi’s Wooly World.” We think that’s a huge step forward for this space. The third aspect is that we do believe our Amiibo figures are going to have a wider demographic footprint. We think we’re going to have much stronger girl appeal. We think we’re going to have strong young adult play because of the collectability. For those three reasons we’ve got the potential to be bigger than what’s been out in the space so far.\"\n\nYour wallet may be crying right now. All of a sudden, I'm hoping we don't have too many more characters in Smash Bros. That means more figurines... which means more wallet tears.\n\nSource: Seattle Times",
  "latent_12457": "About one-in-ten mothers with a Master’s degree or more are staying at home in order to care for their family, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of census data. Among mothers with professional degrees, such as medical degrees, law degrees or nursing degrees, 11% are relatively affluent and are out of the workforce in order to care for their families. This is true for 9% of Master’s degree holders and 6% of mothers with a Ph.D.\n\nThese so-called “opt-out moms” (roughly 10% of all highly educated mothers) make up just 1% of the nation’s 35 million mothers ages 18 to 69 who are living with their children younger than 18. For our purposes, “opt-out moms” are mothers who have at least a Master’s degree, an annual family income of $75,000 or more; a working husband; and who state that they are out of the workforce in order to care for their family.\n\nLisa Belkin first coined the term “opting out” in 2003, to describe highly educated, high-achieving women who seemingly chose to “opt out, ratchet back, and redefine work” after becoming mothers. Ever since then, the phenomenon of “opt-out” mothers has been a subject of much media fascination—the idea that such ambitious, professionally-successful women would put their careers aside, for the opportunity to focus exclusively on their families seemed to really strike a chord.\n\nAnd yet, when examining the total population of mothers who stay at home with their children, these so-called “opt-out moms” make up a very small share (4%). Most of the recent growth in stay-at-home moms has been driven by those with less education, according to a recent Pew Research Center report.\n\nAffluent, highly educated women who exit the workforce may not be “opting out”. Some suggest that they are being pushed out, due to the difficulties of balancing work and family in the U.S. Indeed, a 2009 Center for Work-Life Policy surveyof “highly qualified” women (with advanced degrees, or with high-honors undergraduate degrees), found that among those who had stepped away from their careers, fully 69% said they would not have done so if their workplace offered more flexible work arrangements.\n\nLeaving the workforce is not necessarily a permanent step. In that 2009 survey, fully 89% of those highly qualified women who had left their careers (the plurality of whom did so to care for family) reported that they did plan to return to work. Seventy percent did so, typically after about two and a half years out of the workforce. Furthermore, Pew Research Center analyses indicate that the likelihood of being a stay-at-home mother is higher for those with preschool-aged children— presumably because many moms return to work once their kids are in school.\n\nIn families with these highly educated, affluent non-working moms, it may be the husbands who are bringing home the bacon, but in 37% of the cases, it is the stay-at-home wives who actually have a higher level of education. In 45% of these families, the spouses have equal educational attainment, and in about 18% of the cases, the husbands have more education than their wives. An estimate using a slightly different methodology suggests that the share of all U.S. married couples where the wife has more education than the husband is about 21%.\n\nLooking at these elite stay-at-home moms a bit differently—fully 69% identify as white. A disproportionate share (19%) is Asian, while 7% are Hispanic, and 3% are black. They tend to be a bit older than other moms; about eight-in-ten are ages 35 to 69. Their median annual family income is well over $100,000.\n\nWhile a relatively small share of all mothers has a Master’s degree or more, the educational attainment of all mothers has been growing steadily in recent decades. This trend has been driven by both the increasing educational levels of all women, and the fact that fertility rates for the college-educated have not fallen as much as rates for the less educated.\n\nTopics: Work and Employment, Parenthood",
  "latent_12465": "Introduction\n\nMichael J. Hollis, creator of the Freelancers and Micro-Entrepreneurs PAC, a federal super PAC LinkedIn\n\nAligning with a political committee: most news reporters consider it a cardinal sin.\n\nBut dogma isn’t dogging Michael J. Hollis, a freelance writer and adjunct journalism professor from Texas who on Wednesday registered a federal super PAC aimed at representing the interests of work-a-day scribes, particularly contract writers.\n\nStruggling journalists, he said, shouldn’t fear prodding politicians to heed their economic concerns.\n\n“If we allow real journalism to get devalued though and allow journalists to simply become ‘content providers,’ we are participating in the death of our own industry,” said Hollis, who most recently taught courses at Park University and Concordia University Texas. “There are quite a few changes going on in the industry that are concerning to me but I think we can overcome them so long as we don’t ignore them.”\n\nSimply forming a super PAC, which by definition may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to advocate for or against politicians, guarantees nothing.\n\nMost of the nearly 1,000 federally registered super PACs in existence have raised little or no cash, according to Federal Election Commission records. Multimillion-dollar operations such as conservative American Crossroads or liberal Senate Majority PAC are rare.\n\nHollis said he wants to use the super PAC to advocate for issues and also plans to try to attract small-time entrepreneurs and non-journalist freelancers to his causes.\n\nHe will assuredly face fiscal challenges. Few working journalists ever contribute to political campaigns and committees — although there are exceptions. And freelancers, his target demographic, aren’t typically flush with surplus cash.\n\nHollis says he’s lined up some “small donations coming in next week” and will soon solicit businesses and labor unions that share the super PAC’s philosophy. But he doesn’t expect an influx of contributions, at least not immediately.\n\nSo should Hollis even attempt operating a journalist super PAC?\n\n“Absolutely. Why not?” said Dave Mason, a former Republican chairman of the Federal Election Commission and campaign deregulation advocate.\n\nBut Mason quickly noted that many journalists would likely balk on ethical grounds at supporting — financially or otherwise — this or any political committee.\n\nSkepticism among news professionals will certainly be a problem for the super PAC, which Hollis has named Freelancers and Micro-Entrepreneurs PAC, or FAME PAC.\n\nThe Society of Professional Journalists, for example, urges journalists to “avoid political and other outside activities that may compromise integrity or impartiality, or may damage credibility.”\n\nThe Associated Press requires its employees to “avoid behavior or activities — political, social or financial” that create conflict of interest or compromise our ability to report the news fairly and accurately, uninfluenced by any person or action.”\n\nAnd the New York Times‘ ethics guidelines are even more overt: “Staff members may not themselves give money to, or raise money for, any political candidate or election cause. Given the ease of Internet access to public records of campaign contributors, any political giving by a Times staff member would carry a great risk of feeding a false impression that the paper is taking sides.”\n\nPoints taken, Hollis said.\n\n“I anticipate a fair amount of resistance … but we need to at least try,” Hollis explained, noting that the people his super PAC seeks to represent are often ignored by Congress and have little voice in political debates.\n\nHe added: “I have campaigned against super PACs in the past, but I’m interested now in seeing whether or not they can be put to good use.”\n\nOne ancillary benefit Hollis says comes with forming a super PAC?\n\nThe experience could help his own journalistic endeavors.\n\n“Hopefully, what I learn from being on the inside of a PAC will guide my own future reporting on the subject,” he said. “With all of the other investigative work I have done, being on the inside is by far the best way to truly understand a subject.”",
  "latent_12478": "Sipping an Orange Crush and sinking into a back-stage leather couch, Dave Proctor comes to a quick conclusion.\n\n“I hate running right now.”\n\nThat feeling promises to be fleeting. This is not someone who sits still for long. Under the circumstances, though, it is an understandable sentiment.\n\nOnly minutes earlier, Proctor had staggered off a treadmill.\n\nAfter 24 straight hours of galloping.\n\nInside the Big Four Building at the Calgary Marathon Expo – from 4 p.m. Friday till 4 p.m. Saturday – he ran and ran and ran.\n\nPainfully, Proctor pounded out 260.4 kilometres, establishing a Guinness World Record.\n\nSo to suddenly detest his sport? Fair enough.\n\nHate away.\n\n“I don’t want to ever go out for a run,” says Proctor. “That was a terrible choice. That really, really, really hurt.”\n\nHe smiles.\n\n“But I know that three or four days will pass and I’ll get an itch.”\n\nProctor’s mood – after knocking off the equivalent of six consecutive marathons without sleep or even rest (think about that) – is impossibly sunny.\n\nHe apologizes to a person clipping a microphone to his sopping singlet – “Sorry about the sweat” – and wonders about his appearance.\n\n“How’s my hair? Is it OK?” he says. “Does it look like I ran for 24 hours?”\n\nThe mop looks fine. The man looks fine. All things considered.\n\nBut even as holder of the Canadian 24-hour record for road running – 257.093 kilometres en route to sixth place in the 2015 world championship in Italy – he had been bracing for a different beast this time.\n\nStuck indoors. In a single spot.\n\nServing as a curiosity for passersby.\n\n(Indeed, a sign taped to his treadmill read: “Please do not speak to or feed the animal.”)\n\n“I knew it was going to be a significant struggle, but I never expected it to be that hard,” says the Black Diamond resident, who, by two kilometres, eclipsed the 2004 mark set in a Mississauga, Ont., shopping mall. “I feel absolutely and utterly exhausted. I want to sleep. I’ve been awake now for far too long. All I want to do is put my head down.”\n\nUnder the banner of MitoCanada – a foundation supporting families affected by mitochondrial disease – the weekend’s spectacle raised more than $75,000.\n\nBlaine Penny, co-founder of the charity, cooked up the idea with Proctor over coffee one day at the IKEA cafeteria. And they thought, why stop at a single Guinness entry? Why not nail down a few?\n\nOr, in this case, seven – concurrently.\n\nTwo 12-person teams, with runners hammering out 30-minute shifts, crushed a pair of 24-hour standards – the men compiling 394.76 kilometres, the women 344.45. Arielle Fitzgerald shattered the women’s records for fastest 50 and 100 kilometres, 3:51.25 and 8:30.34. (Meanwhile, in Australia, Bernadette Benson rattled off 128.62 kilometres in 12 hours.)\n\nAnd Proctor?\n\nWith 139.2 kilometres, he obliterated the 12-hour mark.\n\nBut it’s the round-the-clock achievement that stands out.\n\n“Unfathomable,” says Penny. “Very few human beings in the world are capable of this. Then to execute it? Mind-blowing.”\n\nAdds Proctor’s wife Sharon: “So elated. Overwhelmed … I don’t even have words for it. Just super-proud.”\n\nThe 35-year-old’s legwork did not come easily, despite a gait that is the picture of economy.\n\nHe was bonking (“three or four times”) and blistering (a loonie-sized job on his right big toe, which, when lanced, apparently expelled at its own record-breaking distance) and barfing.\n\nFor good measure, there were moments of spasms and chafing.\n\n“I knew if anyone was going to break the Guinness World Record, it was me,” says Proctor. “(But) this was definitely the hardest race I’ve ever run.”\n\nHe killed time by listening to music, by watching movies, by keeping fuelled – bananas, oatmeal cookies, plain potato chips, Thoz Barz. (“Probably 300 to 400 calories per hour,” he says. “Multiply that by 24.”)\n\nHe slurped Red Bull, Coca-Cola, RE7, lukewarm coffee.\n\nFor pure buzz, though, nothing could beat the crowd.\n\nThousands of folks, strolling by to pick up their race packages for Sunday’s events, clapped and chanted his name, hooted and hollered.\n\nThat mattered.\n\nSo do his children – Adele, 5, Sam, 7, Julia, 10 – who were sitting directly in front of him. (Julia, noting the fashion trend towards mismatching, had been responsible for Proctor’s choice of footwear – an orange sneaker and a black one.)\n\nAt one point, he locked eyes with his mother Nancy and told her how much he loved her.\n\nNevertheless, with 90 minutes (and 13 kilometres) to go, he suffered through his toughest patch – “extreme stomach issues.” Grim times.\n\nSo Penny sauntered over and delivered a quiet yet impassioned plea, talking about his son Evan, who is afflicted by mitochondrial disease.\n\n“An amazing story … pretty inspirational stuff,” says Proctor. “Then, how do you not fight? How do you not push? I told him, ‘My legs are gone, my lungs are gone, but my spirit’s good. I’ll break these records.’ ”\n\n=\n\nscruickshank@postmedia.com\n\nTwitter.com/CruickshankCH",
  "latent_12556": "OpinionAbortion\n\nSeptember 6, 2016 (Life Issues Institute) -- All along I’ve felt somewhat suspect that the Zika virus is linked to microcephaly. The US Centers for Disease Control and the New England Journal of Medicine both concluded the link is there. Both are heavy hitters in the realm of research, however, they admit there’s no studied verification.\n\nPlanned Parenthood and the abortion industry were quick to jump on the abortion bandwagon for pregnant women with confirmed or suspected cases of the Zika virus.\n\nBut a recent, expansive study has cast legitimate doubt on the Zika/microcephaly connection.\n\nAnxiety over Zika has affected the Olympic and Paralympic games in Rio, as well as impacting the cruise industry in Florida where Zika cases have been reported. Concern continues to grow.\n\nPlanned Parenthood and the rest of the abortion industry were quick to insert themselves into the medical crisis because they’re absolutely desperate to link abortion to any perceived common good and they thought the Zika virus was their ride to glory. As a result, they’ve been advocating abortion for at-risk pregnant women. Planned Parenthood even hired canvassers to go door-to-door in Miami.\n\nThe New England Complex Systems Institute has shed new light on the situation and opened the possibility that the declared Zika link may be premature. The study is expansive and so credible that the New England Journal of Medicine published the preliminary results. The caution here is that the research only deals with the third trimester of pregnancy.\n\nThe study looked at nearly 12,000 pregnant Colombian women infected with Zika. None of them had a baby with microcephaly. Four cases of microcephaly were reported with women who didn’t have Zika symptoms and were not part of the study, which is consistent with the normal expected number of cases.\n\nBased on estimated numbers there should be about 60,000 pregnant women in Colombia with the Zika virus, yet there are hardly any cases of microcephaly so far. If the link to Zika is legitimate, we should begin to see a dramatic increase in the number of babies with microcephaly.\n\nSo what is the potential culprit?\n\nSome scientists believe pesticides may be the source, specifically pyriproxyfen. It’s effective in controlling mosquitoes by acting as a larvicide. It interferes, the researchers say, with the development of mosquito larvae.\n\nClick \"like\" if you are PRO-LIFE!\n\nDo you recognize the possible link?\n\nPyriproxyfen may also have a detrimental effect on developing unborn babies.\n\nHere’s why American researchers may be interested in this study.\n\nPyriproxyfen was sprayed in areas with a high rate of microcephaly. Even more noteworthy is that they put this chemical in the drinking water in Pernambuco, a state in Brazil at ground zero in the Zika epidemic. The chemical was sprayed and added to the water just before the outbreak of microcephaly.\n\nThese early findings aren’t conclusive—especially considering the study related only to third trimester of pregnancy—but they do open the possibility that Zika may not be the cause of the increase in microcephaly cases. We must follow the research to see where it leads and respond effectively while we protect pregnant women and their unborn babies regardless of the child’s disability.\n\nReprinted with permission from the Life Issues Institute.",
  "latent_12572": "Let me get this out of the way up front: This blog post will not be the definitive word on the contentious subject of a Times article in Sunday’s Automobiles section. It’s just an early effort to put some claims and counterclaims out there, while I continue to look into it.\n\nI will keep reporting on this, and, for now, am simply telling readers what I know so far.\n\nJohn M. Broder set out to test drive the Tesla S Model electric car with a trip up the East Coast, starting in suburban Washington. His trip ended unsuccessfully, he wrote – so unsuccessfully that the car made one of the last parts of its journey on a flatbed truck.\n\nHe wrote: “The Model S has won multiple car-of-the-year awards and is, many reviews would have you believe, the coolest car on the planet. What fun, no? Well, no.”\n\nElon Musk, the chief executive of the Tesla car company, strongly disagrees about what happened. In a blog post Wednesday night, he used the driving logs to state that Mr. Broder misrepresented what happened on the test drive.\n\n“Our Model S never had a chance with John Broder,” he wrote\n\nMr. Musk said that, along the way, Mr. Broder unplugged the car before it was fully charged, drove faster than he claimed and drove around in circles to deliberately run down the battery.\n\nAnd, he added, “He simply did not accurately capture what happened and worked very hard to force our car to stop running.” Mr. Musk released screen shots of the car driving logs to reinforce his points.\n\nMr. Broder’s article was certainly negative for Tesla. And Mr. Musk’s contentions are devastating ones for any journalist.\n\nI will be interviewing Mr. Broder later on Thursday. When I reached him earlier, he said that he and his editors were working on a point-by-point response to Mr. Musk’s blog that would appear on The Times’s Wheels blog. An earlier post on that blog made an initial response on the matter, but that predated Mr. Musk’s release of the logs. I’ll link to the new post when it’s available.\n\nMr. Musk has not returned my call, made at about noon on Thursday. I eventually intend to ask him to fully release and “open source” the driving logs, along with whatever other data might be necessary for better understanding and interpretation.\n\nHere is a discussion on Reddit.\n\nAnd here is an article from Wired, and another from Forbes.\n\nThere will be more to come.\n\nUPDATES: This piece from The Atlantic Wire questions the validity of Mr. Musk’s assertions and his use of the data. Many of the commenters, though, disagree with the article. By late afternoon, I had tried two more times to reach Mr. Musk, to no avail.\n\nMr. Broder’s detailed response to Mr. Musk’s accusations has been posted on The Times’s Wheels blog. I hope to post again Friday with some conclusions, but for now, based on a day’s reporting, I will say this much: I reject Mr. Musk’s central contention that Mr. Broder’s Sunday piece was faked to sabotage the Model S or the electric car industry.",

Guess what the cow has done this time?\n\nAmerica’s dairy farmers could soon find themselves in the computer business, with the manure from their cows possibly powering the vast data centers of companies like Google and Microsoft. While not immediately intuitive, the idea plays on two trends: the building of computing centers in more rural locales, and dairy farmers’ efforts to deal with cattle waste by turning it into fuel.\n\nWith the right skills, a dairy farmer could rent out land and power to technology companies and recoup an investment in the waste-to-fuel systems within two years, Hewlett-Packard engineers say in a research paper to be made public on Wednesday.\n\n“Information technology and manure have a symbiotic relationship,” said Chandrakant D. Patel, the director of H.P.’s sustainable information technology laboratory, which wrote the report. “And having these data centers locally will give farmers a new opportunity.”\n\nCompanies have historically tended to build their large computing centers — often called server farms — in or near large cities and industries. As this practice has continued over the years, it has become difficult for companies building the largest data centers to find enough cheap electricity and real estate to meet their needs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe rise of higher-speed data transfer networks, however, has given technology companies a chance to move farther from large populations and still be able to get information to them as quickly as they need it.

  "latent_13031": "There’s no way Frank Zappa would have wanted it like this. The enigmatic, brilliant, avant-garde rock composer departed this world in 1993, leaving behind a complicated yet revered body of musical work, wife Gail and four children — Moon Unit, Dweezil, Ahmet and Diva. Gail set up the Zappa Family Trust shortly after Frank’s death to ensure that her husband’s legacy was properly taken care of by those who care about him the most — his widow and his children. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nIn the 1990s, Ahmet and Dweezil played together under the band name Z. The new millennium brought about a new project, a family tribute of sorts called Zappa Plays Zappa, led by Dweezil and occasionally featuring former Frank Zappa side players. After Gail's death in October 2015, for reasons that remain unclear, Ahmet and Diva were each given 30 percent shares in the Zappa Family Trust, with Ahmet acting as trustee. Dweezil and Moon were beneficiaries only, with 20 percent each.\n\nThat's when things got nasty. Dweezil's siblings, acting through the trust, suddenly got very particular about the name that Dweezil is allowed to perform under, forcing him to change his show's name from Zappa Plays Zappa to Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa and then, when that name still brought a cease-and-desist letter from the estate, to the more pointed “50 Years of Frank: Dweezil Zappa Plays Whatever the Fuck He Wants — the Cease & Desist tour.”\n\nContinue Reading\n\n“I think most people, when they hear about what’s going on, they just wonder why we all can’t work it out to make this easier, work together to make the Zappa family legacy as great as it can be and have everybody involved,” Dweezil says. “It’s because the people that are involved want to do things a particular way that doesn’t have the best interests of all four of the beneficiaries of the trust. They’re doing things that are purposeful to create problems — problems I didn’t have when my mother was in charge. I had some problems with her, but they’re way worse now with Ahmet and Diva.”\n\nPut simply, Dweezil and Moon must ask Ahmet’s permission before using the family’s name in any musical venture. Which makes things a little complicated for Dweezil, since he is both a musician and a Zappa. Can the terms of the family trust prevent Dweezil from going out and using his own surname? Dweezil doesn’t think so.\n\n“There’s a trademark issue that’s happening where [Ahmet and Diva] have filed to establish themselves as exclusive rights holders of the surname Zappa,” Dweezil says. “Anything that is ticketed entertainment — live music, personal appearance, music production, music festivals — all these things, they want to have the exclusive rights to the name Zappa. If they were to be granted the exclusive rights to the name Zappa, they could have the ability to block me from being able to use the name my father gave me to identify myself. So much of this is completely unnecessary and a huge waste of money. But they’re spending the money of the trust to do it.”\n\nSo for now, Frank’s kids split into two even camps, with no sign of a resolution. It is, says Dweezil, ridiculous. “Nobody can understand it, least of all me,” Dweezil says. “I have the ability to play my dad’s music, and I have no intention of stopping either the touring or playing the music. But all of the things that they’ve done only hurt them in the long run. They’ve taken themselves out of the ability to even sell any official Zappa merchandise at my shows.”\n\nFor fans, the family standoff is particularly frustrating, because Dweezil does a wonderful job of interpreting his dad’s music in a live environment — no easy task for even the most accomplished musicians. Yet deconstructing and reconstructing the songs offers Dweezil a continuation of a loving father/son relationship as he unravels the DNA of the music and finds little, previously unheard intricacies.\n\n“Every time I have that experience, I always wish that I could ask him, ‘Oh my God, how’d you come up with that? This part is genius,’” Dweezil says. “My dad’s music is the kind of thing where, even if you thought you recognized the pattern, when you really do the due diligence to learn the stuff, you see that everything is its own thing. At first listen you might think it’ll be a certain kind of chord progression, or you think you’ve got an idea of what the rhythm is, but then you find out that it’s different than what you thought.”\n\nA respected guitarist and songwriter in his own right, Dweezil’s last solo album of original material, Via Zammata, surfaced in 2015. But while he considers it important as an artist to write and release new music, his recent focus has been on Frank’s legacy and all of the hard work that comes with preparing for that.\n\n“It takes a lot of effort to keep the band together and keep the music rehearsed,” he says. “So if we play 80 to 100 shows a year and then the traveling and rehearsal that goes with that, that takes up at least six or seven months out of the year. ... My other main priority would be spending time with my wife and kids.”\n\nInterpreting the music of Frank Zappa in the modern world is an interesting endeavor, even for members of his own family. The technology is so advanced now, the tools to make weird and wonderful noises so readily available, that new fans struggle to comprehend how far ahead of his time Frank was. Like, say, innovative French composer Jean-Michel Jarre, Zappa was an inventor almost as much as he was an artist.\n\n“If he wanted to extend the range of a woodwind, a horn or something else to make it play notes that it couldn’t otherwise play, he would vary-speed the tape, and he would be able to record the instrument at a different speed so that it would play back at the proper pitch,” Dweezil says. “So songs like ‘Peaches en Regalia,’ for example, have elements like that where you’re essentially inventing a new instrument.”\n\nThat’s the joy for Dweezil; he’s forced to examine the songs in order to play them — delve into every little element and question how certain sounds were made. In doing so, he gets to know his father even better, and we as an audience get to experience the music, so much of it born right here in Los Angeles, all over again.\n\nDweezil Zappa: 50 Years of Frank comes to the Fonda Theatre on Saturday, May 6.

After a while I am unable to maintain an erection out of fear that I am going to cause her more pain if I try to enter her. If I touch her at the opening of her vagina, she complains of pain at the bottom of it. I have tried using my finger but I am unable to get much in without causing her much pain and discomfort. Do you think that this may be because her hymen is still fully intact? I am thinking about getting a personal lubricant for the next time we try.

(1) It is crucial that she starts with Kegel excercises – research that – as that will help her to gain more voluntary control over the muscles directly involved during sex and that will help her to relax the muscles when they start tensing; (2) further it would be wonderful if you as the partner could assist her with your fingers (start with one until you are relaxed enough and then progress to two until she is comfortable and then three. Once you can insert 3 fingers you should be able to handle penetration by your partner. (3) Try to prevent penetration at all times until she is relaxed enough and lubricated enough (use KY if she does not have enough body fluids) and relaxed enough. If you find it difficult to achieve or address on your own; it always help to do it in conjunction with discussions and therapy with a relationship therapist that can contain the relationship and your dynamic while your work on this physically on your own.\n\nIt is important to be patient with one another and relaxed.

Derrick Miller\n\nIn prior posts we have brought you the infuriating details about the injustice facing our American son, Sgt. Derrick Miller.\n\nSgt. Miller sits in Leavenworth Prison with a life sentence for premeditated murder for killing an Afghan he had stopped previously for surveilling his base in a hostile zone. These actions saved the lives of Derrick’s brothers.\n\nBack in September, when supporters stood on the Capitol steps asking for help from congress for relief in Derrick’s sentence, they were joined by Retired LCpl Dave Madaras.\n\nMadaras wrote a letter to Congressman Delaney of Maryland on Derrick’s behalf (see below).\n\nMadaras’ letter is exceptionally powerful and poignant because he is a survivor of the October 23, 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut which killed 241 and wounded 100 more of our brave men.\n\nMadaras’s letter makes the powerful point that Derrick saved the lives of his mean that day.\n\nOn September 26, 2010, when the incident occurred on Derrick’s base, the base immediately went on 100% security and all our soldiers were moved from their positions. An hour later the base was attacked. We did not lose one precious American son that day because of these changes in positions. Derrick’s instincts in recognizing Atta Mohammed from the prior day (when Derrick stopped Mohammed who was driving a truck with a 50 gallon empty drum, guns, change of clothes and laptops) saved the lives of his brothers. Madaras shared with Congressman Delaney, “I know I am not the only one who if time was turned back would willingly sacrifice my life and do whatever it took to stop that truck!”\n\nDerrick did stop a truck, in the form of Atta Mohammed, to protect his men and instead of being held as a hero, he is languishing in prison for life. As Madaras wisely states in his letter to Delaney,\n\n“I am writing to bring your attention to an Army Veteran who is serving time in Ft. Leavenworth for, “murder,” when he should be decorated for valor.”\n\nPlease take the time to read this letter and contact your congressman and senator TODAY to ask for their help in having Sgt. Miller’s sentence reduced and allow him to return home to his two little girls.\n\nPresident-Elect Trump — Please Free this American Patriot!\n\nDerrick Miller Congressional Letter by Jim Hoft on Scribd",

He talked about moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, and named an outspoken critic of Obama’s policies, David Friedman, as U.S. ambassador to Israel.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYet Trump has wavered on some promises since then.\n\nHe’s backed off the pledge to move the embassy to Jerusalem, and had criticized the building of new Israeli settlements.\n\nIn an Oval Office meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov last week, Trump allegedly revealed sensitive intelligence about an ISIS plot. The New York Times reported that Israel was the source of the information.\n\nHeadlines in Israel have also been dominated about a controversy over Jerusalem’s Western Wall, which Trump plans to visit.\n\nA U.S. diplomat was quoted on Israeli television as stating that the Western Wall was in “occupied territory” and that it would not be appropriate, as a result, for Netanyahu to accompany Trump on the visit.\n\nIsrael reacted with outrage, arguing it could not be the president’s position that Netanyahu not visit a site considered one of Judaism’s most sacred places.\n\nThe White House said the comments by the diplomat did not reflect the U.S. position.\n\nThe Netanyahu government has largely shrugged off the controversies.\n\n“The security relationship between Israel and our great ally the United States is deep, meaningful and unprecedented in its scope and contribution to our strength,” Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman tweeted. “That is how it has been and that is how it will continue to be.”\n\nNetanyahu had a poor relationship with Obama and has invested in better ties with the Trump administration, which perhaps gives him little choice but to play down any diplomatic hiccups.\n\nSince Netanyahu's 2015 surprise reelection, his political opponents have been in disarray and his security-first approach has cemented his support among Israelis. Trump's victory last November gave Netanyahu another political victory, after both men supported each other's campaign efforts.\n\nStill, that's given Trump leverage to demand Israeli concessions.\n\nThe Jerusalem Post reported Thursday that Trump plans to demand a slowdown in Israeli settlement growth in the West Bank, a request Trump made at a joint press conference at the White House, asking Netanyahu to \"hold back a bit\" on new constructions.\n\nThat pushback resonated with the Palestinian Authority, whose political star has faded amid internal squabbling and a politically emboldened Netanyahu.\n\nTrump is scheduled to visit the West Bank town of Bethlehem for a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas Tuesday. Palestinians will use the meeting to bolster a weakened Abbas.\n\nElias Zananiri, a spokesman for Abbas, claimed hopefully that Trump's visit could re-ignite the peace process.\n\n“There is a chance something happens — something good,” said Zananiri. “If it works, he will be crowned king of the world. If it doesn’t, he’ll say ‘I tried.'”\n\nBut few outside the Palestinian Authority expect the trip to change the dynamic between Netanyahu and Abbas.\n\n“I don’t hold very high hopes on rekindling the fire between [Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas] after Trump’s visit,” said Avital Leibovitch, the Jerusalem director for the American Jewish Committee (AJC) — the oldest Jewish civil rights advocacy organization — and a former Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) spokeswoman under Netanyahu\n\nIsraeli Arabs — Christians and Muslims who live in Israel and hold full citizenship — aren’t holding their breath either.\n\n“It’s good for Trump, not for the region,” Dr. Hanna Swaid, a Christian Israeli Arab and former member of the Knesset, said of the visit.\n\nKhalil Shikaki, director of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, a group that tracks Palestinian and Israeli public sentiment, said Palestinians at ground level have a similar attitude.\n\nShikaki said only 5 percent of Palestinians view Trump as a friend, and 85 percent said his election would not have a positive impact.\n\n“Most Palestinians do not believe that any of this is serious,” said Shikaki.",

  "latent_13386": "ROMAN age skeletons have been unearthed at a school in Worcestershire.\n\nThe two incomplete adult skeletons, an adult female and a younger adult male, during building works at Overbury Primary School, near Bredon in February this year.\n\nExperts from the Worcestershire County Council Archives and Archaeology Service have now confirmed that remains are from Roman times.\n\nThe adult female, aged over 50, was found with hobnails, which are associated with rural Roman agricultural burials.\n\nThe other was an adult male, aged 25 to 30 who had signs of degenerative joints and osteoarthritis. Also found were a selection of Roman pots.\n\nArchaeologist Tom Vaughan said: \"The remains have been thoroughly examined and found to be from the Roman era. The excavations, including the finds of hobnails with the adult female are typical of Roman internments in the area and similar to recent excavations near Wyre Piddle and St John's, Worcester. It is well known that there was Roman occupation around Bredon Hill.\"\n\nHe said that hobnails are characteristic of Roman burials and may be associated with a physically demanding agricultural lifestyle.\n\nRecent research suggests that females played an important role in Roman agriculture on the continent. Female labourers were likely to have been employed in work on farmsteads, such as preparing food, manufacturing cloth and even general labour.\n\nMr Vaughan added: \"This discovery seems to support evidence that during Roman times there were small farmsteads in Worcestershire, owned or run by a family.\n\n\"The recovery and analysis of the remains has provided important information which has contributed to the growing archaeological evidence for the nature of dispersed burial practices during the Roman period in rural Worcestershire.\"\n\nCllr Lucy Hodgson, cabinet member for localism and communities, said: \"These are very interesting finds and show the importance of carrying out digs like this in order to discover more about our history.\"",

Last week, we discussed how our goal in designing each Prismata unit is to find the best, most balanced, and most interesting version of that unit, and showed how specific opening timings can create design challenges because certain unit designs can favour certain players or certain strategies too much.\n\nLike last time, I’ll be sharing a few pages from our developer-exclusive secret opening book. To understand how to analyze some of the rushes and timings that exist in these openings, we first need to discuss two important strategy game concepts: Tempo and Initiative.\n\nTempo and initiative in Prismata\n\nYou may have heard of concepts like initiative and tempo when studying traditional games like chess, strategy games like StarCraft, or card games like Magic and Hearthstone (these topics are so vital to overall strategy that they’ve even got their own Wikipedia pages!) In a game like chess, the player with the initiative is the player who can make the stronger threats, forcing the opponent to make defensive or reactive plays rather than counterattacking. Tempo (a term used to avoid confusion with “time”, which might refer to the actual time remaining on a player’s clock) is a concept that exists in any strategy game where progress has value—players who can use time efficiently (or force their opponent to use time inefficiently) can effectively “generate a tempo advantage” by making more progress than their opponent in the same number of moves (or same amount of real time, in the case of RTS games). In chess, a player can sometimes “gain a tempo” (get one move ahead in development) by giving up a pawn, making a threat, or otherwise forcing their opponent to make inefficient moves or repeatedly move the same pieces. In collectible card games, players aim to “generate tempo” by making efficient use of their mana and limiting the options of their opponents.\n\nTempo and initiative both play a strong role in Prismata strategy, and the two concepts are always kept at the forefront of our minds when optimizing the design of Prismata units for balance. Before we get to that, however, I want to give a quick overview of how tempo and initiative are relevant in Prismata.\n\nInitiative\n\nInitiative is something that exists in almost every Prismata game. If you construct the first attacker, and your opponent is forced to spend their resources building a Wall instead of an attacker of their own, you’ve “got the initiative”. Having the initiative allows you to determine the pace of the game; by pressuring your opponent, you can control how big your opponent can grow their economy and you can sometimes prevent them from accessing important techs that might thwart your plans. By rushing out multiple early Scorchillas or Tesla Coils, you can even force your opponent to commit substantial resources to defending before they have the opportunity to build up their own attacking forces.\n\nWhen you have the initiative, you have the ability to force your opponent to make defensive and reactive plays.\n\nYou don’t even have to build attackers to develop an initiative in Prismata; sometimes, just threatening to build them is enough. If you’ve got enough resources stored up to build a Tia Thurnax, your opponent might be forced to play defensively even if you never build it!\n\nThe initiative is valuable in most Prismata games, but it comes at a cost. In terms of their raw value and price, attackers are designed to be more efficient than workers and defenders in the long run. However, you need to build up a sufficiently large attack before you reap the rewards of your investment. There are two reasons for this:\n\nThe initial Engineers that your opponent begins the game with can provide a “home base advantage”, effectively allowing them to defend against your first few offensive blows without committing any of their resources to defense. Walls and other absorbing units can render the first few attacks of your early units almost entirely wasted. If larger defenders like Energy Matrix or Centurion are present, this effect is even further amplified.\n\nBy taking the initiative and building attacking units before your opponent, you generally have to make due with a smaller economy or tech level. If you take the initiative too early (e.g. by building an Animus on the first turn and spamming as many Tarsiers as you can), then your small economy may never produce enough attackers to provide a good return on your investment, and you’ll lose. However, as both players grow their economies, it becomes increasingly beneficial to seize the initiative. To see why, consider the following:\n\nDrones generate value as soon as you buy them.\n\nAttackers only generate value once you have enough of them to start killing stuff (and get “over the hump” of your opponent’s first Wall).\n\nAs economy sizes grow and both players become capable of producing more attackers per turn, the amount of time (tempo) needed to get over this “hump” decreases.\n\nConclusion: seizing the initiative gets more and more valuable as the game progresses.\n\nUnits that threaten a lot of sudden damage, like Shadowfangs, Electrovores, and Tesla Coils, can provide a strong burst of initiative, accelerating the game (and making it correct to purchase fewer Drones). Conversely, large absorbing defenders like Energy Matrix often lead to games where it’s correct to go for a larger economy, because more attackers are required to get “over the hump” before the defender starts losing units. The decision of “when should I buy my first attacker” is often incredibly difficult in Prismata, as it depends heavily on the availability of fast attackers and powerful defenders, as well as the types of tech available to you and your opponent. More on that topic next week.\n\nTempo\n\nPeople often use the terms “tempo” and “initiative” interchangeably, but they’re quite distinct concepts. A good way to understand the concept of tempo in Prismata is via analogy with chess—another turn-based game. In chess lingo, the term “tempo” is a countable noun used in a quantified sense: if you allow your opponent to freely make two moves in a row, you would have “lost a tempo” by falling one move behind in your development. A lost tempo in the opening is typically seen as being worth about a third of a pawn in value, though this can vary depending on other factors in a given position. Playing as white, you automatically start the game with an advantage of half a tempo (if you “passed” on your first move, you would lose one tempo and switch from being half a tempo ahead to half a tempo behind). Tempo can often be a source of initiative and tempo advantages translate into statistically significant increases in win percentage, as exemplified by white’s winrate in chess being several percentage points above black’s (a number of studies on the subject are linked here.)\n\nIn Prismata, one whole turn is much too coarse to use as a metric for determining tempo advantage (passing a whole turn during the opening phases of a Prismata game would translate into a deficit so large that even the strongest Prismata players would likely not be able to overcome it against any competent opponent.) The tempo gains and losses seen in a typical game occur at a much more granular level. As an example, leaving back one Drone as player 2 during your first turn could be seen as giving up about 1/7th of a move worth of tempo (though some may argue that 1/10th is a more accurate number than 1/7th, since you’d be starting your second turn with 9 available gold instead of 10.) Even this—a 1-gold difference—is a fairly large amount; enough to shift a player’s win percentage by several points.\n\nTo understand how to quantify differences in tempo, think of a game of Prismata as a race where you and your opponent each take a single step forward each turn, aiming to be the first to cross some unforeseen finish line. It’s not a perfect analogy, but it’s fairly accurate during the opening phases of the game. Initially, player 1 is half a step behind in the race, but is given the chance to take the first step. As you and your opponent take turns building up your economies and purchasing your initial tech, you each step further forward than your opponent stepped during their last turn: at the beginning of your turns, you typically have fewer units than your opponent, but in spending one turn worth of resources, your army size surges ahead, and you leapfrog over your opponent’s army size, ending the turn with more units than your opponent. Your opponent then begins their turn with fewer units than you, and the cycle continues, each of you taking a step forward during your turn, ending up half a step ahead of where your opponent just was.\n\nHence, at the end of each turn during the opening, you’ll have an advantage in army size. The magnitude of this advantage will typically be about half of what you can produce in a turn.\n\nIf your opponent handicaps themselves by leaving a Drone back during their first turn, the effect will be the following: your end-of-turn advantage will be greater than your opponent’s. In other words, at the end of your turns, you’ll be more than a half-step ahead of your opponent, who will be less than a half-step ahead of you. This is precisely the definition of a tempo lead:\n\nWhen your end-of-turn army size advantage is greater than your opponent’s, you’re ahead in tempo.\n\nOf course, there are many complications, and even determining who has a tempo lead can sometimes be difficult. There are different metrics to use (start-of-turn army size also works), and stored resources are complicated to account for correctly (storing resources is usually slightly less efficient than spending them, but stored resources can be more valuable than spent ones if they provide additional options in future turns).\n\nGenerally speaking, having more stuff is a good thing in Prismata, and being ahead in tempo is, for most purposes, equivalent to being ahead in stuff.\n\nThere are many ways to generate a tempo lead in Prismata, but a core principle is simply “be less wasteful than your opponent”. One of the key ways in which beginners often fall behind in tempo is simply by wasting resources. Unspent red and blue resources contribute inefficiency to your turns, causing your “forward steps” to be smaller. Leaving back Drones and attackers unnecessarily has a similar effect. On the other hand, hyper-efficient resource-producing units like Flame Animus and Gaussite Symbiote can produce tempo leads if you can manage to integrate them into your tech-construction plans.\n\nDoomed Drone is another favourite tempo-gainer. Being so cheap, it’s easy to fit Doomed Drone into many builds, allowing you to squeeze out an extra worker in situations where you’d otherwise need to bank leftover resources.\n\nUnits like Centrifuge and Zemora Voidbringer force you to pay up front for benefits that don’t arrive until several turns later. When you pay for a Zemora Voidbringer, those resources are effectively gone for six turns; you’re providing your opponent with a massive (but temporary) tempo advantage in hopes that you can later surge into the lead when your Zemora arrives. These types of dynamic tempo swings make for some highly entertaining games, so expect to see more units with longer build times in the future.\n\nHow tempo and initiative influence unit balance\n\nLet’s consider Scorchilla for a moment. Many months ago, Scorchilla had a price of 7RG and a build time of 1. Now he’s got a price of 5RG and a build time of 2. Why did we make the change?\n\nThat change was aimed at one specific opening. At a cost of 7RG, player two had an incredibly strong Scorchilla rush, which went as follows:\n\n1) .. DD\n\n2) .. DDC\n\n3) .. DA\n\n4) .. 2xScorchilla\n\nThis rush yielded a huge initiative swing on turn 5, with 6 damage threatened. Moreover, it’s a strong tempo play, with very efficient resource usage and no waste of any kind, since it can easily be followed up with more Scorchillas, Rhinos, and other units that efficiently consume the red and green resources generated in subsequent turns. Before the change, Scorchilla was the most player-2-favouring unit in Prismata at the time, with over 57% of ranked games going to player 2 whenever Scorchilla was present.\n\nStrangely enough, the new 5RG Scorchilla isn’t much weaker in terms of its overall value. The 2-gold decrease in price is pretty fair as compensation for the 1-turn increase in build time. However, the above player 2 Scorchilla rush no longer provides nearly as much of a lead in tempo or initiative, so it’s much weaker. Instead, if player 2 wants to threaten 6 damage on turn 5, they have to give up a much larger amount of their economy to obtain the same initiative, by executing a build like the following:\n\n1) .. DC\n\n2) .. A\n\n3) .. 2xScorchilla\n\nThis build is not nearly as strong as the old Scorchilla rush, though it can still be playable in some situations (its success likely depends on the presence of other strong red and red-green units to provide additional support for the rush).\n\nAs a result of our changes to Scorchilla, the player 2 winrate advantage completely disappeared (as did the massive pile of complaints building up in our inbox). Lesson learned: units that produce big swings in initiative need to be priced very carefully to ensure that players don’t have access to timings that are too strong. Especially among lower ranked players who are less skilled at planning against builds like the old 7RG Scorchilla rush, tempo and initiative together can be completely game-winning.\n\nSomething to think about\n\nThis whole discussion of tempo and initiative is really just to prepare you for next week’s article, which will delve into the nitty-gritty details of opening balance and rush timings. To whet your appetite, I’m going to give you something to think about concerning a few openings from our secret opening book. They all involve the biggest blue attacker in the game—Odin.\n\nQuestion: Say you’re playing a Prismata game involving Odin. Which of the following openings is the strongest (and what does the answer depend on?)\n\na) Player 2 turn 5 Odin\n\n1) .. DD (storing 1 gold)\n\n2) .. DD (storing 4)\n\n3) .. DBB (storing 2)\n\n4) .. B (storing 9)\n\n5) .. Odin\n\nb) Player 1 turn 6 Odin\n\n1) DD\n\n2) DDE\n\n3) DDD (storing 1)\n\n4) DDDB\n\n5) BB (storing 6)\n\n6) Odin\n\nc) Player 2 turn 6 Odin\n\n1) .. DD (storing 1)\n\n2) .. DDE (storing 2)\n\n3) .. DDD (storing 4)\n\n4) .. DDDB (storing 4)\n\n5) .. DDDBB (storing 2)\n\n6) .. Odin\n\nd) Player 1 turn 7 Odin\n\n1) DD\n\n2) DDE\n\n3) DDD (storing 1)\n\n4) DDDB\n\n5) DDDS (storing 1)\n\n6) DSBB (storing 1)\n\n7) Odin\n\ne) None of the above\n\nThe answer will be revealed next week! See you then!",
  "latent_13803": "A Brief History\n\nOn August 18, 1612, the trials of the “Pendle Witches” began in England. 22 years later to the day, across the Channel in France, Urbain Grandier was convicted of sorcery and burned alive. Apparently the 18th of August is not a good day to be a witch in Europe, at least not back in the 17th century.\n\nDigging Deeper\n\nThe 12 accused witches of Pendle Hill in Lancashire, England were suspected of having used witchcraft to murder 10 people. One died in prison. Of the 11 who went to trial (2 men and 9 women), 10 were found guilty and hanged. Only 1 of the accused was acquitted. From the early 1400s through the early 1700s, close to 500 people were convicted of witchcraft in England, and most of them were hanged (as were the witches in Salem, Massachusetts).\n\nThe trouble with witches in Lancashire stemmed largely from James I, King of England at the time. James I was fascinated by witches and witchcraft and wrote a book called Daemonologie (1597). In 1612 he feared that witches throughout his realm were conspiring against him, so he ordered the justices of the peace in Lancashire to compile a list of people who did not attend church or who did not support the Church of England, as that area was known to have lingering Catholic sentiments. Those who did not go along with the national religion were suspected of witchcraft and eventually charged with murder, even if their supposed victims had long since died.\n\nThe trials of the “Pendle Witches” are unusually well documented because a clerk by the name of Thomas Potts had been directed to write a current account of the proceedings. This account was published in 1613 as The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the County of Lancaster.\n\nMeanwhile, in France on August 18, 1634, Urbain Grandier, a priest, found himself in Cardinal Richelieu’s disfavor for criticizing his policies, for expressing non-traditional theological beliefs and for questioning celibacy in the Catholic priesthood. Father Grandier became the victim of a political witch hunt and was convicted of having sent the demon Asmodai to do filthy things to a group of nuns in 1632. Allegedly, the mother superior of the convent had her roving eye on Father Grandier, a man known for his sexual prowess. Grandier supposedly rejected her advances, which caused her (a woman scorned) to seek revenge by accusing him of having used black magic to seduce her.\n\nAlthough acquitted of seducing the nuns, his criticism of Cardinal Richelieu could not go unpunished, so he was convicted at a second trial and burned at the stake. Part of the “evidence” against Grandier was a pact with the Devil that had been written down in Latin, backwards. Famous writers such as Aldous Huxley and Alexander Dumas incorporated aspects of this case in their works, and the incident was adapted for the stage, screen and opera.\n\nIf you have ever been the victim of a “witch hunt,” you should be able to relate to these poor victims of ignorance and hate.\n\nIf you do happen to be a witch, stay away from Sarah Palin’s minister. He actually persecuted witches in Africa!\n\nFor more interesting events that happened on August 18, please see the History and Headlines articles: “Virginia Dare is Born” and “10 Major Steps in Women’s Rights.”\n\nHistorical Evidence\n\nFor more information, please see…",
  "latent_13826": "Edit as You Write, the Right Way: 5 Steps\n\nI’ve been asked a few times about this: “What do you think of the whole, ‘Don’t edit as you write’ thing?” This is about why I feel very strongly that writers should edit - but also the steps to do it without going nuts. I’m going to share with you how you can edit as you go, so your story will be cohesive by the time you reach the last page.\n\nPerhaps one of the worst bits of writing advice ever given is also one of the most commonly spread: “Don’t edit as you write. Just finish your first draft.”\n\nWell, don’t believe it. Here’s what to do instead, step-by-step.\n\nThe intention of the “don’t edit as you write” is a good one: just write. Finish your manuscript. Many writers have a hard time finishing what they started, and so what they might need most is completion.\n\nIf what you need most as a writer is to actually complete a manuscript, then do that. Throw words onto pages until you have the proper word count. Just don’t expect it to be anything salvageable - because it might not be.\n\nThe biggest problem with NOT editing as you go\n\nIf you burrow through your first draft, working from page 1 to The End, your chances of having a story that can ever be edited to a point where it’s ready to publish aren’t that good.\n\nThe organizers of NaNoWriMo argue the exact opposite. But the National Novel Writing Month is just that: it’s a short-term exercise to finish a novel-length manuscript in 30 days. That doesn’t mean you’ll have a real story at the end of 30 days.\n\nIt doesn’t even mean you’ll have a manuscript that’s good enough to edit. What it does mean is that you’ll likely have a manuscript that needs a complete rewrite.\n\nSo the question you should ask yourself first is this: do I want to write 50,000 words or do I want to write a novel? If you need a sense of completion and you just want to see if you can physically do it before you die, like a bucket list item – then do the NaNoWriMo. But if you want to be a writer, just don’t.\n\nNot even Stephen King, one of the most prolific authors, writes a novel per month. (While some of his novels are quite long, not all are. Carrie is about 63,000 words). Remember too: this is what King does full time. It is his day job.\n\nSo don’t beat yourself up if you need a year to write your first novel.\n\nDon’t write from start to finish\n\nAs a writing teacher, I’ve seen over and over that the process of writing a story isn’t so clear cut, isn’t so A-to-Z, and that if you do not edit as you go, your story will unravel completely.\n\nSo write scenes as you envision them most strongly and vividly. If you know exactly what you want in the inciting incident, then write that scene.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with writing your manuscript out of sequence. In fact, I recommend it. Just be sure you’ve written an outline first.\n\nWhy you should edit as you go\n\nScene to scene, it’s really important that your style, your narration, your character details – that all the things you put into your story – come together, work together.\n\nIf into page 30 you realize that your narrative voice is wrong, then you should definitely go back and edit the first 30 pages.\n\nDon’t just push forward and write the whole manuscript, switching around your narrative voice – or worse, staying in the voice you originally chose, determining to edit it later. You’re just creating more work for yourself.\n\nIt’s much easier to edit the first 30 pages, fix what you feel strongly should be fixed – and then see if you’re right. You won’t really know whether your narrative voice should actually be changed or not until you try it. So try it.\n\nYou could edit perhaps 10 pages of what you’ve written so far. Test it out and see what happens. Does the story work better? If it does, then you can edit the rest - and then keep moving forward with your new narrative concept.\n\nThe EDIT-AS-YOU-GO 5 Steps\n\nStep One\n\nWrite any 10-20 pages of your manuscript – any pages at any point in your story. They can be at the beginning but don’t have to be.\n\n(I like to start at the end of my story. That way, I know my story end will be really strong.)\n\nBut you should write what you want to write first.\n\nStep Two\n\nRead your pages critically. Do they work? Do they flow? If not, find out what you could do to make the story stronger. There are 5 very specific aspects of writing you should be looking at in this stage:\n\nphysicality, action, reaction, inner thoughts and speech.\n\nThese are what you need to build strong characterization. (For details on these 5 key points, go HERE.)\n\nStep Three\n\nMake your edits.\n\nStep Four\n\nGo back and re-read what you’ve now edited. How is it now? If it still doesn’t quite work, then you need to look at another key aspect of your writing: narrative voice.\n\nSometimes it’s Bigger Decisions that are preventing your story from really shining. Any weaknesses in your character profile would have been revealed in the first editing step, so you’ve already worked that out by this point. (For details on creating great characters, start HERE.)\n\nIf your story still isn’t jiving, then the problem is most likely a matter of writing style, and that’s established through your narrative voice. (For details on narration, start HERE.)\n\nStep Five\n\nMake your edits.\n\nAt this point, after just 2 rounds of careful and intentional editing, you’ll fully understand where you are in the story creation process. You’ll also be ready to write the rest of your manuscript just as intentionally. Not by accident, not with luck.\n\nNow you can really write, and finish your manuscript.\n\nMore Problems\n\nThat isn’t to say that you won’t ever run into problems with your manuscript ever again. But the problems you’ll face will be much easier for you to tackle.\n\nWhy? Because anything after this point will be a cinch. You’ll be so well equipped to handle other decisions you need to make as a writer, you’ll be able to simply make them. It won’t take you days or weeks to work through those problems – it will take you hours, or maybe just minutes.\n\nIf you do have hiccups in your writing after these steps have been taken, they’ll most likely stem from Plot. (For details on building plot, start HERE.)\n\nWhat Works\n\nYou should always do whatever works for you. If you honestly feel your best work is done without editing, then do that. But it’s my experience that this isn’t likely.\n\nWhat’s much more likely is that when you’re struggling through a story draft, you know instinctively that it isn’t working; you’re sensing that it’s getting out of control and that you might not be able to bring it around.\n\nThe only thing to do is to stop writing, start editing. But don’t look for spelling errors or any of the technical aspects of writing that we tend to associate with the process of editing. There are various types of editing, steps you should do at certain points in your writing.\n\n(For a run-down on the different types of editors, and what they do when, go HERE. For details on how to give and get good feedback on a manuscript, go HERE.)\n\nGo through the 5 editing steps I’ve outlined here for you. I promise that if you do, you’ll feel much more in control of your writing process. In the end, you’ll have a manuscript that isn’t just finished. You’ll have a real story.\n\nWhat are you working on right now? If you’re stuck somewhere, just write below, let me know - or, as ever, send me an email. You know I love getting those.\n\nKeep creating, no matter what.\n\n--Download Edit as You Write, the Right Way: 5 Steps as PDF --",
  "latent_13880": "A pproaching Manchester airport, England, on the evening of 1995 January 6, a British Airways Boeing 737 with 60 passengers on board was buzzed by a bright, fast-moving UFO. The first officer ducked instinctively as it flashed past. The conversation between the pilot and Manchester air traffic control was as follows:\n\nPilot: “We just had something go down the right hand side just above us very fast”\n\nManchester: “Well, there’s nothing seen on radar. Was it an aircraft?”\n\nPilot: “Well, it had lights, it went down the starboard side very quick”\n\nManchester: “And above you?”\n\nPilot: “Just slightly above us, yeah”.\n\nAt the time of the incident, which occurred at 18.48 pm, the Boeing was descending through 4,000 ft altitude about nine miles southeast of Manchester. Visibility was over 10 km, it was dark and the Boeing was flying in clear air above cumulus cloud on a northerly heading. The UFO was moving in the opposite direction and was visible for about two seconds. There was no apparent sound or wake. No other pilots reported it, nor was it seen from the ground, presumably because of the intervening cloud.\n\nThe incident was considered so unusual that the pilots submitted a report which was investigated by the Civil Aviation Authority’s (CAA) Independent Joint Airmiss Working Group. Their findings were published in February 1996.\n\n“If you’ve never seen a UFO, you’re not very observant. And if you’ve seen as many as I have, you won’t believe in them.”\n\nArthur C. Clarke In his report to the CAA the pilot described the object as having a number of small white lights, like a Christmas tree. While he was convinced that the object itself was lit, the co-pilot differed, describing it as a dark wedge-shaped object with what could have been a black stripe down the side, and thought that it was illuminated by the Boeing 737’s landing lights. (In fact this is unlikely, since the object was above and to the side of the Boeing). The co-pilot was convinced that it was not a meteorological phenomenon, balloon, or any other craft they were familiar with, including a Stealth aircraft.\n\nIn its investigation the CAA considered the possibility that the UFO could have been another aircraft ranging from a hang glider or microlight to a military flight, but found no evidence to support such suggestions. The CAA investigators did not consider other possible causes since they were outside their remit of air safety, but remarked that “almost all unusual sightings can be attributed to a wide range of well-known natural phenomena”. They concluded that the incident “remains unresolved”.\n\nHad the CAA chosen to consider astronomical explanations, a likely answer would not have been difficult to find. From the captain’s description, the object sounds like a bright fireball, and in view of the lack of a radar return or a wake there is no good reason to suppose that it was anything else. Such a misidentification by experienced pilots is not unusual, as we shall see from what follows. In fact, another British Airways pilot and two RAF Tornado pilots had described a satellite re-entry in similar terms in 1990 (for details, see here and here ). But, in the annals of UFOlogy, the Manchester case has gone down as a UFO officially endorsed by the Civil Aviation Authority.\n\nWhat causes UFOs?\n\nAmateur astronomers know more about the causes of UFO sightings than most so-called UFO researchers. Arthur C. Clarke, not a man with a closed mind, once said: ”If you’ve never seen a UFO, you’re not very observant. And if you’ve seen as many as I have, you won’t believe in them.”\n\nAn astronomical solution should always be uppermost in a UFO investigator’s mind, but few UFOlogists have even a rudimentary understanding of astronomy To see what he meant, we need to look at some statistics. Astronomical objects are by far the main causes of mistaken UFO reports. In a classic analysis of 1,300 UFO reports made to the Center for UFO Studies in the US, published by Allan Hendry in The UFO Handbook (Sphere, 1980), just over half of all identified nocturnal lights were accounted for by astronomical causes: stars, planets, meteors, the Moon, artificial satellites, and satellite re-entries.\n\nWhat’s more, astronomical objects also featured prominently among the identified daytime UFOs, those involving apparent corroboration by radar, and the various classes of close encounters, including the celebrated Third Kind in which occupants are supposedly sighted. In short, an astronomical solution should always be uppermost in a UFO investigator’s mind, but experience shows that few UFOlogists have even a rudimentary understanding of astronomy and so fail to weed out even easily explicable cases.\n\nHow stars become UFOs\n\nWhy should simple lights in the sky cause such confusion? As amateur astronomers know, most people are totally unfamiliar with the sky. Highly credible witnesses such as teachers, policemen and pilots (yes, and astronomers) can still be surprised by the unexpected appearance of a bright star, planet, meteor, or satellite.\n\nUsually, a description such as “it seemed to hover for an hour” is diagnostic of a star or planet (people get fed up watching after about an hour, or the object sets). Often there are other descriptions such as “flashing coloured lights” or “it appeared to be rotating” which is how bright stars appear when they are twinkling, notably Sirius on a cold, frosty night. Binoculars do not always help identification if they happen to be cheap and with optical defects that produce spurious colours and shapes.\n\nAdditional information such as “it wasn’t there before” or “it appeared to move slowly” or “it dodged around” are still consistent with characteristics of stars and planets. Many people don’t realize that stars rise and set during the night. Thin clouds can make stars appear to dim and brighten, as though they were receding or approaching. And, when seen between scudding clouds, stars really do appear to dodge around.\n\nA more subtle effect is known technically as the autokinetic effect . In this, natural movements of the eye make a stationary object appear to move irregularly, sometimes zooming up and down or swinging from side to side in a movement sometimes described as like a “falling leaf”. Autokinetic motion can be uncanny when watching artificial satellites, which often appear to zig zag or even make deviations around stars in their path.\n\nAnother shortcoming of human perception is that it is impossible to judge the distances of lights in the sky. A planet millions of miles away, an aircraft several thousand feet away, or a torch bulb a few dozen yards away all appear much the same size and brightness at night. The examples in this article show the tendency of witnesses to grossly underestimate the distance of nocturnal lights.\n\nEven sightings involving military radar are no more likely to involve “genuine” UFOs. In 1989 a series of reports began to emanate from Belgium, culminating on the night of 1990 March 30–31 with widespread sightings by police and an aerial “chase” by Belgian Air Force F-16 fighters involving radar contact with an unidentified target. This now-famous event turned out to have been sparked off by misidentifications of bright stars and planets by police while the radar returns were due to atmospheric effects and equipment malfunction . (For a more extensive analysis, see here .)\n\nVenus, the biggest culprit of all\n\nLet’s start by looking at some instructive examples involving the planet Venus, the biggest UFO culprit of all, popularly known as the “evening star” (although it can also appear in the morning sky as the “morning star”). As amateur astronomers know, Venus is the brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and can dazzle the eye, sometimes appearing cross-shaped. Back in 1967, there was a famous case in which two policemen in Devon, England, reported Venus as a UFO shaped like a “flying cross” and chased it in their car at speeds up to 90 mile/h.\n\nPerhaps the most celebrated UFO witness of all time was the governor of the US state of Georgia, a former American naval officer trained in celestial navigation and nuclear physics, who was later to become president of the United States: Jimmy Carter. In 1973, Carter reported that four years earlier he and 10 other people in the town of Leary, Georgia, had watched a brilliant UFO low on the horizon which appeared to move towards them and away again, while changing in brightness, size, and colour. He estimated the distance as between 300 ft and 1,000 ft, and said that at times it became almost as big and bright as the full Moon.\n\nThis case was thoroughly investigated by Robert Sheaffer, who described it in his book The UFO Verdict (Prometheus, 1981). For a start, Sheaffer found that Carter was nine months out in his recollection of the date. Of the ten claimed witnesses, Sheaffer could find only one who remembered the incident even vaguely, and he thought the object might have been a balloon. But with the correct date established, Sheaffer found that the witnesses had been looking straight at brilliant Venus. The errors in his report are typical of those made by UFO witnesses: the size and brightness of the object is overestimated, the distance is underestimated, and spurious motion is attributed to the object.\n\n“Close encounters” with Venus and Jupiter\n\nIn The UFO Handbook , Allan Hendry describes an apparent close encounter of the third kind stimulated by Venus. A woman reported that a very bright object in the southwest had made a slow, jerky descent over a period of an hour one evening. As she stared at it, she became convinced that she could see occupants with rounded silvery heads looking out of the object’s windows. The UFO turned up again on subsequent nights, exactly where Venus should be.\n\nKeep this report of apparent occupants in mind when considering the famous story of an American couple, Betty and Barney Hill, who claimed to have been chased by a UFO one night. Barney stopped to look at the object through binoculars and reported seeing a row of windows with alien faces peering out. Thinking they were going to be abducted, the Hills drove off in panic. Later, Betty Hill dreamed that they really were abducted, and many UFOlogists have believed her dream story.\n\nYet, from Betty Hill’s own sketch, Robert Sheaffer has identified the UFO as Jupiter, which is second only to Venus in brightness. The apparent ‘chasing’ is another phenomenon of celestial objects, which appear to keep pace with moving cars. Sheaffer also describes a hilarious 100 mph police chase of Venus through Ohio and Pennsylvania in 1966. They never did catch it, but they did inspire a scene in the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind .",

This decision shows that we must stand up in defense of the freedoms and liberties of every individual,” he continued.“It is individuals that ought to be protected against the abuses of radical politics, while Mayor Romero should be relieved from his post for clear breaches of the nondiscrimination policies that rule government bodies,” he added.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_14008": "My favorite sight during the protests of California's passage of Proposition 8 (eliminating the right of same-sex couples to marry) was a youthful looking guy wearing his nastiest face and carrying a sign that said, \"No More Mr. Nice Gay!\"\n\nSuddenly California's streets were full of \"kids\" who felt entitled, a whole new population of beautiful faces who just assumed the right to marry was or would be theirs. After all, protesting and rallies, marches and demonstrations were \"old.\" All that was for another generation. It wasn't sexy and it didn't sell. In fact, several advertising surveys I was presented with at the national news magazine I used to head, purported data that suggested younger readers/browsers (the \"target audience\" for advertisers) did not identify with \"the struggle.\" It wasn't fun. Or at least advertisers trying to sell them fun things like drinks and cars and gadgets, didn't think struggling was a good match. Since advertising became the only road to staying in business at all (with newsstand, subscriptions, and the old model of charging a fee for website content, all failing), advertisers became not-so-invisible editorial advisers. I mean, God forbid, you should lose or offend one over something you wrote.\n\nIn general, advertisers prefer the blander lifestyle websites and print magazines. In gay media, they'd prefer not to be there at all. Anything about sexuality is controversial, and anything about our sexuality is, well,...run! Granted, it's much easier if the media niche involves fashion, food, nesting, tips, and travel. But, please, don't have issues. Don't scare the horses. How can they put a liquor ad on a page next to a news item about a gay bashing? Who can party with that going on?\n\nAnd yet, there he was: the younger generation, Mr. No More Nice Gay pissed off because he suddenly gets it. He may be young, but he is struggling. And worse than that, his struggle is old: He's still not equal.\n\nMost agree that the initial reaction to the passage of Prop. 8 in California was very hopeful. If only we'd made ourselves visible like that before November 4th! For weeks the feeling was, this is the biggest community response since ACT UP. But when the announcement came ten days later that the California Supreme Court would review the validity of Prop. 8 (beginning March 5th), things quieted back down and all protests stopped. Even President Obama's so-called \"misstep\" with Rev. Rick Warren didn't cancel any trips to DC for the inauguration. You see, protesting is still bad sportsmanship. It's rude. It's withholding. It's bad behavior during festivities. And who wants to be seen raining on a parade?\n\nWell, you might not want to be seen raining on it, but it is your parade too. And even though I could be having fun, (and I'd love to -- with a gadget and a drink and a car), or I could be spending my time ringing my hands over more important things like the world's financial crisis, I'm still hopelessly stuck on the fact that a few percentage points worth of California voters--and way more in Florida and Arkansas -- took time out of their busy day to make sure I don't have all my civil rights. And if it's that important to them, I feel it should be equally important to me.\n\nSo I sure hope they all were watching the Academy Awards February 23 when Milk screenwriter Lance Black won not only Best Screenplay but more importantly, the chance to deliver the most graceful and heartfelt message possible to 36.3 million viewers around the world. The openly gay Black thanked Harvey Milk for saving his life by giving him hope that someday he might grow up, fall in love, and get married. Honestly, we could never have come up with enough money to have purchased ad time during such a humongous event, let alone paid a more spectacular and talented new superstar to deliver it with such authenticity.\n\nAnd, trust me, Lance appeared at a bullseye moment:\n\nThe California Supreme Court just heard a lawyer name Kenneth Starr tell them to annul 18,000 gay & lesbian marriages. Yes, that Kenneth Starr, the one who's already demonstrated that he can whip up quite the obsession for other people's sex lives (Monica Lewinsky, anyone?). And please, what's wrong with us? Why didn't we predict Starr's inevitable comeback as lead counsel on behalf of Prop. 8's official proponents--really was he not destined to cast himself as some sort of Straight-Marriage Nazi?\n\nI wonder, is there a polite way to get all our rights? To be well behaved, must we wait for everything else to be taken care of first, like the economic crisis, the war(s), and for all homophobic people to be educated? I think you know the answer to this. Whatever the California Supreme court ultimately decides this time, all hell is gonna break loose. Although predictions have been made about the outcome of the court's brainstorming (Prop. 8 = upheld, 18,000 marriage = upheld), at this point in time, we don't know.\n\nIt they overturn Prop. 8, supporters will claim they weren't heard, forgetting that a majority cannot dictate the civil rights of a minority. (Although it was Senior Assistant Atty. Gen. Christopher Krueger, arguing that Prop. 8 be overturned because it repealed an inalienable right, who fared the worst at the hearing, many say, due to his performance.) Regardless, it's clear that African Americans would still be sitting in the back of buses and drinking from separate drinking fountains were it not for the justice system. Sadly, history demonstrates that the courts lead the way while the hearts of some Americans must drag behind.\n\nBut if the Supreme Court lets Prop. 8 stand, we need to stomp up to the proverbial plate. Personally I think rallies and marches have a purpose because they show our numbers to the media. But they're not enough. And, yes, it's true, times have changed. Lying down in the streets and being hauled off in paddy wagons is yesterday. It's a new world. Today it's all about finances. I say use what is on everyone's minds. Besides, it's perfect for what is being taken from us.\n\nThe battle cry is very old (1763): \"No taxation without representation.\" It's also very American. The phrase was first used to voice the grievances of the British colonies (that would be us). Just like back then, it means we are not being represented fairly, that we too do not have all the rights other citizens have, so therefore taxing us equally is unconstitutional. If we don't have the \"right to get married,\" or the \"the right to be in the military,\" or \"the right to keep our jobs\" or \"the right to keep our children,\" etc., then we shouldn't give them all our taxes. Any questions?\n\nNow when Joan Baez withheld her taxes to protest the Vietnam War in the 60s, she made headlines and she made her point. But ultimately she had to pay her taxes because she had no legal grounds for withholding the money. Unlike us, she had all her rights. She just didn't like how the government was spending her money: on the war.\n\nInitially, when Prop. 8 passed, Melissa Etheridge announced she would do exactly what I'm proposing. Then she changed her mind. It won't work if only a few people do it. It should be obvious that the government will just make them pay. But a huge, well-organized group of people doing it? That's different. That's a movement saying something loud and clear.\n\nOh, but one thing: it's still rude. And a lot of folks think in light of this wonderful new president, we shouldn't be rude. He's got enough to think about. I'm not one of them, as you've figured out by now. I think we can do two things at once. We can support the president and our country. But we can also support ourselves.\n\nSometimes we just have to be Ms. or Mr. No Longer Nice Gay. But who knows, maybe if we're seen and heard today, the Supreme Court will consider how much we care about what they're going to do. They did the right thing once. Maybe what we do in the next days can keep us from a ruder destiny. So think about it. If you got married, send them a jpeg of your marriage license or your wedding pictures. Make yourselves real.\n\nBut do something! Kenneth Starr is very, very real and quite busy.",
  "latent_14040": "U.S. employers added a substantial 228,000 jobs in November, a sign of the job market's enduring strength in the economy's ninth year of expansion, and the unemployment rate held at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.\n\nFriday's jobs report from the government made clear that the U.S. economy is on firm footing and is likely benefiting from more resilient global growth, with all major economies across the world expanding in tandem for the first time in a decade.\n\nOver the past six months, U.S. economic growth has exceeded an annual rate of 3 percent, the first time that's happened since 2014. Consumer confidence has reached its highest level since 2000. And employers have added jobs for 86 straight months, a record streak.\n\n\"It's a surprisingly strong report given the age of the recovery,\" said Jed Kolko, chief economist at the job listing website Indeed. \"After 86 months, we're still seeing strong payroll gains.\"\n\nIn many cases, in fact, employers say they're struggling to find enough qualified workers to hire. Still, solid hiring and a low unemployment rate have yet to accelerate wages, which rose 2.5 percent in November compared with a year earlier. The last time unemployment was this low, average wages were growing at a 4 percent annual rate.\n\nThe November jobs data make it a near-certainty that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates for the third time this year when it meets next week, economists said.\n\nLast month, job growth was widespread and particularly strong in manufacturing, which added 31,000 jobs, and in construction, which added 24,000. The construction job gains might have reflected, in part, renovation and repair work in such hurricane-ravaged states as Texas and Florida.\n\nIn November, retailers added nearly 19,000 jobs, a sign that physical stores are hiring for the holiday shopping season even in the face of brutal competition from e-commerce companies. Transportation and warehousing companies, which are benefiting from the e-commerce boom, added 10,500.\n\nHiring has slowed slightly since last year, which is typical when unemployment falls to low levels. Employers have added an average of 174,000 a month this year, a bit below last year's monthly average of 187,000.\n\nThere are also welcome signs that the recovery is finally benefiting workers who were seeing little gains in earlier stages of the rebound, Kolko said.\n\nWorkers with just a high school diploma are much more likely to have jobs than they were a year ago. And employees in some of the lower-paying industries are receiving the biggest pay gains: Average hourly pay has risen a healthy 3.8 percent for workers in a category that includes hotel and restaurant employees.\n\n\"In a tight labor market, employers may look to a wider set of candidates than they would when unemployment was higher,\" Kolko said.\n\nBrian Ernest, who owns a small home renovation and contracting firm in Edgewater, Maryland, just hired a project manager to help him keep up with his fast-growing business. He advertises through the Thumbtack website and relies on word of mouth among Realtors.\n\n\"Everything in this area is going great,\" he said.\n\nHomeowners are borrowing against retirement funds that are flush from stock market gains to renovate their homes, Ernest said. Others are able to obtain home equity lines of credit and other loans.\n\nRising confidence among consumers is translating into major purchases: Americans are buying more homes and cars. Auto sales rose 1.3 percent in November compared with a year earlier, to 1.4 million, according to Autodata Corp.\n\nIn October, newly built homes sold at their fastest pace in a decade, and existing homes sold at their quickest rate since June.\n\nBusinesses are spending more, too: Orders for such long-lasting items as industrial machinery, computers and oil-drilling equipment rose for the third straight month in October.\n\nThough wages have yet to pick up, Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he thinks a continued decline in unemployment will lead to higher pay. U.S. metro areas with unemployment rates of 3.5 percent or lower are reporting annual wage growth of roughly 4 percent, Shepherdson said in an email.",

  "latent_14328": "I didn’t know she was North Korean when I first saw her. I mean, I had never met a North Korean before volunteering with TNKR—which stands for Teach North Korean Refugees—so I didn’t know what to expect. I thought they would look more refugee-ish. People whose hardship urged them to risk their lives by running away from a tyrant. I expected conservative, homely people. I did not expect this beauty. The kind of beauty that could disrupt a quiet room.\n\nI thought she was a South Korean intern until an awkward handshake—imagine shaking hands without knowing what a handshake is—and a greeting that fell flat because she didn’t know what “how are you” means.\n\nEleven other volunteer tutors and seven North Korean students were in this room for TNKR’s matching session. The goal is to allow the volunteers and students to meet face to face in order to try to make the best, most comfortable matches possible. Casey Lartigue and Eunkoo Lee, who founded TNKR in 2013, want the students to choose their own tutors because they believe in student-led education.\n\nThey don’t learn much English in North Korea, but the refugees need English to survive in the competitive job market of Seoul. Even after surviving hunger, escaping the regime, getting into South Korea, and adjusting to life here, their journey still isn’t over because they need to learn a new language. The work TNKR does is critical and no one else provides it. This is a very young non-profit. You can support their growth here.\n\nHere’s how the matching sessions works. First the volunteers introduce themselves, talk about their teaching strengths, and say how many students they’re willing to accept. Then the students introduce themselves and say what their goals are.\n\nAfter introductions are finished, Casey and Eunkoo call out the students one by one so they can choose a tutor. When all the students have chosen one, they can continue choosing more until they’re satisfied. Some students chose up to seven tutors and some only chose one.\n\nThree students chose me. One of them got a job and had to quit the program after only one meeting. I’ve never met the second because she was busy with university final exams. The third student who chose me was the room disrupting beauty.\n\nI can’t say her name or show any pictures. Most of the students want to remain anonymous. I’m not sure if it’s because they don’t want North Korea to know they’ve escaped or because they don’t want to be outed as a North Korean in South Korean society. A mix of both, most likely. Still, we need something to call her because “the beauty” is reductive. I’m going to call her “C.” Not “A” because “A” can be a full word and not “B” because then you’d think it stands for “beauty.” Come on, let’s be adults here.\n\n“C” and I had our first class the day after the matching session.\n\nIn the first class, I didn’t even think about where she was from. It was just fun. C is an absolute beginner in English, so we just played games. I brought colored erasers with me and taught her how to say, “The pink eraser is on the black eraser. The red eraser is next to the blue eraser” and so on. We spent an hour playing with erasers. It doesn’t matter where you’re from, this was fun.\n\nThe second time, it bubbled to the surface. She got a call from her father during the lesson. Her parents are still in North Korea.\n\nIt’s illegal for a North Korean to call South Korea. C told me the call goes from North Korea to China, then is transferred to South Korea. When the call finished, she apologized for the interruption and told me that her mother has been sick for a while. Her father was giving her an update. She said it’s going okay, so we continued with the lesson.\n\nLearning a language is a painful process and can be infuriating, especially for beginners. I had been impressed with C’s patience and positive attitude. But I saw her get frustrated for the first time after the call.\n\nWhen the lesson finished, we walked back to the subway station. Her phone rang again. When the call finished, she said, “My father…. give me money.”\n\nFor a moment I thought that must be the secret to this unlikely beauty. She’s a refugee, but from the North Korean upper-class. She caught the first class underground railroad out of the North.\n\nBut I knew she hadn’t learned reported speech (“he said..” “they told me…”), so I pursued it. “You mean, he gives you money or he wants you to give him money?”\n\nShe said, “I give him money. North Korea people…” she patted her belly. “Hungry.”\n\n“I see.”\n\n“But I have no money.”\n\nWe said goodbye in the subway station. She went west and I went east. I watched her board her train. No one realized she was from the North. No one even turned their head. She sat down under an advertisement for plastic surgery and next to a college aged girl captivated by texting—probably about plans for going out. Business men walked by, talking about business plans in their business suits. But C was thinking about how she could make money for her hungry parents in North Korea.",

  "latent_14446": "Image copyright Thinkstock\n\nThis winter just 29 pensioners decided to decline their fuel allowance. It brings the total number of pensioners who relinquish this benefit to probably about 400 out of over 12 million recipients.\n\nThat's despite the fact that two years ago the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith encouraged better off pensioners who can afford their heating bills to return the money to the state.\n\nFigures have been released by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in response to a BBC Freedom Of Information (FOI) request.\n\nSo if you are one of the 29 public spirited pensioners who decided this winter that you could afford the personal sacrifice and that the government had better things to do with its cash than give it to you to subsidise your heating, then now you know how many of your fellows came to the same conclusion.\n\n'Hand it back'\n\nInterviewed in the Sunday Telegraph in April 2013 about why rich pensioners should get the benefit, Mr Duncan Smith said: \"I would encourage everybody who reads the Telegraph and doesn't need it to hand it back.\"\n\nHowever, many wealthier pensioners, whether Telegraph readers or otherwise, seem reluctant to follow this advice.\n\nAccording to the DWP data obtained under FOI by the BBC, the number deciding to reject their winter fuel payment (WFP) was just 163 in the winter of 2011/12, 139 in 2012/13, 78 in 2013/14 and 29 in 2014/15.\n\nThe DWP states these recipients would generally also have relinquished their payments for all future years, possibly making a cumulative total of about 400, although they were not able to provide the BBC with detailed figures to confirm this.\n\nPersonal circumstances\n\nNo statistics are available for previous years, and it was only in 2011 that the government published a clear process for pensioners who did not want the money.\n\nThe value of the benefit varies between £100 and £300 dependent on personal circumstances. This suggests that the 29 who decided to return the payment this winter saved the government an additional sum somewhere between £2,900 and £8,700 (the DWP told us it could not supply an exact figure).\n\nIf 400 pensioners in total are not accepting the benefit, the annual sum involved is between £40,000 and £120,000.\n\nThese savings compare to total government expenditure on winter fuel payments in 2014/15 of £2.1bn.\n\nTarget for criticism\n\nThe allowance is paid automatically each year to over 12 million pensioners in a lump sum, notionally to cover the additional costs of winter heating. It was introduced in 1997 to tackle fuel poverty amongst the elderly.\n\nThe WFP has been a target for criticism from those who argue that this and other universal benefits such as free TV licences and concessionary bus travel should not be provided for wealthy pensioners. Reports have suggested that this is Mr Duncan Smith's personal view.\n\nHowever last month David Cameron repeated his pledge not to introduce means testing for these payments to pensioners.\n\nLabour say they would abolish the winter fuel allowance for the richest 5% of pensioners. The Liberal Democrats also favour cutting the allowance for the better-off. These plans have been criticised by the National Pensioners Convention.\n\nMoral pressure\n\nThe issue achieved prominence in 2010 after the multi-millionaire businessman Lord Sugar complained about the practical obstacles he encountered when he tried and failed to return the payment.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Lord Sugar tried and failed to return fuel payment in 2010\n\nThe official government position is less forthright than Mr Duncan Smith's statement. The gov.uk website avoids all moral pressure and merely advises: \"Write to the office that pays your Winter Fuel Payment if you want to cancel it.\"\n\nGovernment sources stress that there has been no concerted campaign to persuade pensioners to return the money and there is no target for the numbers who do so.\n\nA DWP spokesman said: \"Winter fuel payments provide help with heating bills and are available to the vast majority of pensioners. Anyone who does not want or need that help can return the money.\"",
  "latent_14577": "NEW YORK - Scores of retired New York City police officers, firefighters and prison guards were charged Tuesday with faking psychiatric problems to get federal disability benefits - with some falsely claiming their conditions arose after the Sept. 11 attacks, prosecutors said.\n\nFour ringleaders coached the former workers on how to falsely describe symptoms of depression and other mental health problems that allowed them to get payouts high as $500,000, said Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. The ringleaders made tens of thousands in dollars in secret kickbacks, Vance said.\n\nAmong the retirees arrested were 72 city police officers, eight firefighters, five corrections officers and one Nassau County Police Department officer.\n\nInvestigators said the scam stretched back more than two decades, with the ex-officers and other workers collecting years' worth of benefits for citing mental health problems so severe that they couldn't work at all. The workers were coached on how to portray their problems, reporting that they were so psychologically damaged that they couldn't take care of themselves, prosecutors said.\n\nAccused Social Security scammers Richard Cosentino and Glen Lieberman Handouts/image pixelated by CBS New York\n\nMany of the officers legitimately had physical disabilities that would have entitled them to state disability pensions, but would not have entitled them to federal Social Security disability insurance, which requires a complete inability to work. Internal Affairs Chief Charles Campisi said many of the officers exaggerated their psychological trauma to gain the Social Security benefits. Most claimed post-traumatic stress disorder and many said it was because of the Sept. 11 attacks, he said. The NYPD has no information that they weren't actually working after the terrorist attack, just that they overstated the effect, he said.\n\nOne of the defendants who said he couldn't work taught martial arts. Another former police officer who claimed he couldn't leave the house worked at a cannoli stand at a street festival. Another claimed depression so crippling that it kept him house-bound but was photographed aboard a Sea-Doo watercraft.\n\nAmong those arrested was a retired police officer who has since worked helping members of the detectives' union, the Detectives' Endowment Association, with disability claims at an office in Queens. He has been suspended without pay, union President Michael Palladino said.\n\nMany said they could not use a computer but had Facebook pages, Twitter handles and YouTube channels, prosecutors said.\n\n\"The brazenness is shocking,\" Vance said.\n\nMore than 100 defendants were charged with crimes including grand larceny. Arraignments in the sweeping case began late Tuesday morning, with several of the defendants pleading not guilty and being released without bail.\n\nClaims of government workers feigning injury to get disability benefits have been the focus of sprawling criminal cases before.\n\nOver the last two years, 32 people were arrested in a probe into Long Island Rail Road employees who collected federal railroad disability benefits; at least two dozen have pleaded guilty. The workers allegedly claimed on-the-job injuries, only to be spotted later playing golf and tennis, working out, and even riding in a 400-mile bike race.\n\nJoseph Gentile, an attorney who represents a former police officer, declined to discuss his case specifically. But he also represented one of the people charged in the railroad case, suggested such charges reflect a troubled system for reviewing and approving disability claims.\n\n\"A lot of the problems that occur here are because of systematic problems, not because of someone's criminality,\" he said. While some people may indeed exploit benefits, \"by and large, people have a bona fide, legitimate medical injury. The question becomes: Is the medical problem or injury sufficient to sustain the claim for the benefits?\"",

  "latent_14628": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nIn her first appearance in Washington, DC since hinting at running for Senate in January, Ashley Judd opened up about the sexual abuse she was subjected to when she was younger.\n\nJudd, who is considering a challenge to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) next fall as a Democrat, did not take questions from the press—although she did allude to reporters briefly as the “people here who don’t give a rat’s you-know-what about violence”—spoke for more than a hour on Friday at George Washington University on virtually anything but electoral politics. (Topics ranged from child prostitution, to female empowerment, to reproductive health care, to corruption in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to her Kentucky roots.)\n\nBut her most candid remarks may have come when she was asked if she had any advice for women who have been sexually assaulted:\n\nI’ve been aware of gender violence all my life, being a survivor of gender violence. Yet I was astonished when I went to graduate school and started to do a deeper dive on gender violence here in America how prevalent rape and attempted rape is, particularly amongst young people. Am I correct that it’s one in three college* students, college women? So that’s a lot. That’s a third of us in this room. And I think part of what’s important, in addition to how we shape the narrative, is that we all have the courage to talk about it, because we’re as sick as our secrets and the shame keeps us in isolation. And when we find that shared experience, we gather our strength and our hope. So for example, I’m a three-time survivor of rape, and about that I have no shame, because it was never my shame to begin with—it was the perpetrator’s shame. And only when I was a grown empowered adult and had healthy boundaries and had the opportunity to do helpful work on that trauma was I able to say, okay, that perpetrator was shameless, and put their shame on me. Now I gave that shame back, and it’s my job to break my isolation and talk with other girls and other women.\n\nAt that point, she acknowledged the audience reaction. “I see some people crying,” Judd said. “And that’s good.”\n\nAt that, Judd returned to talking about her work, mostly overseas, working with kids who had been sexually abused. “Because I am that kid,” she said. “I was that kid. And there are least a third of the people in this room who would tell that same story if they had the opportunity.”\n\nLater in the Q&A, a self-identified rape survivor thanked Judd for her answer. “I am glad that you spoke openly today, because I felt so alone,” she said. “I know it is one in four because by my senior year in college I could count.”\n\nJudd first discussed her childhood trauma in her 2011 memoir, All That is Bitter and Sweet. “An old man everyone knew beckoned me into a dark, empty corner of the business and offered me a quarter for the pinball machine at the pizza place if I’d sit on his lap,” she wrote. “He opened his arms, I climbed up, and I was shocked when he suddenly cinched his arms around me, squeezing me and smothering my mouth with his, jabbing his tongue deep into my mouth.”\n\nAlthough the discussion of rape elicited the greatest emotional reaction from the audience, the bigger takeaway from Judd’s talk—at least according to my Twitter feed—was Judd’s frequent lapses into Hollywoodese. She referenced her friendship with Bono more than once, and at one point joked about spending winters in Scotland (where her husband is from).\n\n*Estimates vary, but it’s somewhere between 20 and 25 percent.",

Most of the richest tycoons tend to be white and Asian men, with very few women of any ethnicity reaching such an accomplishment. But Oprah Winfrey and Folorunsho Alakija are on the list, and have been confirmed byandmagazines to be the richest Black women in the world.Oprah Winfrey is the 63-year old media mogul, actress, philanthropist, and talk show host who once hosted the highest-rated daytime television program in history. She is also the founder of her very own magazine and cable network network channel called OWN also known as the Oprah Winfrey Network ( www.Oprah.com ).Born in to poverty in rural Mississippi, Oprah climbed her way to success and went on to become America's first Black billionaire. Her accolades include being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama, and honorary doctorate degrees from Duke and Harvard universities.All in all, she is worth $3 billion.Folorunsho Alakija is not as famous, but actually she is in fact a bit wealthier than Oprah. She is a Nigerian billionaire oil tycoon, a fashion designer and also a philanthropist.The 66-year old got into the oil business in 1991 with no expertise at all in running an oil field, but she boldy applied for and received an Oil Prospecting License (OPL) to explore for oil on a 617,000 acre block. She went on to launch Famfa Oil ( www.Famfa.com ), which now generates billions of dollars in revenue every year.All in all she is worth $3.3 billion.",

According to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the groundwater contained carcinogenic contaminants, including trichloroethylene, 1,4-dioxane, and vinyl chloride.[61] The DEP also reported that the clouds contained other toxins, such as lead and toluene.[60] In 1995, Raytheon acquired Dallas-based E-Systems, including a site in St. Petersburg, Florida. In November 1991, prior to Raytheon's acquisition, contamination had been discovered at the E-Systems site. Soil and groundwater had been contaminated with the volatile organic compounds trichloroethylene and 1,4-Dioxane. In 2005, groundwater monitoring indicated polluted groundwater was moving into areas outside the site.[62] According to DEP documentation, Raytheon has tested wells on its site since 1996 but had not delivered a final report; therefore, it was given a deadline on May 31, 2008 to investigate its groundwater.[60] Contamination in the area has not affected anyone's drinking water supply or health, yet due to negative local media coverage lawsuits are being filed with claims against Raytheon citing decreases in property values.[63] In another case, Raytheon was ordered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to treat groundwater at the Tucson Plant (acquired during the merger with Hughes) in Arizona since Raytheon used and disposed metals, chlorinated solvents, and other substances at the plant since 1951.[64] The EPA further required the installation and operation of an oxidation process system to treat the solvents and make the water safe to drink.[64] On 9 August 2006, The Stream Contact Centre in Derry, Northern Ireland, which had a contract with Raytheon at the time, was attacked by protesters. They destroyed the computers, documents, and mainframe of the office, and proceeded to occupy it for eight hours prior to their arrest. The activists were charged with criminal damage and affray. The trial of six of the accused began May 19, 2008, in the Laganside Courts in Belfast. Colm Bryce, Gary Donnelly, Kieran Gallagher, Michael Gallagher, Sean Heaton, Jimmy Kelly, Paddy McDaid and Eamonn O'Donnell were acquitted of all charges on 11 June, with Eamonn McCann found guilty of the theft of two computer discs.[7]\n\nWorkplace diversity Edit\n\nSee also Edit",

  "latent_15256": "Some thought the superstore's collapse would bring better tidings for smaller shops. But what's really happened since the chain filed for bankruptcy?\n\nAP Images\n\nThere was a time when the independent bookstore seemed fated to die: In the early 1990s, chains like Borders and Barnes & Noble began their impressive rollout, and their guiding principle of bigger-is-better drove many independently owned shops out of business. But now, about two decades later, Borders is the one bowing out in dramatic fashion. After suffering from declining sales and missed payments, the 40-year-old chain filed for bankruptcy in February and has proceeded to liquidate its stores. Articles with headlines like \"Borders shutdown shifts independent booksellers into the spotlight\" and \"Borders' demise could pave way for expansion of independent bookstores,\" claim that the superstore's collapse will bring better tidings for the independent.\n\nGiven the fraught history of chains vs. independents, such a prediction is understandable—but is it accurate? Mark LaFramboise is a book buyer at Politics & Prose, an independent shop in Washington, D.C., and he says that the shuttering of the closest Borders earlier this year, during the chain's first wave of closings, has had no discernible effect on business. \"Does this herald a renaissance of the independent bookstore?\" LaFramboise says of Borders' closing. \"Probably not. Put me down in the 'I hope so' category. But stop short of the 'I think so' category.\" Scott Abel, the general manager of Kramerbooks & Afterwords Cafe in D.C., says his store has not witnessed radical windfall either, though he has certainly spoken with a few customers who mentioned that they used to shop at Borders.\n\nNew customers may not have simply fallen on their laps as a direct result of Borders' expiration. But many independents near a closed, or soon-to-be-closed, location are making the effort to attract the chain's former customers, according to Oren Teicher, CEO of the American Booksellers Association, a nonprofit trade group that represents about 1,600 independent shops across the country. Independents have flexed their entrepreneurial muscles in a variety of ways: honoring Borders gift cards, extending special discounts, offering space for book clubs that formerly met at Borders, and even running newspaper advertisements in the wake of Borders' closing to remind book buyers of other existing options. \"There is the beginning of at least a little evidence in some markets of the country where there was a Borders close by, that the nearby store has picked up on that business,\" Teicher says. \"This is the time to be as aggressive and out-front as one can.\"",
  "latent_15414": "When Ilene Hurd Smoot’s brother went to prison in 2004, she was angry at him at first. Their parents had strived to raise them right; their father was a deacon at their childhood church in Mississippi and the siblings sang in the choir. “They were hardworking people,” Ilene said. “They didn’t steal. They worked for everything they had.” Her brother, Shannon Hurd, was mischievous growing up, she says, but he had never done anything to hurt anyone. His main problem was a drug addiction he couldn’t seem to shake, which led to a couple of arrests in his 20s. Although she was the baby of the family, Ilene felt protective of her older brother. “I used to say, ‘Shannon, please, whatever you do, just be good.’”\n\nBut in 2003, Shannon was arrested for walking into a home in Kenner, Louisiana, and stealing $14 from an elderly couple. He insisted police had the wrong man — the couple had not seen his face — but his clothes closely resembled the description of the culprit, and the cops discovered $14 when they found him soon after the robbery. Despite his relatively minor crime, at trial the state cast Shannon as “the worst kind of defendant. He’s a predator.” In a 11-1 split, the jury found him guilty. He was given 30 years in prison.\n\nBut Jefferson Parish prosecutors weren’t satisfied. On September 10, 2004, according to court records, “the state introduced fingerprint cards, certified copies of convictions, and arrest registers” from Shannon’s previous run-ins with the law. They dated back to the 1990s. One was for unauthorized entry. Another was for “theft over $500.” A third, in 1997, was possession of a firearm by a felon. On December 4, 2004, under Louisiana’s habitual offender law, Shannon was resentenced to life without parole.\n\nIlene was incredulous — “Life for $14? Come on, seriously?” — but she couldn’t help but be mad at her brother. “I kind of like cut off communication with him,” she admitted. For years, Shannon kept writing to her anyway, certain that she would respond eventually. That moment came suddenly, when Ilene opened a letter in April 2014. Shannon was gravely ill. He had long complained about a pain in his side, but prison doctors dismissed the symptoms. By the time he was diagnosed with kidney cancer, the tumors had spread to his brain. “Please don’t think I’m playing games with y’all,” Shannon wrote in his letter to his sister. “I’m sick and I don’t want to die alone.”\n\nPhoto: Hurd Family\n\nIlene immediately got back in touch with her brother, going to see him at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, known as Angola. As he deteriorated, advocates helped him apply for medical parole or compassionate release, but officials rejected the request, citing behavior violations during Shannon’s time in the prison hospice. In a letter last summer to Louisiana Department of Corrections Secretary James LeBlanc, Catholic nun and prison activist Alison McCrary called it “wildly inappropriate” to subject Shannon to disciplinary measures. “Mr. Hurd is a dying man with multiple brain tumors taking steroid medication, all of which means that his control over his behavior is diminished for reasons he has no control over,” she wrote, to no avail.\n\nOn Sunday, March 5, at age 42, Shannon died at Angola. Ilene was by his side, along with her older sister. Ilene’s 20-year-old daughter made the drive too, but was barred from seeing him despite being on his visiting list. (“They’re like, he didn’t put her on this list.”) Prison officials wanted to bury Shannon quickly, on Tuesday, but he had repeatedly begged them not to leave his body at Angola. Bringing his body home was an expense the siblings could hardly afford, a reality for many families. It is one major reason half of the men who die at Angola are buried there. Still, Ilene was determined to try. The day after her brother’s death, the family put up a crowdfunding webpage seeking money to cover the transportation and funeral expenses. “Shannon was well loved by all, and he was never thrown away,” Ilene wrote. “He was our brother — not just another inmate — and we want to remember him as such.”\n\nMen incarcerated at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, La., attend a screening in 2011 of the documentary “Serving Life,” about the volunteer hospice work done by inmates for inmates dying in the prison. Photo: Gerald Herbert/AP\n\nCruel and All Too Usual\n\nThe case of Shannon Hurd may seem uniquely cruel, but it is not unusual. In 2015, Glenn Ford died from untreated lung cancer after spending decades on Louisiana’s death row for a crime he did not commit. Scores of other men and women are growing old in state and federal prison for nonviolent crimes, with little hope of release. Barack Obama granted clemency to a historic 1,927 people serving draconian sentences during his presidency, but denied many thousands more. In 2013, the American Civil Liberties Union published a major report on the thousands serving life without parole for nonviolent crimes at the state level. Louisiana easily outpaced all other states, with a tally of 429. Florida was a distant second, with 270.\n\nBehind the figure was the same habitual offender law that sent Hurd to die in prison. As I wrote in The Nation in 2013, the report highlighted men like Fate Vincent Winslow, “who, while homeless, ‘acted as a go-between in the sale of two small bags of marijuana, worth $10 in total, to an undercover police officer’; Timothy Jackson, who stole a jacket from a department store in New Orleans; Paul Carter, convicted of ‘possession of a trace amount of heroin residue that was so minute it could not be weighed’; and Sylvester Mead, a Shreveport man who drunkenly threatened a police officer while seated, handcuffed, in the back of a patrol car.” In another case out of Jefferson Parish, a man named Keith Barnes stole items valued at $188.22 from a Walmart and was given a two-year sentence — the maximum for such a low-level offense. But, as with Shannon Hurd, prosecutors argued that Barnes was a repeat offender. It did not matter than he had already served serious prison time for earlier offenses, including 16 years for an armed robbery he committed as a teenager. At 39 years old, Barnes too was resentenced to life without parole.\n\nLike Shannon — and like some 90 percent of those serving life without parole for nonviolent crimes in Louisiana — all the aforementioned men are black. “Dogs get treated better than black people here,” Ilene says. At Angola, a functioning plantation named for the origins of the slaves who once worked the same land, abysmal medical care accelerates the in-house death sentences given to men like her brother. The prison runs on inmate labor; in a six-month investigation by reporters Katie Rose Quandt and James Ridgeway last year, a man named Francis Brauner argued that the prison denies treatment to those no longer seen as useful. “You get hurt, you get sick, or you can’t produce for them no more in their fields. … They put you on a ward on a bed and let you die,” he said.\n\nBrauner, who arrived at Angola in 2010 after becoming paralyzed in an accident at a different Louisiana facility, spent years surreptitiously documenting the prison’s repeated failure to provide him medical treatment. Quandt and Ridgeway recounted how the records became the basis for a class-action lawsuit in 2015. The 63-page suit is rife with horrific details describing gross medical neglect at Angola, from untreated wounds to refusals to provide a cane to a man who lost his eyesight. Guards and EMTs accuse injured men of “malingering” in order to get out of physical labor. Cancer screenings are virtually nonexistent.\n\nAmong the plaintiffs in the lawsuit is Shannon Hurd, who had begun complaining about a pain in his side the same year Brauner began keeping his notes. In the years that followed, Quandt and Ridgeway wrote, Shannon “developed numbness in his feet, legs, and fingertips, lost his appetite, and dropped nearly 100 pounds. When he finally received a CT scan in 2015, he was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in his kidneys and lungs.”\n\nIlene remembers her brother telling her repeatedly, “They are killing me in here.”\n\nThe sun shines through concertina wire on a fence at the Angola Prison Rodeo in Angola, La., April 26, 2014. Photo: Gerald Herbert/AP\n\nFree at Last\n\nOn March 10, the Friday after her brother’s death, Ilene was at her sister’s place across from the New Orleans airport, listening to the radio and cooking up a storm. Her aunt had gotten up early that morning to prepare potato salad and green salad; her sister had made macaroni and cheese. There was catfish in a propane fryer outside. The family had handed out fliers around the neighborhood advertising a two-day fundraiser, with a few lines about her brother printed along the bottom. “Please help bring some peace to Shannon in his final resting,” it read.\n\nFor $9 on Friday you got a full plate including peas, bread, and a slice of cake. Chicken plates would be available Saturday for $8 apiece. Some people had already come by just to give donations. “Like yesterday a lady just came by and gave me ten dollars,” Ilene said. “She was like, ‘I don’t want a plate. Here, take the ten dollars.’”\n\nThe crowdfunding site had raised more than $2,000 so far, but that was far from the $7,000 goal.\n\nIlene knows too well how much a funeral costs: Her mother died of a sudden heart attack in 1995 and her 23-year-old brother, Daryl, drowned while fishing in Port Fouchon, Louisiana, a year later. In 1998 her father died, too. Like his wife, he was in his 50s. “This isn’t our first rodeo,” Ilene said. They would sell as many plates as possible.\n\nThere was a lot more to do. Over the weekend she would drive to Mississippi to arrange for the burial plot. But for now Ilene and her remaining siblings were debating how to dress Shannon for his funeral. Ilene was planning to find a nice suit at Goodwill and get it dry-cleaned, but her sister pointed out that he never dressed formally. “I think we might go with something casual,” she said.\n\nWhen her parents and brother died, the family organized both a wake and a funeral, but it got to be too much. Regardless of how much money they raise, Ilene is planning something simple but beautiful, a single event to commemorate her brother. There will be a church service in Kenner on Saturday, March 18. And then they will make the hour and a half drive to Liberty, Mississippi, to lay him to rest alongside his parents and brother.\n\n“I want to call it a home-going celebration,” Ilene said. “I don’t want to call it a funeral. Because he’s free.”",

  "latent_15514": "Editor's note: This story was originally published in May 2013.\n\nCarl Sagan, a titan of scientific study and communication, died in 1996, leaving behind an expansive legacy of research and education. He assumed a diverse set of roles throughout his life, including as a longtime casual user of and advocate for marijuana.\n\nSagan's involvement with pot began as a secret, when he penned an essay in 1969, at the age of 35, under the pseudonym \"Mr. X.\" The piece, in which Sagan described the benefits he felt from using marijuana, later appeared in Dr. Lester Grinspoon's 1971 book, \"Marihuana Reconsidered.\" Sagan's identity as the author wasn't publicly disclosed until 1999, when Keay Davidson published \"Carl Sagan: A Life,\" which documented Sagan's writings as his alter-ego, \"Mr. X.\"\n\nWriting that he'd begun smoking intermittently around 10 years before, Sagan noted that marijuana \"amplifies torpid sensibilities and produces what to me are even more interesting effects.\"\n\n\"The cannabis experience has greatly improved my appreciation for art, a subject which I had never much appreciated before,\" he wrote. \"The understanding of the intent of the artist which I can achieve when high sometimes carries over to when I’m down. This is one of many human frontiers which cannabis has helped me traverse.\"\n\nSagan went on to explain in intricate detail how his experiences listening to music, eating food and even having sex were all heightened while high.\n\nHis essay also included some classic Saganesque poetry:\n\nI can remember one occasion, taking a shower with my wife while high, in which I had an idea on the origins and invalidities of racism in terms of gaussian distribution curves. It was a point obvious in a way, but rarely talked about. I drew the curves in soap on the shower wall, and went to write the idea down. One idea led to another, and at the end of about an hour of extremely hard work I found I had written eleven short essays on a wide range of social, political, philosophical, and human biological topics. Because of problems of space, I can’t go into the details of these essays, but from all external signs, such as public reactions and expert commentary, they seem to contain valid insights. I have used them in university commencement addresses, public lectures, and in my books.\n\nSagan ultimately concluded that it was easy to use marijuana in moderation. For that reason he wrote that \"the illegality of cannabis is outrageous, an impediment to full utilization of a drug which helps produce the serenity and insight, sensitivity and fellowship so desperately needed in this increasingly mad and dangerous world.\"\n\nYears later, Sagan became more outspoken about his advocacy, arguing that medical marijuana should be legal for cancer and AIDS patients.\n\n\"Is it rational to forbid patients who are dying from taking marijuana as a palliative to permit them to gain body weight and to get some food down,\" Sagan asked in an interview. \"It seems madness to say, 'We're worried that they're going to become addicted to marijuana' -- there's no evidence whatever that it's an addictive drug, but even if it were, these people are dying, what are we saving them from?\"",

Have you heard the Johnny Cash song 'When the Man Comes Around'? That's what I think we're trying to channel with Apocalypse.\"\n\nIsaac has perviously discussed the word Apocalypse itself as a source of inspiration, which in certain interpretations actually means to reveal. \"We associate so strongly with destruction, but it actually means to lift back the curtains,\" the actor said.\n\nWhen asked what this character would be revealing Isaac replied, \"On an individual level he's able to reveal the true power of his Horsemen and what's true to them.

  "latent_15642": "2015 was a headline grabbing year for extreme weather events. Massive floods, extreme drought and low snowpack were seen around the globe. In Alaska, wildfires scorched over 5 million acres of land. Now the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is taking a closer look and trying to figure out what caused them.\n\nListen Now\n\nJames Partain, a NOAA climatologist, said he can’t go anywhere without someone asking about climate change. His dentist, passengers on airline flights — he says they all want to know what’s triggering these unusual weather events around the state?\n\n“Last night, I was at my restaurant in Eagle River having some supper and my waiter asked the same thing,” Partain said. “He sat down with me.”\n\nPartain recently coauthored part of a report called Explaining Extreme Weather Events of 2015, which his colleagues at NOAA presented this week in San Francisco.\n\nHis contribution focuses on the large wildfires that blazed through Alaska two years ago. That year saw the second largest number of acres destroyed by wildfire since 1940.\n\n“Wildfires are probably the most visible catastrophic footprint of climate change that you can get,” Partain said.\n\nBut Partain said, in the past, it’s been difficult for scientists to answer the bigger question:\n\n“This press release and this paper that we’ve developed shows unequivocally that man-made change is a cause of why 2015 was such a serious event,” Partain said.\n\nPartain says lightning strikes caused most of the wildfires to ignite. About 44 percent were started by people – garbage fires, someone dropping a lit cigarette, etc.\n\nBut he said the unusually dry conditions that caused the wildfires of 2015 to blaze out of control are due to climate change, too. And that’s the part which has been linked to the planet heating up, due to an increase of carbon emissions.\n\n“As man-made climate change continues to advance and increase, we expect to see more and more and more of these very strong fire seasons,” Partain said.\n\nStill, Partain said currently we’re in a La Niña year — meaning things have cooled slightly for now. He expects next year’s wildfire season won’t be as severe as 2015, but it’s unknown how it will actually play out.\n\nPartain welcomes more questions.",

This team has talent — that is no question. James Harden is still averaging 27.8 points a game, and always plays Golden State hard. Dwight Howard shows up whenever convenient and can string together good minutes on the floor. Besides that, they have a lot of OK parts that J.B.

They have pulled together three game winning streaks, followed by four game losing streaks. Their record should be a lot worse, and they are miserable on the road.\n\nWhat to make of this team?\n\nThey will accidentally make the playoffs again, and should scare a team when Howard and Harden get a home game in Houston and act like they care. Until then, they are hovering at mediocre, a long ways away from when this was a big rivalry and a good match up against the Warriors.\n\nLast time these two locked up...\n\nOct 30th - Warriors win in Houston 112-92\n\nDec 31st - Warriors win in Houston 114-110\n\nPredictions\n\nThe Warriors are too locked in and the Rockets are too scrambled for this one to be a challenge. I don't love the front court matchup, and I'm sure the Rockets can get hot if they want to, but the team discipline is not there, and the Warriors offense is clicking on all cylinders. This one is close-ish in the first, but the Rockets run out of steam and Golden State takes it running away in the second half 112-99.",
  "latent_15925": "Under fire: Northamptonshire Police have been accused of helping cover up the Cyril Smith scandal\n\nA police force was last night accused of helping to cover up the Cyril Smith scandal because of the involvement of the security services.\n\nA Freedom of Information request was made for any details held by the force about an incident in the 1980s where the politician was stopped on the M1 and then arrested after child porn was found in the boot of his car.\n\nBut Northamptonshire Police say laws relating to the security services prevent the force from divulging any information it holds on Smith.\n\nIt cited Section 23 of the Freedom of Information Act, which concerns ‘information supplied by or concerning certain security bodies’.\n\nLast night a victim and a campaigning MP condemned the decision as a ‘cover-up’ and called for the information to be released by the security services.\n\nAfter 29-stone Smith died, it was revealed that he was a paedophile who repeatedly escaped police and court action despite sexually abusing boys for decades.\n\nLabour MP Simon Danczuk said: ‘This confirms what we’ve always suspected: that the security services were involved in covering up the crimes of Cyril Smith and it is time for the authorities to reveal to what extent they were involved.\n\n‘Failing to release these documents perpetuates the cover-up that has been going on for four decades.’\n\nKevin Griffiths, 66, who was abused by Smith in Rochdale, said: ‘This stinks to high heaven. Have lessons not been learnt that covering up these crimes is so wrong? The security services – MI5 – should release any files concerning Cyril Smith so the victims can finally have some closure on this.’\n\nHe said the fact the force is citing the security clause is clear proof of MI5 involvement.\n\n‘It’s shocking to think we live in a society that protects paedophiles and abusers while the victims are refused any justice through the use of the secrecy laws,’ he said.\n\nSmith, the Liberal MP for Rochdale, who died aged 82 in 2010, was allegedly stopped on the M1 in Northamptonshire during the 1980s on suspicion of a driving offence.\n\nA search of his car unearthed a collection of child porn and he was arrested and taken to a police station to be questioned.\n\nBut it is understood he was released and allowed to leave after making a telephone call to an unidentified third party in London. According to Mr Danczuk, who also represents Rochdale, police received at least 144 complaints by victims about Smith but MI5 and Special Branch put pressure on officers to drop investigations.\n\nAfter 29-stone Smith (pictured left) died, it was revealed that he was a paedophile who repeatedly escaped police and court action. Labour MP Simon Danczuk (right) has condemned Northamptonshire Police's decision not to release details on Smith's arrest in the 1980s because of the involvement of the security services\n\nAnd he believes MI5 repeatedly stepped in to orchestrate a cover-up throughout Smith’s political career to protect other establishment figures from investigation.\n\nThe incident was described by Mr Danczuk in his book Smile for the Camera: The Double Life of Cyril Smith – which was serialised in the Daily Mail and blew the lid on Smith’s perverted past.\n\nIn March, Northamptonshire Police announced a cold case review of their dealings with the MP over the allegations made in the book. In response to the BBC’s FOI request, the force said it could ‘neither confirm nor deny that it holds any other information’ about the case.\n\nIt also cited other exemptions under the Act, including those relating to law enforcement, personal information and investigations.",

  "latent_16049": "Thierry Neuville has faced a rocky road to reach the position of being a genuine championship contender. The beginning of his career was a journeyman affair, jumping from Citroen to Ford, before eventually settling down at Hyundai. He suffered the ignominy of being demoted to the Korean marque’s junior team after a disappointing start to the 2016 season, albeit bouncing back quickly with a win two rallies later. With reigning world champion\n\nWith reigning world champion Sebastien Ogier starting the year on the back foot after a forced departure from Volkswagen to M-Sport, the stars seemed to have lined up for a Neuville world championship, and yet, as the half-way point of the championship approaches, the Belgian is 22 points behind the four-time champion. With Neuville failing to capitalise fully on Ogier’s difficult transition period, can he hope to challenge for the title at all when coming from behind?\n\nNeuville’s potential for world championships sits within the context of the current benchmark for performance in the WRC, Ogier. The Frenchman has successfully established himself as the superstar of the post-Loeb era, a driver so talented he forced himself out of a job at Citroen for his refusal to concede an inch to Loeb. The pair’s paths to reach their current situation on the face of it have similarities, and yet could not be further apart.\n\nWhile the formative years of his career in Belgium and Germany were at the wheel of a Ford, it was also with the PSA Group that Neuville established himself in the WRC. His path to Citroen’s junior team in the premier class was a much tougher one, however, demonstrating plenty of pace but failing to finish all but two events in his sole JWRC campaign. It took a diversion to the now defunct Intercontinental Rally Challenge – where he piloted a factory Peugeot 207 – before getting his break in the same team which gave Ogier his start in the WRC.\n\nMany expected him to succeed Loeb for 2013, but having only been offered a seat-share with the outgoing world champion by Citroen team principal Yves Matton, he elected to follow Nasser Al-Attiyah to Ford, for whom he deputised twice that season. Without the pressure of being a factory junior driver, 2014 would be his breakout season, running rings around the nominated factory entries of Mads Ostberg and Evgeny Novikov.\n\nThose performances were what led to his appointment as Hyundai’s lead driver. The i20 was not the fastest car out of the box, but as it received further development to bring it closer to the Fords and Citroens, the pressure mounted to consistently deliver results. In the early months of 2016, it seemed that pressure had finally become too much to handle.\n\nWhile Ogier was gallivanting off to his fourth successive championship, Neuville had reached a historic low for his career. With Hayden Paddon clinching his maiden WRC victory, the Kiwi was bumped up to the lead Hyundai car, whilst Neuville saw himself sent to the Hyundai N squad, the team for which drivers not nominated to score manufacturer points would compete for.\n\n“It will not continue like this,” he stated flatly at the time. “It’s no disadvantage to be in the number 20 car. It will give us more freedom and space to push if needed, it’s a bit more relaxed.”\n\nHis assessment of the disappointing situation he found himself in, turned out to be entirely accurate. That experience built the foundations of his current title challenge, securing only his second WRC victory after nearly two years of waiting at Rally Italy two events later. For the next round in Poland he was back in the #3 Hyundai, and strung together a run of five consecutive podiums at the end of the season, edging out the second Volkswagen of Andreas Mikkelsen for runners-up honours.\n\nThis uptick in form came at exactly the right moment for Neuville, as Ogier was suddenly in crisis. With the diesel emissions scandal causing Volkswagen to pull the plug on their all-conquering WRC programme, suddenly Hyundai were left as the form team in the WRC. Ogier hurriedly acquired a seat at M-Sport after a deal for Martin Prokop’s Jipocar team to run the 2017 specification VW Polo R fell through, and the seemingly untouchable Frenchman was unexpectedly on the back foot.\n\nGoing into this year, the Belgian had inherited championship favourite status. The new generation Hyundai looked solid in testing, and was able to develop the car in his preferred direction. The main championship protagonists from recent years had no such advantage; Ogier being dropped into M-Sport at the last minute, and Jari-Matti Latvala only managing a couple of weeks of testing with the brand new Toyota squad. The stage was set for a title showdown between Thierry Neuville and Kris Meeke, now Citroen’s main man, whose team was the other manufacturer to put in a strong showing in pre-season testing.\n\nStraight out of the blocks in Monte Carlo, Neuville demonstrated he was the man to beat. He found himself in a class of his own, winning stage after stage while Ogier put his Fiesta in a ditch, then understeered off into a field, and made it a trifecta by clattering into a bank. It seemed the dynamic of the championship had swung away from the Frenchman and towards Neuville after years of years of being the shadows.\n\nA drainage culvert on the tarmac’s edge in SS13 unravelled everything he had built up in the previous nine months.\n\nNeuville’s safety crew had forewarned him and co-driver Nicolas Gilsoul about said culvert, located on the outside of a fast left midway through the stage, but he kicked the rear of his i20 out and broke the right rear suspension with it regardless. His 51 second lead over the ragged Ogier was wiped away in an instant.\n\n“Even Sebastien Ogier went off twice, but he had more luck than us,” he said afterwards. “But that’s part of the rally, to be honest. We have been lucky ourselves in the past, just not this time when we really deserved it.”\n\nWhile the mechanical damage to the Hyundai was all patched up in time for Sweden, the psychological damage was not. The cold, icy conditions were somewhat similar to the treacherous mountain roads of Southern France in which the Monte is held, and similar too was the outcome of the rally. A comfortable gap had been built over Jari-Matti Latvala by the closing stages of the second day once again, but he took entirely the wrong leaf out of\n\nA comfortable gap had been built over Jari-Matti Latvala by the closing stages of the second day once again, but he took entirely the wrong leaf out of the Finn’s book. If there is one moment from his rival’s highlight reel he needed to avoid, it was Poland 2009.\n\nIn Latvala’s case, it was an Armco barrier, and a second place wasted away. For Neuville, a stack of tyres in the Karlstad superspecial test once again eliminated him from contention, blowing two likely wins in a row. While the newly rejuvenated Toyota driver went on to take the marque’s first win since 1999, Neuville was shell-shocked by his own actions.\n\n“Oh no! Oh f*ck! What was that? It’s not possible!” he exclaimed, with both his car and his spirits broken. He was a little more reflective once the emotions of a sudden retirement had subsided, but the message was largely the same as previous near-misses.\n\n“After Monte we could not believe it has happened again, but what can we do? I think we were doing a perfect job, Nicolas [Gilsoul] and me, and I have no regrets on that side, but at the end we missed out on luck.”\n\nLuck appears to be a recurring theme, and yet despite his suggestion his luck deserted him on these occasions, luck had actually been on his side. The opening five rounds of the season were most of the luck he was going to get this year. Sebastien Ogier being on the back foot is such a rarity, and opportunity that must be capitalised on. For five rounds, the title favourite was on the back foot, lost at sea with a car he couldn’t figure out how to set-up to his liking. Rally Portugal demonstrated those teething problems had finally been put behind him. The hole in his title defence has been patched up.\n\nHaving been presented with the closest thing to an open goal one could probably hope for with Ogier, Neuville missed the opportunity entirely. The margins from this point forward between the two will be finer than before, and so his best opportunity for a world title may have already gone past him.\n\nWhen Neuville alludes to the need for more luck, he has the right idea in mind. He has a championship rival for whom it took two punctures and an engine failure in Catalunya back in 2011 to stop him from challenging the greatest rally driver of all time – at least statistically – for a world title. Given Ogier’s imperious form the moment he had cracked the enigma of his Fiesta’s setup, it will take a healthy dose of luck – perhaps in the form of a drainage culvert or stack of tyres standing in the way of Ogier – to close that 22 point gap and take a debut world title ahead of the defining talent of the post-Loeb era.",

Now her name is Reeva Steenkamp, killed by Olympic sprinter and double amputee Oscar “the Blade Runner” Pistorius.\n\nWe don’t know whether Pistorius is guilty of murdering a woman he claims to have deeply loved or is merely guilty of being an unbelievably irresponsible gun owner, firing four bullets into the door of his bathroom in an effort to hit an imagined burglar.\n\nWe do know that this is either an all-too-familiar story of a man and the woman he dated and then killed, or it’s the story of a man who thought a burglar had penetrated the electrified fence that surrounded his gated community to break into his house and use his toilet.\n\nJust as with Belcher and Perkins, we will learn more than we ever wanted or needed to know in the weeks to come about the nature of Pistorius and Steenkamp’s relationship.\n\nWe will learn about the “allegations of a domestic nature” that had brought police to his home in the past. We will learn about Pistorius’s previous allegedly violent relationships with women. We will learn about the variety of guns he kept at close hand.\n\nWe will surely discuss male athletes and violence against women: the sort of all-too-common story that can create commonality between a football player from Long Island and a sprinter from Johannesburg. We might even ponder the way these gated communities, one of which was also the site of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin’s murder two years ago, become throbbing pods of paranoia and parabellums.\n\nWe will learn about everything except what actually matters: there is a global epidemic of violence against women, and South Africa is at its epicentre.\n\nTwo days before Steenkamp’s death, there were protests outside South African parliament about the failures of the state to adjudicate the unsolved rapes and murders of women across the country.\n\nAs the executive director of the Rape Crisis Centre Kathleen Dey said on February 12: “There are no overnight cures to the scourge of rape that is affecting South Africa. We have the highest instance of rape in the world and we cannot continue in this way.”\n\nThe official statistics are shocking. Every seventeen seconds a woman is raped in South Africa, yet just one out of nine women report it and only 14% of perpetrators are convicted.\n\nThe Rape Crisis Centre and other groups are starved for funds, with the demand for social services, counseling and even HIV tests far outstripping their capacity.\n\nThere have also had to be demonstrations against what the Women’s League of the African National Congress has termed “femicide”. In this country of 50 million people, three women a day are killed by their partners.\n\nWhen news of Steenkamp’s death became front-page news across the country, it pushed out ongoing headlines of the February 2 Western Cape gang rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl named Anene Booysen. Before her death, Booysen identified one of her perpetrators: it was someone she both trusted and knew.\n\nThis is hardly a South African problem, of course. We are confronting nothing less than a global system of brutal misogyny. Too many men across the world see too many women as repositories of their rage, frustration, narcissism or simply their will to enact violence.\n\nThe World Health Organisation’s reports that depending on the country, anywhere from “15% (Japan) to 71% (Ethiopia) of women report physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner at some point in their lives”. Like in South Africa, every statistic on this issue must be viewed with scepticism because of the transnational stigmas and shame that silence women who have survived.\n\nIn the United States, rape culture and the rape it produces have been normalised to the point where Notre Dame athletes accused of rape can take the field for a national championship football game without a peep from the sports pages.\n\nIt is a country where Fox News host Bob Beckel can ask incredulously: “When’s the last time you heard about rape on a college campus?” It is a country, and a world, where people are now saying enough is enough.\n\nIt is a global problem that will get solved only with a global response if we want to even dream of a world where violence against women is a relic of history. That is the sentiment behind initiatives like “One Billion Rising to End Violence Against Women and Girls”, and this kind of brave solidarity and support is extremely welcome.\n\nThis very solidarity was displayed by Reeva Steenkamp herself just before her death. Distraught over the murder of Anene Booysen, Steenkamp sent out an instragam message. It read: “I woke up in a happy safe home this morning. Not everyone did. Speak out against the rape of individuals in SA. RIP Anene Booysen.”\n\nShort of a billion of us rising, happy and safe homes will not be a reality for the women of the world. It should be. We have to act now unless we want to keep telling the stories of Kasandra Perkins, Anene Booysen and Reeva Steenkamp over and over again, only with different names.\n\n[First appeared at The Nation.

Modern peso and dollar currencies have a common origin in the 15th–19th century-Spanish dollar, most continuing to use its sign, \"$\".[1] The Mexican peso is the 10th most traded currency in the world, the third most traded currency from America (after the United States dollar and Canadian dollar), and the most traded currency from Latin America.[2]\n\nThe current ISO 4217 code for the peso is MXN; prior to the 1993 revaluation (see below), the code MXP was used. The peso is subdivided into 100 centavos, represented by \"¢\". As of 17 February 2019 , the peso's exchange rate was $21.75 per euro and $19.27 per U.S. dollar.[3]\n\nEtymology [ edit ]\n\nThe name was first used in reference to pesos oro (gold weights) or pesos plata (silver weights). The Spanish word peso means \"weight\". Compare the British pound sterling.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nlatest rates The exchange rate of Mexican pesos per U.S. dollar since November 1991. Source: Bank of Mexico\n\nFirst peso [ edit ]\n\nThe peso was the name of the eight-real coins issued in Mexico by Spain. These were the so-called Spanish dollars or pieces of eight in wide circulation in the Americas and Asia from the height of the Spanish Empire until the early 19th century (the United States accepted the Spanish dollar as legal tender until the Coinage Act of 1857).\n\nIn 1863, the first issue was made of coins denominated in centavos, worth one hundredth of the peso. This was followed in 1866 by coins denominated \"one peso\". Coins denominated in reales continued to be issued until 1897. In 1905, the gold content of the peso was reduced by 49.3% but the silver content of the peso remained unchanged (subsidiary coins were debased). However, from 1918 onward, the weight and fineness of all the silver coins declined, until 1977, when the last silver 100-peso coins were minted.\n\nNew peso [ edit ]\n\nThroughout most of the 20th century, the Mexican peso remained one of the more stable currencies in Latin America, since the economy did not experience periods of hyperinflation common to other countries in the region. However, after the oil crisis of the late 1970s, Mexico defaulted on its external debt in 1982, and as a result the country suffered a severe case of capital flight, followed by several years of inflation and devaluation, until a government economic strategy called the \"Stability and Economic Growth Pact\" (Pacto de estabilidad y crecimiento económico, PECE) was adopted under President Carlos Salinas. On January 1, 1993 the Bank of Mexico introduced a new currency, the nuevo peso (\"new peso\", or MXN), written \"N$\" followed by the numerical amount.[4] One new peso, or N$1.00, was equal to 1000 of the obsolete MXP pesos.[4]\n\nOn January 1, 1996, the modifier nuevo was dropped from the name and new coins and banknotes – identical in every respect to the 1993 issue, with the exception of the now absent word \"nuevo\" – were put into circulation. The ISO 4217 code, however, remained unchanged as MXN.\n\nThanks to the stability of the Mexican economy and the growth in foreign investment, the Mexican peso is now among the 15 most traded currency units.\n\nCoins [ edit ]\n\n19th century [ edit ]\n\nThe first coins of the peso currency were 1 centavo pieces minted in 1863. Emperor Maximilian, ruler of the Second Mexican Empire from 1864–1867,[5] minted the first coins with the legend \"peso\" on them. His portrait was on the obverse, with the legend \"Maximiliano Emperador;\" the reverse shows the imperial arms and the legends \"Imperio Mexicano\" and \"1 Peso\" and the date. They were struck from 1866 to 1867. A limited-edition twenty-peso coin was struck, during 1866 only, comprising 87.5 percent gold and also featuring Maximilian on one side and the coat of arms on the other.[6]\n\nThe New Mexican republic continued to strike the 8 reales piece, but also began minting coins denominated in centavos and pesos. In addition to copper 1 centavo coins, silver (.903 fineness) coins of 5, 10, 25 and 50 centavos and 1 peso were introduced between 1867 and 1869. Gold 1, 2½, 5, 10 and twenty-peso coins were introduced in 1870. The obverses featured the Mexican 'eagle' and the legend \"Republica Mexicana.\" The reverses of the larger coins showed a pair of scales; those of the smaller coins, the denomination. One-peso coins were made from 1865 to 1873, when 8 reales coins resumed production. In 1882, cupro-nickel 1, 2 and 5 centavos coins were issued but they were only minted for two years. The 1 peso was reintroduced in 1898, with the Phrygian cap, or liberty cap design being carried over from the 8 reales.\n\n20th century [ edit ]\n\nIn 1905 a monetary reform was carried out in which the gold content of the peso was reduced by 49.36% and the silver coins were (with the exception of the 1-peso) reduced to token issues. Bronze 1- and 2-centavos, nickel 5-centavos, silver 10-, 20-, and 50-centavos and gold 5- and 10-pesos were issued.\n\nIn 1910, a new peso coin was issued, the famous Caballito, considered one of the most beautiful of Mexican coins. The obverse had the Mexican official coat of arms (an eagle with a snake in its beak, standing on a cactus plant) and the legends \"Estados Unidos Mexicanos\" and \"Un Peso.\" The reverse showed a woman riding a horse, her hand lifted high in exhortation holding a torch, and the date. These were minted in .903 silver from 1910 to 1914.\n\nBetween 1917 and 1919, the gold coinage was expanded to include 2-, 2½-, and 20-peso coins. However, circulation issues of gold ceased in 1921. In 1918, the peso coin was debased, bringing it into line with new silver 10-, 20-, and 50-centavo coins. All were minted in .800 fineness to a standard of 14.5 g to the peso. The liberty cap design, already on the other silver coins, was applied to the peso. Another debasement in 1920 reduced the fineness to .720 with 12 g of silver to the peso. Bronze 10- and 20-centavo coins were introduced in 1919 and 1920, but coins of those denominations were also minted in silver until 1935 and 1943, respectively.\n\nIn 1947, a new issue of silver coins was struck, with the 50-centavo and 1-peso in .500 fineness and a new 5-peso coin in .900 fineness. A portrait of José María Morelos appeared on the 1 peso and this was to remain a feature of the 1-peso coin until its demise. The silver content of this series was 5.4 g to the peso. This was reduced to 4 g in 1950, when .300 fineness 25- and 50-centavo, and 1-peso coins were minted alongside .720 fineness 5 pesos. A new portrait of Morelos appeared on the 1 peso, with Cuauhtemoc on the 50-centavo and Miguel Hidalgo on the 5-peso coins. No reference was made to the silver content except on the 5-peso coin. During this period 5 peso, and to a lesser extent, 10-peso coins were also used as vehicles for occasional commemorative strikings.[7]\n\nIn 1955, bronze 50-centavos were introduced, along with smaller 5-peso coins and a new 10-peso coin. In 1957, new 1-peso coins were issued in .100 silver. This series contained 1.6 g of silver per peso. A special 1-peso was minted in 1957 to commemorate Benito Juárez and the constitution of 1857. These were the last silver pesos. The 5-peso coin now weighed 18 grams and was still 0.720 silver; the 10-peso coin weighed 28 grams and was in 0.900 silver.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1971, new coinage was introduced, consisting of brass 1- and 5-centavos, cupro-nickel 10-, 25-, and 50-centavos, 1-, 5-, and 10-pesos, and silver 25-pesos (only issued 1972). In 1971 José Maria Teclo Morelos y Pavón wanted his own coins to be printed. In order not to get mixed In with the regular general coins these were printed with a symbol to the right. These coins were removed from circulation in 1967 and are now worth anywhere from 600 - 2,000 dollars in the U.S. In 1977, silver 100-pesos were issued for circulation. In 1980, smaller 5-peso coins were introduced alongside 20-pesos and (from 1982) 50-pesos in cupro-nickel. Between 1978 and 1982, the sizes of the coins for 20 centavos and above were reduced. Base metal 100-, 200-, 500-, 1000-, and 5000-peso coins were introduced between 1984 and 1988.\n\nNuevo peso [ edit ]\n\nAs noted above, the nuevo peso (new peso) was the result of hyperinflation in Mexico. In 1993, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari stripped three zeros from the peso, creating a parity of $1 New Peso for $1000 of the old ones.[4]\n\nThe transition was done both by having the people trade in their old notes, and by removing the old notes from circulation at the banks, over a period of three years from January 1, 1993 to January 1, 1996. At that time, the word \"nuevo\" was removed from all new currency being printed and the \"nuevo\" notes were retired from circulation, thus returning the currency and the notes to be denominated just \"peso\" again.\n\nConfusion was avoided by making the nuevo peso currency almost identical to the old \"peso\". Both of them circulated at the same time, while all currency that only said \"peso\" was removed from circulation. The Bank of Mexico then issued new currency with new graphics, also under the \"nuevo peso\". These were followed in due course by the current, almost identical, \"peso\" currency without the word nuevo.\n\nIn 1993, coins of the new currency (dated 1992) were issued in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 centavos, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 nuevos pesos. The 5 and 10 centavos were minted in stainless steel and the 20 and 50 centavos in aluminium bronze. The nuevo peso denominations were bimetallic, with the 1, 2 and 5 nuevos pesos having aluminium bronze centers and stainless steel rings, and the 10, 20 and 50 nuevos pesos having .925 silver centers and aluminium bronze rings.\n\nIn 1996, the word Nuevo was removed from the coins. New 10 pesos were introduced with base metal replacing the silver center. The 20, 50, and 100-peso coins are the only currently circulating coinage in the world to contain any silver.\n\nIn 2003, the Banco de Mexico began the gradual launch of a new series of bimetallic $100 coins. These number 32 – one for each of the nation's 31 states, plus the Federal District. While the obverse of these coins bears the traditional coat of arms of Mexico, their reverses show the individual coats of arms of the component states. The first states to be celebrated in this fashion were Zacatecas, Yucatán, Veracruz, and Tlaxcala. In circulation they are extraordinarily rare, but their novelty value offsets the unease most users feel at having such a large amount of money in a single coin. Although the Bank has tried to encourage users to collect full sets of these coins, issuing special display folders for the purpose, the high cost involved has worked against them. Bullion versions of these coins are also available, with the outer ring made of gold, instead of aluminium bronze.\n\nThe coins commonly encountered in circulation have face values of 50¢, $1, $2, $5, and $10. The 5¢, 10¢ and 20¢ coins are uncommon due to their small value. Small commodities are priced in multiples of 10¢, but stores may choose to round the total prices to 50¢. There is also a trend for supermarkets to ask customers to round up the total to the nearest 50¢ or 1 peso to automatically donate the difference to charities. The $20, $50 and $100 coins are rarely seen in circulation due to the wide use of the lighter banknotes of the same denominations as well as their metal value.\n\nBanknotes [ edit ]\n\nFirst peso [ edit ]\n\nThe first banknotes issued by the Mexican state were produced in 1823 by Emperor Agustin de Iturbide in denominations of 1, 2 and 10 pesos. Similar issues were made by the republican government later that same year. Ten-pesos notes were also issued by Emperor Maximilian in 1866 but, until the 1920s, banknote production lay entirely in the hands of private banks and local authorities.\n\nIn 1920, the Monetary Commission (Comisión Monetaria) issued 50-centavos and 1-peso notes whilst the Bank of Mexico (Banco de México) issued 2-pesos notes. From 1925, the Bank issued notes for 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pesos, with 500 and 1000 pesos following in 1931. From 1935, the Bank also issued 1-peso notes and, from 1943, 10,000 pesos.\n\nProduction of 1-peso notes ceased in 1970, followed by 5 pesos in 1972, 10 and 20 pesos in 1977, 50 pesos in 1984, 100 pesos in 1985, 500 pesos in 1987 and 1,000 pesos in 1988. 5,000-pesos notes were introduced in 1981, followed by 2,000 pesos in 1983, 20,000 pesos in 1985, 50,000 pesos in 1986 and 100,000 pesos in 1988.\n\nSeries AA [ edit ]\n\nSeries A [ edit ]\n\nSeries B [ edit ]\n\nIn 1993, notes were introduced in the new currency for 10, 20, 50, and 100 nuevos pesos. These notes are designated series B by the Bank of Mexico (Banco de México). (It is important to note that this series designation is not the 1 or 2 letter series label printed on the banknotes themselves.) All were printed with the date July 31, 1992. The designs were carried over from the corresponding notes of the old peso.\n\nSeries C [ edit ]\n\nAll Series C notes had brand new designs and were printed with the date December 10, 1993, but they were not issued until October 1994. The word \"nuevos\" remained and banknotes in denominations of 500 nuevos pesos was added. The 500 nuevos pesos note was worth more than US$100 when it was introduced, but its value dropped to almost equal to $100 by the end of 1994.\n\nSeries D [ edit ]\n\nThe next series of banknotes, designated Series D, was introduced in 1996. It is a modified version of Series C with the word \"nuevos\" dropped, the bank title changed from \"El Banco de México\" to \"Banco de México\" and the clause \"pagará a la vista al portador\" (Pay at sight to the bearer) removed. There are several printed dates for each denomination. In 2000, a commemorative series was issued which was like series D except for the additional text \"75 aniversario 1925-2000\" under the bank title. It refers to the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the Bank. While series D includes the $10 note and is still legal tender, they are no longer printed, are seldom seen, and the coin is more common. $10 notes are rarely found in circulation.\n\nStarting from 2001, each denomination in the series was upgraded gradually. On October 15, 2001, in an effort to combat counterfeiting, Series D notes of 50 pesos and above were further modified with the addition of an iridescent strip. On notes of 100 pesos and above, the denomination is printed in color-shifting ink in the top right corner.\n\nOn September 30, 2002, a new $20 note was introduced. The new $20 is printed on longer-lasting polymer plastic rather than paper. A new $1000 note was issued on November 15, 2004, which was worth about US$88 upon introduction. The Bank of Mexico refers to the $20, $50, and $1000 notes during this wave of change as \"series D1\".\n\nOn April 5, 2004, the Chamber of Deputies approved an initiative to demand that the Bank of Mexico produce by January 1, 2006 notes and coins that are identifiable by the blind population (estimated at more than 750,000 visually impaired citizens, including 250,000 that are completely blind).[8]\n\nOn December 19, 2005, $100, $200, and $500 MXN banknotes include raised, tactile patterns (like Braille), meant to make them distinguishable for people with vision incapacities. This system has been questioned[citation needed] and many demand that it be replaced by actual Braille so it can be used by foreign visitors to Mexico not used to these symbols.[9] The Banco de México, however, says they will continue issuing the symbol bills.\n\nThe raised, tactile patterns are as follows:[10]\n\nValue Bill Description of pattern $100 Five diagonal lines side by side, with a negative slope, each broken up into three segments. $200 Small broken-up square pattern. $500 Four horizontal lines under each other, each broken up into three segments.\n\nSeries F [ edit ]\n\nIn September 2006, it was announced that a new family of banknotes would be launched gradually. The 50-peso denomination in polymer was launched in November 2006. The 20-peso note was launched in August 2007. The 1,000-peso note was launched in March 2008.\n\nThe $200 was issued in 2008, and the $100 and $500 notes were released in August 2010. This family is the F Series. A revised $50 note, with improved security features was released on May 6, 2013. This note is part of the F Series family of banknotes issued by the Banco de Mexico (as Type F1).[11]\n\nCommemorative banknotes [ edit ]\n\nOn September 29, 2009, The Bank of Mexico unveiled a set of commemorative banknotes. The 100-peso denomination note commemorates the centennial of the Beginning of the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920). The 200-peso denomination note commemorates the bicentennial of the start of the Mexican War for Independence which began in 1810. There was a printing error in the $100 notes, in the small letters (almost unnoticeable, as they are very small and the same color as the waving lines), near the top right corner, just above the transparent corn, from the side of the \"La Revolución contra la dictadura Porfiriana\", it is written: \"Sufragio electivo y no reelección\" (Elective suffrage and no reelection), this supposed to be a quote to Francisco I. Madero's famous phrase, but he said \"Sufragio efectivo no reelección\" (Valid Suffrage, No Reelection). President Felipe Calderón made a newspaper announcement in which he apologized for this, and said that the notes were going to continue in circulation, and that they would retain their value.[12]\n\nLikewise, a 100-peso banknote that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the enactment of the Constitution of Mexico was unveiled and issued in 2017.[13]\n\nCommemorative notes from Series F [7] Image Value Dimensions (millimeters) Main Color Description Date of Obverse Reverse Obverse Reverse printing issue withdrawal $100 134 × 66 mm Red Steam locomotive \"Del Porfirismo a la Revolución\" (From the Dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz to the Revolution) by David Alfaro Siqueiros.

Congressmen swearing to observe and enforce the Mexican Constitution. February 5, 2017\n\nSeries G [ edit ]\n\nIn August 2018 a new series of notes began circulation. New anti-counterfeiting measures were implemented. The obverse of the notes will portray important historical eras and individuals. The reverse of the notes will portray the various ecosystems of the country through one of the World Heritage sites of Mexico.\n\nThis series will not include a $20 note; it will gradually be replaced by a coin.[14] If Banco de Mexico finds that there is a necessity, the introduction of a $2000 note will occur.[14]\n\nUse outside Mexico [ edit ]\n\nThe 18th and 19th century Spanish dollar and Mexican peso were widely used in the early United States. On July 6, 1785, the value of the United States dollar was set by decree to approximately match the Spanish dollar. Both were based on the silver content of the coins.[16] The first U.S. dollar coins were not issued until April 2, 1792, and the peso continued to be officially recognized and used in the United States, along with other foreign coins, until February 21, 1857. In Canada, it remained legal tender, along with other foreign silver coins, until 1854 and continued to circulate beyond that date. The Mexican peso also served as the model for the Straits dollar (now the Singapore/Brunei Dollar), the Hong Kong dollar, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan.[17] The term Chinese yuan refers to the round Spanish dollars, Mexican pesos and other 8 reales silver coins which saw use in China during the 19th and 20th century. The Mexican peso was also briefly legal tender in 19th century Siam, when government mints were unable to accommodate a sudden influx of foreign traders, and was exchanged at a rate of three pesos to one Thai baht.[18]\n\nModern use [ edit ]\n\nSome establishments in border areas of the United States accept Mexican pesos as currency, such as certain border Walmart stores, certain border gas stations such as Circle K, and the La Bodega supermarkets in San Ysidro on the Tijuana border.[19] In 2007, Pizza Patrón, a chain of pizza restaurants in the southwestern part of the U.S., started to accept the currency, sparking controversy in the United States.[20][21] Other than in U.S., Guatemalan, and Belizean border towns, Mexican pesos are generally not accepted as currency outside of Mexico.[citation needed]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

Worn for the first time at the Grammy Awards, the hat took on a life of its own. First as a Twitter feed, and then as a meme.\n\nThe hat, designed by Vivienne Westwood, no less, was often imitated - with varied results. The country cringed at James Cordon's attempt to bond with Pharrell while presenting the Brits. It didn't quite come off.\n\nBut the hat lives on: and can be now be viewed in a museum.\n\nAnd what did Pharrell himself have to say about the whole craze?\n\n\"I was just wearing a hat.\"\n\nFair enough, mate.\n\nFebruary was about… goats\n\nImage copyright Max Murs Image caption Goats + metal sheet = viral history\n\nGoats!

Well, aside from a few cameras to capture it all on.\n\nJaw-droppingly dangerous, and it many cases illegal, the videos are enough to make you feel dizzy in your chair.\n\nOne of the stand-out clips of the year was released in February, when two masked chaps climbed the tallest building in China.

A whole heap.\n\nThere were some criticisms about the effectiveness of donations, and some knocked it for being a bit self-centred - more about showing what celeb connections you had - but the figures don't lie.

All brilliant, but too rude to share here.\n\nAlso in November, people were talking about the wonderful Museum of Selfies - a collection of images that transforms some of the world's oldest paintings. The sophisticated face of the selfie craze.

See if you can spot it. More difficult - spot the cameo by someone, a BBC someone, who appeared in last year's viral list.\n\nThe Wealdstone Raider's viral fame was entirely accidental.

Week after week, clip after clip, millions and millions of views.\n\nIn May there was Kevin Spacey became an honorary member of the Ragtime Gals. In November, Fallon stepped in for an injured Bono to perform U2 track Desire. And in October, Daniel Radcliffe surprised everyone with a flawless performance of Alphabet Aerobics.\n\nAnd there we have it. If you ask me, the strongest year yet for viral fun - with a healthy dose of charity and goodwill to match. Happy New Year, internetters!\n\nWhat did we miss?

  "latent_16263": "Clinton and Trump deliver their convention speeches in July. (Reuters photos: Jim Young, Mike Segar)\n\nBoth major-party nominees favor statism over free markets.\n\nLiberalism is in trouble.\n\nNo, not the authoritarian, big-government, modern variety. That’s doing just fine, with the two leading presidential candidates more or less equally devoted to it. But the classical liberalism of free markets, equal treatment under law, and individual rights is taking a real beating.\n\nOne needn’t paper over past political disagreements to recognize that there is something qualitatively different about what seems to be happening today. We are not arguing about whether federal spending should rise or fall by some small percentage of GDP, whether taxes should go up or down, or how to regulate this or that. Sure, those issues come up, but at a more fundamental level, this election is about the relationship between the individual and the state, and neither of the major candidates is taking the side of the individual.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton see government as the preeminent force in our lives. The words “liberty” or “limited government” or “Constitution” almost never pass their lips. Their entire campaigns are based on what government should do for us or give to us.\n\nBoth candidates believe that it is the government’s job to create or preserve jobs. Consider trade. Both Trump and Clinton would restrict our right to buy and sell where we please, even though doing so would increase costs to consumers and spark retaliation that could cost jobs elsewhere. Trump’s call to lower taxes is belied by his desire to impose new taxes on consumers, a.k.a. tariffs. (Hillary, of course, doesn’t even pretend that she wants lower taxes.) But beyond the economic malpractice, what is truly troubling is the belief that the government should choose which jobs should be shielded from the “creative destruction” of the free market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs long ago as 1845, Frédéric Bastiat pointed out the foolishness of such policies. His satiric Candle-makers’ Petition posited the candle-makers guild asking for protection from their unfair competitor — the sun. In fact, since at least Adam Smith, free-market economists have understood that, while there are always winners and losers, trade enriches society overall, increasing both growth and innovation. But Trump and Clinton choose government, and its ability to pick winners and losers, over the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen not “protecting” jobs, both Trump and Clinton want government to create jobs directly, hence their proposals for massive infrastructure programs. Again, they ignore the longstanding consensus of classical liberal economics that government ultimately can’t create jobs. Any money that the government spends on infrastructure — or anything else — must ultimately be extracted from the economy through debt or taxes. That means there is less money available for the private sector to create jobs. Neither Trump nor Clinton would create new jobs. They would simply have the government choose which jobs get created.\n\nBoth also see government as a means for propping up wages. Whether it’s Clinton’s (and sometimes Trump’s) plan to hike the minimum wage, or Trump’s call to restrict the labor supply through immigration controls, both want government to pay workers more than what a free market would provide.\n\nBoth Clinton and Trump see it as government’s job to provide Americans with whatever we need.\n\nTrump and Clinton don’t stop at jobs and wages either. From health care to child care to retirement, both see it as government’s job to provide Americans with whatever we need. If there is a problem faced by someone somewhere in America, they believe that government can and should intervene. This obviously flies in the face of government failures in everything from the War on Poverty to the War on Drugs, but it is a recipe for essentially unlimited government. Government becomes not just a village, but our mommy, daddy, and brother’s keeper. Civil society withers and dies, replaced by the beneficent state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNor does Trump and Clinton’s love affair with government power stop with economics. In almost any given situation, from freedom of speech to freedom of religion to police power, their default is in favor of government control. The idea of individual autonomy seems completely foreign to them. Clinton clearly thinks in terms of the collective, rather than the individual. And Trump compounds his anti-liberalism with appeals to nationalism and racial resentment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe United States is hardly alone in witnessing the rise of a new illiberal politics. Europe is rife with it, from Marine Le Pen’s National Front in France and the Law and Justice party in Poland to Jobbik in Hungary or Vladimir Putin in Russia.

  "latent_16353": "As a politician, I often find myself in situations where, unfortunately, I express a certain thought or idea poorly, or find my words taken out of context. Indeed, that is what happened this weekend. Upon reviewing the impromptu remarks I made Sunday afternoon, I can now see that I used the wrong words in the wrong way. I would now like to set the record straight with the American people and clear up some confusion about what it was I intended to convey.\n\nYou see, what I said was, “If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.” But what I meant to say was, “I am a worthless, moronic sack of shit and an utterly irredeemable human being who needs to shut up and go away forever.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is clear to me now that I did not choose my words with care and did not get across the point I was trying to convey. In hindsight, I guess instead of using the words “legitimate rape,” I should have used the words “I am an unforgivable, unrepentant, and unconscionable subhuman dickhead.” Or better yet, “I am an evil, fucked-up man who should never have been elected to the United States Congress, and anyone who would vote for me is probably a pretty big fucking dumbshit, too.” See how much more sense that makes? It’s amazing how a few key word changes can totally alter the meaning of a statement.\n\nBecause, of course, it’s all about context. And yes, when you take what I said out of context, I can see how it might sound like I’m denying that women can be impregnated via rape. This is, I assure you, not what I was trying to express at all. Such is the age we live in that one little sentence excerpted in a news report can come back to haunt a person in a pretty big hurry. But if you actually go back and look at the remarks closely, you’ll see that what I was actually trying to convey in my statement was that\n\n(1) I am a big fucking idiot,\n\n(2) I am a nauseating slug of a human being who doesn’t deserve to live, and\n\n(3) I am essentially everything that’s wrong with this country and with humanity in general.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHonestly, that’s all I was trying to get across there. It was a simple misunderstanding, really.\n\nIt’s funny, because, in my head, I remember thinking very vividly, “I, Rep. Todd Akin, am a bigoted jackass who probably should not be alive, let alone in political office. People need to know what a terrible person I am so they will then remember to punch me in the face anytime they get the chance.” But when I opened my mouth and tried to articulate that thought, somehow I blurted out the thing about rape instead of just saying, in plain English, that I am awful, just purely and incontrovertibly awful.\n\nFrankly, it’s hard not to make a mistake from time to time when you’re in the public eye as much as I am. I am constantly having to speak my mind in a public forum, and sometimes, when all I’m trying to say is something simple and inarguable, like, “Sweet Jesus, I am the worst person who has ever lived,” I wind up saying something completely different. It’s frustrating, really. Because I have a lot of very pertinent and very well-thought out things to say about how somebody should just smack me in the head with a goddamned cricket bat because of how brainless and insensitive I am, but instead my words just come out all jumbled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess I just have a habit of putting my foot in my mouth! And for being the very worst that Western Civilization has to offer!\n\nSo let me take this opportunity to be very specific about what I meant Sunday, which was this: I am not a competent or respectable politician; I am, essentially, a subhuman monster of a prick, a prick as profoundly insensitive as he is monumentally unintelligent in every respect; somebody should apply dozens of layers of duct tape to my mouth every morning so that words are not able to exit my large, dumb, misogynist, imbecilic mouth at any point; I make the planet worse; I don’t know jack shit about any of the topics I spoke about in that interview, or about any topics at all, really; I should apologize every day to the women of the world, but doing so would most likely be an exercise in futility given my rock-bottom intellect and my complete and utter lack of human decency; I am, in no uncertain terms, not even worth the time it took you to read this.\n\nThat’s what I meant to say. Sorry for the confusion.",

  "latent_16476": "Greetings Citizens,\n\nArena Commander 1.0 is here! Today’s release marks the most significant update to Arena Commander yet, adding both the long-awaited lobby system and more than tripling the number of flyable ships. Every variant of the Aurora, Mustang, 300 and Hornet are now flyable, as are the base models of the Cutlass and the Avenger. If you’ve been waiting to fly one of Star Citizen’s single-seaters, there’s a good chance your ship has come in today!\n\nArena Commander 1.0 adds a host of new ship upgrades as well as significant enhancements to many of the game’s systems. Included for the first time are a ship signature system, a thruster power system, and a lateral g-force system. It contains the first iteration of the game’s lobby and we have launched a friends system in the game and on the RSI site to help you connect. Audio and visual effects have been updated throughout the game, with new animations, new textures, new cameras and more. You can find the complete list of changes, which range from the major updates below to dozens of game balancing changes and technical fixes, in the patch notes.\n\nAs you know, the team has been working very hard to release Arena Commander today and we’re especially excited to publish this patch before our Holiday break. We would have ideally liked another 4-5 days of internal stress testing and polish but with everyone looking forward to some well-earned time off I didn’t want to eat into people’s break. That said, being cognizant of the fact that the upcoming holidays are a time when everyone (myself included) looks forward to playing their favorite games we wanted to make sure that we released Arena Commander 1.0 for all our backers to enjoy over the holidays. With that in mind, I’ve opted to push today’s build of Arena Commander 1.0 to all of our backers today. So please, enjoy this significant update, give us your feedback, and we’ll come back in the New Year ready to continue polishing Arena Commander and developing the BDSSE!\n\nI would like to stress that today’s release of Arena Commander 1.0 is a beginning, not an ending. This milestone does not denote the completion of Arena Commander, it kicks off an even more significant phase of its development. With this update, we’ve added a significant number of ships, items, missiles, and systems which means more interconnected systems, more servers to stress and more bugs to squash. These future changes won’t be limited to fixing technical glitches and balance issues.\n\nSome elements, like the initial Avenger and Cutlass, will be converted to the new modular ship component system, but we wanted long-waiting owners to get an early look at their ships. So I encourage you to experience everything we’ve added to Arena Commander 1.0, but also to know that much, much more is in the works!\n\nAnd that is where you come in! With this update, there’s a lot more for the community to help us test. So get on the forums and share your feedback and let us know your thoughts, criticisms, and ideas on everything that we’ve added. Every experience you report today, positive or negative, will help us make a better game tomorrow and come January 2nd, we will go back to work making Arena Commander even better.\n\nThank you for your continued support, and I sincerely hope you enjoy Arena Commander 1.0. I think that it’s a great indication of where we’re going with the Star Citizen experience. I’d like to close by saying Happy Holidays to backers everywhere. I wish you all the joy in the world and look forward to continuing our journey in the coming year.\n\n— Chris Roberts\n\nNew Manual\n\nThe Cloud Imperium publications team has produced an updated version of the Arena Commander manual in honor of 1.0!

From the jack-of-all-trades Aurora ES to the fearsome Avenger, Star Citizen’s combat balance is going through a major revision. In addition to ships sold as concepts, we’ve put a number of newly-available ships (including the Mustang lineup) for sale in the pledge store.\n\nUpdate : If you wish to explore the entire Starter Ship line ups, but want to keep you alpha access, LTI or other precious package items, you can use the following Ship and Cross-Chassis Upgrades :\n\nNew Components\n\nIn addition to new ships, Arena Commander 1.0 adds an assortment of additional ship components to the game. Now backers will be able to further customize their ship’s loadout with a level of complexity unseen before. We are offering some of this additional equipment for UEC via the Voyager Direct store.\n\nNew guns\n\nNew missile racks\n\nMissile ammo!\n\nVisit your Voyager Direct dealer!\n\nPublic Test Universe\n\nArena Commander 1.0 isn’t the only big launch for the team today! As you may have noticed on your accounts, we are also kicking off something we’re calling the Public Test Universe. The Public Test Universe, or PTU, is a new server environment which will allow us to selectively push more experimental builds of Star Citizen to players who wish to assist with more hardcore testing of our game, balance and systems. With the PTU, we will be able to do more testing and get more feedback between patches, all while sharing more of Star Citizen’s development with backers! PTU releases will be launched in “phases,” with varying amounts of players given access as are needed for tests. If your account is eligible, you can start the process under account settings in the My RSI > Settings > Public Test Universe panel.\n\nHUD\n\nWe’re proud to introduce in Arena Commander 1.0 our initial implementation of the in-cockpit user-interface. We have designated the Aurora to be the “prototype” ship to host much of the HUD information and interaction you’ve been seeing in the visor on the cockpit’s display panels. This represents our first step towards diversifying the HUD / UI so that each ship can have a unique and immersive piloting experience. The technology that allows us to achieve this diegetic projection of interface elements is called Scaleform 3Di. 3Di allows us the ability to project any number of UI components anywhere we want within the game world with minimal effort in terms of setup. This technology, in conjunction with our robust UI framework provides us with a highly flexible system to create truly unique interfaces with their own visual languages and interaction rules. It also allows us to iterate very efficiently with regards to the positioning, scale, and rotation of these elements within the game-world.\n\nBut the Aurora isn’t the only ship to receive an upgrade to the UI. We have also made some updates to the Combat Visor Interface (CVI) to have a more immersive feel when you’re wearing your helmet. Now, when looking at your character in 3rd person, the HUD can be seen actually projected inside the helmet and conforming to the helmet’s geometry.\n\nTo help address some of the complaints about visibility of certain UI elements on brighter backgrounds, we have introduced an additive blending mode for the HUD which essentially “brightens” UI elements when displayed against bright backgrounds such as the planet on Broken Moon. This means that elements such as the reticle and hit predictors will be much more visible because they will always appear brighter than the backgrounds that they are projected against. This also has the benefit of making the HUD look much better visually and less “flat”, because its brightness and color is more reactive to the environment. Going forward, we will continue to improve on this blending to provide pilots with the best readability for a given environment while still retaining the nice visual look we want for the HUD.\n\nMissiles\n\nWe’ve had missiles in the game before, but for 1.0 we went back to the basics of what missile gameplay could mean and created a unique mechanic that creates a variety of other potential uses outside of simply blowing a target up, such as the ability to lock multiple missiles onto a target (or multiple targets, if your ship can handle it).\n\nAdding these sorts of changes into missiles meant touching a whole host of other systems. The radar needed revamping to read all the signatures properly, the HUD had to be revisited to communicate any number of missiles, the controller/keybound input had to be modified to accommodate missile management while also keeping the system available and useful in the heat of battle, and the targeting computer needed to be linked to each missile individually (rather than just the rack that fires them) to accommodate the wide range of missile types and behaviors that became available.\n\nThen we built the Rattler missile, the first example of many of our new missile behaviors to come, which carries its own salvo of Venom rockets to hunt down your enemies. It’s a very satisfying weapon to use, try not to get so distracted watching it that you forget to stay in the fight! There’s also the new rocket pods strapped to the Mustang Delta, presenting the first opportunity to use dumbfire ordnance. I look forward to seeing the videos of skillshots that come out of those things.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle was a new look at countermeasures. In most games, the use of countermeasures would be effectively the same as using an accuracy debuff – thing enters the field, thing has trouble hitting the target, simple as that. Here, we actually have the countermeasures affecting the signal system directly, which means that you aren’t playing against arbitrary data – you can just as easily escape an enemy radar as a missile as they are all part of a single data-driven system.\n\nSignature System\n\nOne major update to Arena Commander 1.0 is the launch of the Signature System, which we kick off with three measured signatures in today’s build. The Signature System is an important new combat mechanic, which introduces a huge variable to how Arena Commander’s ships face off.\n\nMost objects generate a detectable signature of some sort. These signals take on any number of forms: radio signals, electromagnetic signals, audio signals. Even visual reflectivity is a form of signal. It’s through these signals that we detect objects, and an ability to track them is key in all forms of weapons targeting. Whether it’s a heat-seeking missile homing in on the hottest jet exhaust or an image recognition warhead knocking something out of the sky based on its shape, signals are key to modern warfare.\n\nUnder this approach, it stands to reason that most objects in the Star Citizen environment must also generate detectable signals. Our challenge becomes: what signals do we simulate, how do we simulate them and, for the purposes of a variety of gameplay elements, how do we simulate their detection? (That is: how does a missile know that it sees you and how does that differ from how an NPC does the same?)\n\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio\n\nThe answer to this final question is that we create a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value for every objection. In science and engineering, signal-to-noise ratio is a value that compares the level of a given signal to the amount of background noise. More specifically, it is the ratio of a signal’s power to the background noise’s power. A ratio higher than 1:1 means that there is more signal than noise and that for our purposes an object is more readily detected. In simplest terms, SNR is a value that distinguishes an object from the background.\n\nHow do we calculate SNR for an individual situation, defined as targeting between two objects? The magic formula is SNR = 10 * log10( (S * (1-N/100) * (A^Z) * O) / R ). In this equation, S is the target’s signal emission, N is the overall level noise given as a percentage, A is your ship’s radar amplitude, Z is your ship’s radar amplitude power, R is your distance from the target and O is the occlusion influence percent (0 to 1.)\n\nNoise\n\nWhat, then, is noise in Star Citizen? It’s not an arbitrary value and most importantly it is not a constant! At present, every Star Citizen map contains a default level of noise intended to mimic background cosmic radiation. That’s the general noise present throughout the universe, the general static of the universe that is generated by countless of stars, black holes, quasars and the like. But in addition to a default level of cosmic radiation, Star Citizen is capable of altering the noise on a case by case basis. Imagine flying through an electromagnetic storm, or a gaseous nebula, or into a gravity well. The background noise will increase, often significantly. The SNR ratio will be impacted and the game will make it easier (or, occasionally, harder) for players to keep their ships undetected.\n\nThe noise value is determined by measuring the maximum amount of noise between two targets. If there’s a disturbance somewhere between you and your opponent, that increases the measured noise as the two attempt to target one another. This gives rise to one more opportunity for gameplay: the ability to deploy chaff, which generates a temporary artificial field of noise. Upend the ratio yourself to avoid detection or missile locks! (This is essentially the basis upon which actual chaff functions. Instead of telling the computer ‘if chaff is fired, decrease missile’s chance’ we’ve created an overall logical system that autonomously creates the same functionality.)\n\nSignal\n\nNow that we have noise, including ways to both increase and decrease it, what constitutes a signal? At present, combat in Star Citizen measures three distinct types of signals: infrared, electromagnetic and cross section. Each of these signals, which factor into the overall ’S’ value of your situation’s SNR number, has a distinct set of rules and characteristics intended to emulate how they would function in actual combat.\n\nInfrared – With a ship’s infrared signal, individual items have a heat pool which builds up based on certain actions. An item such as a weapon will generate heat in the pool briefly while firing, whereas an engine might output a steady stream of heat that constantly impacts your infrared signal. Items such as coolers will pull heat away from a given item’s pool, reducing the infrared signature. The cooler impacts the infrared signature based on the amount of heat a ship was cooled (think of it like water cooling your PC!) Thrusters generate heat based on the amount of thrust generated at any given point, dumping this into the heat pool. Thus, thrusters will take time to cool off after use and the resulting infrared signature will take time to dissipate (like a hot car engine on a cold day.) Occlusion lowers the overall detected infrared signature.\n\nElectromagnetic – Electromagnetic energy is generated by a number of items on a standard ship, especially the shield systems and power plants. Shields require power to stay active and additional power during any regeneration. This power requirement generates the electromagnetic signature, meaning that a ship holding with shields active will generate a significant holding signature but that this signature will increase should the shields be damaged and begin recharging. A ship’s power plant generates its electromagnetic signature based on the overall amount of power needed by the ship at a given time. Occlusion also lowers the detected electromagnetic signature.\n\nCross Section – The cross section signature is based on the actual volume of a given ship using offline calculations which determine the measurements based on each axis. It is our first ship signature to be in 3D. It is based on the view direction of a ship’s cross-section, so the value will change constantly based on the angle from which you can view a target. A Scythe viewed directly head-on will have a significantly lower cross section signature than one viewed from above or below. Unlike electromagnetic and infrared signatures, a ship’s cross section signature value cannot be detected through geometry (other objects that physically block a target.)\n\nWith the signature system, we hope to kick off a more complex sort of balance for Arena Commander. Hopefully you can see that, in addition to being the basis for how all objects lock on to one another, Star Citizen’s stealth mechanics will spring directly from the development of this system. Pilots who wish to fly stealthy ships will arrange their upgrades and enhancements in such a way as to reduce power consumption, signal output and even visual size if they wish to score a low SNR. Some ships, such as the Hornet Tracker, will include enhanced functionality to detect and alter signals.\n\nWe’re dedicated to making Arena Commander more than just shooting, and we’re excited to expand and balance signals going forward!",
  "latent_16693": "The morning after January Transfer Deadline Day. Fernando Torres is gone to Chelsea for £50m, Andy Carroll is gone to Liverpool for £35m and the whole world is gone mad and you'd like to think excitable Sky Sports News presenter Jim White is gone for a well-earned lie-down in a darkened room. And with no reason to shout things at rich young men driving to and from Premier League training grounds in expensive cars, his colleagues out in the field are at a loss to know what to do with themselves. All that remains for the Rumour Mill to do is to tie up the few remaining loose ends regarding the blizzard of cash that blew across the English football landscape yesterday, so where better to start than with Andy Carroll's mind-boggling £35m move from Newcastle United to Liverpool.\n\nAccording to the Toon Talk Newcastle fan website, Carroll claimed via a series of text messages that he was forced out of St James' Park by club suits, who are believed to have asked the striker to pretend he wanted to leave. A man named Steve, who runs the website and claims to be friends with Carroll, says the player texted him on Saturday afternoon to say \"I'm not going anywhere mate,\" only to change his tune shortly after 5pm yesterday afternoon, when he revealed that \"They have kind of said we don't want u but want me to say I wanna go. And I said I don't want to go.\"\n\nCarroll then went on to reveal that, contrary to what was reported in the news, he didn't hand in a transfer request yesterday. \"No I didn't that's what I mean that's what they wanted me to do and I said no,\" he said via another text to Toon Talk. He then went on to say that he was \"Gutted to be leaving Newcastle but I was kind of pushed out the door.\"\n\nIf the texts purporting to be from Carroll are genuine, the news that their prized asset was sold against his will and without being replaced is likely to infuriate already fed-up Newcastle fans, who have every reason to fear that their club's owner Mike Ashley will reinvest the £35m booty he got for the centre-forward on something other than reinforcements: chocolate cake, perhaps, or several sets of tastefully bespoke diamond-encrusted ermine curtains for his house. If the texts purporting to be from Carroll are not genuine, then today's Rumours are going to look even more foolish than usual. Expect proper journalists to get to the bottom of the matter later today.\n\nMeanwhile in Blackpool, Charlie Adam is believed to be \"distraught\" that his chairman turned down a £14m bid from Liverpool to secure his scrawl, while Tottenham Hotspur were beaten by the clock in their late efforts to sign the Scottish midfielder with a magic wand for a left peg. Yesterday will go down as a decidedly unsuccessful transfer deadline day for wheeling and dealing's Harry Redknapp, with the Tottenham Hotspur manager failing in his efforts to land a string of high profile superstars - Diego Forlán, Sergio Agüero, Giuseppe Rossi, Luís Fabiano, Fernando Llorente - and Phil Neville.\n\nIn more mundane news, today's Daily Express reports that lesser-spotted Frenchman Gabriel Obertan has \"stunned Manchester United\" by handing in a transfer request. The France under-21 international has failed to make much of an impact since signing for £3m from Bordeaux 18 months ago and is believed to be hankering after a return to his homeland during the summer, despite having over two years left to run on his contract.",

Apple recently filed a motion to obscure the Samsung logo on the court's video displays and ban any statements attributed to Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson, author of the recent biography about the late Apple leader.\n\nMeanwhile, the Korean mobile phone maker wants to exclude a pair of Apple experts and any \"Apple-related blogs and articles by non-expert newspaper reporters, regarding any assessment of Apple and Samsung and/or their products.\"\n\nThis long-running legal confrontation began in April 2011 when Apple filed a lawsuit in California accusing Samsung of copying \"the look and feel\" of its iPad tablet and iPhone smartphone. \"Rather than innovate and develop its own technology and a unique Samsung style for its smartphone products and computer tablets, Samsung chose to copy Apple's technology, user interface, and innovative style in these infringing products,\" Apple complained.\n\nSamsung quickly responded with a countersuit against Apple, taking the fight overseas to South Korea, Japan, and Germany.",

  "latent_17300": "The first time I passed as a woman in public was on leave in the US from my deployment to Iraq in February 2010.\n\nI’d long known I was a woman, but I’d been afraid, and a bit embarrassed, to appear publicly as myself before this. Not only was I worried that I could lose my already-tenuous connections with my family, but I was terrified that I could face administrative, or even criminal, charges from the military. It was the height of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” and we in the queer and trans community lived in fear on a regular basis.\n\nTell us about a time you faced your fear Read more\n\nThen I went to Iraq, where death was all around me. It made me realize just how precious and frail life really is. I decided I wanted to take the plunge, and do something that I wanted to do, for once. For myself.\n\nI remember nervously shopping for the clothes I wore that day. I had decided to go into a department store and buy a gorgeous casual business outfit. I walked into the store and snuck over to the women’s section. I was wandering around for 10 or 15 minutes looking at many outfits in many different sizes. I realized that I didn’t know where to start.\n\nIt was then that one of the sales associates walked over.\n\n“Can I help you?” she asked.\n\n“Yes, actually, you can,” I replied with a catch in my throat. “I am trying to buy a professional outfit for my girlfriend for a job interview. She’s never really worn business outfits before, so she wasn’t able to give me any guidance.”\n\n“Oh absolutely,” the saleslady said brightly. “I can help you with that. What are her sizes?”\n\nI paused. “I don’t remember,” I said, thinking fast. “But she’s about my size, except she has a B cup.”\n\nIt was her turn to pause. “This might seem a little odd,” she said, “but can I just measure you real fast?” So she did, while I explained deceptively that my girlfriend was two inches taller than me.\n\n“That doesn’t change the size at all,” she said, pulling out some options. I joined her – once I knew what sizes to look for, I could start picking out things I liked right away. I felt more comfortable mixing and matching things together rather than being too coordinated, and she and I were able to put together a nice outfit quickly. I bought a casual gray business suit jacket and skirt with a white blouse and black tights.\n\nI walked out of the store, moving with purpose. I ran to my car. Where to now?\n\nThe next stop was a high-end cosmetics store and then a discount outlet to buy a nice coat, since it was cold. This time, I wasn’t as clueless. I knew cosmetics pretty well already, as I had purchased and worn makeup many times before. I had figured out my coat size with the nice sales lady in the department store. I found a faded purple coat and bought it.\n\nI ran to my car and went home to get changed. I already owned a natural looking wig, bought during a previous, private cross-dressing episode. It was golden blond and flowed over my shoulders. I put on the wig over my military regulation buzz cut.\n\nIt all worked together pretty well. It felt very natural, and I was able to blend in to the crowd as myself.\n\nI actually spent a solid day, in public, dressed a woman, wearing my new clothes and makeup. I just kind of wandered about, going to coffee shops and bookstores, trying to blend in as a bored woman looking for something interesting to do even though I was actually exhilarated.\n\nBeing myself for a whole day taught me a few lessons: trying to meet the expectations that I believed were placed on me by society was unsustainable. I was miscast in the play of life, and it was urgent that I admit that, sooner rather than later. Joy, confidence and security can’t begin until we are able to just be ourselves.\n\nComments on this article will be premoderated",
  "latent_17332": "After a request for the original data was denied, PLOS ONE editors have flagged a 2012 sub analysis of a controversial clinical trial on chronic fatigue syndrome with an editor’s note.\n\nThe editor’s note — which reads like an Expression of Concern — reiterates the journal’s policy that authors make data and materials available upon request, and notes that staff are following up on “concerns” raised about the study.\n\nThere have been numerous requests for data from the “PACE” trial, as the clinical trial is known, which the authors say they have refused in order to protect patient confidentiality. On November 13, James Coyne, a psychologist at the University Medical Center, Groningen, submitted a request for the data from the PLOS ONE paper to King’s College London, where some of the authors were based. According to Coyne’s WordPress blog (he also has a blog hosted by PLOS), the journal asked him to let them know if he “had any difficulties obtaining the data.” He did — KCL denied the request last Friday (the whole letter is worth reading):\n\nThe university considers that there is a lack of value or serious purpose to your request. The university also considers that there is improper motive behind the request. The university considers that this request has caused and could further cause harassment and distress to staff.\n\nLast author Peter White at Queen Mary University of London, UK, told us the journal had not asked them to release the data, but he would work with PLOS to address any questions:\n\nWe understand PLOS One are following up concerns expressed about the article, according to their internal processes. We will be happy to work with them to address any queries they might have regarding the research.\n\nHere’s the editor’s note for “Adaptive Pacing, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Graded Exercise, and Specialist Medical Care for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,” in full:\n\nSeveral readers have raised concerns regarding the analyses reported in this article. We are also aware that there have been requests for the data from this study. The article was published in 2012; the PLOS data policy that applies to the article is that for submissions prior to March 3, 2014, which is outlined here: http://journals.plos.org/…. The policy expects authors ‘to make freely available any materials and information described in their publication that may be reasonably requested by others for the purpose of academic, non-commercial research’. The policy also notes that access to the data should not compromise confidentiality in the context of human-subject research. PLOS ONE takes seriously concerns raised about publications in the journal as well as concerns about compliance with the journal’s editorial policies. PLOS staff are following up on the different concerns raised about this article as per our internal processes. As part of our follow up we are seeking further expert advice on the analyses reported in the article, and we will evaluate how the request for the data from this study relates to the policy that applies to the publication. These evaluations will inform our next steps as we look to address the concerns that have been noted. Competing interests declared: PLOS ONE Staff\n\nWe weren’t sure what the last line was referring to, so contacted Executive Editor Veronique Kiermer. She told us that staff sometimes include their byline under “competing interests,” so the authorship is immediately clear to readers who may be scanning a series of comments.\n\nThe trial followed 641 patients, and concluded that two forms of therapy that focus on mental aspects of the disorder were safe, and might be more effective than the therapy commonly favored by patients.\n\nPatients and advocates have disputed these claims — arguing, among other things, that the findings may prompt some to believe chronic fatigue is a mental, not a physical, disorder. (No one knows what causes CFS, which can leave patients bedridden; some scientists think that there might be multiple causes.) Further, advocates argue, a program focused on cognitive behavioral therapy or graded exercise therapy — the two treatments supported by the PACE trial — could actually be harmful to patients by encouraging too much exercise. There have been calls from patients and academics alike for a re-analysis of the data.\n\nThe PLOS ONE paper compared the cost-effectiveness of various forms of therapy for CFS, and concluded that cognitive behavior therapy could be the most cost-effective approach to treatment. It has been cited 10 times, according to Thomson Scientific’s Web of Knowledge.\n\nIn September, we spoke to White about the choice to not release the data behind their findings (we were considering publishing an account of the trial by David Tuller; ultimately we could not agree on an approach). During that previous interview, White told us:\n\nWe have yet to release any raw data. It’s part of our patient’s consent form. We promised that we would keep it confidential. We think it’s really important for our trial — A, for if we do a long-term follow up, which I hope we will. B — When you make a promise to participants, and say ‘I’m going to protect your data, I’m not going to release it to any member of the public,’ we keep that promise. We made a promise and we have to keep it.”\n\nIn his request to KCL, Coyne explained his plans for the data:\n\nI am interested in reproducing your empirical results, as well as conducting some additional exploratory sensitivity analyses. Accordingly, and consistent with PLOS journals’ data sharing policies, I ask you to kindly provide me with a copy of the dataset in order to allow me to verify the substantive claims of your article through reanalysis.\n\nTo Coyne, the stakes are higher than this one trial. In PLOS Blogs post titled “Why the scientific community needs the PACE trial data to be released,” Coyne explains that his reasons for requesting the data go beyond his skepticism of the PACE trial’s conclusions:\n\nThe crisis in the trustworthiness of science can be only overcome only if scientific data are routinely available for reanalysis. Independent replication of socially significant findings is often unfeasible, and unnecessary if original data are fully available for inspection.\n\nKCL’s response to Coyne’s request notes the controversy surrounding the trial, including allegations that the scientists have received death threats from activists:\n\nThere have been significant efforts to publicly discredit the trial following the release of the first article in the Lancet journal in 2011. Among other public campaigns, there is a Wikipedia page dedicated to criticisms of this project. The campaign has included deeply personal criticism to the researchers involved as well as significant comment around the decisions not to disclose data and information about the project.\n\nWe asked Kiermer what the journal will do if the authors refuse to release the data:\n\nWe are looking into the matter and we cannot speculate at this point.\n\nLike Retraction Watch?

This paper investigates the effects of academic directors on corporate governance and firm performance. We find that companies with directors from academia are associated with higher performance and this relation is driven by professors without administrative jobs. We also find that academic directors play an important governance role through their advising and monitoring functions. Specifically, our results show that the presence of academic directors is associated with higher acquisition performance, higher number of patents and citations, higher stock price informativeness, lower discretionary accruals, lower CEO compensation, and higher CEO forced turnover-performance sensitivity. Overall, our results provide supportive evidence that academic directors are valuable advisors and effective monitors and that, in general, firms benefit from having academic directors.",
  "latent_17359": "Budget Magic: $72 (26 tix) Modern Rally Vampires\n\nby SaffronOlive // Sep 23, 2015 Tweet\n\nbudget magic video\n\nBonjou Budget Magic lovers, it's that time once again. With the impending Standard rotation, I've been having a difficult time motivating myself to brew for the format so this week we are heading back to Modern to showcase Rally Vampires. This deck that has been super successful this week for me even against some of the most popular and powerful decks in the format. Rally Vampires occupies an interested place in the metagame: it is a tribal, creature-based combo deck that can occasionally win by beating down with (somewhat) efficient creatures. I could go on and on, but first let's get to the videos and then we'll talk a bit more about the deck. Oh, right. A quite reminder — if you enjoy the Budget Magic series and the other video content here on MTGGoldfish, make sure to subscribe to the MTGGoldfish Youtube Channel to keep up on all the latest and greatest.\n\nRally Vampires Intro\n\nRally Vampires vs Twin\n\nRally Vampires vs Merfolk\n\nRally Vampires vs Boggles\n\nRally Vampires vs Living End\n\nLet me say first that I love this deck. When I make a Budget Magic, one of two things happens: Either I record the matches, write the article and move on to the next deck, or I stumble across something I really enjoy playing (which for me involves not just having fun, but also winning matches) and keep playing the deck in my free time (i.e. even when I'm not recording content). Rally Vampires falls into the latter group. After starting off strong on camera, I've continued to play (and tweak) the deck and am currently 10-5 over the course of 15 matches (66.67 mwp), almost exclusively against tier one and tier two decks.\n\nOne of the things I love about Rally Vampires is it has game in a wide range of matchups. Incidental life gain from Blood Artist and Kalastria Highborn give us a shot against aggro decks (although these matchups are still hit-or-miss game one, but much better once we board in more removal). Rally the Ancestors gives us a way to pressure control decks (and decks like Twin) at instant speed, allowing us to combo off in response to an end-of-turn Snapcaster Mage or Desolate Lighthouse activation. Plus we are naturally resilient to removal. Not only do we have nine sacrifice outlets to fizzle exile effects like Path to Exile, but a lot of the time we actually want our creatures to die so that we can Rally the Ancestors and Return to the Ranks them back for value.\n\n$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00\n\nBlood Artist and Kalastria Highborn are the centerpiece of the deck and they are almost always the way we win the game (out of 20 game wins, I've won by beating down two or three times). Blood Artist is a known quantity at this point being one of the primiere cards in Standard Aristocrats a couple years ago and now seeing fringe play in other Return to the Ranks decks in Modern. Its power in conjunction with sacrifice effects is undeniable.\n\nKalastria Highborn, on the other hand, is part of what make this deck unique, basically acting as Blood Artist five through eight in a deck full of Vampires. While it costs more to get going since you have to pay B for every activation, draining two instead of one is a big deal. One of the typical lines with Kalastria Highborn is to Rally the Ancestors back a bunch of Vampires at the end of our opponent's turn and, with the \"exile\" trigger on the stack, sac our board to drain for 10 (or more).\n\n$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00\n\nThe realization that all of the best creature-based sacrifice outlets in Modern were also Vampires is what brought the entire deck together. With one these cards on the battlefield we can trigger Blood Artist and Kalastria Highborn at will, protect our creatures from exile-based removal (mostly Path to Exile), shut down cards with lifelink (like Wurmcoil Engine by blocking and sacrificing before damage), and occasionally win by beating down with a huge threat.\n\nVampire Aristocrat is pretty bad, mostly because he costs three which means we can't get him back with Return to the Ranks. However, I really wanted a ninth sacrifice outlet in the deck because having one at all times is super important. Since we're not allowed to play nine Viscera Seers or five Bloodthrone Vampires, Vampire Aristocrat makes the cut by virtue of being the next best option.\n\nBloodthrone Vampire is solid although almost always worse than Viscera Seer. Initially I thought we might win a reasonable amount of the time by beating down with (and pumping up) Bloodthrone Vampire, but the more I play the deck, the less concerned I am with winning by combat damage — it just doesn't happen all that often. Instead, Bloodthrone Vampire is usually just another free sacrifice outlet that is sometimes very good at blocking creatures like Tarmogoyf.\n\nViscera Seer is — by far — our best sacrifice outlet. As we'll talk about momentarily, Rally Vampires gets to play eight mass-reanimation effects between Rally the Ancestors and Return to the Ranks. The goal of the deck is to get a handful of creatures on the battlefield/graveyard and cast our reanimation effects as often as possible. Viscera Seer is great because it not only lets us sacrifice our board to trigger Blood Artist and Kalastria Highborn, but it also digs for our next reanimation spell. Once we are sacrificing five or six creatures every turn, we've got nearly a 50/50 shot that we'll be able to scry into another Rally the Ancestors or Return to the Ranks, allowing us to repeat the process again the next turn, and the turn after that, and the turn after that until our opponent is dead.\n\n$ 0.00 $ 0.00\n\nPawn of Ulamog is the card I'm most proud of \"finding\" for this deck since it allows us to do two crazy things. First, when combined with a sacrifice outlet it allows us to double up on our Blood Artist triggers. Every time we sac a creature, we get an Eldrazi Spawn token which we can immediately sac for another \"drain one\" from Blood Artist. The other application of Pawn of Ulamog might not be as obvious. Remember that the idea of this deck is to play some Vampires, sacrifice our board and reanimate everything with Rally the Ancestors and Return to the Ranks. When we have a Pawn of Ulamog in play, every creature we sacrifice adds one mana towards our next mass-reanimation spell. This sometimes allows us to Rally or Return all of our creatures multiple times in the same turn.\n\n$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00\n\nRally the Ancestors is typically better than Return to the Ranks because the \"exile\" clause on Rally isn't actually a downside in our deck since we almost always have a sacrifice outlet to get everything back in our graveyard and because Rally the Ancestors can reanimate our three drops (which Return to the Ranks cannot). The real power of these cards is that we get to play them both, giving us a critical mass of reanimation which allows us to loop our entire board nearly every turn in the mid and late game. Once we get things set up with a sacrifice outlet and some combination of Kalastria Highborn and Blood Artist, the power of these cards ranges from \"pay 3WW, Fog and Drain life for 10\" to \"you win the game.\" As a result, it usually doesn't take that many loops to finish off our opponent.\n\n$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00\n\nThe remaining creatures in the deck are more or less there for value. Gatekeeper of Malakir is a great card in a deck that can reliably pay BBB on turn three (which Rally Vampires can), plus its cmc of two means we can get it back with both Rally the Ancestors and Return to the Ranks to generate more drain triggers. Geralf's Messenger isn't a Vampire, but his synergy with sacrifice outlets and Rally the Ancestors is so strong that it is worth a slot regardless. With any sac outlet, Geralf's Messenger represent at least four damage, and it gets even crazier when we have a Blood Artist on board or Rally it back.\n\nThe idea of Mogis's Marauder was to pull the Standard Rally combo with Bloodthrone Vampire or Vampire Aristocrat taking the place of Nantuko Husk. That said, since we typically win by comboing off rather than beating down, I'm not sure it is really necessary. I'm thinking of adding another removal spell in this slot.\n\nLess-Budget Vampire Rally\n\nI mentioned that I've been working on the deck in my own time since recording the videos, and while the foundation of the deck has remained more or less the same, I have made a couple changes designed to streamline our manabase and shore up the sideboard. Here's where I'm at currently for the non-budget build.\n\nConclusion\n\nAnyway, that's all for today. What can we do to improve the deck? What other cards should we test? Am I missing any awesome Vampires or other synergies? Let me know in the comments, and you can reach me on Twitter (or MTGO) @SaffronOlive.",

The encouragement I get online is invaluable. Twitter has also brought me the lovely friendship of fellow dysgwr Cymraeg, Susan Floyd, and with it an inspiring story of how the language can be learned a long way from Wales.\n\nSusan describes herself as a “sixth generation Texan” and is an archivist with the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. Outside the day job of dealing with historical manuscripts and state records she has nurtured a love of Wales, its language and its culture through family ancestry... and football.\n\n“Well obviously my name is Welsh: Floyd,” she explains. “I’ve known that since I was about eight, coming as I do from a family of history buffs. So I always had some recognition and identification there. I lived in England for about five years in my 20s and have visited Wales on numerous occasions before, including climbing and hiking in Eryri, visiting the Brecon Beacons where my ancestors were supposedly from, and spending New Year’s Eve 2000 in Cardiff. Learning Welsh was always on my bucket list, always in the back of my mind – maybe a project for retirement or my twilight years or something.”\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nBut then came a moment that made Susan decide there had never been a better time to kick off: “Wales qualified for the Euros. I’d been telling my football-watching friends here in Austin for a couple of years that they would, and that they would be good – and fun to watch. So I was just as utterly delighted as every other Wales supporter when they reached the semi-finals,” she recalls.\n\n(Image: Collect unknown)\n\n“I watched every game at a local Irish pub here in Austin where I normally watch Liverpool with a group of local fans. I’d been watching England in international tournaments for 20 years, but had never before had the opportunity to even watch a single Wales game on television. And what an introduction! I met other fans, both American and Welsh, who were there to watch the game. It was all a dream. I even stayed in touch with a woman I met at the pub who was here in Texas on holiday (an Everton fan, no less!) and we met up when I was in Bangor in November. I keep saying, ‘Joe Allen: bringing people together!’ She says, ‘No, it’s all Ashley Williams’.”\n\nSusan adds: “My mother, who has always been a fan of American football, tennis, and basketball, became a soccer fan because of the Euros. One day, she told me, ‘I love watching this team! I’m so jealous. I wish I was Welsh!’ So I did a little more digging in her side of the family tree and found Welsh ancestors we hadn’t even known about. She was pretty excited.\n\n“So, long story short, Chris Coleman’s team inspired me to start learning Welsh at the youthful age of 36!”\n\n(Image: Collect unknown)\n\nIt’s great to hear a team that not only performed brilliantly in the Euros but used Welsh so effectively and organically across various media platforms throughout its campaign has left such a positive linguistic legacy. But how on earth do you go about learning Welsh in Texas?\n\nAs Susan explains, in cyberspace it doesn’t matter how many thousand miles you are away from Wales: “I began with Gareth King’s Colloquial Welsh and a daily diet of BBC Radio Cymru. Then I decided to get serious in September and signed up for John Good’s Beginning Welsh I class through Americymraeg .\n\n“We meet once a week online, using Google Hangouts, and John leads us through listening and speaking exercises based on that week’s lessons in our textbook, Heini Gruffudd’s Welcome to Welsh. This is invaluable, not just having the regular opportunity to speak the language, but also to learn slang, idioms, North Walian/South Walian variances, folk tales, songs, and get our questions answered by a great and enthusiastic teacher. I look forward to Monday nights.”\n\nLast autumn, Susan supplemented her online learning with a personal pilgrimage to Wales. “I was making great progress until the US election, which threw me off track. I flew to Britain in November and spent one week in England with old friends before spending the next week driving the perimeter of the Welsh coast alone – from Liverpool to Swansea.\n\n“It was wonderful getting to meet native speakers and hear the language in regular use. But I am ashamed to say that I was too out of practice – and intimidated – to try to speak much beyond uttering a very basic ‘Diolch!’ in shops. I also got to meet with several wonderful Welsh speakers whom I’d ‘met’ on Twitter during the Euros, which made my trip infinitely more interesting and meaningful. So, though I was travelling alone, I received a very warm welcome and more than enough motivation to continue learning the language.”\n\nSusan now aims to improve her Welsh by attending a more immersive course. “I’m hoping to attend an Wlpan (course) for a week or, ideally, two, sometime in 2017, so that I can move my Welsh study from basic/academic to conversational/practical. I am also going to try to start a Welsh conversational meet-up group here in Central Texas soon. Unfortunately, though our local university is one of the largest in the world, it doesn’t offer any Celtic languages. But I am fairly confident I’m not the only dysgwr Cymraeg around here!”\n\nAnd, of course, there is the added support network of the online Welsh learning – and sporting – community. As Susan says: “Social media is definitely a major factor in the spread of interest in Wales and Welsh. The football team doesn’t hurt, either.”\n\nSo “America first!” may be the mantra of the newly-inaugurated President but as Susan’s inspiring example proves, there are still plenty of US citizens reaching out to embrace a language and culture thousands of miles beyond any walls that Trump may want to build.\n\nCarolyn Hitt has embarked on a 30-week course to learn Welsh and is sharing her progress. This month she discovers how learning the language can be a truly global experience.\n\nFor information on opportunities to learn Welsh across Wales click on www.learnwelsh.cymru and follow Y Ganolfan Dysgu Cymraeg Genedlaethol/National Centre for Learning Welsh on Twitter @learncymraeg",

His biodegradable battery powers ingestible medical devices, then dissolves after the device has served its purpose. That means even very sick people can swallow it without risk to their health.\n\n\"This is very important technology, as implantable biocompatible devices play an increasingly important role in the future of medicine, as well as in environmental sensing with devices that themselves do not pollute the environment they are sensing,\" Crouse explained in a statement. \"But current technology in this area is unreliable and poor performing.\"\n\n\"What was also remarkable about Vineet's work was his comprehensive approach to single-minded tackling of the problem of biodegradable batteries: Not only did he come up with the idea, he chose the materials, conducted the research, and then engineered a practical and cost-effective device,\" Crouse said. \"Through this project, he exhibited the entire spectrum of skills, from innovation, through science, to engineering - and this impressed the judges greatly.\"\n\nEdupuganti said his choice of alloy, and his ability to fast-track the testing of various versions of his device, allowed him to make such big strides.\n\n\"Biodegradable electronics is definitely an emerging area, and there is some incredibly fascinating research currently going on at various institutions,\" he said. \"I chose to explore the use of a magnesium alloy, AZ31, in biodegradable batteries, which increased performance significantly. I also developed a computer model for the device, which allows one to gauge device behavior without the need for extensive experimental testing.\n\nThe high schooler said Solanki, the Portland state microelectronics expert, provided invaluable facilities, equipment and guidance. \"Without his support, my project would not have been possible,\" he said.\n\nThe Spanish-speaking piano-playing high school senior would like to find real-world applications for research that he can eventually take to market. He is fascinated by the newly-emerging field of biodegradable electronics because he sees its potential to affect change in a wide array of industries,\n\nEdupuganti won a third place grand award at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in 2015 and 2016. He plays classical piano, guitar and tennis. He is also a huge Blazers fan and plans to use his scholarship to study materials science or electrical engineering. But he is still in the midst of his college search and has no idea which college he may end up attending, he said.\n\nHe said the strength of Oregon Episcopal School's science research program, in which he has participated since sixth grade, helped propel him to success, as has the encouragement of all his teachers and his parents. The research program, in particular, \"gave me the necessary tools to explore and conduct research in depth, while also teaching me how to better convey my work in a variety of ways,\" he said.\n\nThis post has been updated to include content from our interview with Edupuganti, conducted just before he caught a flight home from Washington, D.C., where he received his prize.\n\n-- Betsy Hammond",

  "latent_17407": "- Washburn came into Bearcat Arena Saturday afternoon and forced Northwest Missouri State's men's basketball team to put on its hard hat and grind out its fourth straight MIAA title.It was fitting for Northwest to win in a blue-collar fashion. The Bearcats' 74-68 victory was the epitome of their team-first mentality over this six-year run of 20 or more win. Northwest now stands at 23-0 overall and 15-0 in the MIAA.\"We are going to see these types of games in Kansas City and wherever else we go,\" said Northwest senior. \"It was fun. Obviously, winning by 20 is great, too. But it is great for the postseason to win like this.\"With four conference games remaining, Northwest, ranked No. 1 in the NABC coaches top 25, holds a four-game lead over second-place Central Missouri. Northwest can win the outright title on Thursday with a win at Pittsburg State or a loss by Central Missouri.Given that Northwest has won a conference-record 27 straight MIAA regular season games, it is nearly 100 percent certain that will remain by itself atop the MIAA when the regular season ends.\"It is pretty special to go four straight,\" Schneider said.In front of 1,675 fans at Bearcat Arena, Northwest showed once again it knows how to win when shots aren't falling through at over a 50-percent clip like the previous three games.\"I was happy with the way we responded in the second half,\" Northwest coachsaid. \"I didn't think we played well the whole game, but we were tough enough to get the win. It was a good, fun atmosphere. I appreciate everybody's support. Our kids just competed as hard as they could.\"After the game, a happy celebration erupted. New MIAA commissioner Mike Racy handed the regular-season trophy to the Bearcats. \"We are the Champions\" from Queen blared through the loudspeakers as the players cut down the nets.For Schneider, it was the fourth time he has been able to enjoy a conference title. Seniorhas experienced three and seniorhas two.\"This means a lot and it feels so good,\" Woods said. \"Four in a row is crazy, just a blessing.\"By the way the first half went, it was obvious every possession in the second half was important. In the first 7 minutes of the second half, there were 10 lead changes. The 10one gave Northwest a 46-45 lead when Schneider hit a three-pointer. Northwest never trailed again.The Bearcats solidified the lead on a basket JustiPitts, making it 48-45. Washburn stayed between one and three points behind until Northwest grabbed its first five-point lead of the game on at 57-52 on two free throws by Pitts with 8:48 left. Pitts finished with a game-high 22 points.Northwest maintained a three to five-point lead over the next several minutes until the Bearcats managed to increase it to seven at 65-58 on two free throws by juniorwith 4:41 left.Each little increase in the lead came from tenacious defense and a gritty, offensive-mind-set. Exemplifying that attitude was seniorwho backed his way in the paint and then powered up a basket that gave Northwest a 67-60 lead with 3:08 left.\"I was just trying to do my job and the opportunity presented itself,\" said Mosby, who finished with 13 points and seven rebounds.A little less than a minute later, senior Chris-Edou Ndow hit a soft, 10-foot jumper in the free throw lane that pushed Northwest's lead to 69-60 with 2:15 left.\"We just did us and gave a little more effort and did it better in the second half,\" Mosby said. \"The first half we didn't execute our game plan. The second half we tightened up and got the result.\"And the result was Northwest's fourth straight conference title.\"That was a postseason atmosphere,\" Mosby said. \"It was awesome.\"Throughout the first half, Northwest struggled on offense. In fact, it was one of the worst shooting halves of the new year. But the Bearcats' sting defense allowed them to go into halftime tied 31-31.Neither team went on much of a run in a half that saw nine lead changes. The biggest lead for Washburn was 5-2. Northwest held a 28-24 advantage late in the first half.It was simply a hard-fought, defensive battle that the Bearcats needed. Northwest will have plenty of these types of games in postseason.But first, Northwest must concentrate on the remaining four regular-season games, starting at Pittsburg State on Thursday.\"We have to take it one game at a time, stay focused and take every practice serious,\" Woods said.",
  "latent_17485": "August 26, 2015\n\nby Canadian Manufacturing.com Staff\n\nTORONTO—Canadians can expect to see average base salary increases of 2.4 per cent in 2016, according to a national survey of more than 525 Canadian public and private sector employers.\n\nThe survey was conducted by Hay Group in June and July. Participants include many of Canada’s leading employers.\n\nThe projection is lower than the 2.6 per cent projection for 2015, continuing a downward trend in Canadian salary increases that has developed since the start of the economic downturn in 2008. Canadians have now fallen further behind their U.S. counterparts.\n\nAccording to the survey, 70 per cent of Canadian employers are forecasting that they will provide their employees with base salary increases in 2016, which is significantly less than the 83 per cent of employers who projected increases for 2015. This is due to continued economic uncertainty across many sectors in the Canadian economy and to the fact that more employers are now adopting a “wait-and-see” position before increasing their budgets.\n\nResource provinces behind the rest of Canada\n\nDue to the high demand for skilled labour, workers in the oil and gas sector have traditionally received the highest salary increases in Canada, however, with the economic impact of collapsing oil prices over the last year, these workers are now projected to receive the lowest increases in the country at 1.5 per cent as employers shed jobs and the labour supply now exceeds demand.\n\nCredit unions (three per cent), Leisure/hospitality (three per cent) and insurance (2.9 per cent) will lead all sectors with forecasts higher than the national average of 2.4 per cent.\n\nSaskatchewan (2.7 per cent) and Alberta (2.5 per cent) still lead the country with projected overall base salary increases higher than the national average (2.4 per cent). However they are significantly lower than in recent years, due mainly to the global softening in commodity prices, particularly in the Alberta oil and gas sector. Unless there is an unforeseen jump in demand from the major oil and gas importing economies e.g. China, the EU or a choking off of supply by OPEC, principally through Saudi Arabia, then this year’s results will turn from a blip into the new norm for Alberta.\n\nLooking at the 2016 projections for major Canadian cities, workers in Edmonton are projected to receive increases of 2.9 per cent, followed by Regina at (2.6 per cent) and the GTA, Saskatoon, Winnipeg and Ottawa at 2.5 per cent.\n\nOther findings",
  "latent_17486": "Gawker has long been known to do whatever they wanted to bring in clicks. Most people call it “clickbait” but you could call it “anti-journalism” since it’s less about informing people and more about causing outrage. It’s turned into what’s now being labeled as the era of “outrage media”, where a site uses said clickbait to drum up outrage in their audience. Gawker did this when they lied about #GamerGate, and they’ve managed to do it again when they outed the CFO of Conde Naste in an article that garnered so much hatred across the web that they actually buried their ego just enough to finally relent and take down the article.\n\nThe article has been removed and Gawker founder Nick Denton offered up an apology, but the original piece was about Conde Nast’s CFO, titled “Condé Nast’s CFO Tried To Pay $2,500 for a Night With a Gay Porn Star”. It was published on July 16th, 2015.\n\nIt was about an escort attempting to blackmail the CFO who had connections with a politician. The piece was scraping a barrel with a bottom that was too ashamed to be scraped. The result was that some of Gawker’s own staff felt the site had gone too far.\n\nGawker’s Timothy Burke from the editorial staff made it clear where he stood; in the post where the company apologized for running the tawdry piece, stating…\n\n“A large percentage of the Gawker Media editorial staff disagreed with Gawker’s decision to publish the post to which this statement refers. Our opposition to the removal of the post lies solely in the process by which that decision was made, not in regard to the content of the post itself.”\n\nKotaku’s editor-in-chief Stephen Totilo defended Gawker, with Kotaku in Action – the Reddit front for #GamerGate – capturing his comments and archiving them, where he states…\n\n“This isn’t about the content of a post, which plenty of writers on my team had strong concerns about today. It’s about our company’s approach to editorial freedom and transparency.”\n\nA Jezebel writer – another subsidiary under the Gawker media wing – also defended Gawker, trying to say that it was good to knock people down a peg.\n\nHowever, even senior Gawker writer Adam Weinstein, over on Tumblr, had to concede that Gawker had stepped a step too far from counter-culture blogging to outright “bad journalism”. Weinstein waxed whining against #GamerGate while also condemning Gawker like some kind of self-flagellating, self-righteous blogger without a compass to find his own self-awareness…\n\n“[…] none of this vindicates any of the psychotic, hateful, performatively sanctimonious self-marketing of Christina Hoff Sommers, Milo Yianawhatever, “gamergaters,” and the bevy of cold, craven, retrograde pre-fab apartment-dwelling souls who are waging an inane jihad against Gawker Media, feminism, and cultural justice. They are wrong. They are twisted. They are abusive. And I could give three hot farts about their crocodile tears for David Geithner and his family. What pisses me off the most about this lapse in editorial judgment is that it’s (again) enabled this barely coherent rabble of internet bullies to signal boost their dumb assertions about Gawker en masse, and to get them taken seriously for a dumb nanosecond.”\n\nWeinstein, however, had to bring up #GamerGate because for the past 11 months Gawker and #GamerGate have been fighting across social media, leaving nothing in its wake but dust, tears and scorched comment sections with more butt-hurt than a waiting room full of first-time proctology patients.\n\nFormer antagonist of #GamerGate, Ian Miles Cheong – the managing editor of the gaming website GameRanx – chimed in to admit that maybe the internet cultural revolt against censorship, bad journalism and unethical behavior in the press isn’t such a bad thing.\n\nRemember when that group of people everyone likes to pretend doesn't exist suggested we e-mail Gawker's advertisers? Yeah, do that. — Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) July 17, 2015\n\n@sdw On the flip side, if I start disliking Gawker, that basically aligns me with Gamer Gate!?! Ahhhhhhhh nooooooo — Cabel Sasser (@cabel) July 17, 2015\n\nEven people staunchly opposed to #GamerGate’s fight for ethics had to admit to some modicum of conciliation with the consumers mounting a revolt against sites like Gawker, with writer and blogger Jeff Fecke, amongst others, writing on Twitter…\n\nI hate when bleeping GooberGotterdammerung is right. It hasn't happened before now, but still. https://t.co/C3UuuAPUj2 — Jeff Fecke (@jkfecke) July 17, 2015\n\nThe comments on every Gawker article is amazing – All the redditors and Gamer gaters rushing to take shots at Gawker. — C. Knapp (@hockeynightdoc) July 17, 2015\n\nGawker actually did something so wrong that they made gamer gate do the right thing I'm scared — Deport Donald Trump (@rowast) July 17, 2015\n\nPart of this about-face from the online community in supporting, or at least tangentially acknowledging #GamerGate’s finger-pointing of Gawker’s bad behavior, comes from numerous instances where Gawker has partaken in what many have considered to be unethical defamation and purposed character assassination.\n\nWhat’s worse is that they even had an article on Jezebel in January of 2014 condemning media for outing trans and gay individuals.\n\nThis also comes short on the heels of Hulk Hogan going full Hulkamania on Gawker in a lawsuit about the sex tape they published of him a while back.\n\nTheir continued efforts to libel, defame and put down private citizens and public celebrities alike even caused the gentle giant and YouTube star Boogie2988 to lash out against them.\n\nBeen reading up on gawker media and the things they have done for clicks and all I can say is FUCK gawker and anyone associated with it. — Boogie2988 (@Boogie2988) July 17, 2015\n\nThe e-mail campaigns to their advertisers have been numerous and expedient. Consumers, readers and gamers alike have decided to fight back against the media giant where it hurts the most: their ad revenue.\n\nOver on Kotaku in Action someone purportedly received a response from Netflix where the company stated…\n\n“I will take your complaint and make sure it gets to the right people here today, we are always here to listen and we do take your opinions seriously.”\n\nEven the Society of Professional Journalists stepped in to condemn Gawker in a piece titled “We Expect Better, Gawker“.\n\nWebsite Adland.tv wrote a piece exclaiming that Gawker went from “toxic” to “radioactive”, with author David Fenton writing…\n\n“Simply put, Gawker has always been dangerous. That’s not an opinion. This isn’t an editorial. That’s a fact. However this steps over the line in so many ways. There’s no excuse to blackmail someone and hide it behind the flimsy excuse of journalism. There is no excuse.”\n\nBut this has been a common occurrence with Gawker for quite some time, as pointed out by a former writer for Gawker, Richard Lawson, who admitted to smearing in the name of clicks…\n\nKeep in mind that the reason people have such a low opinion of #GamerGate is because media websites like Gawker purposefully crafted a narrative to depict it to the public as a hate campaign, this happened after #GamerGate targeted Nathan Grayson and Stephen Totilo on charges of journalistic impropriety and unethical behavior in covering up a conflict of interest between a developer and an editor.\n\nThe general public finally gets to see the monster #GamerGate has been fighting for the past 11 months. The “doxxing” and “rape threats” and “death threats”? Those happened from random egg accounts that were made and deleted that day but it had nothing to do with #GamerGate – those individuals didn’t even use the hashtag. This information was corroborated by a peer reviewed WAM! report that statistically absolved majority of the people on the GG Autoblocker list from being harassers.\n\nThe reality is that the whole harassment narrative was concocted in part by the Game Journo Pros, a group that contained several Gawker employees, and that group has been found to have partaken in some very unethical behavior. It was mirrored after JournoList after all.\n\nHopefully the narrative will finally break down and the truth will finally get out, and normal everyday people will finally see just how dangerous it is to have a media website control public perception through defamation, misinformation and agenda-driven deception.\n\nSome normies and those who even classify as “anti-#GamerGate” are actually helping #GamerGate by partaking in the Operation Disrespectful Nod e-mail campaign. A campaign, I might add, that originally was put into effect last year in the fall, back when Gawker and other unethical media websites attacked and defamed the gaming industry.\n\n(Main image courtesy of Maggie Hager and Captain Toog)",

They frequently looked rattled as an enterprising Algeria wasted a succession of chances in an open, exciting encounter, before Andre Schurrle finished from close range early in the first additional period.\n\nMesut Ozil drilled in to double their lead and, although Abdelmoumene Djabou volleyed home to ensure a frantic end, a relieved Germany held on and will take on the French in Rio on Friday.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Andre Schurrle scores cheeky extra-time goal\n\nThe result looked inevitable once an impressive Algeria side began to tire, but Joachim Low's men will have to improve dramatically if they are to secure a first World Cup since 1990.\n\nGermany are into the last eight for the 17th time in 18 World Cup appearances, but they lacked the fluency and cutting edge that has seen them installed among the tournament favourites.\n\nAlgeria could not mark their first experience of the knockout stage with a win, meaning Africa's representation in Brazil is over, but they depart with immense credit for a superb campaign.\n\nAnalysis \"Germany played such a high line with little pace in defence, and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is incredible to sweep up after them. They flirt with danger and he gets them out of trouble. \"Has there ever been a better sweeper keeper? He reads things wonderfully well.\"\n\nThe build-up was dominated by talk of them seeking revenge for 1982, when West Germany's convenient 1-0 win against Austria saw them both reach the second round at Algeria's expense.\n\nThey beat the Germans in the group stage that year and looked determined to produce a repeat.\n\nWith a 5-1-3-1 formation and five changes to their starting line-up that saw playmaker Yacine Brahimi drop to the bench, the Desert Foxes appeared to be set up defensively.\n\nBut, after an early spell of German pressure, they went in search of a shock lead and almost found it.\n\nGermany keeper Manuel Neuer made a vital challenge on Islam Slimani after Faouzi Ghoulam's ball up the left wing eluded Per Mertesacker, and it subsequently took an important tackle from the Arsenal centre-half to deny the same man.\n\nMatch facts Andre Schurrle has scored five goals in his last five competitive matches for Germany. Germany's total of 28 shots (inc. blocked) is a record for this edition of the tournament. There have now been a record 27 goals scored by substitutes at this World Cup. Algeria (7) have scored more goals in this tournament than in their previous three World Cup finals combined (6).\n\nSofiane Feghouli then sliced through the Germany back line only to miscue his cross from a brilliant position, Slimani's diving header was correctly disallowed for offside and Ghoulam steamed through on the left but lashed his finish across goal and wide.\n\nGermany eventually managed to exert an influence - Ozil's misdirected cross was tipped over the bar, Muller headed wide and keeper Rais Mbolhi spilled an Ozil drive - but Algeria refused to sit back and Mehdi Mostefa was the latest to come close with a strike that was deflected wide.\n\nMbolhi made a magnificent double save from Toni Kroos and Mario Gotze as Germany finished the half well, but it was no surprise when Gotze was replaced by Schurrle at the break.\n\nThe big question was whether Algeria would maintain their intensity or be punished for their missed chances and the answer nearly arrived when Schurrle's effort was deflected narrowly off target, before Shkodran Mustafi headed at Mbolhi and the goalkeeper pulled off a fine save from Philipp Lahm's shot.\n\nAlgeria responded by tightening up at the back and attempting to pounce on the counter-attack. Keeper Neuer was forced to operate as an auxiliary sweeper as Slimani escaped the German centre-backs, while Feghouli drilled wide and then Slimani lashed powerfully at Neuer.\n\nAt the other end, Mbolhi made another stunning stop from Muller's header while Esseid Belkalem and Ghoulam cleared off the line from Schurrle and Benedikt Hoewedes respectively.\n\nAlgeria were visibly tiring and after Muller and Bastian Schweinsteiger threatened a winner late in the 90 minutes, Schurrle finally broke the deadlock in the opening moments of extra time.\n\nMuller crossed low from the left for the Chelsea forward to dispatch with an improvised finish. It was the 14th of Germany's last 24 World Cup goals that Muller has been involved it.\n\nOzil rammed in a second before substitute Djabou converted from Feghouli's cross, but there was no time to find another goal as Germany celebrated and Algeria made a tearful exit.\n\nAlgeria goalkeeper Rais Mbolhi:\n\n\"It's true we are part of Algeria football history, we went farther than any other team before.\n\n\"We have to build upon this performance for the future since we saw that Algeria is able to play on an equal footing at a very high level with other teams.\"\n\nAlgeria fans predict a repeat of their victory over (West) Germany in 1982\n\nGermany's goalkeeper Manuel Neuer challenges Algeria's Islam Slimani\n\nAlgeria's goalkeeper Rais Mbolhi dives for the ball\n\nPhilipp Lahm forces a fine save from Rais Mbolhi\n\nBastian Schweinsteiger sees his header saved as the game heads into extra time\n\nGermany's Andre Schurrle scores past Algeria's goalkeeper\n\nAndre Schurrle celebrates his opening goal\n\nMesut Ozil scored what proved to be the winner\n\nAbdelmoumene Djabou scores a late consolation for Algeria",
  "latent_17546": "This 1970s press handout picture suggests that these two might be on to something.\n\nApple/Business Insider\n\nThis post originally appeared in Business Insider.\n\nAnd now, some breaking news from 1977: There is a new company in California that makes computer kits for individual hobbyists. It’s called The Apple Computer Company, according to Kilobaud magazine, and it looks like it might be a huge hit.\n\n“Rich Travis of Sunshine Computer Company in Southern California reports he sold ten Apples in three weeks … his customers were looking for a complete, ready-to-run system that was inexpensive,” writes Sheila Clarke of Kilobaud. “Because the system is really easy to buy and use, the system may well be in the homes of several hundred hobbyists within a few months.”\n\nAfter Business Insider recently published a charming set of photos taken by Apple’s earliest employees, veteran tech writer Sheila (Clarke) Craven got in touch and sent us this gem from February 1977: “The Remarkable Apple Computer,” a lengthy dissection of Apple’s launch product that Craven wrote after flying to San Francisco and interviewing founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. (Kilobaud eventually went out of business and its founder, Wayne Green, died in 2013.)\n\nCraven says she believes it was the first article ever written about Apple. We checked with Wozniak, and he agrees. “Seems quite the way it was,” Wozniak told us. “The only thing I can note is that we were demonstrating the Apple ][ before we shipped any Apple I’s, so we knew that it was a temporary project.”\n\nWe’ve published the entire Kilobaud article below. But be warned—it’s a dense catalog of computer arcana from the days when using a computer required knowledge of the BASIC programming language.\n\n“My interview with the two Steves took place while they were still in the folks’ garage,” Craven tells Business Insider. She remembers it this way:\n\n“I flew up from LA, and the two Steves picked me up in a red Chevy Luv Truck, tossed my suitcase in the back, and put me between them in the front seat. We went someplace for lunch, and talked about their plans.\n\nOf course, Steve Jobs did all the talking. After lunch we drove to his parents home in Palo Alto—never went inside the house—straight to the garage. On a workbench sat a PC board. above the workbench on a shelf sat a TV set where wires dangled from it to the PC board.\n\nThe whole time Steve Jobs was talking, explaining, outlining future plans for marketing and development, he was just about dancing on his tippy toes in his tennies. Then Woz sat at the workbench, initiating the operating system (I suppose) to demonstrate a program. Woz was pretty quiet. I got that he was the engineering brain power, and Jobs was the idea guy.\n\nOne of the things Jobs told me was that they would make certain there would be an Apple in every classroom and on every desk, because if kids grew up using and knowing the Apple, they would continue to buy Apples and so would their kids. The computers would be donated by Apple Computer. I understand that when that article came out, orders starting pouring in, and Apple Computer was seriously launched.”\n\nAt the time, Apple consisted of just the two Steves in Jobs’ parents’ garage. There was no office, Craven says. Craven spent four hours with the pair, including lunch. After Wozniak booted up the machine, Jobs loaded a game of Blackjack onto it to demonstrate its powers.\n\nCraven regarded the Apple I as “just another homebrew product” rather than the beginning of a machine that would change the world. “We never met again, although of course I continued to encounter Jobs at computer expos, Comdex, CES, etc.,” Craven says, although “I don’t think he ever manned a booth.”\n\nThe article says some things that were true of Apple then and, 40 years later, remain true today. Such as:\n\n“For the inexperienced, getting a program up seems to have been made relatively simple.”\n\nUpdates would be made available to existing customers for free.\n\nApple was trying to create “a network of program exchange” to develop games and other apps that would make the computer more fun and more useful.\n\n“Steve Jobs confesses that the Apple is not for everybody.” (It cost $788.66, a lot of money at the time.)\n\nAt the same time, the article contains some nuggets that illustrate how comically primitive computing was at the time. For that $788 you would get:\n\n“A complete system on a board. Complete that is if you’re willing to forgo extras now, like hard copy output, floppy disk storage, and color graphics.”\n\n“If you must purchase a black and white monitor, add the cost to the system; but you’ll probably run over my proposed budget.”\n\n“Although the Apple-1 comes with 4K bytes of RAM, 4K more is available for $120.”\n\n“BASIC is the language of the people,” say Steven Jobs and Stephen Wozniak, Apple Computer Company owners. Soon, they add, people won’t care which chip is used in the CPU, but will want to know more about the computer’s capability and how easy it is to use.”\n\n“We’re not in the business of making things more expensive,” say Jobs and Wozniak, when discussing their design philosophy.”\n\nCraven’s main impression was that “the two Steves care … they’re responsive to user enquiries and are open to suggestions and criticisms (to a point).”\n\nHere is the article.\n\nSee also: Photos of Apple’s First Employees From The Company’s Earliest Days",

There are, for example, those Christo rip-off ads AT&T has been flogging; and we wrote before about how Absolut blatantly stole the work of Stefan Sagmeister and was all, “We’re so inspiring at creative!

If Ogilvy & Mather did lift this idea — and I think it’s telling that this occurred in Jakarta, rather than say, New York, where the artist lives — what I find particularly gross is that they took it from someone small enough that few people would ever notice. Indeed, they might have gotten away with it. At least AT&T and Chartered had the decency to do such a blatant rip-off that they couldn’t help but be called out.\n\nadvertisement\n\nUPDATE Ogilvy responds: The Ogilvy creative team in Jakarta, which was solely responsible for the ad concept, was unaware of Mr. Johnson and his work. Any similarity between his work and our installation is coincidental. Creative integrity is a fundamental value of our company and a non-negotiable requirement of our client, UPS. UPS responds: From UPS’s perspective, we certainly understand and appreciate your concern, but Ogilvy has given us every assurance that their creative team in Jakarta had no knowledge of Ryan Johnson or his work. Given our long association with Ogilvy in Asia, we believe them. Ogilvy, and every other agency or vendor that represents UPS in some way, understands that we will not allow anyone to compromise the integrity or value of our brand. In light of the side-by-side images above, these responses seem laughable, right? Note the similarities in pose, proportion, and pixel density–and note how the precise similarities extend all the way to the L-shaped support on the forward leg. And now it gets even nuttier: Johnson responds: How can they claim that they never saw Pedestrian? The evidence is undeniable and infuriating… Stranger still is that I grew up in Jakarta as my parents were teachers at the Jakarta International School. Also strange is that an ad agency in Germany working on a pitch for DHL contacted me a few years ago and were wondering if they could use the image of Pedestrian. So does that make Ogilvy doubly unoriginal?\n\nadvertisement\n\nUPDATE 2 We’ve actually covered another unfortunate instance of uncanny similaries courtesy of Ogilvy–in particular, how they seemed to appropriate another artist in a campaign for AmEx. But in that case, Amex yanked the ads and apologized to the original artist. Johnson should get at least as much.

  "latent_17848": "Even with these great successes, work remains to be done. Every experimental test of entanglement has been subject to one or more loopholes, which hold out the possibility, however slim, that some alternative theory, distinct from quantum theory and more in line with Einstein’s intuitions, may still be salvageable. For example, one potential loophole — addressed by Dr. Aspect’s experiment — was that the measurement device itself was somehow transmitting information about one particle to the other particle, which would explain the coordination between them.\n\nThe most stubborn remaining loophole is known as “setting independence.” Dr. Zeilinger and I, working with several colleagues — including the physicists Alan H. Guth, Andrew S. Friedman and Jason Gallicchio — aim to close this loophole, a project that several of us described in an article in Physical Review Letters.\n\nHERE’S the problem. In any test of entanglement, the researcher must select the settings on each of the detectors of the experimental apparatus (choosing to measure, for example, a particle’s spin along one direction or another). The setting-independence loophole suggests that, though the researcher appears to be free to select any setting for the detectors, it is possible that he is not completely free: Some unnoticed causal mechanism in the past may have fixed the detectors’ settings in advance, or nudged the likelihood that one setting would be chosen over another.\n\nBizarre as it may sound, even a minuscule amount of such coordination of the detectors’ settings would enable certain alternative theories to mimic the famous predictions from quantum theory. In such a case, entanglement would be merely a chimera.\n\nHow to close this loophole? Well, obviously, we aren’t going to try to prove that humans have free will. But we can try something else. In our proposed experiment, the detector setting that is selected (say, measuring a particle’s spin along this direction rather than that one) would be determined not by us — but by an observed property of some of the oldest light in the universe (say, whether light from distant quasars arrives at Earth at an even- or odd-numbered microsecond). These sources of light are so far away from us and from one another that they would not have been able to receive a single light signal from one another, or from the position of the Earth, before the moment, billions of years ago, when they emitted the light that we detect here on Earth today.\n\nThat is, we would guarantee that any strange “nudging” or conspiracy among the detector settings — if it does exist — would have to have occurred all the way back at the Hot Big Bang itself, nearly 14 billion years ago.\n\nIf, as we expect, the usual predictions from quantum theory are borne out in this experiment, we will have constrained various alternative theories as much as physically possible in our universe. If not, that would point toward a profoundly new physics.\n\nEither way, the experiment promises to be exciting — a fitting way, we hope, to mark Bell’s paper’s 50th anniversary.",
  "latent_18024": "Canada is finding that many Syrian refugees are reluctant to travel so far afield, a stumbling block as the country works to identify thousands of newcomers to bring here within a matter of months.\n\nInitial efforts in November by the United Nations to find Syrians in refugee camps keen on rapidly relocating thousands of kilometres to Canada as government-sponsored refugees bore relatively little fruit, new figures released by Ottawa show.\n\nOnly about 6.3 per cent of refugees contacted indicated they were interested in coming to Canada when the UN got in touch with them between Nov. 18 and 26. This was chiefly in Jordan but also in Lebanon.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe Canadian government, which released these numbers Wednesday, insists refugee interest has grown since late November – but could provide no numbers to back that up. They acknowledged many refugees in camps are still hoping they might return to Syria or want to remain in the region.\n\nImmigration Minister John McCallum said Canada can still meet its targets despite reluctance among some.\n\n\"There's about four millions refugees that we can draw on. And so if a smaller percentage wants to come, we just contact more,\" he told reporters in Surrey, B.C.\n\n\"There is absolutely no doubt in my mind, having seen many of these refugee applicants over there, spoken to a few through an interpreter, that there's a huge enthusiasm to come to Canada. It's just a question of the logistics of connecting us to them.\"\n\nThe Liberals have promised to bring 25,000 government-assisted refugees to Canada by 2016, with Ottawa saying it will give preference to the most vulnerable. They are separate from the 10,000 Syrians being sponsored privately by individual Canadians and groups, who will cover first-year living costs and have selected their own refugees – often relatives. Most of this second group will arrive later in December.\n\nBeginning Nov. 18, the United Nations refugee agency sent text messages to more than 41,000 Syrians asking if they wanted to come to Canada by the end of February, 2016. They later found that only about 28,500 of the phone numbers worked.\n\nMore than 3,000 refugees ended up coming for interviews with the UN and ultimately only about 1,800 indicated they were interested in coming to Canada by February, Ottawa said. These were referred to the Department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship for screening.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nA senior Canadian official, speaking at a background briefing for reporters Wednesday, said it's normal that potential refugee numbers get whittled down as the UN contacts prospective candidates.\n\n\"It's just a reality that as much as we are eager to welcome the 25,000 people … some of them want to stay close to home. Some of them still want to be able to return to Syria and are hopeful there will be a resolution to the conflict there,\" the official said.\n\nThe government still insists it's on track to bring 15,000 government-assisted refugees to Canada by the end of February, 2016. About 8,000 private-sponsored refugees are expected before Christmas as well as 2,000 government-assisted newcomers. The Liberal government promises to bring in another 10,000 government-supported refugees by the end of 2016.\n\nThe Trudeau government has branded the resettlement of thousands of refugees as a \"national project\" that will ease the four-year-old refugee crisis unfolding in the Middle East and in Europe as a result of chaos in Syria.\n\nStill, the relatively low number of Syrians who initially accepted the invitation to enter the federal program shows that coming to Canada is not every refugee's first choice.\n\nSome of them \"hope against hope\" that they will be able to return home eventually, said Paul Clarke, executive director of Action Réfugiés Montreal. He added that it is hard for Syrian refugees to grasp exactly how they will adapt to their new home, learn a new language and find a way to earn a living, especially if they lack the necessary education.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"The decision to cross an ocean forever is obviously a major one, and not one that people necessarily want to make,\" Mr. Clarke said in an interview.\n\nAlexandra Kotyk, project manager for Lifeline Syria, said interest among prospective government-sponsored refugees could pick up after some initially settle in Canada. \"Once reporting gets back from a community that has been resettled here – with people reporting back that this is a good place – then they will start to want to come in bigger numbers.\"\n\nThe Liberal government is still unable to state precisely where the refugees will be settling in Canada.\n\nMayors and provincial ministers have been seeking firm details on the geographic distribution of the first 15,000 government-sponsored refugees, both to get ready for their arrival but also to try to get as many of them as possible to settle in their communities. This comes amid concerns that a large majority of the refugees will choose to settle in Canada's biggest cities.\n\nBureaucrats say, however, that they are not used to determining in advance where refugees will be settling, and have refused to create firm targets to be met in coming months.\n\nA senior federal public servant told reporters at Wednesday's briefing that a clear challenge is that there is now a thirst for \"degrees of information in advance for this movement [of people] that never exists for other movements.\"\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe official added that in normal situations, \"communities didn't know normally exactly how many refugees would be arriving in the next calendar year.\" He added that bureaucrats will create \"notional targets\" by city, but added that the targets will be continuously adjusted to accommodate the needs of the newcomers.\n\nAnother federal official said that \"destination matching\" can only occur after government workers have interviewed refugees, pointing out that they are most likely to stay in an area if they have family members who are already present.\n\n\"We like to see people settle and not move out two weeks later,\" the official said. \"If they have family members in a particular community, that is a strong indicator of where they should be settled as government-assisted refugees.\"\n\nThe bureaucrats also try to gauge whether the refugees have particular needs, such as mental-health care, when determining where they should settle.\n\nWith a report from Sunny Dhillon in Vancouver",

Moreover, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who can discuss the iconic poet, author, illustrator, and singer-songwriter Shel Silverstein without warmly recalling childhood memories of works like \"The Giving Tree,\" or \"A Light In The Attic.\"There has been so much written about him and far more by him -- but yet, in all likelihood, you probably don't know the full scope of his work. Let's start with this fun fact: Shel Silverstein was a columnist and cartoonist for Playboy Magazine for over 40 years beginning after he joined the staff in 1956.The story goes that though Shel hit it off with Playboy's notorious founder Hugh Hefner -- who also happened to be a cartoonist -- nothing happened fast. Hefner was maneuvering an uncertain future for his newly minted magazine while Silverstein was attempting to make a living doing something he was uncomfortable with at the time -- freelancing.\"I really thought I was meeting a guy who [had] just woken up, which is a legitimate concern,\" Silverstein humorously mused upon observing Hef's silk-pajama garb. But once Playboy commissioned its first few cartoons from Shel and paid good money for them, he was hooked. In fact, those first Playboy checks gave him the grounds to move out from under his parent's roof when they were all too keen to see him fail in his unconventional career and get a \"normal\" job.\"Normal\" wouldn't cut it for Shel though. His career began to flourish in Playboy with travelogues detailing risqué assignments in places like Fire Island [ see the cartoons here ], Tokyo, and cities around the world where Shel and his photographer would put together joint cartoon-photo features that shed light on worldly locales through the wholly original lens of Silverstein's imagination.\"The cartoons lampoon and deflate the expectations of the tourist, humanising the apparently foreign, yet for comic effect they ring new changes on those same foreign and cultural stereotypes,\" the blog StreetLaughter surmised And so it went, on-and-off, for more than forty years of incredibly underrated material. Oh yeah, and then there are the drug-fueled songs penned and performed by Silverstein as well. But those are for another story ...Happy Birthday Shel!",

Developers are calling the criteria for approval inconsistent and unclear, and some have suggested that the final approval involves asking a hamster named Monroe whether he would like some dried carrot. If Monroe has a tummy ache that day, it's back to the drawing board. Apple has neither confirmed nor denied this rumor.\n\nI, myself, have submitted several applications to the iPhone Developer Program, and have been rejected every time. I think if you look over my list of apps and the supposed reasons for their rejection, you'll see that Apple's decisions are pure whimsy, drawn up from the whimsy mines deep beneath the company's headquarters in sunny Cupertino, California.\n\nLow-Fat Chicken Breast Recipe Book\n\nApparently, Apple can't even handle the word breast, because it rejected this app, which is nothing more than a guide to cooking healthful, delicious, boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Each recipe comes with detailed instructions and a helpful video showing the dish being prepared by a naked porn star.\n\nSteve Jobs Strip Poker\n\nApple has never been the biggest fan of transparency, so I guess it stands to reason that the company would be too cowardly to let the world see what its CEO looks like under the turtleneck. I'm no financial expert, but if I were looking to invest in Apple, I'd wonder what Jobs is trying to hide. A vestigial twin, whispering design suggestions for the fabled iTablet? A \"NeXT Forever\" tattoo? The mark of Cain? We'll never know, because Apple was unwilling to approve this app, much less supply the appropriate texture maps.\n\nBaby Shaker\n\nThis was a detailed, realistic sim where you raised a child in the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing, aka the Shakers, teaching it to sing hymns and build furniture.

For added fun, it would send an e-mail to the smashee, saying: \"I just killed you! You are dead!\" and attaching a video of the terrifying murder. For some reason, Apple found this \"offensive.\" I guess the company's engineers just don't like social media.\n\nPersonalConnect Voice\n\nIt's sad that Apple can't handle a little competition. Not only did it reject the Google Voice app, the company also rejected my PersonalConnect Voice app, which provides an instant connection to phone sex operators around the world. It seems Apple wants to keep the lucrative phone sex market to itself. I just wish the company would admit it. Come on, Cupertino — come out and say it: \"When someone calls a jaded sex worker pretending to be a nubile, insatiable co-ed, we want them to think 'Apple.'\"\n\nSteal Me!\n\nThis handy app uses motion detection to determine when your iPhone has been set down for three minutes or more, at which point it begins to yells a recorded message: \"Steal me! Just grab me and run! You can get a hundred bucks or so, easy! Spend it on drugs! Anyone who buys an iPhone has too much money anyway! Go for it!\" I have no idea why Apple rejected this app, but I suspect the company is working on its own version and didn't want the competition.\n\n\\—\n\nBorn helpless, nude and unable to provide for himself, Lore Sjoberg eventually overcame these handicaps to become a developer, a devaluer and a devolutionist.

  "latent_18231": "Tobacco industry dying? Not so fast, says Stanford expert\n\nSmoking is not going away. Worldwide, says Stanford historian Robert Proctor, the tobacco industry continues to create toxic products that cause not just lung cancer but also cataracts, ankle fractures, early onset menopause, spontaneous abortion and erectile dysfunction, among other maladies.\n\nSteve Fyffe and L.A. Cicero 'The industry has spent tens of billions designing cigarettes since the 1940s – that's from the industry's own documents,' Robert Proctor said.\n\nThe cigarette industry is not dying. It continues to reap unimaginable profits. It's still winning lawsuits. And cigarettes still kill millions every year.\n\nSo says Stanford's Robert Proctor, author of the new bombshell study, Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition, a book the tobacco industry tried to stop with subpoenas and hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees.\n\nProctor, the first historian to testify in court against the tobacco industry (in 1998), warns that the worst of the health catastrophe is still ahead of us: Thanks to the long-term effects of cigarettes, \"If everyone stopped smoking today, there would still be millions of deaths a year for decades to come.\"\n\n\"Low-tar\" cigarettes? \"Light\" cigarettes? Better filters? Forget it, he said. They don't work. Today's cigarettes are deadlier even than those made 60 years ago, gram for gram.\n\nHalf the people who smoke will die from their habit. A surprising number will die from stroke and heart attacks, not cancer.\n\nMoreover, he asks, \"How many people know that tobacco is a major cause of blindness, baldness and bladder cancer, not to mention cataracts, ankle fractures, early onset menopause, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion and erectile dysfunction?\"\n\nSix trillion cigarettes are smoked every year – that's 6,000,000,000,000. Proctor said that's \"enough to make a continuous chain from Earth to the sun and back, with enough left over for a couple of round trips to Mars.\"\n\nL.A. Cicero 'There's hundreds of things people don't know about smoking,' Robert Proctor said.\n\nHis 750-page book, a decade in the making, has already earned high praise, with terms like \"a real page-turner,\" \"a must-read,\" \"the most important book on smoking in 50 years.\"\n\n\"This book is a remarkable compendium of evil,\" wrote Columbia's David Rosner, an author of Deceit and Denial: The Deadly Politics of Industrial Pollution. \"It will keep you spinning from page one through the last. … It is the type of book that makes you wonder how, in God's name, this could have happened.\"\n\nAccording to Donald Kennedy, Stanford president emeritus and former editor of the journal Science, the book \"unpacks the sad history of an industrial fraud. [Proctor's] tightly reasoned exploration touches on all topics on which the tobacco makers lied repeatedly to Congress and the public.\"\n\nThe hefty book has not only won him accolades, but it's personally cost Proctor $50,000 in legal fees to defend himself against the industry, which subpoenaed his email and unpublished manuscript.\n\nAccording to an article in The Nation last year, Proctor is one of only two historians who currently testify on behalf of smokers injured by tobacco products; 50 have testified on behalf of the industry. Academics from virtually every discipline have been collaborating with the Marlboro Men – and made big money doing so.\n\n\"This is the biggest breach of academic integrity since the Nazis,\" he said, and \"certainly the most deadly.\"\n\nSuch language is typical for Proctor. When it comes to cigarettes, he speaks in provocative superlatives, pulling no punches.\n\nCigarettes are \"the deadliest artifact in the history of civilization\" – more than bullets, more than atom bombs, more than traffic accidents or wars or heroin addiction combined. They are also among \"the most carefully and most craftily devised small objects on the planet.\"\n\n\"The industry has spent tens of billions designing cigarettes since the 1940s – that's from the industry's own documents,\" he said.\n\nHe also marshals evidence to show that smoking contributes substantially to environmental damage, even global warming: \"When we finally decide to take seriously the problem of global climate change, cigarettes will come under increasing scrutiny. Tobacco agriculture and cigarette manufacturing have heavy carbon footprints – think deforestation and petrochemical pesticides – and cigarettes are leading causes of fires and industrial accidents. There's not much room for cigarettes in an environmentally conscious world.\"\n\nFor the industry, though, the cigarette represents the perfect business model. \"It costs a penny to make. Sell it for a dollar. It's addictive,\" says investment guru Warren Buffett. Proctor notes that \"by artfully crafting its physical character and chemistry, industry scientists have managed to create an optimally addictive drug delivery device, one that virtually sells itself.\"\n\n\"There's hundreds of things people don't know about smoking,\" said Proctor. Myths have instead lulled the public into complacency. He listed a few of the most common:\n\nMyth #1. Nobody smokes anymore. If you read the media, smoking sounds like a dying habit in California. That's far from true, said Proctor. Californians still smoke about 28 billion cigarettes per year, a per capita rate only slightly below the global average.\n\nSo why do we have this illusion? \"We don't count the people who don't count. It's not the educated or the rich who smoke anymore, it's the poor,\" said Proctor.\n\nAlso, look at popular social trends – the recent trendiness of cigars, for example. Or the current fad for hookah parties. He recalled one such event at Stanford: \"They would never have a Marlboro party. But hookah is just as addictive, and just as deadly.\"\n\nMyth #2. The tobacco industry has turned over a new leaf. \"The fact is that the industry has never admitted they've lied to the public or marketed to children or manipulated the potency of their project to create and sustain addiction,\" Proctor said. \"A U.S. Federal Court in 2006 found the American companies in violation of RICO racketeering laws, and nothing has changed since then. And the same techniques used in the past in the U.S. are now being pushed onto vulnerable populations abroad.\"\n\nMyth #3. Everyone knows that smoking is bad for you. Proctor pointed out that most people begin smoking at the age of 12 or 13, or even younger in some parts of the world. \"Do they know everything?\" Proctor asked rhetorically. \"And how many people know that cigarettes contain radioactive isotopes, or cyanide, or free-basing agents like ammonia, added to juice up the potency of nicotine?\"\n\nMyth #4. Smokers like smoking, and so should be free to do it. And the industry has a right to manufacture cigarettes, even if defective. Proctor called this \"the libertarian argument.\"\n\n\"It is wrong to think about tobacco as a struggle between liberty and longevity; that tips the scales in favor of the industry. People will always choose liberty, as in 'Give me liberty or give me death.' What people don't realize is that most smokers dislike the fact they smoke, and wish they could quit. Cigarettes are actually destroyers of freedom.\"\n\nThere are tobacco industry documents, he noted, in which smoking is compared not to drinking but rather to being an alcoholic. Proctor also points to how we handle other forms of toxic pollution: \"We don't allow kids to play with toys coated with lead paint. We don't drive cars that don't meet safety standards.\"\n\nThe upshot: \"People should be free to smoke wherever it harms no one else, but cigarettes as now designed are too dangerous to be produced or sold.\"\n\nMyth #5. The tobacco industry is here to stay. Global tobacco use would be declining were it not for China, where 40 percent of the world's cigarettes are made and smoked. Proctor has a bet with a colleague, though, that China will be among the first to bar the sale of cigarettes, once their financial costs are recognized. Governments throughout the world have benefited from tobacco taxes, which he calls \"the second addiction.\" The costs of paying for diseases caused by smoking are high, however – especially when you count lost productivity – and governments will start winding down on tobacco, he says, once this is taken seriously.\n\nProctor also said that in the United States, a \"Kafkaesque world\" divides smokers and non-smokers. The industry has computerized databases of virtually all smokers and spends over $400 per smoker per year on special offers, coupons, sign-ups and other direct mail approaches – an unseen world to non-smokers. \"This is precisely how the industry wants it; a fungus always grows best in the dark,\" he writes.\n\nProctor admits to a personal motivation for his research. Three of his grandparents died from smoking – one from emphysema, another from lung cancer and a third from a heart attack in his mid-50s. The family blamed the last death on eating too many eggs. \"That's the story,\" said Proctor, \"but he smoked nonstop.\"\n\nFor Proctor, then, his engagement with Big Tobacco is more than just research: \"It's part of my sense of what it means to be an ethical human being, using my expertise to do what's right for humanity on the planet.\"\n\nMedia Contact\n\nRobert Proctor, History: (650) 269-4495, (650) 323-6346, rproctor@stanford.edu\n\nDan Stober, Stanford News Service: (650) 721-6965, dstober@stanford.edu",
  "latent_18250": "Microsoft’s SkyDrive is an adequate cloud storage service (and one that boasts 17 million customers to boot), but it’s not something that the folks at Redmond can afford to leave in its current state. With Apple playing up their iCloud integration in their forthcoming OS X Mountain Lion update, SkyDrive program managers Mike Torres and Omar Shahine took to the Building Windows 8 blog to outline what’s next for their own cloud service.\n\nAt first glance, the changes seem incremental. SkyDrive will look prettier than it has before thanks to a handsome new Metro-styled app for Windows 8. It’s exactly what you would expect — users can swipe through their remotely-stored files, while third-party applications are able to access those SkyDrive files without any extra work needed from their developers. Expect to see this launch right alongside the Windows 8 consumer preview next week.\n\nA new desktop app is also in the works, and will allow users to drag and drop files into their SkyDrive without the need for firing up a browser and navigating to the SkyDrive site. Frankly, it’s a feature that’s long overdue — the old process could be clumsy and time-consuming, and while it got the job done, nothing about it made it worth writing home about. Files as large as 2GB can be dragged into the SkyDrive, and the effect on overall performance is expected to be minimal.\n\nThat’s all well and good — Microsoft is taking steps to ease the friction that comes with storing and interacting with files in the cloud. But the last of their new features could put SkyDrive over the top for some users.\n\nAs it stands, the SkyDrive site offers very few frills, but users will soon be able to access files stored on their PCs remotely from the SkyDrive site. Internally called the “Forgot something?” feature (a name that I hope makes its way into the consumer release), users can access their devices while on the run so long as they’re running the SkyDrive desktop service. Microsoft doesn’t mention to what extent users will be able to dig through their own files — whether it’s just certain shared folders or the entirety of the filesystem — but it could be a real life-saver if it works as well as it looks in their demo video.\n\nTo offset the potential security risk this sort of access poses, Microsoft has set up a two-factor authentication scheme that requires the user to have both their device password, and access to a connected email account or mobile device. Though the authentication proces seems like a (necessary) hassle, the payoff is substantial — in addition to moving files back and forth, users can also stream video and view photo slideshows remotely.

future erupted on Wednesday night when Ecuador’s foreign minister went public with a note from the British charge d’affairs threatening to use an obscure law to rescind the building’s diplomatic status, storm the building and make the arrest.\n\nBritish officials said it was an attempt to ‘rattle their cage’ but Mr Patino reacted with fury, claiming such a move would be seen as a ‘hostile act’.\n\nAnnouncing the decision to award ‘diplomatic asylum’ in a televised statement yesterday, he said Mr Assange was a victim of political persecution and could face the death penalty if sent to the US by Sweden.\n\nMr Assange’s supporters fear he could face charges of sedition and espionage over the release of tens of thousands of secret US documents by the WikiLeaks site two years ago.\n\nMr Patino said: ‘It is not impossible that he would be treated in a cruel manner, condemned to life in prison, or even the death penalty.’\n\nThe decision was condemned by Foreign Secretary William Hague who said asylum was being used ‘for the purposes of escaping the regular processes of the court.’\n\nHe added: ‘No one, least of all the government of Ecuador, should be in any doubt

reference to the 1987 Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act which allow the suspension of normal embassy rules.\n\nThe law was a response to the shooting dead of WPC Yvonne Fletcher from inside the Libyan embassy in 1984.\n\nLast night senior diplomats privately condemned the Ecuadorian government which they said had been captured by left-wingers similar to Venezuelan firebrand Hugo Chavez – who regard Mr Assange as a hero because they hate the United States.\n\n‘There is evidence that he did not turn up there by accident,’ a senior source said.\n\nMr Assange welcomed the decision to grant

further humiliation for ministers.\n\nHis lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson QC, claimed the blunder over the threatening letter happened because ‘all the good lawyers’ at the Foreign Office were away on holiday.\n\nHuman rights activists poured scorn on Ecuador’s claim to be protecting human rights.\n\nThe regime has a notorious record for persecuting both journalists and its political opponents.\n\nMr Assange entered the embassy on June 19, after a two-year legal battle against extradition under the European Arrest Warrant.\n\nHis case against extradition was rejected by a district court, at the High Court and went all the way to the Supreme Court where it also failed.\n\nHe was granted bail after sureties worth nearly £250,000 were pledged by his supporters, who include film

  "latent_18258": "by\n\nDue to petitions of a number of environmental groups, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) appears likely to list the wolverine under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Once found across much of the West and northern-tier states from Minnesota to Maine, wolverines are now limited to a few isolated populations in the western United States. Wolverines are a wide ranging predator that are adapted to survival in cold snowy climates.\n\nTrapping, combined with poisoning programs aim at other predators like wolves, originally contributed to the wolverines demise across much of its former territory. However, global warming is the latest threat to its survival in the lower 48 states. Though population estimates vary, the best available “guesses” (and I say guess because no region- wide efforts to document population numbers has been completed) are that there are no more than 250-300 wolverine in the lower 48 states, with the majority of them residing in Montana.\n\nBecause of these precariously low numbers, trapping of wolverine has been banned in all states where they are found, except Montana. The Montana Dept. of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (MDFWP) argue that trapping is not a major source of mortality or a threat to the species.\n\nFurthermore, they restrict the number of wolverine that can be trapped in any one part of the state which they claim ensures that trapping will not harm the species.\n\nIn response to the USFWS determination that wolverine warrant protection under the ESA, MDFWP has announced that it will seek an exemption to trapping of wolverine in Montana once the species is listed under the ESA.\n\nWe all know that climate change is one of the factors that threaten the long-term survival of wolverine in the lower 48 states. But doing anything about climate change in the near future is not likely to change this scenario, and all models suggest wolverine habitat is shrinking, thus fewer wolverine in a population, that is already precariously low, for long-term survival.\n\nThe one thing we have immediate control over is optional forms of human caused mortality such as trapping. While the number of animals lost to trapping may seem small (5 a year), there are biological reasons why trapping may contribute to greater losses than that number suggests. Due to the social behavior ecology of wolverine, the trapping of one individual can lead to the death of several to many more wolverine.\n\nFurthermore, even the additional loss of one or two animals from a single mountain range may be sufficient to push that island population to extinction. As the wolverine in mountain range after mountain range wink out, the species is pushed ever closer to extinction.\n\nFinally, the elephant in the room that MDFWP totally ignores is the ethics of trapping in a modern age. Is it really ethical to inflict avoidable pain upon other animals? Trapping amounts to torture. Most of us would be outraged if a dog owner put their pet in a trap and left it for hours or days to suffer. Hunters are admonished to make a “clean kill” so that animals they shoot do not suffer. Why do we allow trappers to inflict pain and suffering on wolverine, wolves or other animals? For what reason, do these few trappers need to trap wolverine? To eat? To sell a couple of pelts for income? Are these elusive wolverine threatening trappers in anyway? Trapping amounts to the privatization of a public resource for private gain. Is this what a civilized society permits?\n\nI am most concerned about what promoting this practice of wolverine trapping says about MDFWP priorities. It appears to be more concerned about maintaining the recreational activities of a few people at the expense of the wildlife it is entrusted by the Public Trust Doctrine to protect. It is putting the interests of hunters/trappers ahead of the interests of wildlife they are obligated to protect.\n\nThough MDFWP claims to use the best available science in managing wildlife, it continuously ignores the latest social behavior ecology and conservation biology principles when formulating its wildlife policies with regards to predators, from wolves to wolverine.\n\nMany of the remaining populations of wolverine in Montana are in small isolated island population groups, often as little as 10 individuals in a mountain range. Such small populations are very vulnerable to local extirpation simply to natural stochastic population events. Even the loss of one key individual may jeopardize an island population.\n\nWolverine bear young in the winter, it’s entirely possible to trap a female and wind up killing her and her young, 2-3 additional wolverine in one swoop because the young starve to death.\n\nIn many of these small island population centers there is likely to be only one or two breeding females. If for any other reason, there is additional mortality on any other females–killed by natural causes, being hit by a car or whatever, that population could easily dwindle to zero.\n\nFurthermore, male wolverine by protecting their territories, keep other male wolverine out of the territory occupied by females they have mated with. Thus the presence of the dominant male indirectly protects the young wolverine he has sired that outside males tend to kill. Trapping of a male wolverine may therefore lead to the death of many additional young wolverine.\n\nGiven the very low density of wolverine in most of its remaining range, it’s entirely possible for trappers to wipe out the animals from range after range.\n\nThere is yet another example of where the MDFWP appears to ignore the latest science regarding the social behavioral ecology and principles of conservation biology. It has to do with the concept of “effective” breeding population. The number of animals involved in breeding in a polygamous species like wolverine, is far less than the total population. Some estimate this breeding population may be as small as 35 animals.\n\nOnly a few male wolverine are doing most of the breeding of females, and the number of females that are breeding at any one time is also a subset of the total. Therefore the loss of breeding animals and the loss of entire island populations can put the species at risk of genetic bottlenecks, if the species is not already threatened by such a small breeding population.\n\nThere is new research with many other wildlife species that have seen genetic losses; from wolves that recently recolonized Scandinavia; to cheetahs in Africa; to mountain lions in Florida; to wolves on Isle Royal. All have genetic problems because of these kinds of genetic bottlenecks.\n\nAt the very least the MDFWP should acknowledge that this may already be a problem with such a very small wolverine population in Montana. Again, there has not been a word from the “professionals” on how many wolverines live in Montana or any of the demographics about these wolverines.\n\nWhen you’re dealing with an animal that is already precariously low in numbers, and due to its social behavior has limited opportunities for genetic diversity, any losses are serious. Sure there are other sources of mortality out there, but trapping mortality is preventable, most of the others are not.\n\nMost genetic studies that I have seen regarding predators suggest that a minimum effective breeding population of 500 is needed to ensure the long term survival of the species. Obviously, we have already passed below that point with wolverine in Montana.\n\nWhether this minimum number applies to wolverine I do not know, but I suspect the professionals at the MDFWP do not know either, and that is the problem. How can sound decisions be made when the most basic information about the species is not available?\n\nFinally, even the presence of trappers may harm wolverine. Research has demonstrated that snowmobile use of high country can disturb denning female wolverine and cause them to abandon their dens, sometimes leading to the loss of their young. Most trappers today use snowmobiles, so even the pursuit of wolverine may harm their survival.\n\nThe precautionary principle in conservation biology is to err on the side of the animal.\n\nIf MDFWP wants to portray themselves as “professionals” then it’s time to act like a professional organization, not just a handmaiden to hunters and trappers. MDFWP is the regulatory agency that is supposed to regulate and manage wildlife for ALL PEOPLE and FUTURE GENERATIONS. Unfortunately they appear to be more interested in maintaining archaic traditions like trapping than promoting the long term survival of many species entrusted to their care.\n\nThere are many things that MDFWP does well, but the management of predators and endangered species is not one of them. In these instances, it appears that hunter/trapping/economic interests are put ahead of the welfare of the wildlife they have a Public Trust obligation to protect.\n\nI hope in the future I can write a more positive note, one congratulating the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks on its willingness to challenge age old dogma.\n\nGeorge Wuerthner is the Ecological Projects Director for the Foundation for Deep Ecology and has published 35 books, including soon to be released Energy: Overdevelopment and the Delusion of Endless Growth.",
  "latent_18292": "Since its first broadcast in 1964, Rankin-Bass’ TV special Rudolph has built a cult following in the LGBT community. Saving it from its own era has always been an act of intervention.\n\nCould Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer premiere without controversy in these times? Since its debut nearly fifty years ago, the television special has delighted generations with its tactile charm and catchy songs. But despite its timeless appeal, Rudolph also offers a glimpse of a bygone era carrying a different set of social mores. Over the decades, outdated messages and symbolism—whether intended or not—have emerged from the stop-motion antics of Rudolph, Hermey the Elf Dentist, Santa, and the denizens of the Island of Misfit Toys. For some viewers, Rudolph delivers a rousing rebuke to prejudice and discrimination; while others note how far society has progressed from the patriarchal rule of the North Pole.\n\nMisfits\n\nRudolph’s father, Donner is a creature of the mid-sixties, head of the household in a patriarchal society. Right off the bat, he refuses to accept his son’s nose, covering it with mud. His iron hoof extends to matters with his wife, who he handles with Don Draper-esque élan.\n\nMuch of what Donner says to Rudolph during the special could be considered borderline abusive, though TV Tropes posits,\n\n… considering the time when the creators were growing up and the movie was released, it was probably wasn’t intended to come off as abusive and was meant to be a typical father-son relationship. Men being hard on their sons was considered the norm, whether it was fair or not, and could still be considered reasonably well-adjusted.\n\nLike Rudolph, Hermey fares no better with his fellow elves on the admission that he doesn’t like to make toys. The Head Elf harangues him for his interest in bicuspids and molars, while his toy making peers—all male, by the way—roundly mock the erstwhile dentist.\n\nThe shunning of Rudolph and Hermey appear to be motivated by absolute fear of offending the most important figure in town: Santa Claus. Truly bizarre and comical is just how irritable St. Nick comes across during nearly every one of his scenes. When given the opportunity to set an example, perhaps by consoling Rudolph during the reindeer games, Santa piles on, shaming Donner no less. (For further proof, this supercut lays bare the OG Bad Santa.)\n\nThough thorny issues regarding power existed in the mid-sixties, they were not viewed in the same light as present day. Social change begets reevaluation of prior morals. In recent years, perhaps no group has identified more with Rudolph’s central story than the gay community, many of whom believe that the special’s creators, Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass, intentionally created an allegory depicting their struggle for acceptance. Rudolph exhibits sheer flamboyance. He was born this way and should not need to conceal his true self.\n\nWith his grand swoop of blonde hair and delicate speaking voice, Hermey is a closeted elf desperate to follow his heart’s desire amongst belligerent peers. Is there any wonder how a young person who deviates from gender norms might see themselves in either as they light up when sharing their dream? Colleen Claes of Cultural Voice-Over writes,\n\n… tell me you don’t feel—with your adult senses—that the word “dentist” could easily be replaced with “homosexual.” For instance… Hermey: Hey, what do ya say we both be independent together, huh? Rudolph: You wouldn’t mind… my… red nose? Hermey: Not if you don’t mind me being… a… dentist.\n\nThe spotting of gay archetypes continue with assertions that Yukon Cornelius fits the bill of a bear and that Charlie-in-the-Box speaks with a tell-tale lisp. LGBT site Dallas Voice goes as far as painting Bumble the Abominable Snowman as a “sloppy bottom.”\n\nReindeer Games\n\nWhile it’s fun to claim hidden meanings and assign cheeky symbolism to these iconic characters and events, viewers may also come to grips with the unpleasantries that many in the gay community face. For those who feel outcast, perhaps no scene hits closer to home than the reindeer games. The young sleigh team hopefuls—again, all male—take to flying lessons. After nervously flirting with a doe, Clarice (I guess he could be bisexual), Rudolph gracefully takes to the air and lands with ease. When the mud concealing his nose pops off, the other reindeer rip into him, calling him a host of names.\n\nFor some, the situation rings familiar, as evidenced a satirical poem written by Domenick Scudera for the Huffington Post:\n\nRudolph the red-nosed reindeer\n\nHad a very shiny nose,\n\nAnd if you ever saw it,\n\nYou would even say it glowed.\n\nAll of the other reindeer\n\nUsed to laugh and call him names:\n\n“Queer,” “dickhead,” “fruit,” “fairy,” “faggot,” “ho-ho-homo,”\n\n“Retard,” “douche,” “gay,” “tranny,” “pussy,” “sissy boy.”\n\nRankin and Bass, of course, weren’t responsible for this turn of events; they merely followed the action laid out in the popular song written by Johnny Marks. While present day viewers may brand the mocking reindeer as bullies, we take satisfaction in knowing that Rudolph will prevail.\n\nHowever, for Long Island University Professor George Giuliani, Rudolph’s triumph is beside the point. He argues that the Christmas special actually promotes bullying, and even claims to have written an alternate version of the Rudolph legend titled, “No Bullies at the North Pole.” Presently, the book cannot be found online, so there’s no telling whether Dr. Giuliani is sincerely making perhaps too fine a politically correct point, or if he’s deliberately trolling the right-wing of the country. Either way, FOX News took the bait, inviting the author to debate against conservative “comedian” Brad Stine.\n\nIf Rudolph weren’t steeped in a half century of tradition, would FOX be so dismissive to claims that it’s anything more than a children’s story? Maybe not.\n\nClaus the Redeemer\n\nDid the creators have an inkling that these characters would stir such feelings of association from those who felt different? In an interview with Jim Colucci for the Archive of American Television, Rankin refutes that the special was specifically geared to anyone other than children in general.\n\nI think all kids feel slightly inferior, cause, as the man said – when he went to send his daughter to the psychiatrist – he says “What’s wrong with her?” The psychiatrist says, “What do you mean, ‘What’s wrong with her?’ She’s four-years-old, she’s three-feet tall, and she’s broke! She’s got problems.’ Kids have problems whatever they may be, and to see other characters that also have problems, they can associate with them.\n\nRankin and Bass likely paid little heed to issues of gender norms while honing the script. However, a telling example of gender expectations can be found in the credits. Though the voice of Rudolph was performed by Billie Mae Richards, a Canadian actress in her forties, the part is credited to Billy Richards. Rankin would later explain that he wanted to keep people from being confused. Nevertheless, this switch would seem to subvert the moral of the story: Be yourself—even when voicing a felt creature of the opposite gender.\n\nThis lack of an agenda to provide succor to those who felt strange and unloved might explain the odd decision to omit the famous scene of Santa returning to the Island of Misfit Toys at the end of the special. Indeed, when Rudolph first aired in 1964, Charlie-in-the-Box, the train with square wheels, spotted elephant, and girl rag doll (who Rankin would later reveal had “psychiatric problems”) were left on the island, tearfully counting down the days until next Christmas. After a letter writing campaign, an additional scene showing Santa’s rescue was filmed, and has been the proper ending ever since. By engendering empathy, Christmas is saved year after year, offering hope that misfits will find their place in the world.",

  "latent_18676": "Eating tuna is risky. It has been known to lead to mercury poisioning, character assassination, mass extinction and poverty.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be confusing. That's part of why the latest cross-sectional report from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on threat levels for billfish and scombrid species was greeted with relief when it arrived at HuffPost Food HQ. (Tuna is a sub-class of scombrids, which also include bonito, mackerel and Spanish mackerel.) Its data on tuna threat levels are both more comprehensive and more fine-grained than data at the better-known Monterey Bay Aquarium.\n\nThe IUCN report indicates that five of the eight species in the Thunnus species, which comprise the eight major varieties of tuna, are threatened with extinction. The two species facing the greatest threats are the Atlantic bluefin (Thunnus tynnus) and the southern bluefin (Thunnus maccoyii), which the IUCN rated endangered and critically endangered respectively. The report classified albacore (Thunnus alalunga) and yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) tuna as near threatened and bigeye (Thunnus obesus) tuna as vulnerable. (Vulnerable is the classification between \"near threatened\" and \"endangered\" on the IUCN red list.) Longtail (Thunnus tonggol) tuna are said to be data deficient, while blackfin (Thunnus atalanticus) and Pacific bluefin (Thunnus orientalis) tuna fall under the category \"Least Concern.\"\n\nNone of this is great news; at least five, and possibly six, of the eight species of tuna are at risk of extinction, largely because of overfishing. But the resilience of stocks of blackfin and Pacific bluefin tuna is at least heartening. And the report also noted that many species closely related to the major tuna genus, such as skipjack and bonito, are still relatively plentiful. This won't do anything to help the southern bluefin recover; with populations just 5% of what they would be without fishing, it may be too late for them. But it does mean that, if conservation begins soon, we may not lose the last wild food forever.",
  "latent_18694": "Announcing a robust datastore bulk update utility for App Engine\n\nPosted by Nick Johnson | Filed under app-engine, python, coding, tech, bulkupdate, datastore\n\nNote: This library is deprecated in favor of appengine-mapreduce, which is now bundled with the SDK.\n\nI'm pleased to announce the release of bulkupdate, an unoriginally-named library for the App Engine Python runtime that facilitates doing bulk operations on datastore data. With bulkupdate, simple operations like bulk re-puts and bulk deletes are trivial, while more complex operations like schema transitions or even emailing all your users become much simpler.\n\nThe basic operation of bulkupdate is very similar to the 'map' phase of the well known 'mapreduce' pattern. To use it, you create a subclass of the 'Bulkupdater' class, and define two methods: get_query(), which returns the query to execute, and handle_entity(), which is called once for each entity returned by the query. For example, suppose you want to write a daily task that sends an XMPP message to everyone with new activity on their accounts - the updater class would look something like this:\n\nclass ActivityNotifier(bulkupdate.BulkUpdater): def __init__(self, date_threshold): self.date_threshold = date_threshold def get_query(self): return UserAccount.all().filter('last_update >', self.date_threshold) def handle_entity(self, user): if user.unread_messages > 0: xmpp.send_message(user.jid, \"You have %s unread messages!\" % user.unread_messages)\n\nRunning the job is even simpler - you simply do something like this from inside a cron job:\n\njob = ActivityNotifier(datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=1)) job.start()\n\nThe bulkupdate framework takes care of the rest, running tasks on the task queue, and automatically chaining new ones when necessary. The real value of the library becomes apparrent when you consider the need to monitor and debug jobs. The bulkupdate library handles this by providing an admin interface, allowing you to list current and past jobs, show statistics on them, and even cancel or delete them. Here's an example of the current version of the admin console for one of our jobs:\n\nAs you can see, along with general statistics, the console captures stacktraces from any failed instances. Updaters can also log information using self.log, which gets recorded to the same log, and made available on the admin interface, as you can see above. This is an invaluable tool for outputting diagnostic information on the progress or contents of a bulkupdate job.\n\nThe bulkupdate library is still a work in progress, but it's fully functional and ready to be used today. Check out the documentation on the main bulkupdate page for more on how to get started.\n\nWill you use this library? Do you have a special job in mind for it, or a feature request? Let me know in the comments!\n\nDisqus",

  "latent_19376": "The Grandhotel Pupp ( Czech pronunciation: [pup]) is a 228-room luxury hotel located in Karlovy Vary (Carlsbad), Czech Republic. The hotel hosts the annual Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.\n\nThe hotel began as the Saxony Hall, built in 1701 by Burgomaster Deiml. A later mayor, Becher, built a Lusthaus on a plot of land he owned at right-angles to the Saxony Hall. This became known as the Bohemia Hall. Jan Jiří Pop (German: Johann Georg Pupp), a confectioner, came to Carlsbad in 1760 and worked for a local confectioner called Mitterbach. The widow of former mayor Becher sold a one-third share in the Bohemia Hall to Mitterbach's daughter, who married Pop in 1775. The following year, she bought another third and her husband the remaining third, giving the Pop/Pupp family complete ownership of the hall. At that time, Jan Jiří Pop started to use the German variant of his name.\n\nThe family prospered in the following decades and was able to buy the Saxony Hall in 1890. Between 1896 and 1907, the Viennese architects Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer rebuilt the various family-owned buildings into the neo-Baroque Grandhotel Pupp that stands today. Up until the Second World War the family continued to acquire neighbouring properties and incorporate them into the hotel complex.\n\nAfter the war, the Communist government of Czechoslovakia nationalised the hotel and it was renamed Grandhotel Moskva in 1950. The hotel's owners, along with almost the totality of the Karlsbad's population, was expelled. The hotel's original name was restored in 1989 and it has since been privatised.\n\nThe hotel in the year 1977.\n\nThe Grandhotel Pupp was a major location for the 2006 movie Last Holiday starring Queen Latifah.

  "latent_19558": "Source: robinjavier\n\nWhite feminists have been criticised by Black and ‘Third World’ feminists for silencing and overgeneralizing their experience. White Feminists have attempted to universalize their experiences, applying theories of ‘patriarchy’, and ‘the family’, to ethnic women, regardless of social realities. Whilst doing so, they have silenced minority women, ignored ideological manifestations which oppress them, and had their attention diverted from the realities which essentialism shields. In three articles the contributions to feminist thought by Hazel V. Carby, Patricia Hill Collins, and Uma Narayan will be analysed, alongside their critiques of white feminist thinking.\n\nHazel V. Carby – Black Feminism\n\nLiberal feminists advocate women gaining equal rights through means such as education (Wollstonecraft, 2015) and legal reforms (Mill, 1869). Carby (1999) does not believe legal reforms have been beneficial to all women, especially black women. For Carby, a significant amount of gender inequality is rooted in racist colonial ideologies held about specific racial groups (Carby, 1999). In the following section, the focus will be on racist ideologies at play in society, and Carby’s rationale as to why dominant white feminist concepts such as ‘patriarchy’, ‘the family, and ‘liberation’, cannot be adequately applied to the lives of black and ethnic women.\n\nWalby defines patriarchy as a system of social structures and practices in which men dominate, oppress and exploit women (Walby, 1990, p. 20). Carby argues the term ‘patriarchy’ needs to be developed to create a more complex definition (Carby, 1999). Black men suffer from the intersectionality of class, gender, and race. Racism ensures that black men do not have the same relationship to patriarchal/capitalist hierarchies as white men (Carby, 1999, p. 111).\n\nThis disparity between black and white men’s relationship to patriarchal/capitalist hierarchies is displayed well when you examine European society. The world is built on a racial contract which partitions white/non-white populations, this contract has been strengthened through 500 years of European domination and gradual global supremacy. This racial contract is evident in historical events like the voyage of ‘discovery’, and slavery. The racial contract is built into psyches making it exploitative; life chance for white are always significantly better than for non-whites (Mills, 1997, p. 13-37).\n\nVariation in life chances can be seen when exclusion rates are examined, in 2014 the Department for Education found Black Caribbean pupils were over three times more likely to be permanently excluded than all other ethnicities in the school population combined (Department for Education, 2016, p. 7). The House of Commons Library, between January-December 2015 found that Black men had an unemployment rate of 12.2%, more than double white men’s unemployment rate of 4.9% (House of Commons Library, 2016). In other words, white feminists have attempted to overgeneralize white men’s privileged patriarchal status in capitalist society to all men. For Carby (1999) the disadvantaged position of many ethnic men is rooted in historical colonial ideologies such as those created about black men in the transatlantic slave trade. This trend of overgeneralisation continues with theories of the ‘family’.\n\nAnsley (1972) is arguing about the nuclear family in her Marxist analysis of male partners using women as a source to relieve their frustrations against capitalist exploitation (cited in Bernard, 1972). This type of literature unintentionally reinforces the nuclear family as the norm, rendering the theory inadequate for explaining black women’s lives (Carby, 1999). Throughout time maintaining the mythical figure of the financially independent, white middle-class family organized around a monogamous heterosexual couple required stigmatising African-American families as deviant (Collins, 1991, p. 165).\n\nAccording to Platt’s (2009) analysis of the British Labour Force Survey in 2008, 20% of the White population were in tradition ‘nuclear’ families, 16% of the Black Caribbean population, 25% of the Black African population, with the Bangladeshi population making up the largest number of tradition nuclear families with 52%. For White British, Black Caribbean’s, and Black Africans the single person family type made up the largest family unit (Platt, 2009). Carby is keen to highlight that women living in different kinship relations are not necessarily oppressed in the way that white women are in nuclear families (Carby, 1999). The United Kingdom is a melting pot of various family structures the 2011 Census showed, 12% of the adult population of England and Wales was living in a cohabiting couple, and 42% of the adult population was not living in a couple (Smith, 2014, p. 23-27). Theories popularized by white feminists around the nuclear family fail to account for most individuals in the UK. These theories also buy into the ideological myth of the nuclear family which has been proven not only to be a mythical standard but a factor to racial oppression (Uzoka, 1979; Lehr, 1999; Roy, 2001; Collins, 1991; Carby, 1999).\n\nThe western nuclear family structure and related ideologies of ‘romantic love’ formed under capitalism are more ‘progressive’ than black family structures (Carby, 1999, p. 113). By ‘progressive’ Carby means black family structures are perceived as ‘backwards’ in comparison to the nuclear family. Western culture and feminists have aided this racist ideology by creating notions of women in need of ‘liberation’ which do not stem from experience, reinforcing throughout that some women and some forms of family are ‘advanced’ (Carby, 1999). One example Carby (1999) utilises is arranged marriage, which has the accompanying ideology of the forced marriage to delegitimize it.\n\nIn forced marriage, the medias ‘horror stories’ about Asian girls bear very little to their real life experiences. The ‘feminist’ version of this ideology presents Asian women as needing liberation, not in terms of their own herstory and needs, but into the ‘progressive’ social mores and customs of the West (Carby, 1999, p. 114). In 2015 the Forced Marriage Unit dealt with 1,220 cases on Forced Marriage across the UK (Home Office, 2016) it is 1,220 cases on Forced Marriage as many of the cases were practitioners seeking information on Forced Marriage rather than an actual Forced Marriage case. This is a small number of cases in comparison to the UK population which the World Bank estimated in 2015 to be 65,138,23 thousand (World Bank, 2015). For Carby, this inappropriate polarization behind ‘liberation’ is a direct result of imperialism, exemplifies the lack of research into black and ethnic women’s lives (Carby, 1999).\n\nIn the next article examining Black & Third World feminists against white feminism, Patricia Hill Collins contributions will be examined.\n\nBy Shaneka Knight\n\nFacebook: Shaneka Knight\n\nInstagram: shanekaakknight\n\nSee Also\n\nPatricia Hill Collins Vs White Feminism\n\nUma Narayan Vs White Feminism\n\nReferences\n\nBernard, J.

Not only that, the pool of candidates is getting less diverse.\n\n\"There is value in all students learning from teachers with diverse backgrounds,\" said Dr. Bernice Cobbs, principal of Benjamin Franklin Middle School in Rocky Mount.\n\nCobbs is one of about two dozens members of a task force charged with coming up with recommendations to address teacher diversity in the Commonwealth.\n\nLast year, 49 percent of students in Virginia's public schools identified as minorities, according to the Virginia Department of Education. That's compared to just 20 percent of teachers.\n\n\"The teacher pipeline is becoming less diverse,\" said Cobbs.\n\nOn Tuesday, the group presented its ideas to Gov. Terry McAuliffe.\n\n\"Our teacher population should reflect our student body,\" said McAuliffe. \"That's plain and clear, just as it is in society.\"\n\nThe task force came up with a total of 16 recommendations to tackle four barriers.\n\nThe barriers to a diverse teaching workforce were identified as:\n\n1. The length and cost of the traditional teacher preparation pathway is disproportionate to salary, which is particularly burdensome for first generation college students and low income students who are often minorities.\n\n2. Students are not exposed to or made aware of pathways into the profession early enough, nor are non-teaching majors aware of potential pathways into the profession.\n\n3. The provisional licensing route is underutilized, and teachers of color who are provisionally licensed in Virginia obtain full licensure at lower rates than their peers.\n\n4. Teaching suffers from declining respect and interest in the profession.\n\nThe task force came up with a list of priority recommendations. It included:\n\nAllowing undergraduate education-based majors in teaching and education\n\nDeveloping a model \"Grow your own\" program for deployment to local school divisions\n\nAnnually convening teachers and teacher candidates of color\n\nImplementing a model teacher induction and mentorship program\n\nCovering/subsidizing the cost of tests and test prep programs for minority and low-income teacher candidates\n\nTravis Holder is licensure manager for Fairfax County Public Schools. He and Cobb presented the suggestions to the governor on behalf of the rest of the task force.\n\n\"I think it was received pretty well,\" he said. \"I'm hopeful that our recommendations will be put into action and we can see some changes over the course of the next couple years.\"\n\nTo learn more about the task force, click here.",

His attack on Syria, as it was (and is) programmed, and if Congress had voted (or does yet vote) in favor of it, would have been or will be no “shot across the bow.” The plan is to “degrade” Syria’s entire military and supporting infrastructure, so as to tip the civil war’s balance — as Baghdad was “degraded” in 2003. It would make the civil war far worse, with thousands more dead, by triggering a rebel offensive, covertly supported by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, to take Damascus (or its ruins).\n\nThis risks instigating a much bigger sectarian war between Sunnis and Shiites, capable of extending to Iraq and Iran, and by way of Iran’s involvement, possibly bringing in Israel. In that case, there could be tens of thousands of “boots on the ground,” among them American boots, notwithstanding airy and irresponsible promises by Obama administration officials.\n\nMr. Putin currently offers Obama the attractive role of a warrior chief whose threats so frightened the world as to force the sequestering and destruction of Syrian chemical weapons. It has brought a wide international and U.N. intervention potentially capable of forcing a settlement conference (“Geneva II”), possibly halting the civil war and its multiple threats to the region. Mr. Putin himself chooses to play the peacemaker. And why not?\n\nAs Russia would have to be one of the guarantors of such a settlement, as the United States would insist on being, and as Russia would also have to stand guarantee for the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons, Moscow would automatically provide Syria with deterrence against Israeli nuclear blackmail and that conventional threat from Israel which the chemical weapons were manufactured to deter. Russia’s enlarged political presence and guarantee of Syria’s neutralization would also secure Lebanon. Both results are highly desirable.\n\nFinally, its presence would implicitly deter Iranian threats to Israel and the Israeli/American threat to Iran, the other smoldering bed of potential war in the Middle East. This would obviously displease Israeli hawks, whose ultimate aim is the elimination of Iran as the most powerful Muslim state in the region, but it might also reassure the Israeli public, lifting their most important security anxiety. It might even lead Israeli (and American) elites to place more value than they do now upon pursuing the ways of peace instead of war. As for the effects upon the Israeli-Palestinian imbroglio, that is a discussion for another day.\n\nAs for the fate of Syria itself, it is worth looking into the past in search of a way to ameliorate the present and future miseries of its people and deal with their communal hatreds. The former French Foreign Minister, Dominique de Villepin, has recently condemned both French and American commitments to military strikes to “punish” President Bashar Assad as a hopelessly misguided and simple-minded (my word, not his) action guaranteed to make things worse.\n\nWhat is a realistic (“realpolitik” is his word) alternative? To recognize that the “Greater Syria” that the Western allies abstracted in 1918, under local pressures, from the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the Levant, put incompatible elements together. There was an Arab Muslim majority, the Alawites (a Muslim sect, some 10 percent of the total population), who under the Assad family have governed the country in recent decades, major Christian communities of great antiquity, a community of Druze (an offshoot of Islam) and a significant Kurd population.\n\nThe allies made what now is Lebanon into a Maronite Christian state (the Maronites are united with Roman Catholicism, and France has considered itself their protectors since the Crusades) but with a Muslim minority that in recent times has become the voting majority, a source of permanent tension.\n\nVillepin argues that it is no longer feasible to maintain Syria in its present borders, and that an at least temporary partition is necessary in which each of these groups can possess an autonomous and secure existence. This would have to be accomplished as a part of a long-proposed but American-blocked peace conference under the auspices of the U.N. It is urgent to exploit the present crisis to find a settlement among the ethnic and religious communities of present-day Syria, as a means to a larger peace.\n\nThere are plenty of people in the Washington foreign policy elite, as well as the Obama administration, who will be horrified at the notion of introducing Russia into the Middle East under international sponsorship. But Russia has already introduced itself into the only presently recognizable solution, if outside military “punishment” and consequent expanded war are to be avoided.\n\nThe Middle East, under the burdens of American military interventions, has since the 1950s suffered heavy-handed and disastrously unsuccessful — indeed destructive, as Iraq today attests — policies of American intervention and vain “democratization.” This cannot continue. The Washington community seems incapable of recognizing this, but the U.S., in this region, has made itself hated and feared. It is incapable of generating generally acceptable geopolitical solutions.\n\nTo use a word popular among Washington’s war-hawks, it no longer has “credibility.”\n\nVisit William Pfaff’s website for more on his latest book, “The Irony of Manifest Destiny: The Tragedy of America’s Foreign Policy” (Walker & Co., $25), at www.williampfaff.com.",

  "latent_20202": "Pope Francis declared his two predecessors John XXIII and John Paul II saints on Sunday before hundreds of thousands of people in St. Peter's Square, an unprecedented ceremony made even more historic by the presence of retired Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nNever before has a reigning and retired pope celebrated Mass together in public, much less at an event honouring two of their most famous predecessors.\n\nBenedict's presence was a reflection of the balancing act that Francis envisioned when he decided to canonize John and John Paul together, showing the unity of the Catholic Church by honouring popes beloved to conservatives and progressives alike.\n\nPope Francis receives the relic of Pope John Paul II from Floribeth Mora, a Costa Rican woman whose inoperable brain aneurysm purportedly disappeared after she prayed to John Paul II, during a ceremony in St. Peter's Square on Sunday. (Alessandra Tarantino/Associated Press)\n\nFrancis took a deep breath and paused for a moment before reciting the saint-making formula in Latin, as if moved by the history he was about to make.\n\nHe said that after deliberating, consulting and praying for divine assistance \"we declare and define Blessed John XXIII and John Paul II be saints and we enrol them among the saints, decreeing that they are to be venerated as such by the whole church.\"\n\nApplause broke out from a crowd that stretched from St. Peter's to the Tiber River and beyond.\n\nBenedict was sitting off to the side of the altar with other cardinals. He had arrived in the square on his own to cheers and applause, wearing white vestments and white bishops' miter. He stood to greet Italy's president and later Francis when he arrived, and sang along during the hymns that followed the canonization rite.\n\nItaly's interior ministry predicted 1 million people would watch the Mass from the square, the streets surrounding it and nearby piazzas where giant TV screens were set up to accommodate the crowds eager to follow along.\n\nBy the time the ceremony began, Via della Conciliazione, the main boulevard leading from the square, nearby streets and the bridges across the Tiber were packed.\n\nPolish pilgrims carrying the red and white flags of John Paul's beloved homeland had been among the first to push into the square well before sunrise, as the human chains of neon-vested civil protection workers trying to maintain order finally gave up and let them in.\n\n\"Four popes in one ceremony is a fantastic thing to see and to be at, because it is history being written in our sight,\" marvelled one of the visiting Poles, David Halfar. \"It is wonderful to be a part in this and to live all of this.\"\n\nCanada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a statement calling John Paul II \"an icon of faith and a defender of the truth about man's dignity and freedom.\"\n\n\"John XXIII came to be known worldwide for his humble leadership, attentive pastoral guidance and concern for the poor. He is especially known for convening the Second Vatican Council in 1961, which marked a significant development in the Catholic Church’s pastoral approach to the modern world,\" Harper said.\n\nMost of those who arrived first at St. Peter's had camped out overnight nearby on air mattresses and sleeping pads. Others hadn't slept at all and took part in the all-night prayer vigils hosted at a dozen churches in downtown Rome.\n\nBy mid-morning, the scene in the square was quiet and subdued — perhaps due to the chilly grey skies and cumulative lack of sleep — unlike the rollicking party atmosphere of John Paul's May 2011 beatification when bands of young people sang and danced in the hours before the Mass.\n\nPrevious Next\n\nBenedict had promised to remain \"hidden from the world\" after resigning last year, but Francis has coaxed him out of retirement and urged him to take part in the public life of the church.\n\nIn a dress rehearsal of sorts, Benedict attended the February ceremony in which Francis installed 19 new cardinals. But celebrating Mass together with Francis was something else entirely, a first for the 2,000-year-old institution and a reflection of Francis' desire to show the continuity in the papacy, despite different personalities, priorities and politics.\n\nPope John XXIII, who reigned from 1958-1963, is a hero to liberal Catholics for having convened the Second Vatican Council. The meetings brought the church into the modern era by allowing Mass to be celebrated in local languages rather than Latin and by encouraging greater dialogue with people of other faiths, particularly Jews.\n\nDuring his quarter-century papacy from 1978-2005, John Paul II helped topple communism through his support of Poland's Solidarity movement. His globe-trotting papacy and launch of the wildly popular World Youth Days invigorated a new generation of Catholics, while his defence of core church teaching heartened conservatives after the turbulent 1960s.\n\n\"John Paul was our pope,\" said Therese Andjoua, a 49-year-old nurse who travelled from Libreville, Gabon, with some 300 other pilgrims to attend. She sported a traditional African dress bearing the images of the two new saints.\n\n\"In 1982 he came to Gabon and when he arrived he kissed the ground and told us to `Get up, go forward and be not afraid,\"' she recalled as she rested against a pallet of water bottles. \"When we heard he was going to be canonized, we got up.\"\n\nKings, queens, presidents and prime ministers from more than 90 countries attended. Some 20 Jewish leaders from the U.S., Israel, Italy, Francis' native Argentina and Poland were also taking part, in a clear sign of their appreciation for the great strides made in Catholic-Jewish relations under John, John Paul — and their successors celebrating their sainthood.",
  "latent_20269": "At pastors’ briefing, Senator Lois Kolkhorst calls her filing of the bathroom bill a ‘spiritual’ decision.\n\nOn the eve of a committee hearing on his anti-transgender bathroom bill, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick compared the fight for passage of the measure to the Battle of the Alamo.\n\nPatrick made the comments during a Monday briefing for pastors hosted by the Family Research Council, an anti-LGBT hate group, at the headquarters of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a corporate-funded right-wing think tank.\n\nAddressing the bathroom bill, Senate Bill 6, Patrick called on pastors to “go out and win this fight for America.” He added that “a strong America depends on a strong Texas,” and said SB 6 is about “Texas values.”\n\n“Today, on this day, 189 people sacrificed their lives at the Alamo because they believed in something,” Patrick said, referring to the pivotal battle that ended on this day, March 6, in 1836.\n\n“We’re not asked to give our lives. We’re not asked to grab our guns. We’re just asked to go cast courageous votes,” Patrick said. “And in the Senate, thank God, I think we have the votes to get out of committee and get off the Senate floor, but we have to get it all the way to the governor’s desk.”\n\nAt 8 a.m. Tuesday, the Senate Committee on State Affairs will hold the first hearing on SB 6. Though SB 6 is widely expected to pass the Senate, its fate is uncertain in the House.\n\nPatrick addressed the pastors shortly after speaking at a news conference on SB 6, where he unveiled “Operation One Million Voices” — a campaign in support of the measure that he said will rely on churches across the state.\n\nThe news conference and pastors’ briefing also coincided with Transgender Lobby Day, which drew hundreds of SB 6 opponents to the Capitol.\n\nLou Weaver of Equality Texas said 350 people registered for the lobby day, up from about 75 two years ago, and many participants were expected to testify against the bill on Tuesday.\n\n“There’s a huge effort to make sure stories are being told, human and real-life stories,” Weaver said.\n\nMeanwhile, organizers of the pastors’ briefing, which will continue Tuesday, encouraged the hundreds of attendees to testify in support of SB 6.\n\nPatrick was joined at the pastors’ briefing by Senator Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, the author of the bill. Kolkhorst told pastors that Patrick asked her to carry SB 6 on either August 31 or September 1.\n\n“Without praying, I just said yes,’” Kolkhorst said. “And then later on I said, ‘Oh Lord, did I just take it and I didn’t pray?’ But it was so spiritual, it was just like, so yes.”\n\nAs the legislative session approached, Kolkhorst said she began to “feel the pushback” and “feel the battle” from SB 6 opponents.\n\n“I just didn’t know if I was prepared for it,” Kolkhorst said, crediting three pastor friends with helping her through the struggle.\n\n“They came over to my house, and I’m telling you that we prayed, and we brought the holy spirit so strong into that room,” Kolkhorst said. “I’ve passed big bills before, and I’ve always asked the Lord to help me, because I believe that this country is founded on Judeo-Christian values. We will only remain this kind of country with God.”\n\nSenator Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, asked the pastors to pray for Kolkhorst, which they later did before she spoke.\n\n“She has been taking a lot of slings and arrows from a lot of liberal media,” said Bettencourt, a co-author of SB 6.\n\n“Senator Kolkhorst is one of our pure warriors, one of our best spear-carriers, but she has endured quite a bit in the last month or two,” he added.\n\nAlso present were Senator Bryan Hughes, R-Mineola, Senator Eddie Lucio, D-Brownsville, and North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest. Hughes and Lucio are members of the State Affairs Committee, and during Monday’s news conference, Lucio became the first Democrat to endorse SB 6.\n\nForest called the controversy over House Bill 2, a similar law in North Carolina, “by far the toughest spiritual battle of my life.”\n\n“You have some brave warriors up on stage,” Forest said, referring to Patrick and Kolkhorst. “There’s no way that anybody in this audience can understand the dark days that they go through, that they will be going through.”\n\nForest said he told Kolkhorst earlier in the day that he prays for joy for her, since they are both “on the side of the God of the universe.”\n\n“Right now in America, really what we see is a battle for western civilization,” Forest said, calling the legalization of same-sex marriage “a starting point for what’s going on.”\n\n“Now we’re attacking, ‘Did God really create us male and female?’” Forest said. “It’s blurring the lines of God’s most basic creation.”",

Henderson wants to fight the winner, and he thinks it will be Jones.“I think obviously Jon Jones is probably the favorite in that one,” Henderson told the Sherdog Radio Network’s “Savage Dog Show.” “With his style and his wrestling ability, he should be able to control the fight well. Lyoto likes to stay on the outside, and I think that’s probably not the opponent to do it against.”Still, Henderson does give Machida a chance in the fight.“Lyoto’s real quick and he’s a little bit goofy,” Henderson said. “He’s got a nice straight left hand. He definitely could catch Jon Jones. I don’t think Jon Jones’ chin has really been tested much because he is hard to hit. Anything can happen in a fight, but I definitely see Jones picking him apart from the outside and probably taking him down and beating him up.”Henderson likes his own chances against Jones much better. He’s complimentary of Jones’ talent, but he also questions his experience.“I think I’m a tough fight for anybody,” Henderson said. “If you’re in a fight with me, you’re definitely going to know you’re in a fight. I don’t know if really Jon Jones has felt that too much in his career. I definitely would test that out. I think style-wise I match up real well with him.”Of course, there’s no guarantee that Henderson will get the next shot. Rashad Evans is also in the mix. He was rumored to be fighting Jones on Dec. 10 before it was revealed that his hand was injured and Machida would get the shot instead.“It’s unfortunate that Rashad got hurt, but you know, it’s happened twice now,” Henderson said. “He’s had people step in. … All I know is, if I have to, I’ll pull out the age card and just say I should have seniority here. I’m getting older. Rashad’s got a little more time than I do.”Although Henderson might joke about his age, the 41-year-old is serious about winning a UFC belt before he retires. He figures he has two or three years left to fight and he wants to go out a champion.“That’s pretty much one of the last things I’ve got on my list for my career,” Henderson said, “to get a UFC title and keep it for a little while.”",

  "latent_20622": "LBC now traded on the fastest, safest digital asset exchange in the world.\n\nAs of today, LBRY Credits (LBC) are now available for exchange with other digital assets on ShapeShift.io. Using the groundbreaking service, anyone can exchange their preferred digital currency for LBRY Credits (LBC) instantly with no account, no emails, and no passwords.\n\nShapeShift founder and CEO Erik Voorhees commented on the announcement:\n\n“The world is improved by the existence of LBRY – an innovative method of content dissemination – and we’re honored to add it to ShapeShift. I’ve been watching the LBRY project for months, and am thrilled to make it instantly available for trading with all other leading digital assets.”\n\nFollowing the July 4th launch of LBRY’s beta and live blockchain, LBRY Credits have been listed on both the well-known Bittrex and Poloniex exchanges. This gave cryptocoin markets global access to LBC. As a result, the appcoin’s value has gone from essentially nothing to today’s trading price of about US$0.26. On top of that, the hashrate of the LBRY blockchain grew by 693,000% in the first 10 days after the launch of beta, and another 2X since then – to about 1.7 TH/s today.\n\nListing on ShapeShift is expected to bring additional depth and liquidity to LBC. ShapeShift is widely considered the most convenient digital asset exchange, and it also expands the potential of LBRY through its application programming interfaces (APIs). These will allow any developer to integrate LBC into third-party wallets and software platforms that are primarily designed around Bitcoin.\n\nWhile this is big news for LBC as a digital asset, it also has a bearing on LBRY’s core purpose to enable content creators to connect with their fans.\n\nOne of LBRY’s hurdles to mainstream acceptance – a barrier the founders have anticipated from the beginning – is making LBC a handy method of payment. You’re a brilliant filmmaker who has just released his feature-length film on LBRY, and it’s a hit! The LBC are flowing into your wallet. Now what do you do with them?\n\nWith ShapeShift, anyone who holds LBC will be able to quickly and securely exchange them for another cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. From there, creators can spend them anywhere Bitcoin is accepted – including Overstock, Amazon (via Purse), Gyft, Expedia, and a rapidly increasing number of brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nAnd that process works in reverse.

  "latent_20673": "Three years ago, when Gustavo Brey took over IT for the social and health services government agency in Argentina, he inherited development and operations teams that did not like working together, and it showed. Each time a deployment went wrong (which Brey says happened 80 percent of the time), each team would point fingers at the other team instead of trying to solve the problem.\n\nWe talked to Brey, IT Manager for Instituto Nacional de Servicios Sociales para Jubilados y Pensionados, about what he did to turn things around (these days 90 percent of deployments are a success). Here’s what he said:\n\nThe Enterprisers Project (TEP): How were the development and operations teams working together before you moved to a DevOps model?\n\nWhen I started here, I felt like there was a war between the two teams. Every time there was a problem, one side pointed to the other instead of trying to get the problem fixed. They weren’t even taking time to see what caused the problem.All of the developers used to test their code in a different environment. And when this code has to move to production or test environment, they couldn’t make it work because they were using different versions of libraries. So the first thing we did was to standardized the environment. We provided each developer with a localized environment that was the same version of libraries and version of the middleware as the infrastructure environment.Another problem we had was that the deployment process of every application was failing. We have around 100 deploys per week and 80 percent of those deploys had a problem. Every time we had a deployment, I had to pray it would be OK. So two years ago we automated deployment. We started implementing Jenkins, which is an open source tool we use for deployment. We started moving all the deployment process in an automated fashion.Every time there was a problem in production, we were always alerted by users. We never knew something was wrong unless we had a call or a web form. Every time we found a problem, the two teams started saying that the other team was responsible. Those were the main problems we had at that time.We started a DevOps meeting every Monday morning where we have people from DevOps teams discuss the plan of the week. After that meeting we have an architectural meeting and we decide all the policies and practices. We plan the week and the next month in terms of new applications and how we are going to architect them. Since starting the meetings, standardizing the environments, and automating the deployment process with a ticketing tool, we’ve gone from 80 percent of our deployments having a problem to 90 percent of deployments being a success.As we tackle these things, both teams have a better relationship. They don’t fight anymore. They communicate. Developers always see operations as lazy. And operations always think developers will break the build. And that won’t change. But if you can have tools to bring them to the table so that they don’t have any regret or any shame, it makes it easier for them to communicate. And for me in my role, I no longer need to know if there is a deployment or not. We have thousands of commits per day. We have about 30 deploys per day. Most of the deploys are automated. All the developers have the chance to deploy their code on a different environment except for production because our standards don’t let the developer deploy to production. But the procedure we use to deploy in development and QA and production is the same, the difference is who approves it. That gives me more time.Instead of looking at the problem that is happening today, we have time to look at new things or to look at the new DevOps or infrastructure or architectural changes I want to make. We are looking at Docker and OpenStack. We want to move forward to create some sort of a path to make the operations side web-based. I don’t think we need developers talking too much to operators. They have to provision all the infrastructure they need as a service. But we have to work on the most important things at the very beginning.\n\nALSO READ\n\nGustavo Brey is an Information Systems Engineer graduated from the National Technological University (UTN), with over 15 years of experience in IT in different industries, holding varied positions.

  "latent_20720": "The UN has taken the rare step of invoking its legal immunity to rebuff claims for compensation from 5,000 victims of the Haiti cholera epidemic, the worst outbreak of the disease in modern times and widely believed to have been caused by UN peacekeepers importing the infection into the country.\n\nCiting a convention laid down in 1946, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, telephoned President Michel Martelly of Haiti to tell him that the UN was not willing to compensate any of the claimants. The epidemic has killed almost 8,000 people and stricken hundreds of thousands more – about one out of every 16 Haitians.\n\nFor the UN to claim immunity for a crisis that most experts are convinced it unwittingly caused through its own disaster relief mission is highly contentious. The infection is thought to have been carried into Haiti by UN peacekeepers from Nepal sent to help with disaster relief following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.\n\nBan's spokesperson issued a carefully worded statement that pointedly did not accept or deny liability for the epidemic. But the statement made clear that the UN would not countenance the compensation claims, invoking its immunity from such legal disputes under section 29 of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the UN.\n\nThe convention was one of the first treaties passed by the UN at its inception in 1946. In it, the UN grants to itself legal protections in the countries in which it operates, while section 29 extends that immunity to any UN worker operating in an official capacity.\n\nThis is not the first time that the UN has invoked its own immunity, but it is a highly unusual move made more controversial by the extreme distress in Haiti to which it relates. Sensitivities are running high within the UN headquarters in New York.\n\nThe suit for compensation was brought in November 2011 by the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti (IJDH), a group of lawyers based in Boston. It sought to require the UN to install a national water and sanitation system to control the epidemic, pay compensation to victims for their losses, and make a public apology for its \"wrongful acts\".\n\nNicole Philips, speaking in IJDH's office in Haiti, gave a jaundiced reaction to the announcement, saying they were \"not surprised by this at all. It's all very political\". She said almost three times as many people had died in the continuing crisis as in the terrorist attacks of 9/11.\n\n\"If this had been a corporation, and if it had been an environmental spill, there would have been liability,\" Philips said.\n\nMario Joseph, the lead counsel for the 5,000 victims on whose behalf IJDH filed the lawsuit, plans to travel from Port-au-Prince to the worst-affected Artibonite department to pass on news of Thursday's UN statement.\n\n\"The United Nations can't have humanity and impunity at the same time. [The victims] still do not know what the UN has said, as they live in the countryside, but I know that they will want us to fight for justice from the UN.\"\n\nAlix MacGuffie, 42, who lives in the coastal port town of Saint Marc in western Haiti's worst-affected Artibonite department, got cholera in July 2011. Speaking on the phone, he responded to news of the UN's decision. \"I could have died from cholera. The UN caused us much harm and we should get compensation. If we don't stop cholera, what will happen in the future?\"\n\nMaximilien Saint Juste, 29, an electrician at a hospital in Saint Marc, said he was treated for cholera in November 2011 at the very hospital at which he works and though he is better now, he faces \"discrimination\" for having had the disease. \"I think every victim should get compensation. The UN hasn't taken responsibility for the fact that they brought cholera to Haiti. Many people died from cholera and many of us suffer discrimination. A lot of people think that cholera cannot be treated entirely; they believe that cholera always sticks in your blood cells.\"\n\nCholera broke out in Haiti in Octo­ber 2010. Since then there has been substantial medical research, including full genome sequencing on the strain of cholera found in Haiti, which identified UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the source of the disease.\n\nIn October 2012, two years after the outbreak, a leading US cholera specialist, Dr Daniele Lantagne, said, \"that the most likely source of the introduction of cholera into Haiti was someone infected with the Nepal strain of cholera and associated with the UN Mirebalais camp.\" She said \"that the strain of cholera in Haiti is an exact match for the strain of cholera in Nepal.\"\n\nThe UN has accepted that inadequate sanitation at its barracks in Mirebalais, 60km north-east of the capital, Port-au-Prince, might have been a possible source of the bacterium. But it has doggedly refused to accept liability, insisting that the source of the cholera remains unclear and that the epidemic was caused by a \"confluence of circumstances\" that included problems with water, sanitation and public health.\n\nWhile rebuffing the compensation claims, the UN has vowed to continue its efforts to contain the epidemic. So far the UN has spent $118m on medical equipment, health networks, water and sewerage improvements, health education at schools and other programmes designed to stem the crisis.\n\nIn December, Ban launched an initiative to eliminate the infection, and a new oral vaccination campaign is in the offing.",

  "latent_21376": "The Orbital Sciences Corporation Antares rocket, with the Cygnus spacecraft onboard suffers a catastrophic anomaly moments after launch from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport Pad 0A, Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2014, at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia.\n\nThe private American rocket that exploded shortly after liftoff Tuesday evening (Oct. 28) was powered partly by an engine built to get cosmonauts to the moon in the 1960s.\n\nOrbital Sciences Corp.'s two-stage Antares rocket crashed in a fiery heap just seconds after launching from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia on Tuesday, ending an attempted cargo run to the International Space Station just seconds after it began.\n\nAntares' first stage uses two AJ26 engines, which are refurbished variants of the NK-33 built by the Soviet Union for its ill-fated N-1 moon rocket during the height of the space race. While it's unclear at the moment whether or not the AJ26 played any role in Tuesday's mishap, the engines' age and provenance has already stirred debate, as well as a bit of criticism. [Orbital Sciences' Antares Rocket Explosion in Pictures]\n\nAn AJ26 engine is placed in a test stand at NASA's Stennis Space Center. (Image: © NASA)\n\nHow Orbital Sciences' Antares rocket and Cygnus spacecraft service the space station. See how Orbital's Cygnus spacecraft and Antares rockets works in this infographic. (Image: © Karl Tate, SPACE.com Infographics Artist)\n\nSome of the criticism long predates this week's accident. In 2012, for example, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said Antares \"honestly sounds like the punch line to a joke.\"\n\n\"It uses Russian rocket engines that were made in the '60s,\" Musk told Wired magazine back then. \"I don’t mean their design is from the '60s — I mean they start with engines that were literally made in the '60s and, like, packed away in Siberia somewhere.\"\n\nSpaceX and Orbital Sciences are competitors; both companies hold billion-dollar contracts to fly robotic cargo missions to the space station for NASA. To date, SpaceX has successfully completed four supply runs using its Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 rocket. Orbital had executed two such missions with Antares and its Cygnus spacecraft before Tuesday's failure.\n\nThe massive N-1 moon rocket — the Soviet Union's attempted answer to NASA's huge Saturn V booster — lifted off four times, with the first launch coming in 1969 and the last in 1972. All of the launches ended in failure, and the N-1 program was canceled in the mid-1970s. But dozens of NK-33 engines remained in the nation's stockpile.\n\nThe California-based company Aerojet (now Aerojet-Rocketdyne) later bought some of these engines, then modernized, refurbished and renamed them to fly in American rockets.\n\nThe appeal of of the NK-33/AJ26 is clear, said Orbital Sciences executive vice president Frank Culbertson, a former NASA astronaut.\n\n\"There are not very many other options around the world in terms of using power plants of this size, and certainly not in this country, unfortunately,\" Culbertson said Tuesday night during a press conference after the Antares crash.\n\nAJ26 engines are rugged and robust, he added, and they're tested extensively before flight, both at NASA's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi and, after incorporation into Antares, at Wallops.\n\n\"These engines were taken through the normal testing — acceptance testing and pressure testing, et cetera,\" Culbertson said of the AJ26s inside the Antares that exploded Tuesday. \"We didn't see any anomalies or anything that would indicate that there were problems with the engine.\"\n\nAn AJ26 engine did explode during a test at Stennis in May, however. The engineers investigating Tuesday's Antares failure are doubtless looking back at that mishap with fresh eyes now.\n\nAntares isn't the only American rocket that incorporates Soviet or Russian tech. For example, United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 booster, which launches many payloads for the U.S. military and NASA, uses a Russian RD-180 engine in its first stage.\n\nRD-180s are of much more recent vintage than the old NK-33s. Regardless, their provenance makes some policymakers, military officials and other influential people uncomfortable. The United States should not be dependent on Russian technology to launch important national-security missions, they say.\n\nFollow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+.

  "latent_21654": "Features\n\nOur growing addiction to prescription painkillers\n\nby Bianca Nogrady\n\nPrescription painkillers are some of the most commonly misused drugs in Australia. So why are doctors prescribing these medications in increasing numbers? And how can people with chronic pain safely use prescription opioids?\n\n[Image source: iStockPhoto | milanfoto ]\n\nWhen talking about the problems of illicit drug use in Australia, conversations will tend to focus on ice, heroin, ecstasy and similar drugs.\n\nBut one class of drugs rarely gets a mention, despite the fact that it's now overtaking heroin as the cause of calls to drug treatment services. Perhaps that's because there's a good chance you've tried it, and a very good chance that your doctor prescribed it to you.\n\nPrescription pain-relieving opioids, such as morphine and oxycodone, are fast becoming the top drugs of misuse in Australia. For example, one Victorian alcohol and drug counselling helpline now receives more than twice as many calls about prescription opioids as they do about heroin.\n\nAt the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre, more than three times as many visits each month are for the injection of crushed opioid tablets when compared to heroin.\n\nPrescription opioids are not only an issue in Australia. In the United States, prescription opioids have earned the nickname 'hillbilly heroin', and their public health impact is now being likened to that of diabetes.\n\nNo typical user\n\nThere is no typical user, or typical scenario for prescription opioid misuse, although most people seeking help for prescription opioid addiction have been prescribed medication for pain relief, says Dr Matthew Frei, clinical director of Victoria's Turning Point Alcohol and Drug Centre.\n\n\"There's a spectrum of aberrance or dysfunction or problems associated with the medications,\" says Frei.\n\n\"They range from gradual dose escalation to a dose that is causing some discomfort either for the patients, their doctor, and/or the regulators; to people who are really dysfunctional and might be attempting to get the medications from multiple doctors, they might be purchasing medications on grey or black markets, and even in severe cases, injecting, selling or trading the medication.\"\n\nFrei says most people seeking treatment for prescription opioid addiction were originally prescribed the medication  as opposed to those who have come by the medication through illicit means  which highlights a major part of the problem with opioids, and the reason why we now find ourselves in this epidemic of misuse.\n\nPrescription rates skyrocket\n\nOpioid prescriptions have increased dramatically in the past two decades. The supply of oxycodone increased from 95.1kg in 1999 to 1270.7kg in 2008, and prescriptions increased 20.1 per cent from 2005-06 to 2006-07 alone.\n\nThe picture is the same for morphine. One study reported a 89 per cent increase in the rate of morphine prescription per person between 1995 and 2003.\n\nThis begs the question of why so many more prescription opioids are being used. Emergency medicine specialist Dr David Caldicott from Canberra's Calvary Hospital says there is a clear pattern of overprescribing, and inappropriate prescribing, of opioids in Australia, and some of that is being driven by patients themselves.\n\n\"I think there is perhaps an expectation or sense that pain from whatever painful condition can be obliterated, and that may be contributing to the overprescription of these drugs,\" Caldicott says.\n\nDoctors are also under increasing pressure to dispense quick solutions.\n\n\"In an increasingly time-poor medical environment  where to get optimal pain relief you want to sit them down, tell people what exercises to go through, what other non-pharmaceutical tricks they could use to minimise their pain  it is very tempting just to give them a pack of pills and send them on their way,\" he says.\n\nMore harm than good\n\nHowever in many cases, this pack of pills is likely to do far more harm than good. One particular issue is that it's possible to become tolerant of the effects of these drugs, and therefore require higher and higher doses to achieve the same effects.\n\nAnother problem is that opioids, like all pharmaceuticals, come with side effects, and the one causing the most problems is its impact on our respiratory system. In some situations, this can be deadly.\n\n\"If you have a background of chronic respiratory disease and you are just on the edge of surviving as far as your breathing is concerned, and you broke your leg, and somebody got the dosing too enthusiastically then there could be a problem,\" Caldicott says.\n\n\"If you are taking any other medications that cause respiratory depression, they can accentuate the effects, and there are plenty of ways where a fairly normal dose for a 25-year-old 80 kilogram man could really knock a 50 kilogram 75-year-old off their perch.\"\n\nPrescription opioids are also featuring more prominently than ever before in the overdose figures, according to Professor Louisa Degenhardt, professor of epidemiology at the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at the University of New South Wales.\n\n\"Heroin is still the most common [cause of overdose] of any single opioid; it accounts for about 30 per cent of overdoses, but it used to account for 70 per cent of opioid overdoses, so pharmaceutical opioids are now comprising the remaining 70 per cent,\" Degenhardt says.\n\nFigures from Victoria showed that the detection of oxycodone in deaths reported to the Victorian Coroner increased 21-fold from 2000 to 2009.\n\nWhile overdoses in older patients with pain are thought to be largely deliberate, overdoses in younger individuals generally occur among injecting drug users, who often crush the tablets to snort or inject them.\n\n\"Often tablets have a controlled release mechanism so when you swallow it, it gives you less of a high and more of a sustained level of coverage of pain,\" Degenhardt says.\n\n\"But when you tamper with a tablet, that mechanism is overcome so basically you get the whole dose at once.\"\n\nIn response to this kind of misuse, drug manufacturers are reformulating the tablets to make them harder to tamper with.\n\nHow useful are these medications?\n\nThere are also serious questions about whether opioids such as oxycodone and morphine do actually help in the case of long-term, chronic, non-cancer pain, says pain medicine specialist Professor Milton Cohen from Sydney's St Vincents Hospital.\n\n\"The more liberal prescription [of opiods] reflects the better recognition of the problem of chronic non-cancer pain in particular and the desire to do something more about it, although to rely on medications alone in that context is not going to work,\" Cohen says.\n\nChronic non-cancer pain  and indeed pain generally  is still relatively poorly understood, he says, and is under-represented in medical education, largely because of its complexity.\n\n\"Chronic pain is not a reliable guide to a body disease, so it's hard for medicines to come to grips with.\"\n\nFor example chronic back pain, a scenario that would often lead to the prescription of opioids, is often not due to a clear and treatable disease; it often presents in people who have other medical problems, including a history of psychological illness.\n\n\"It's a much more complex phenomenon than just 'something is wrong with your back', and the reliance on using medications to treat that, often in a multiple-medication situation, has led to the problem,\" Cohen says.\n\n\"When somebody says 'my pain is getting worse', often what they mean is 'my life is getting worse'.\"\n\nAddiction medicine physician Professor Yvonne Bonomo from St Vincents Hospital in Melbourne says people may not even realise they are becoming addicted to their opioid pain relief.\n\n\"Some are on prescription opioids and don't realise they are becoming dependent, then suddenly their supply runs out and their doctor is not prepared to prescribe anymore, or they go into hospital for something else and stop their medications and experience withdrawal syndrome,\" she says.\n\nOne solution to avoiding this is to have a clear plan from the beginning about how long someone is going to be taking opioids, Bonomo says.\n\n\"Having an end date in mind when you start is very important,\" she says.\n\n\"There are guidelines around longer term use now and so doctors are being educated about that but really the bottom line is before you start the opioids you have a plan for how long approximately you plan to provide this medication, how long you think it will be needed, and what other aspects of pain management are going to take place.\"",
  "latent_21702": "Alan Moore and Brian Bolland ’s classic and controversial Batman: The Killing Joke is making waves once again after the the animated adaptation debuted at San Diego Comic Con and reportedly doubled down on the damseling and objectification of Batgirl . Without spoiling the changes ( you can read about them here ), Barbara Gordon’s reliance on men’s approval is a big theme of the film, and only serves to give Batman more angst when the events of the comic play out.\n\nFans of The Killing Joke will often defend it by pointing out that without the story, Barbara Gordon would not have become Oracle , the Batman family’s computer whiz and one of the most prominent disabled superheroes in comic books. However, crediting The Killing Joke for the creation of Oracle is wholly inaccurate and does a disservice to the true creators of the reinvention, John Ostrander and Kim Yale .\n\n(Note: This article contains some language that readers may find upsetting.)\n\nThe reinvention of Barbara Gordon as Oracle is often attributed to Moore and Bolland, and as such the trauma and objectification she endures in The Killing Joke are seen as justified. According this argument, Oracle was the end goal, and Killing Joke should be lauded for everything that happened to Barbara Gordon afterwards.\n\nBrian Bolland\n\nThat couldn’t be further from the truth, and Alan Moore has gone record saying that Baraba’s trauma was an afterthought. Quite famously, he approached his editor Len Wein with the idea, seeking approval, and Wein responded with “Yeah, okay, cripple the bitch”.\n\nBrian Cronin’s A (Perhaps Unnecessary) Guide to Oracle’s Formative Years goes into more detail about the timeline of Barbara Gordon’s transformation into Oracle, and with one quote from John Ostrander, proves itself to indeed be very necessary.\n\n“There were no plans for her in the continuity at that time. We decided that if that happened, we weren’t just going to make her better magically — we wanted to explore what happened when someone like her was crippled and how she would respond.”\n\nBy the time The Killing Joke happened, Barbara Gordon had retired as Batgirl and was living a peaceful civilian life. She was revived by Moore and Bolland solely to be assaulted --- grievously and sexually --- by The Joker , all as part of his effort to get to her father and, by extension, Batman.\n\nThere is a concept called the \"Sexy Lamp test,\" coined by writer Kelly Sue DeConnick, that says If you can take out a female character out of a story and replace her with a sexy lamp you are, to quote DeConnick, \"a f------ hack!”.\n\nSo let’s apply that to The Killing Joke . Barbara Gordon is nothing more than a sexy lamp to Commissioner Gordon and Batman, an object that they like a lot, which The Joker can exploit to hurt them. At the end of the story, no-one cares about the lamp or its future.\n\nLuke McDonnell & Geof Isherwood\n\nIt took John Ostrander and Kim Yale to reintroduce Barbara Gordon as the computer savvy hacker Oracle in the pages of Suicide Squad , giving the character new purpose and showing that disabled people aren’t broken, and they certainly aren’t disposable.\n\nAs a member of the Suicide Squad, Barbara proved that people with disabilities can be superheroes too, and the character had enough support from the likes of Barbara Kesel , Denny O’Neil and Chuck Dixon to survive the end of Suicide Squad and become one of the most iconic DC characters of the '90s.\n\nThe Killing Joke is a classic comic, but it can still be criticized for its misogynistic treatment of the one female character in the comic. When you give credit to Alan Moore and Brian Bolland for starting Barbara Gordon on the path to becoming Oracle, you’re not only wrong, but you diminish the legacy of two of the most underrated creators of that era.",

A post says that Hughes, 51, had liver cirrhosis and was rushed to the Whittington Hospital during the night and suffered a cardiac arrest.\n\nHughes was a pioneering stand-up and one of the youngest comedians ever to win the prestigious Perrier Award. He won it in 1990 with A One Night Stand With Sean Hughes. From there he went on to receive critical acclaim for his C4 sitcom Sean's Show and was best known as team captain on Never Mind The Buzzcocks.\n\nHis former promoter Richard Bucknall paid tribute to Hughes: \"He was a pioneering, groundbreaking comedian who changed comedy with that live show.\"\n\nThe show marked a turning point in the evolution of long-form stand-up, adding a narrative where previously Edinburgh shows had essentially been an extended club stand-up set. Hughes' Perrier-winning show was set in his bedsit where the lovelorn Morrissey fan was waiting by the telephone for a call. With his references to indie music, The Smiths and pop culture, Hughes was quickly embraced by the music press as well as the comedy world.\n\nNica Burns, the director of the Edinburgh Comedy Awards (formerly the Perrier, now sponsored by lastminute.com said: \"Sean Hughes was the youngest comic at 24, to win Britain's top comedy award in 1990 He was a huge talent, a really good comic, instinctive timing from day one and a very good writer.

  "latent_21859": "Most Linux users that employ Solid State Drives (SSDs) build their systems with the smaller SSDs holding the operating system and the larger, slower, much cheaper HDD drives holding their data. When you're trying to create the fastest system possible, though, you want to get that data drive up to the speeds of your far-faster SSD. Problem is, very large SSDs can be cost-prohibitive. So, what can you do? With the help of bcache, you can use a smaller SSD as a caching drive for the larger, slower HDD. With this set up, you have the best of both worlds.\n\nA lightning fast SSD housing your operating system.\n\nA bcache-enabled SSD that caches for your large HDD data drive.\n\nAs of kernel 3.10, bcache is available with minimal installation and work. I will walk you through the process of getting the bcache data “drive” up and running (assuming you already have a working Linux system running on your faster SSD drive).\n\nAlthough you can set this up on an existing system (with existing data), I highly recommend you not do so. The chance of losing data is high, so let's start out with a fresh SSD (for caching) and a fresh HDD (for storage – or “backing”).\n\nI am going to illustrate this process using a working installation of Ubuntu 13.10, with a smaller SSD drive (an inexpensive 60 GB drive will work fine) and a much larger HDD drive (as large as necessary) for backing. Let's begin.\n\nInstall the tools\n\nThe first thing you must do is install bcache-tools. This is the tool that will create and register the block devices to work with bcache. To install bcache-tools you must first add the repository. This is done with the following commands:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:g2p/storage\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install bcache-tools\n\nCreate and register the devices\n\nBefore you set about creating your bcache devices, format both drives to the ext4 file system (I prefer using Gparted for this). Once the devices are formatted, you can create and register the devices with the help of bcache-tools. Let's say the caching device (SSD) is located at /dev/sdc and the backing device (HDD) is located at /dev/sdb. First, create the backing device with the command:\n\nsudo make-bcache -B /dev/sdb1\n\nNow, create the caching device with the command:\n\nsudo make-bcache -C /dev/sdc1\n\nIf you get an error that there are already non-bcache superblocks on the device(s), you have to remove those errors with the wipefs command, as such:\n\nsudo wipefs -a /dev/sdb1\n\nYou might have to do that for both the caching and backing devices.\n\nWith distributions that use udev (such as Ubuntu), you can skip the next two steps. If your distribution doesn't use udev, you have to register the devices with the kernel. We'll do those one at a time with the commands:\n\nsudo echo /dev/sdb1 > /sys/fs/bcache/register\n\nsudo echo /dev/sdc1 > /sys/fs/bcache/register\n\nOnce the backing device is registered, it will show up in /dev in the form of /dev/bcacheX (Where X is a number – such as /dev/bcache0). The registering can either be done manually (you'd have to re-register each time you reboot), or you can set it for auto-register with an init script. The contents of that init script would need to be:\n\necho /dev/sd* > /sys/fs/bcache/register_quiet\n\nThis will look for and register bcache superblocks and ignore everything else.\n\nNow it's time to mount the newly created file system. This is done with the mount command:\n\nsudo mount /dev/bcacheX /path/to/mount/point\n\nWhere X is the device to be mounted (most likely bcache0) and /path/to/mount/point is the actual path you want to mount the device to. For example, you could create a DATA folder on / and then mount bcache0 there:\n\nmount /dev/bcache0 /DATA\n\nNOTE: Make sure the user that will want to write data to the caching device has permission to write to the DATA directory.\n\nAt this point, the cache set will show up in /sys/fs/bcache/ as a UUID (a UUID will be a long string of characters). You will need that UUID for the next command.\n\nAttach the devices\n\nThe devices are now created and registered. You now have to attach the caching and backing devices to enable the caching feature. Here you will need the UUID (a long string of characters) found in /sys/fs/bcache/ (enter the command: ls /sys/fs/bcache and you'll see the UUID). To attach the devices, you simply use the echo command to add the UUID to the attach file in /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/. The command is:\n\necho UUID > /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/attach\n\nWhere UUID is the actual UUID found in /sys/fs/bcache.\n\nYour bcache system is now ready to use. Simply write your data to the /DATA directory (see photo, below) and you should enjoy much faster data writes.\n\nTo check to see if the caching is working, open up a terminal window and issue the command:\n\ntail /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/stats_total/*\n\nEnable writeback caching\n\nBy default, bcache uses writethrough caching. With writethrough, only reads are cached and writes are written directly to the backing drive. You can gain some serious speed by enabling writeback caching. Be warned, however, this is not nearly as reliable as the writethrough mode. You can lose data should there be a power outtage or if the SSD fails. But if you long for that extra bump of speed, you can enable writeback caching by issuing the following command:\n\necho writeback > /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/cache_mode\n\nAgain, I will caution you that using writeback mode is not as reliable as writethrough.\n\nIf you're looking for a way to squeeze as much speed from your machines as possible, bcache might be exactly what you need. With the right hardware, and just a little time, you can get those older, slower HDD drives writing data as if they were solid state drives. But do remember, always back up your data before you attempt any work of this nature.\n\nEditor's Note: For more on bcache, read Linux.com's recent article All About the Linux Kernel: Bcache, or see the bcache documentation and a full list of bcache features and performance notes.",
  "latent_22059": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nDeclaring that it is “passionate” about the safety of young drivers, Ford is sponsoring clinics at US high schools, urging teens to heed traffic laws and avoid distractions behind the wheel. The auto giant, as part of its “Driving Skills for Life” program, also recently awarded $25,000 to students who created the best music video about the hazards of distracted driving.\n\nBMW, likewise, has launched “Don’t Txt & Drive,” a series of ads dramatizing the risks of distracted driving. And the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry trade group, is teaming with the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons on a similar campaign.\n\nWith efforts like these, automakers are positioning themselves as leaders in the fight against distracted driving, a problem federal authorities estimate caused 5,474 deaths in 2009—including 995 from using cell phones. Yet even as they urge drivers to focus on the road, these same companies are packing their new models with cutting-edge infotainment systems that encourage drivers to multitask.\n\nFord’s SYNC system, for instance, let drivers use voice commands and touch screens to make and receive calls, listen to texts, and choose from a menu of replies. BMW’s Connected Drive provides calling, email, and text read-backs, displaying email subject lines on a screen. General Motors struts its stuff in this 30-second Super Bowl spot, which features a young Chevy owner checking his first date’s Facebook status.\n\nAuto execs are counting heavily on these arresting high-tech features to boost sales to the young and the hip. David Mondragon, president of Ford Canada, put it bluntly. “The biggest turnoff to a twentysomething consumer is to put their life on hold when they sit in a car,” he said in a speech to the Canadian Marketing Association, according to an account in the Globe and Mail.\n\n“And what does it mean to put their life on hold?” Mondragon continued. “To get disconnected when they get in the car, to have a system that will not allow you to sit there and email, read your BlackBerry, talk on the phone. So you have to have a seamless transition from your home to your transportation device, to your workspace. Or to your play space.” (Mondragon, through a spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed.)\n\n“I’m not in the business of helping people tweet better,” groused NHTSA chief David Strickland.\n\nAll of this, naturally, has safety officials worried. “I’m not in the business of helping people tweet better,” groused David Strickland, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in a speech at a national conference in June. NHTSA’s official position, backed by a body of research, is that there are three types of distraction: visual, manual, and cognitive. That is, even when a motorist is looking straight ahead, the cognitive demands of a phone conversation may cause “inattention blindness,” or a failure to respond to visual cues, because the mind is “somewhere else.”\n\nThe evidence includes a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety that found that drivers are four times more likely to crash when they are talking on the phone, even when using a hands-free device.\n\nResearchers at the University of Utah, meanwhile, have found that cellphone conversations slow drivers’ reactions as much as having a blood alcohol level at the legal limit of .08 percent. Moreover, in some fatal crashes, there is anecdotal evidence that drivers were simply talking—not dialing or groping for their phones.\n\nWith their public service campaigns highlighting distracted driving, critics say, automakers are trying to keep regulators at bay. “The best defense is a good offense,” notes Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington, DC. “One has to watch what auto companies do, versus what they say.”\n\nTelling customers to turn off their devices is a lost cause, industry officials insist. So they have opted to make the roads safer by offering built-in connections that are simpler and less distracting to use than a smart phone. “Given that the driver has decided they are going to do something, it’s better to be doing it with their eyes on the road and their hands on the wheel,” explains Louis Tijerina, a senior technical specialist with Ford.\n\nIndeed, “eyes on the road, hands on the wheel,” has become something of an industry mantra—for Ford in particular. More than a marketing slogan, it presents a fundamental challenge to the long-held precept that distraction involves not only the eyes and the hands, but the mind.\n\nThe automakers draw their ammunition from competing research, largely studies by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, which GM and Ford recently hired to compare their built-in systems with portable devices in terms of driver safety. (The built-ins prevailed, and the companies issued press releases touting the results.)\n\nThe institute is a pioneer of so-called naturalistic studies, wherein cameras and sensors are mounted in vehicles to record what drivers were doing at the time of crashes, near-crashes, or lesser incidents such as veering out of their lane. While visual and manual tasks can be serious distractions, its studies have concluded, there is little crash risk so long as drivers keep their eyes on the road, “regardless of any other ‘cognitive demand,'” as one paper put it.\n\nTo suggest “there’s no such thing as cognitive distraction…is obviously not right.”\n\nNearly the entire risk, according to the institute’s researchers, stems from dialing, texting, or reaching for the gadget—almost none of it comes from talking. One institute study of commercial truck and bus drivers even concluded that wireless conversations had a “protective effect.”\n\nTo suggest “there’s no such thing as cognitive distraction…is obviously not right,” counters David Strayer, a University of Utah researcher and coauthor of the study equating cell-phone use with drunk driving. “They’re really postulating a model that would run counter to the way we, as cognitive scientists, know how the brain works.”\n\nEven if built-in systems are safer than portable devices, the question remains whether they will be an ever present temptation that causes drivers to “spend more time distracted in some way,” says Adrian Lund, president of the insurance institute. “The honest answer is, we don’t know. This is an experiment we’re all in.”\n\nThe experiment is taking place in a regulatory vacuum. Federal safety rules dictate the minimum strength of vehicle roofs and door latches, the performance airbags, the stopping power of brakes, but automakers have carte blanche when it comes to the design of electronic systems. It’s been that way since NHTSA, a decade ago, challenged the industry to use its best judgment and do the right thing. The companies responded by developing voluntary guidelines, such as placing visual displays high enough so drivers can see them and scan the road at the same time.\n\nThe guidelines also recommend that electronic tasks should simple enough so drivers can perform them without looking away from the road for more than two seconds. In other words, complex tasks like typing in requests for directions may be locked out when the car is in motion. Even so, a car traveling at 60 miles per hour covers 176 feet in two seconds—which leaves little room for stopping if someone in front of you slams on the brakes, or a deer leaps out into the road.\n\nFederal regulators let ”the animals get out of the barn, and it may not be possible to get them back in.”\n\nThere has never been an independent review of the industry guidelines, nor monitoring of companies’ compliance. But under Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, who has called distracted driving “a deadly epidemic,” federal authorities are becoming more active. NHTSA, for one, is developing its own guidelines, and plans to publish the first phase this fall.\n\nYet some watchdogs fear regulators have waited too long to get involved. Henry Jasny, vice president and senior counsel for Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, told me his group has been urging NHTSA to prepare for the onslaught of high-tech electronics ever since the 1990s. Now, they’ve let ”the animals get out of the barn,” he says, “and it may not be possible to get them back in.”\n\nThe best safety advice, Jasny adds, is still more or less what the old bumper sticker says: Hang Up And Drive. “We just don’t get why people should be encouraged not to pay attention to the driving task,” he says. “I understand that people get bored, they have other things they want to do, but they can pull over and do those without endangering the public.”\n\nSee Myron Levin’s previous exposé: “Do Cell Phones Kill 1,000 People a Year?“",
  "latent_22156": "As we’ve seen in this comparison with Apache Cassandra, DynamoDB may be a valuable choice for storing data. It’s fully maintained by AWS you just have to configure your instance and you can start using it straight away.\n\nBeing one of the Amazon web services DynamoDB offers a JSON/HTTP interface and Amazon provides a set of client for a variety of language. Unfortunately Scala is not one of them but there is a Java client available. Sadly it suffers from big performance issues due to poor design choices.\n\nSo what are the alternatives? This is what we’re going to see in this post: How can we get the most out of the official driver and are there better alternatives both in terms of performance or integration with the Scala ecosystem.\n\nThe AWS Java client\n\nAs the time of writing of this post, the official AWS Java Client for DynamoDB is based on the Apache HTTP client and uses blocking calls. This is very unfortunate as making an HTTP call takes a very long time (with respect to CPU cycles). It might be useful for testing purposes but it’s definitely not something I’d like to use in production code.\n\nThere’re actually 2 clients:\n\nAmazonDynamoDB is the blocking client I just mentioned\n\nis the blocking client I just mentioned AmazonDynamoDBAsync is an “async” client that doesn’t block the calling thread\n\nAmazonDynamoDBAsync is clearly a better option but it’s still not truly async. It still relies on Java Future (which blocks as soon as you try to access the value inside the future) and uses a thread pool (a FixedThreadPool to be exact) to perform the blocking call when sending the HTTP request. That’s clearly a limiting factor in a high-throughput application.\n\nIn fact it might happen that your application cannot reach your DynamoDB provisioned throughput just because there is no more threads available to perform more requests. So what can you do?\n\nOf course, use bigger thread pools. This is easily configurable but you’re going to reach a point where there is too much contention on the thread pool’s job queue. You might then prefer to use 2 (or more) thread pools and dispatch requests to these thread pools. But clearly using 1 thread per request doesn’t scale well.\n\nAmazon is very aware of this limitation and is currently working on a new version of it’s Java client. This new client is based on Netty – one of the fastest HTTP library on the JVM – and offers a truly async interface based on Java 8 CompletableFuture .\n\nThis new client is certainly an option worth considering. However at the time of writing of this post it is still under “developper preview” and might change according to the feedback from the community.\n\nThe API\n\nThe client is just a wrapper around HTTP calls. It is suppose to make the developer’s life easier but I cannot say that I particularly appreciate the Java interface. It relies heavily on the “builder” pattern in order to make a “fluent” interface.\n\nimport com.amazonaws.services.dynamodbv2.AmazonDynamoDBClientBuilder; import com.amazonaws.services.dynamodbv2.model.AttributeValue; import com.amazonaws.services.dynamodbv2.model.GetItemRequest; import scala.collection.JavaConverters._ val client = AmazonDynamoDBClientBuilder.standard().build() val key = Map( \"Artist\" -> new AttributeValue().withS(\"No One You Know\"), \"SongTitle\" -> new AttributeValue().withS(\"Call Me Today\") ).asJava val request = new GetItemRequest().withTableName(\"Music\").withKey(key) val response = client.getItem(request)\n\nBasically the client uses a Map[String, AttributeValue] to represents the DynamoDB specific JSON syntax:\n\n{ \"Artist\": {\"S\": \"No One You Know\"}, \"SongTitle\": {\"S\": \"Call Me Today\"} }\n\nAlternatively there is a higher-level API that uses POJO-annotations and a DynamoDBMapper to generate the JSON corresponding to your data model.\n\nGiven all the JSON libraries available in Scala there is certainly a better option where we would define our data model as an ADT (a set of sealed traits and case classes) and have a library handle the JSON transformation for us: This is Scanamo.\n\nScanamo\n\nScanamo is a Scala library for DynamoDB developed by the Guardian.\n\nIt provides 2 components:\n\nDynamoFormat provides a mapping from your ADT case classes to the AWS AttributeValue\n\nprovides a mapping from your ADT case classes to the AWS ScanamoOps The DynamoDB operations modelled as a Free monad\n\nOf course it glues everything together in a simple syntax to query DynamoDB:\n\n// The data model case class Farm(animals: List[String]) case class Farmer(name: String, age: Long, farm: Farm) // DynamoDB ops val table = Table[Farmer](\"farmer\") val ops = for { _ <- farmTable.putAll(Set( Farmer(\"Boggis\", 43L, Farm(List(\"chicken\"))), Farmer(\"Bunce\", 52L, Farm(List(\"goose\"))), Farmer(\"Bean\", 55L, Farm(List(\"turkey\"))) )) bunce <- farmTable.get('name -> \"Bunce\") } yield bunce // Execute the ops Await.result(ScanamoAsync.exec(client)(ops), 5.seconds)\n\nDynamoFormat\n\nDynamoFormat is pretty interesting in itself. DynamoFormat is actually a type-class with methods to transform to/from AttributeValue (which in turn is transformed into a JSON string to be sent over the wire).\n\n@typeclass trait DynamoFormat[T] { def read(av: AttributeValue): Either[DynamoReadError, T] def write(t: T): AttributeValue def default: Option[T] = None }\n\nThe interesting bit is that it relies on Shapeless to automatically derive type class instances for your ADT.\n\nIt’s also easy to define additional formats for specific classes (e.g. for java Instant )\n\nimport java.time.Instant implicit val dateFormat: DynamoFormat[Instant] = coercedXmap[Instant, String, IllegalArgumentException](Instant.parse)(_.toString)\n\nLike most of the Scala-JSON libraries it relies on implicit resolutions to find the right format.\n\nThis is a pretty nice library all by itself and I wish the Guardian had released it on its own (much like play-json is released outside of Play) but more on that later.\n\nScanamo Operations\n\nScanamoOpsA represents all the DynamoDB operations along with their return type.\n\nsealed trait ScanamoOpsA[A] extends Product with Serializable final case class Put(req: ScanamoPutRequest) extends ScanamoOpsA[PutItemResult] final case class Get(req: GetItemRequest) extends ScanamoOpsA[GetItemResult] final case class Delete(req: ScanamoDeleteRequest) extends ScanamoOpsA[DeleteItemResult] final case class Update(req: ScanamoUpdateRequest) extends ScanamoOpsA[UpdateItemResult] // ...\n\nThese operations are then lifted into a Free monad so that they can be easily combined.\n\nobject ScanamoOps { import cats.free.Free.liftF def put(req: ScanamoPutRequest): ScanamoOps[PutItemResult] = liftF[ScanamoOpsA, PutItemResult](Put(req)) def get(req: GetItemRequest): ScanamoOps[GetItemResult] = liftF[ScanamoOpsA, GetItemResult](Get(req)) // ... }\n\nwhere ScanamoOps is just a Free monad\n\ntype ScanamoOps[A] = Free[ScanamoOpsA, A]\n\nHaving a (Free) monad we can combine them in for-comprehensions. This is what was done in the example above. We performed a put followed by a get request:\n\nval ops = for { _ <- farmTable.putAll(Set( Farmer(\"Boggis\", 43L, Farm(List(\"chicken\"))), Farmer(\"Bunce\", 52L, Farm(List(\"goose\"))), Farmer(\"Bean\", 55L, Farm(List(\"turkey\"))) )) bunce <- farmTable.get('name -> \"Bunce\") } yield bunce\n\nNote that nothing is executed here. It’s just a description (or blueprint) of the operations to be executed on DynamoDB. The farmTable.get will return an Option[Either[DynamoReadError, Farmer]] but in order to get it we need an Interpreter that can turn a Free[ScanamoOpsA, Option[Either[DynamoReadError, Farmer]]] into a Future[Option[Either[DynamoReadError, Farmer]]] (or directly into an Option[Either[DynamoReadError, Farmer]] if we’re using the blocking sync client).\n\nThat’s a bit of a convoluted return type but every type is there for a reason:\n\nThe Either[DynamoReadError, Farmer] is here in case the returned JSON can’t be deserialised into a Farmer\n\nis here in case the returned JSON can’t be deserialised into a The surrounding Option indicates the possibility that there is no matching record found in DynamoDB.\n\nScanamo provides 2 interpreters (both of them rely on the AWS Java client):\n\nScanamoInterpreters.id that relies on the AWS sync client\n\nthat relies on the AWS sync client ScanamoInterpreters.future that relies on the AWS async client\n\nTo execute the above operations we need to foldMap over them using one of these 2 interpreters.\n\nval interpreter = ScanamoInterpreters.future(asyncClient) ops.foldMap(interpreter)\n\nAlternatively Scanamo provides some nicer syntax to do just that:\n\nval res = Scanamo.exec(client)(ops) // or val futureRes = ScanamoAsync.exec(asyncClient)(ops)\n\nNote that DynamoDB imposes some limitations in the size of batch requests but Scanamo provides a nice way to get around them with:\n\ndef putAll[T](tableName: String)(items: Set[T])(implicit f: DynamoFormat[T]): ScanamoOps[List[BatchWriteItemResult]] = items.grouped(batchSize).toList.traverseU(batch => ScanamoOps.batchWrite( new BatchWriteItemRequest().withRequestItems(Map(tableName -> batch.toList.map(i => new WriteRequest().withPutRequest(new PutRequest().withItem(f.write(i).getM)) ).asJava).asJava) ) ) // deleteAll and getAll work similarly\n\nHere it creates as many BatchWriteItemRequest as needed to handle all the items passed in.\n\nTo conclude Scanamo is a very handy library to work with DynamoDB as it provides tools that integrates nicely with Scala. The use of the Free monad allows to compose multiple requests together but it’s well hidden behind simple APIs so that it’s possible to use it without being aware of such implementation details.\n\nThe interpreters provided by Scanamo are based on the AWS Java client and as such suffers the same performance issues.\n\nThe good news is that providing a new interpreter based on a different library is easy to do and above all runs all of your operation without any code changes. So the question here: Is there any other DynamoDB client on the JVM?\n\nAlpakka\n\nIt turns out there is another DynamoDB client on the JVM in the form of an Akka-stream connector part of the Alpakka project.\n\nAlpakka aims at providing a all sorts of connectors for Akka-streams (Kafka, DynamoDB, SQS, Kinesis, Cassandra, AMQP, JMS, elasticsearch, …).\n\nIf you look at the connector for DynamoDB you’ll find a rather simple implementation and at its heart is this method:\n\noverride protected val connection: AwsConnect = if (settings.port == 443) Http().cachedHostConnectionPoolHttps[AwsRequestMetadata](settings.host)(materializer) else Http().cachedHostConnectionPool[AwsRequestMetadata](settings.host, settings.port)(materializer)\n\nWhat it means is that it doesn’t use the AWS Java client to send request but Akka-Http (a truly non-blocking HTTP client based on Akka-stream!).\n\nIf we look closer to the Alpakka connector we see that it interfaces with the request/response entities provided by the AWS Java client and transform them into Akka HTTP requests/responses.\n\nIt makes the client not very pleasant to use (Java builders, no-automatic conversion from the data model ADT, …) but having a non-blocking client is a huge win!\n\nThe better of both worlds\n\nKnowing this, you’ve probably guessed where this is going by now: Can we use the Alpakka client in Scanamo?\n\nWell, it turns out that yes, we can. If you think about it, the Scanamo interpreters are using the AWS Java client so they must turn the Scanamo operations into AmazonWebServiceRequest s at some point.\n\nAnd there is an object that do just that (although it is package private):\n\nprivate[ops] object JavaRequests { def scan(req: ScanamoScanRequest): ScanRequest = ??? def query(req: ScanamoQueryRequest): QueryRequest = ??? def put(req: ScanamoPutRequest): PutItemRequest = ??? def delete(req: ScanamoDeleteRequest): DeleteItemRequest = ??? def update(req: ScanamoUpdateRequest): UpdateItemRequest = ??? }\n\nThen the job of the interpreter is simple: turn the Scanamo opereration into an AWS request (using JavaRequests ) and use the AWS client to execute this request.\n\ndef id(client: AmazonDynamoDB) = new (ScanamoOpsA ~> Id) { def apply[A](op: ScanamoOpsA[A]): Id[A] = op match { case Put(req) => client.putItem(JavaRequests.put(req)) case Get(req) => client.getItem(req) case Delete(req) => client.deleteItem(JavaRequests.delete(req)) // ... } }\n\nThe idea to implement a new interpreter is to replace the client with an Alpakka connector:\n\ndef future(client: DynamoClient)(implicit executor: ExecutionContext): ScanamoOpsA ~> Future = new (ScanamoOpsA ~> Future) { import akka.stream.alpakka.dynamodb.scaladsl.DynamoImplicits._ override def apply[A](ops: ScanamoOpsA[A]): Future[A] = ops match { case Put(req) => client.single(JavaRequests.put(req)) case Get(req) => client.single(req) case Delete(req) => client.single(JavaRequests.delete(req)) // ... } }\n\nAnd there you have it! A truly non-blocking interpreter for Scanamo. The best of both world: an easy and nice syntax with a performant client!\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen it comes to accessing DynamoDB there is not a lot of option on the JVM (to my knowledge). However it’s still a web service so whatever client can do. The second aspect is how easy it ease to build a request. Scanamo really has a point to ease building the requests.\n\nIt would have make sense to split Scanamo into 2 artifacts:\n\nOne library to build AWS requests including DynamoFormats and a way to build the requests outside of the Free monad\n\nand a way to build the requests outside of the Free monad One library based on the other one that uses the Free monad to compose Dynamo operations and execute them\n\nAs always you can find (and try) these ideas in this Github repo.",
  "latent_22236": "OAKLAND — The city’s court-appointed police leader criticized department brass Thursday for being unprepared to stop the vandalism that erupted downtown last month shortly after the Trayvon Martin verdict was announced.\n\nA weak intelligence gathering system left police with little advance warning “of the easily anticipated events that occurred,” former Baltimore Police Commissioner Thomas Frazier wrote in his monthly report on Oakland’s progress in satisfying court-ordered reforms.\n\nThe intelligence failure occurred, Frazier added, even though police had been warned that protests would be likely if George Zimmerman was acquitted in Martin’s death and were asked to provide their plans for dealing with protests. Fixing the department’s intelligence system will now become a top priority that must be addressed before federal oversight of the department is lifted, Frazier wrote.\n\nInterim Chief Sean Whent has said police were unaware that the verdict could come on a Saturday evening and that there were not enough officers downtown to safely arrest protesters that turned violent.\n\nVandals smashed the windows of numerous businesses, tagged other buildings and set garbage bins ablaze. After two more nights of vandalism, police began assigning more officers to handle protests, none of which has since turned violent.\n\nFrazier was granted far-reaching power over Oakland’s police department earlier this year to force through decade-old reforms stemming from the Riders police brutality scandal. Although the reform plan focuses primarily on the department’s ability to police its officers, Frazier has expanded his focus to include subjects well beyond the unmet reforms.\n\nFrazier also wrote that he had brokered a deal with the police union to hire retired officers to do background checks on police cadet candidates.\n\nThe city is desperate to add more police, but its first two academies in five years have had alarmingly high rates of attrition.\n\nOf the 57 recruits that entered last year’s academy, only 36 are with the force, six of whom, as of last week, still were not ready to work on their own.\n\nThis year’s academy class has already shrunk from 51 to 40 recruits.\n\nFrazier wrote that the attrition is due to a shortage of money and human resources staff to conduct high-quality background investigations.\n\nPolice otherwise continued to make impressive progress toward satisfying the reform plan, Frazier wrote. He also wrote that friction with city administrators he noted in his prior report had not been a problem last month.\n\nContact Matthew Artz at 510-208-6435.",
  "latent_22293": "DALLAS -- Go ahead and count Ronda Rousey among those who'd like to see the next defense of her UFC women's bantamweight title come against former Strikeforce superstar Gina Carano.\n\n\"I would love that. I've always said that, I never would've found women's MMA if I hadn't seen her fight,\" Rousey told reporters in Dallas on Friday.\n\n\"To fight her would be a real honor and I think that'd be a milestone for the sport. But, I mean, you can't fight for anyone but yourself. I wouldn't want her to fight for any other reason than if she wants to fight. It's a personal decision for everyone.\"\n\nIt's been nearly five years since Carano left mixed martial arts for the bright lights of Hollywood, yet speculation continues to swirl regarding her prospective comeback.\n\nFor her part, Rousey said that despite Carano's lengthy layoff, she believes the former fighter turned actress would absolutely deserve an immediate UFC title shot if she were to return, because of \"everything that she's done for the sport and the pioneer that she is.\"\n\nAdditionally, Rousey stated that she would be open to fighting at a catchweight with Carano, who fought the majority of her career at 145 pounds, despite it being a compromise Rousey has historically resisted for other challengers, such as Invicta FC champion Cris \"Cyborg\" Santos.\n\n\"There are exceptions that I would make for Gina that I wouldn't make for anyone else,\" Rousey said.\n\nRousey (9-0), who recently defeated Miesha Tate and Sara McMann in back-to-back training camps, is currently eyeing a summer return date for the fourth defense of her UFC title. And if the Carano fight proves to be a pipe dream, she already has an idea about who she'd like to square off against next.\n\n\"I still feel that Cat Zingano is next,\" Rousey said. \"I feel like she is the No. 1 contender, and I saw a statement from her management saying that she'll be ready in June.\"\n\nFor Rousey, after steamrolling through a hectic 2013 schedule which consisted of fighting, dabbling in Hollywood, and filming The Ultimate Fighter, the leisurely pace of the past few weeks has served as a much-needed chance to recharge her batteries.\n\nNonetheless the first female UFC champion continues to land in the headlines for a variety of reasons, from the reasonable, such as speculation regarding her next opponent, to the absurd, like a recent quarrel with UFC Octagon girl Arianny Celeste.\n\n\"That whole Arianny thing, those comments from the Maxim thing, that was from 12 months ago. Did it just take her a year to come up with a comeback? I mean, why is this coming up now?,\" Rousey remarked.\n\n\"They made grammatical sense, which is good for her.\"",
  "latent_22298": "In Case of Emergency (ICE) is a program that enables first responders, such as paramedics, firefighters, and police officers, as well as hospital personnel, to contact the next of kin of the owner of a mobile phone to obtain important medical or support information (the phone must be unlocked and working). The phone entry (or entries) should supplement or complement written (such as wallet, bracelet, or necklace) information or indicators. The programme was conceived in the mid-2000s and promoted by British paramedic Bob Brotchie in May 2005.[1] It encourages people to enter emergency contacts in their mobile phone address book under the name \"ICE\". Alternatively, a person can list multiple emergency contacts as \"ICE1\", \"ICE2\", etc. The popularity of the program has spread across Europe and Australia, and it has started to grow into North America.[2]\n\nOverview [ edit ]\n\nFollowing research carried out by Vodafone that showed that fewer than 25% of people carry any details of who they would like telephoned following a serious accident, a campaign encouraging people to do this was started in May 2005 by Bob Brotchie of the East Anglia Ambulance Service in the UK. The idea has taken off since 7 July 2005 London bombings.[3]\n\nWhen interviewed on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme on 12 July 2005, Brotchie said:\n\n\"I was reflecting on some difficult calls I've attended, where people were unable to speak to me through injury or illness and we were unable to find out who they were. I discovered that many people, obviously, carry mobile phones and we were using them to discover who they were. It occurred to me that if we had a uniform approach to searching inside a mobile phone for an emergency contact then that would make it easier for everyone.\"\n\nBrotchie also urged mobile phone manufacturers to support the campaign by adding an ICE heading to phone number lists of all new mobile phones.\n\nWith this additional information and medical information, first responders can access this information from the victim's phone in the event of an emergency. In the event of a major trauma, it is critical to have this information within the golden hour, which can increase the chances of survival.\n\nIn Germany, the In Case of Emergency concept has been criticised for some reasons:[4]\n\nMedical service personnel on site normally do not have the time to contact relatives. Information stored in a phone is thus useless for medical care prior to hospital.\n\nContacting relatives of a seriously injured person is a sensitive task that is not carried out by telephone in the first place.\n\nIt is recommended that one carries contact information and relevant medical information in writing inside one's wallet, and not rely on ICE contacts as a primary means of identification.\n\nMany smartphone models have dedicated ICE contact information functionality either built into the OS or available as apps. Saving duplicate phone numbers on a phone without dedicated ICE functionality may cause the ICE and regular contacts to be combined, or cause the caller ID to fail for incoming calls from a close friend or relative. (To avoid this, some use the \"tel:\" URI scheme to put the phone number in the ICE contact's \"home page\" field.)\n\nLocked phones [ edit ]\n\nFor security purposes, many mobile phone owners now lock their mobiles, requiring a passcode to be entered in order to access the device. This hinders the ability of first responders to access the ICE phone list entry. In response to this problem, many device manufacturers have provided a mechanism to specify some text to be displayed while the mobile is in the locked state. The owner of the phone can specify their \"In Case of Emergency\" contact and also a \"Lost and Found\" contact. For example, BlackBerry mobiles permit the \"Owner\" information to be set in the Settings → Options → Owner menu item. Android users running Android Nougat (Android 7.0) or higher also have the ability to program emergency information and contact details accessible by others through the emergency call screen when the device is locked.[5] Emergency contacts can be added to iPhone lock screens with the iOS Health application, and accessed by tapping or swiping to the Emergency dialer, where a calls to 911 or another pre-specified number can be made, and the Medical ID button is displayed as well. When accessing this Medical ID, the user's name, health information, allergies and medications can be listed, along with the ability to directly contact listed emergency contacts.[6]\n\nAlternatively, some handsets provide access to a list of ICE contacts directly from the \"locked\" screen. There are also smartphone \"apps\" (applications) that allow custom ICE and emergency information to be displayed on the \"locked\" screen. For instance, the Medical ID Android app enables quick access to medical information and emergency contacts.\n\nIf you click the lock button 5 times, it will call 911 in case of emergency.\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

  "latent_22541": "Some of you may remember a little controversy over a cake that Verdant Tea used to sell , which wasn’t quite the amazingly special tea it claimed to be. Well, a new controversy has arrived through a Reddit thread. Calling these controversy is really giving too much credit to Verdant though, because in both cases the questions far overwhelm the response they gave – things, basically, don’t check out. The Reddit thread includes comments by TwoDog of White2Tea and Scott of YunnanSourcing – yes they are vendors but they are low-BS vendors, whereas Verdant’s BS meter is sky high. You should look through that thread.\n\nThe story is this – there’s this puerh that Verdant sells that they claim to be from a single 1800 years old tree. In general, people think that older trees are better, and are willing to pay through the nose to get it. I’m not going to link to the tea, which is sold out anyway, but will instead show you a screengrab.\n\nFirst of all, you may note that for 100g, $60 isn’t a lot of money for a tea that claims to be as rare and special as a 1800 years old tree should. In fact, it is very cheap, cheaper than all old tree or ancient tree teas on the market today, by a pretty wide margin too. There’s a reason we say “if it’s too good to be true, it probably is.” Well, this price is way, way too good to be true, especially coming from an American vendor who will naturally have a much higher overhead.\n\nBut that’s not the only problem. There are a lot of things that don’t really check out in this story. For example, this is one productive tree! 100 cakes were pressed, with 100g each, that’s 10kg of processed tea leaves. This means the tree would’ve had to have produced 40kg of raw leaves for this much processed leaves be available for pressing. 40kg for a single tree that is so old – it’s seriously risky and damaging to the tree if this were really done, because older trees that aren’t pruned regularly don’t really grow very fast, and to harvest this much tea from it would literally kill the tree.\n\nNot to mention that it’s impossible. This issue was reposted on Steepster, where the wife of Verdant Tea’s proprietor, Lily Duckler, responded to the criticism. Scott of Yunnan Sourcing followed up with a response of his own (in the second last thread on the page). Basically, trees of this nature are now all under state protection, and harvesting from them is usually a serious crime. I have no illusion that some illegal harvesting is going on, but this isn’t 2005 anymore when anyone and everyone can harvest whatever tea they want from whatever tree they want. It’s a lot more difficult now to get access to the fields of ancient trees, many of which have been designated as protected and thus off limits (or limited severely in quantity). That a tree this old can be harvested with impunity and obvious disregard for its long term health is not going to happen.\n\nScott’s response also highlighted another issue that was obviously problematic for me when I saw the page – for a vendor so keen on producing photos and videos of their trips, conspicuously absent are good photos and/or videos of the tree in question. There’s one poorly shot one in the product page, but that’s it. Lily Duckler’s response beats around the bush about other trees (some of the photos there, as Scott points out, are of trees from different tea regions entirely and has nothing to do with this village, contra Duckler’s claim) and doesn’t actually talk about the tree in question. Why not? There are pictures of other trees, but no more of the ones for which they’re selling the tea? That’s very odd, to say the least. What there are pictures of, however, are plantation tea trees in the background – the picture with the hut at the bottom? See those rows in the back on the slope? Wonder what they are? Plantation teas.\n\nI don’t really care about pictures all that much – it’s about the tea, after all, and not the tree. Even if there are trees of that age in the area, there is no indication at all from Lily Duckler’s response that they have any proof that the tea they got is from those old trees. She mentioned, specifically, that these cakes took up a whole year’s harvest, which would imply that when they got there to buy the tea and have them pressed into cakes, the teas were already harvested and in bags. As anyone with any familiarity with Yunnan tea buying knows, buying processed leaves from bags from vendors, especially if you’re new to the area and a foreigner, is a very, very risky business. Most likely, you’ll get low grade stuff taken in from lesser regions being sold as premium goods in the more expensive regions. This has been and continues to be a problem. The really conscientious tea makers go out there themselves and harvest with the guys, oversee the entire process in person (because otherwise their good tea will get swapped out) and take the tea away with them, leaving no chance for any kind of fishy business. A few friends of mine who are serious about pressing cakes all follow this to a letter, which means spending a month or more in Yunnan every harvest season to see this done. If you don’t, you run a pretty high risk of seeing your tea get changed into something else, or at least adulterated, which is bad enough given the prices of these tea. Yet, we have no indication that these teas are in fact from those trees. The only response is “trust us” which, unfortunately, is really not good enough for the Yunnan puerh scene.\n\nAm I being overly harsh and assume the worst of human beings? Yes and no. Yes, because I do assume the worst in the case of tea growers in Yunnan. No, because I think they are perfectly justified in doing so. You have to remember – this is the first time in history that farmers in this region have a chance to live above subsistence. These are not Bordeaux wine makers living out of old chateaus with centuries of winemaking wealth behind them. This is the first time in history for farmers here to finally buy a nicer appliance, buy a car, send kids to school in a dependable manner, have a bit of money leftover for retirement – stuff that others in the cities have enjoyed for much longer. These guys have to be hard at work trying to get as much money as they can out of their tea. The boom in puerh tea has been going on for ten years now, so conditions are nicer than when it first started, but these guys are by no means economically secure, and it is crazy to think that a farmer would give up literally tens of thousands of US dollars (and that’s how much 10kg of tea from a 1800 years old tree would be worth on the open market) to instead sell to an American guy with an online shop for something like $1000-2000 USD (Verdant couldn’t have paid more than maybe $15-20 a cake given overhead and associated costs). Giving up that much money – money that can substantially improve lives, if not for the farmer himself then for his community – would be crazy. If they’re indeed in a collective, even if the farmer himself is super-altruistic and doesn’t care for money, he would probably sell the tea to pay for school renovation, public works projects, road repairs, etc. He wouldn’t virtually give it away to some American guy to sell online, unless of course the tea is not what Verdant thinks it is. As Scott said in the thread on Steepster, if the tea really is what it is then Verdant just ripped off this Mr. Zhou and should feel ashamed.\n\nFinally, there’s the issue of vendor responsibility. If the tea is not what it is, and I most certainly think it’s not, then it’s the same old question – is Verdant the con man or is Verdant being conned? Given their track record, I’m leaning towards the former. After all, this is a shop that sells low priced Shandong (Laoshan) green tea as if they’re premium products, and which marketed that Star of Bulang as if it’s a special cake. I find no reason to believe any of these claims made by them. Whether or not they sincerely believe them themselves is actually irrelevant. If they do, then they are too naive to do business in the tea world in China and shouldn’t be in the market, because they are just passing on cons from Chinese vendors to Western consumers without weeding out the bullshit, which is what they’re being paid to do. If they do not believe their own marketing, then they’re the con man themselves. Either way, the conclusion is the same – stay away from them as there are better vendors out there.",

From his first vampire-centric 1993 feature, Cronos, to the much bigger-budgeted Hellboy films, to Oscar-winning fantasy thriller Pan's Labyrinth, del Toro has brought a number of memorable creatures to life for a new generation of monster-lovers.\n\nIn his latest film, The Shape of Water, hitting theaters Dec. 8, del Toro reunites with his go-to man behind the mask, Doug Jones. The actor has starred in five of del Toro's previous films (Mimic, Hellboy, Hellboy II, Pan's Labyrinth and Crimson Peak) as well as the director's FX television series The Strain. Jones' roles in the films have varied from parasitic alien lifeforms to hyper-intelligent aquatic fishmen to eloquent Spanish-speaking ancient fauns to the nightmare-inducing Pale Man and many more.\n\nFrom an unassuming phone call 20 years ago (to fill in for a Canadian actor for pick-up shoots on 1997's Mimic in Los Angeles) the duo's relationship grew into a artistic collaboration between director and performer. Now, with The Shape of Water earning rave reviews and scoring a Golden Lion win at the 2017 Venice Film Festival, del Toro and Jones seem poised for another hit and possible Oscar contender.\n\nDespite their longstanding working relationship, Jones was tasked with a unique challenge in the new film: making a monster a believable love interest and leading man. In The Shape of Water, Jones plays an aquatic creature known as \"the Asset\" who is captured and held in captivity by the government in 1960s Cold War America. There he develops a relationship with a lonely laboratory worker (Sally Hawkins) that quickly blossoms into a romance.\n\nJones spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about his role in the new film, what it's like to work with a visionary like del Toro, and how he managed to make an Amazonian fishman \"sexy.\"\n\nHow’d you first come to work with Guillermo del Toro?\n\nThe Shape of Water is my sixth movie with him, and I also did his television series The Strain. We met 20 years ago in 1997 when he was doing his first American feature film, Mimic. The principal photography was in Toronto, and the tall, skinny actor who played the bug guys in the movie was Canadian. When they did pick-up shoots right before it came out, they did them in Los Angeles. Him being a Canadian, getting a work permit in America would be problematic, so they asked, \"What tall, skinny actor can we get in L.A.?\" Well, whenever tall and skinny comes up, my name is in that rolodex. So, I got a call one afternoon asking if I was free tonight for a night shoot. I worked for three days, and on day number two when I finally met the director — this roly-poly, delightful man named Guillermo del Toro — he sat down across the lunch table from me and told me [Jones drops into a gravelly impersonation of del Toro], \"Tell me everything you’ve been in before.\" I told him about my past projects working with Oscar-winning makeup artists and Guillermo wanted to hear all about them. His love and devotion to monsters and creepy, crawly things was that of an 8-year-old boy. By the time lunchtime was over he asked for my card. I walked away asking if that was a fanboy who walked in here or if that was the director.\n\nIt was a little while before you worked together again, though.\n\nHe came back looking for me five years later. The design came up for Abe Sapien [for 2004's Hellboy] and all the makeup effects people who were working on it said, \"Doug Jones should play this.\" He went, \"Doug Jones? I know Doug Jones!\" and he pulled my card out of his wallet that I gave him five years before. That movie is where we really connected and developed a working rapport. For me to fall into a relationship with a director of his stature, that’s a dream for any actor, and it’s a rarity that only like a Scorsese/De Niro or Tim Burton/Johnny Depp get. It’s rare and it’s beautiful when it happens.\n\nYou quickly became his go-to monster guy after that. How early on in the process were you involved with The Shape of Water?\n\nBack in 2014, when we were working on Crimson Peak, on one of my days off he called me into his office to have a private little talk about this other movie he wanted to do after Crimson Peak. He wanted to get away from the big studio system and do a smaller movie. I loved how the talk began and I said, \"Yes, yes, yes, please, please, please.\" (Laughs.) He said he had a story in mind, \"And I want you to play the creature.\" That’s when he told me the entire storyline — which he had not written out on paper yet — for The Shape of Water. I thought if he’s going to direct this story he just told me we might have another piece of magic on our hands.\n\nOften when you’re playing the monster in a film you’re more of a supporting or antagonistic role. In The Shape of Water that is a very different case.\n\nRight, even when I’m not onscreen they’re talking about me. The fishman is absolutely the centerpiece of that film. Of course, it’s Sally Hawkins’ film and she’s absolutely lovely and brilliant. Getting to be her love interest, as a monster, is something only del Toro could pull off. That private talk he had with me in 2014 began with his concern about the intimacy that was going to be portrayed on film between Hawkins’ character and mine. He was hesitating when he talked to me so I asked what were his misgivings. He said, \"I know you’re a good Catholic boy, I just want to make sure it’s OK with you to play this.\" I asked what could possibly be the problem and he goes, \"Well, there’s a fuck scene.\" (Laughs.) As only he could say.\n\nHow hard is it to make a monster a believable love interest?\n\nA note Guillermo gave me, as far as [the Asset’s] physicality goes, he kept pushing the sexy. This character has to be sexy. When watching the film you have to believe that someone could actually fall in love with him and find him sexy and want to take their clothes off in his presence. So how do you create a monster who does that? The sculpting process, the developing this character’s look was years in the making. Guillermo enlisted the help of a fine artist who hadn’t done much in the movie world named Mike Hill whom Guillermo had discovered at the trade show Monsterpalooza. And a lot of Mike Hill’s pieces are now a part of Guillermo’s collection at Bleak House. Mike Hill was actually on set with us doing the finishing touches on my makeup every day. He develop my colors and my shapes and my silhouette that became this sexy and beautiful creature.\n\nIs it particularly challenging as an actor to film intimate scenes while you’re wearing a full bodysuit?\n\nWell, you have to find the mindset and storytelling brilliance of Guillermo del Toro when you’re working on one of his films. You mentioned a minute ago that monsters are often secondary. Guillermo is the one director who can make a monster the leading man. In The Shape of Water he has created this fishman mutant, last of his kind, who becomes a sexy love interest. I don’t know anyone else who could’ve pulled that off but him. When I asked him why this time does it need to involved full-frontal nudity — I mean, we’re going for it! — and he harkened back to the Creature from the Black Lagoon and Frankenstein and any of the classic monster movies that helped develop his love of monsters. There was always a romantic side to these characters and relationships on film that never got actualized all the way. Guillermo said this time, the monster’s going to actually fuck the girl. (Laughs.) A gentler way to say it is that this is the creature from the wet, black lagoon who actually gets the girl this time.\n\nThe Asset in The Shape of Water shares a few characteristics with your Hellboy character Abe Sapien. Was there any commonality between portraying the two different characters?\n\nI was in water way more for this one than I ever was for Abe Sapien. In fact, I was never in water when I was Abe. Guillermo was very specific, he did not want Abe Sapien in this film at all. He wanted this to be very stand-alone, it’s its own piece of art. Let’s celebrate this own unique story that has nothing to do with Abe. He has a love for fishmen and mermaids, anyway. The Creature from the Black Lagoon was his favorite of the Universal monsters. He wanted this one to be very different. Abe was a very articulate, well-spoken, intelligent, poised and postured being who gestured with his hands a lot and was very gentile. Guillermo wanted the opposite [for the Asset]. He wanted it very raw and animalistic. What he specifically said to me was that he did not want a Dougie Jones performance, he wants a character. He doesn’t want a physical performance. He wanted something raw and animal and real. This character came out of the wild, it’s not a fantasy being. This is something that was found on Earth and is real and is in front of us in the 1960s. My character doesn’t speak, but he is intelligent enough that I can learn communication. Sally Hawkins' character doesn’t speak either, so we connect on a beautiful nonverbal level which is so lovely to explore on film.\n\nWith del Toro stressing for you to give a “real” performance is it safe to assume that a lot of the effects in this movie were done in-camera?\n\nCorrect, yes. Another del Toro thing is that he loves old-school filmmaking style. If you’re going to have a monster in a movie, put him in the movie, don’t paint it in later. If you can. (Laughs.) That’s nice for Sally Hawkins because she didn’t have to interact with a tennis ball. There was a real creature in front of her that she could touch, interact with and love on. And same for me. I could be there with her in that moment instead of being there later with dots on me in front of a green screen. I much prefer this method of filmmaking.",
  "latent_23012": "“People start playing squash to get fit,” says Terry Pritchard, one of the most enthusiastic players at Headwaters Racquet Club. “But soon you are getting fit to play better squash.”\n\nEither way, the game is a heck of a good way to have fun while elevating your heart rate, putting your lungs to the test, and giving your grey matter a workout. “You play your butt off in 45 minutes on a squash court,” says Jamie Hickox – and he should know. Born in Oakville but now living in Caledon Village, Jamie was a top-15 player on the world circuit from 1982 to 1997 and is currently Squash Canada’s performance director. Squash is like “chess on legs,” he says. “You have to think three or four shots ahead.”\n\nUnlike tennis, squash is always played indoors in a cube-like room, 21 feet wide and 32 feet long for singles play. The racquet and hollow ball are smaller than those used for tennis, and there is no net. Instead, players take turns hitting the ball against any of the four walls, though it must hit the front wall at least once during any shot. A rally ends when a player fails to return a shot before the ball bounces more than once on the wooden floor, giving a point to the opponent. Games are played to 11 points, with a match being the best of five games.\n\nTerry was a rank beginner when he picked up squash at the Headwaters club about five years ago. He remembers how nervous he was at his first tournament. “I thought it would be very competitive,” he recalls. “In fact, what we found was the opposite. It was sort of a family atmosphere.”\n\nTerry’s experience matches that of most squash players, who comment on how social the game is. Leah Desbarres, the squash pro at Headwaters, says, “There’s always lots of socializing among squash players after a match.”\n\nLeah, who has played the game since her early teens and ranked for many years among the top 10 players in Ontario, gave me a few pointers one day in the fall. I thought I was doing pretty well – until I asked her to play as if she were in a tournament. So she dropped shot after shot into the back corner, giving inexperienced, tennis-playing me no room to swing at the ball.\n\nTaking pity, she told me to try a “boast,” a strategy that involves banking the ball off a side wall straight to the front wall. In this way, the game is a little like billiards. Leah’s suggestion helped, but the manoeuvre left me vulnerable to her next shot, which she dropped neatly into the opposite front corner so I had to dash madly to return it – whereupon Leah stroked the ball leisurely, hitting a line drive that was out of my reach.\n\n“I’m not a power player,” she explains, “but I can place the ball pretty well.” Her accuracy frustrates a lot of big, strong heavy hitters, she says. No kidding.\n\n“Hitting the ball hard is an advantage, but it isn’t everything,” says Jamie. His favoured shot is a “working boast,” essentially the shot Leah instructed me to use to get the ball out of a back corner. His love of squash developed from his enjoyment of hitting things against a wall as a young boy. After that, he says, “Imagine how much fun it was to have four walls to play against.”\n\nThis kind of childhood obsession, the repetitive sound of which can drive parents crazy, was critical to the development of the game, which originated in the Fleet Prison in London, England – a place where you’d expect people to spend a lot of downtime amid concrete walls. To pass the time, the debtors who made up most of the notorious prison’s population hit balls against the walls of the recreation yard. By the early 1800s this pastime had evolved into a game called rackets, a precursor of squash.\n\nThen, “by some strange route,” wrote Ted Wallbutton on the website of the World Squash Federation, rackets made its way to Harrow, arguably the most prestigious school in England. Though it’s hard to imagine Harrow’s privileged students running out of balls, they must have, for squash emerged when the boys realized how challenging it was to play with a punctured rackets ball that “squashed” when it hit the wall.\n\nAlthough squash doesn’t enjoy the popularity of tennis, squash aficionados hope this will change if the game is included in the Olympics. The campaign to make this happen recently suffered a setback when the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee rejected the World Squash Federation’s proposal, but officials aren’t giving up on their dream of making the game an Olympic sport.\n\nHere in Canada, the game is played by about 200,000 people – and for a while the country boasted an acknowledged superpower on the world scene. Colourful and outspoken, Jonathan Power was the world’s number one player when he retired in 2006. Caledon has a few players to brag about too. From Palgrave, the two older Riedelsheimer brothers, Sebastian and Christian, both attended American universities on squash scholarships, and their younger brother Alexander will learn this winter whether he, too, is heading south of the border.\n\nAsked what he considers his main advantage, Alexander says, “I’m pretty smart on the court and I’ve got pretty good hands.” These capabilities will no doubt help the 17-year-old realize his other dream: to become a doctor.\n\nMeanwhile, I have to towel off after my short lesson with Leah. My damp shirt is all the proof I need that squash is a great workout, and figuring out all the angles is way more fun than sitting on a stationary bike. Leah admits she wanted us to play so I’d be reminded of squash’s “awesomeness.” Her ploy worked.",

My mother! My mother!'\" Toledo recalled. \"I looked upstairs, and there's this lady who looks like she doesn't want to move, like she's frozen.\"\n\n\"She was engulfed in smoke, so that's why I had to act,\" Toledo said. \"So I just ran up there. I really didn't think about the fire was going to get me. I just ran up there, grabbed her and came down. She continued thanking me.\"\n\nToledo said he was sitting inside his house when he heard an explosion at the apartment building next door.\n\n\"I came running out this way, and I saw there was a gentleman trying to put a fire out in a car that was jammed into the corner,\" Toledo said. \"So I ran and got my fire extinguisher and tried to help, and when I came back it was worse. It felt like it kept growing.\"\n\nFire rescue crews responded to the scene at 12:48 p.m., the St. Lucie County Fire District said in a news release.\n\nAll eight units in the complex sustained damage, and the building was cordoned off with police tape.\n\nThe American Red Cross has been notified to assist 13 adults and five children who had been living in the apartment building, the Fire District stated.\n\nThe incident is being investigated by the Fire District, Fort Pierce police and the state Fire Marshal's Office.\n\nMore: First husband-wife team of firefighters retiring from St. Lucie County Fire District\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/local/st-lucie-county/2017/07/04/propane-laden-car-rams-into-fort-pierce-apartment-building-one-dead-several-homeless/450135001/",

  "latent_23449": "Right after Nina Dobrev tweeted a photo of her kissing a puppy, the same picture showed up on Weibo, China’s twitter-like service, with its caption translated into Chinese. “I wish I were the doggy,” one micro-blogger commented on the photo, which was already reposted more than 300 times on Weibo.\n\nA man holds an iPhone as he visits Sina's Weibo microblogging site in Shanghai May 29, 2012. REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nDobrev is not the first, or the most popular western celebrity on Chinese social media. But the Canadian actress, known for her role as Elena Gilbert on The CW television drama The Vampire Diaries, has gained her 290,000 Chinese followers through perhaps an unintended channel-that is, her show is pirated.\n\nAnd the audience is big-when Dobrev showed up in Shanghai in December to help promote a shopping mall’s anniversary celebration, thousands of fans packed all four floors, screaming at the top of their voice as the 24-year-old actress said, “I love you” in Chinese.\n\n“It’s shocking,” said Larry Namer, co-founder of cable and satellite network E! Entertainment Television and Metan Development Group, a China-focused programing company. When he launched his Mandarin show Hello Hollywood a few years ago, the recognition American TV stars received in China completely caught him off-guard. “Somebody like Wentworth Miller would be as big in China as Brad Pitt would be.”\n\nMiller, who had appeared in several Chinese commercials and talk shows, was the leading role in Prison Break, a Fox drama series that went viral in China a few years ago. Following that phenomenon, more American TV celebrities have tapped into the China market, where new episodes of the hottest shows are available online immediately after they’ve aired in the U.S.\n\nOf course the popularity of pirated shows in China is not lost on Western studios and producers. Jonathan Taplin, a film producer and a professor of international communication at University of Southern California believes piracy can still be “destructive to the overall ecology of TV production.”\n\n“American companies spend up to $2 million per episode of a TV show. Part of that calculation is that they will receive foreign licensing fees from countries that exhibit the show,” Taplin said. “Obviously if the only exhibition in China is on pirate sites (often financed by Chinese advertisers) then the economics don’t work for the U.S. producer.”\n\nThe pirated shows, ad-free, usually come with delicate subtitles, done by hard-core volunteers, who also add in occasional headnotes to explain references to American culture and history. Thanks to their effort, stars like Johnny Galecki from The Big Bang Theory and Maggie Q from Nakita are cheered by tens of thousands of fans on Weibo.\n\n“In the U.S. you got to have a Facebook or Twitter; in China it’s the same thing, only bigger,” said Namer, who also uses Weibo frequently. So not surprisingly branding companies are filling the gap by creating social media campaigns in China for western celebrities.\n\nFanstang, the company that represents Nina Dobrev, is one of the successful pioneers. Owned by a firm called China Branding Group, its Weibo portfolio includes a variety of American celebrities, ranging from NBA star Dwyane Wade to Hollywood socialite Paris Hilton. The company declined to comment, but according to one of its public relation officers in Shanghai, Fanstang has introduced more than 100 western stars to Weibo since its debut last summer. With the help of its well-connected partners in Hollywood, she thinks the firms is going to grow even more.\n\n“Typically they’ll have a relationship directly with the celebrity or his or her management team…and work collaboratively on an overall campaign,” said Namer, who works with a similar marketing firm called Mingyian. “There’s a lot of sponsorship money, there’s a lot of appearance money,” he said. “There’s a real business reason for why you want to start building your image in China now.”\n\nFor TV stars, their surprising popularity in China could also mean a higher chance to be cast in films, Namer said. According to a recent report by Motion Picture Association of America, China has surpassed Japan as the second-largest box office market in the world. Last year, more than half of all the country’s box office receipts went to foreign films, after the government permitted more Hollywood blockbusters to be released locally, the state-run newspaper People’s Daily reported.\n\nBesides the benefits they have brought to the actors and actresses, pirated shows also serve as free samples for the American TV industry, said Jerry Kirkpatrick, an emeritus professor of international business and marketing at California State Polytechnic University. “This expands the audience and builds loyalty,” said Kirkpatrick, who believes pirated products can be utilized as marketing tools. “If the producers sit idly by and complain about the pirates, they will be defaulting on their responsibility as marketers.”\n\nAlthough licensing shows on Chinese TV is tricky, with tight restrictions on quantities and airtime slots, some Internet companies are picking up the slack. Having spotted the large fan base of American television, websites like Sohu and Youku, both listed on NASDQ, have introduced dozens of shows the in the past few months, featuring popular shows like Homeland, The Big Bang Theory and House of Cards. And the licensing fees are actually “quite reasonable,” as Sohu’s copyrights director Ma Ke told The Beijing News recently. With the market growing bigger and bigger, Ma said, importers are now making bets on newly released shows, in hopes of attracting viewers before the pirated sites do.\n\nBut Metan Development Group’s Larry Namer sees a different opportunity out of the trend. His company, Metan Development Group, has bought the rights from Warner Brothers last year to develop a Chinese version of Gossip Girl, another teen drama that became hugely popular in China, though this time without the need for piracy.\n\n“The audience taste is different, the cultural background is different. You got to localize it,” Namer said. “That’s why I insisted that this company be China centric.”",

  "latent_23700": "Do you run a hedge fund? If so, I have exciting news. The prominent campaign by Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, to crack down on insider trading in the three-trillion-dollar hedge-fund industry has just ground to an inglorious halt. Late last week, it was quietly announced that prosecutors would drop all charges against one of Bharara’s highest-profile targets, Michael Steinberg, who worked at the fourteen-billion-dollar hedge fund S.A.C. Capital Advisors.\n\nSteinberg, a trusted deputy of Steven A. Cohen, the founder of S.A.C., was convicted of insider trading, in 2013. (I wrote about the investigation of S.A.C. for the magazine last year.) But Steinberg appealed. Last December, in a separate case, a New York appeals court overturned the convictions of two other hedge-fund traders and issued an opinion that dramatically narrowed the definition of insider trading by requiring that prosecutors prove both that the tipper received some sort of compensation for sharing the information and that the individual who traded on that information knew it was an illegal tip. Bharara’s office challenged the ruling, but, earlier this month, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.\n\nUnder this new interpretation of insider trading, Steinberg appeared likely to win his appeal—so Bharara dropped the charges against him, and also dismissed the guilty pleas of six coöperating witnesses who had acknowledged trading on material nonpublic information. The United States Attorney’s office maintains that the majority of its insider-trading convictions will remain unchallenged by this change in the legal landscape. But the truth is that if you operate a hedge fund and care to structure your business around the gaping loopholes that the Supreme Court has implicitly endorsed, insider trading is now effectively legal in the United States.\n\nSuccessful hedge funds are like vast information combines, voraciously churning market data and analysis. At its height, S.A.C. employed about a thousand people, and portfolio managers were charged with generating investment ideas upon which the firm would bet enormous sums. But, because there are so many hedge funds, each with its own army of analysts, the trick is to find some nugget of information that the rest of the market doesn’t know. This is where the culture of insider trading took hold.\n\nIn the summer of 2008, a floppy-haired S.A.C. analyst named Jon Horvath began feeding tips based on insider information to Steinberg, his boss. Through a friend at another hedge fund, Horvath obtained details from an insider at Dell about the company’s disappointing financial results. Horvath passed his information to Steinberg, who made sizable bets against Dell stock in advance of a quarterly earnings report.\n\nHorvath’s friend had obtained the tip from a friend of his who worked at another hedge fund, and had obtained it directly from an insider at Dell. Horvath knew that the provenance of the information was illegal. But did Steinberg? During Steinberg’s trial, in 2013, Horvath, who made a plea deal and became a prosecution witness, testified that Steinberg once told him, “I can day-trade these stocks and make money by myself. I don’t need your help to do that. What I need you to do is go out and get me edgy, proprietary information.” On the stand, Horvath said that he inferred this to mean illegal, nonpublic information. Bharara described the culture at S.A.C. as one in which insider trading was prevalent, even subtly encouraged, and called the firm a “magnet for market cheaters.” Cohen was never personally charged with any crime, but the fund ended up pleading guilty to a criminal indictment, agreeing to stop investing money from outsiders and to pay a $1.8 billion fine.\n\nBefore and after his initial conviction, Steinberg maintained his innocence, arguing that he did not know that the source of the Dell information may have been illegal when he traded on it. Many people on Wall Street felt that Bharara’s crusade against insider trading was recklessly broad: An analyst like Horvath might knowingly obtain an illegal tip, but if he feeds his information up the chain to a Steinberg or a Cohen, and they take his word that he is not passing along stolen goods, should they really go to prison for that misplaced faith? Is it fair to convict someone of engaging in insider trading if he didn’t know he was doing so at the time?\n\nAn edgy tip tends to travel: a company insider shares a fragment of data with a friend, who passes it along to another friend, who passes it to the portfolio manager he works for, who passes it to his boss. Bharara believed that when people like Steinberg make big bets on the basis of this sort of information, they should be prosecuted, even if they are separated by several links on the information chain from the original tipper.\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit disagreed. In overturning the convictions of the two other traders, Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, the court derided the “doctrinal novelty” of Bharara’s approach, and held that it is not enough to prove that someone traded on a tip that she should have known constituted material nonpublic information; instead, prosecutors need to prove that she was affirmatively aware of the dodgy provenance of the tip. The court also held that prosecutors must demonstrate that the original tipper was somehow compensated for offering the tip.\n\nFor Bharara, this was a devastating repudiation. But, to anyone who is at all acquainted with the anthropology of the contemporary hedge fund, it also represented, unmistakably, a license to cheat. Company insiders share tips for many reasons, not just financial compensation: the person they share the information with may be a friend or a family member, someone they want to impress, someone they owe a favor. And once they pass the tip along it often circulates through a network of people in the investment community. At a large hedge fund, the senior investors are generally not out shaking the trees and doing primary market research themselves—they are relying on their analysts and portfolio managers to feed them data and hypotheses. These intermediaries were always a buffer against legal exposure, and the existence of that buffer may offer one explanation for why Bharara was never able to personally charge Cohen with criminal wrongdoing.\n\nWhat the Second Circuit opinion does is fortify the buffer with Kevlar. Richard Holwell, a former federal judge who presided over several high-profile securities-fraud cases, told me that, when an illegal tip is passed up the chain at a hedge fund, senior traders often know better than to inquire about its origins. Instead, some firms have an unspoken policy that Holwell characterized as “don’t ask, don’t tell.” This was the case in the old legal landscape, at the height of Bharara’s crackdown. But in the new legal climate “don’t ask, don’t tell” will amount to much more than a mere precaution—it will be an ironclad bar to prosecution.\n\nOne encouraging byproduct of Bharara’s efforts is that many firms, including S.A.C. (which was rechristened last year as Point72 Asset Management, a “family office” that can only invest Cohen’s personal fortune and the money of some of its employees), have beefed up their compliance departments. But, in a textbook instance of perverse incentives, the ruling by the Second Circuit will discourage due diligence, because the less management knows about the sourcing employed by analysts and traders to generate investment ideas, the fewer people will face legal exposure. It’s not that it will be impossible to bring insider-trading cases from now on; it’s that, at a hedge fund, all of the legal liability will now rest with the analysts and traders on the front lines of information gathering—with the initial knowing recipients of a tip. (Incidentally, if you’re a junior portfolio manager, this might be a good time to ask your boss for a raise.)\n\nBharara observed, earlier this month, that the decision by the Supreme Court to let the Second Circuit’s interpretation of insider trading stand creates “an obvious road map for unscrupulous investors.” But the hedge-fund community is celebrating. “The Justice Department can take its busted insider trading theories back where they came from,” the Wall Street Journal crowed in an editorial, earlier this month. With billions of dollars to be made in betting on the market, whether or not you see cause for alarm in any of this will likely depend on just how scrupulous or unscrupulous you think the average investor is.",

  "latent_23788": "NEW DELHI (AlertNet) - Over five million people in Pakistan still need basic aid such as shelter, clean water and healthcare six months after floods inundated thousands of villages in the south, a senior U.N. official said.\n\nAngali, a four-year-old girl, stands next to her mother who has been displaced by floods while taking refuge at a camp set up by a Turkish Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) for flood victims in Mirpur Khas district in Pakistan's Sindh province September 23, 2011. REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood/Files\n\nFloods triggered by annual monsoon rains in August last year disrupted the lives of nine million people in Pakistan’s Sindh and Baluchistan provinces, killing more than 430 people and forcing hundreds of thousands to camp out in the open.\n\nLynn Hastings, head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Pakistan, told AlertNet that $440 million was needed to help around 5.2 million people rebuild their lives after the disaster.\n\n“Across the board, in all the districts affected, there are very significant needs that are still outstanding - be it to provide food-for-work schemes or some sort of shelter - something better than tarpaulin sheets,” Hastings said in a phone interview from Islamabad.\n\n“There are varying degrees (of need) - there are people who have gone back to absolute nothing and then some people who have gone back and salvaged something. There are others who still can’t return.”\n\nHastings said 10,000 families - about 60,000 to 70,000 people - have not yet been able to return home as 10 percent of Sindh province is still underwater.\n\nAbout 800,000 homes were destroyed or damaged by the disaster and large swathes of farmland submerged, she said, resulting in 92 percent of the area’s cotton and 81 percent of sugar cane crop being lost.\n\nU.N. officials estimate that more than one third of those suffering as result of last year’s floods, were still in a state of recovery - having been hit by Pakistan’s worst ever floods in July 2010. Those monsoon floods left one fifth of the country - an area the size of Italy - underwater and disrupted the lives of more than 18 million people.\n\nRECESSION OR “BAD BRAND”?\n\nPakistan is not only prone to disasters such as floods and earthquakes, but the country has also seen the displacement of millions due military operations against Taliban insurgents in volatile northwestern regions in recent years.\n\nAppeals for funding to tackle Pakistan’s various humanitarian crises have, like many around the world, received a poor response from international donors.\n\nFor example, a previous U.N. appeal in September last year for $356 million life-saving aid for the same flood survivors has until now only been about 50 percent funded.\n\n“I think it’s a global economic issue, first and foremost. Some of the donors, when we were discussing this with them in the fall, did indicate that there were competing interests - in particular the Horn of Africa and Libya,” Hastings said.\n\n“This really put economic strains on donors, and then of course there were the floods in Thailand, an earthquake in Turkey and I guess it’s just largely competing interests and the global recession.”\n\nOther humanitarian agencies, like the Red Cross, however last year alluded to Pakistan being a “bad brand” to sell to donors due to its reputation as being a haven for militants and its tense relationship with the United States, its biggest donor.\n\nHastings said she was hopeful that politics would not adversely impact Western donors’ response to the flood victims.\n\n“I think donors are interested. Whether or not that translates into money or not, I don’t know. But certainly, the interest in knowing what the needs are has been expressed by donors,” she said.",
  "latent_23869": "Flemming Rose has been called a Nazi, a Muslim-hater, and a Danish Satan. He has been simultaneously targeted with death threats and blamed for the deaths of 200 or more innocent people around the world. Since September 2005, when he commissioned now-infamous cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed for the Danish newspaper, Jyllands-Posten, Rose has been a focal point for the tension between respect for cultural diversity and the protection of democratic freedoms.\n\nThis image of Rose as provocateur extraordinaire is difficult to reconcile with the man himself: Soft-spoken and reflective, he gives the impression of being still a little surprised to have caused such a stir. “I am not by nature a provocative person,” he explained to me when I met with him in Washington, D.C. “I do not seek conflict for its own sake, and it gives me no pleasure when people take offense at things I have said or done.” It’s baffling to him that Westerners couldn’t see his decision to publish the cartoons as an act in defense of the values on which liberal democracies were founded.\n\nRose commissioned the cartoons, including Kurt Westergaard’s incendiary image of Mohammed with a bomb in his turban, in order to highlight growing problems of self-censorship in Europe. In London, the Tate Gallery withdrew an installation that featured the Bible, Talmud, and Koran torn to pieces. Museum administrators were wary of offending Muslims, especially in light of the July 2005 bombings. In Denmark, a children’s writer couldn’t find an illustrator for a book about the life of Mohammed; the person who finally agreed to the drawings did so on the condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, the Dutch minister of justice seized on the murder of filmmaker Theo Van Gogh to argue for the necessity of hate speech laws. If the laws had been in place, he insisted, Van Gogh wouldn’t have been murdered—because his film, which critiqued the treatment of women in Islam, would never have seen the light of day in the first place.\n\nCriticizing Islam didn’t constitute a legal offense, but the social pressure to tread softly was immense. The cartoon was a way to insist on freedom of speech and to show the extent to which it was threatened in some of the world’s leading democracies. “Should it not be considered a mark of civilization that in the face of barbaric violence, we respond only with a cartoonist’s pencil?” Rose asks. Still, Muslims around the world erupted in protest; Danish embassies were attacked; a Somali Muslim broke into cartoonist Westergaard’s home wielding an axe and a knife; the newspaper’s offices were evacuated because of bomb scares; and Danmarks Radio, Denmark’s leading public-service media, asked Rose how many bombs had to go off before he apologized.",
  "latent_23897": "One of the things I love about freelancing is that I can work from anywhere. I can take my laptop down to the coffee shop if I want a change of scene. I can do work from anywhere in the world.\n\nWhen I travel, even though I could hole up in the hotel room to do work, sometimes I like to look for a local coworking location. It’s kind of fun to meet new people and socialize. I don’t have the coworking option in my own town, but it’s fun to see coworking centers elsewhere.\n\nWhat is Coworking?\n\nWith the rise of the Internet as a way to work, many solopreneurs find that they miss the social interaction that comes with a more traditional job. As a result, many freelancers are finding common workspaces that allow them to remain freelancers, but also enjoy some of the social interaction that comes with having an office.\n\nCoworking can be done in meetup form, with like-minded freelancers coming together for a day of work in different locations (usually equipped with accessible Wi-Fi). However, there are also dedicated coworking spaces as well. In some cities, coworking offices are set up with everything you need in an office. You might need to pay a fee to use the space, though. Some centers charge a per-day fee, while others have tiers based on whether you use open tables, or whether you have a permanent desk. Some coworking centers even provide private office space.\n\nYou can use a search to find coworking opportunities near you, or you can start with a helpful list of coworking centers from Under 30 CEO.\n\nIs Coworking Right for Your Freelancing Business?\n\nWhile coworking can be a good experience for many freelancers, it’s important to realize that not all freelancers are right for this arrangement. Coworking is ideal for writers, graphic designers, and computer programmers. These freelancers don’t usually have to make a lot of noise, so others can work. If you spend a lot of time on the phone, coworking might not work as well for you. It might not also work as well if you need a large work area to spread your stuff out on.\n\nThere are some coworking arrangements that can accommodate you, though. Some coworking spaces offer “conference” rooms where you can handle your phone calls without disturbing other workers. However, you will need to be considerate; others might need the room. It’s also possible, in some coworking centers, to get a large private area (although you might have to pay $200 to $400 a month for it), where you can spread out your work and make phone calls. If you want a more professional office, but don’t want to lease the office space, some coworking centers can provide that environment at a reasonable rate.\n\nFinally, you need to decide whether or not you can handle the distractions that come with coworking. Be realistic about how much work you are getting done when you go to the coworking center. Are you spending more time chatting with other workers than actually working? If you are too distracted, it might be best to limit your coworking to two or three times a month, and work from home the rest of the time.\n\nWhat do you think? Would coworking be something you would enjoy?\n\nGD Star Rating\n\nloading...",

(Photo: Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo\n\nTeacher absences forced 88 Detroit schools to close today, the largest sick-out meant to call attention to large class sizes, dilapidated buildings and other problems in Michigan's largest school district.\n\nThe sick-out idled most of Detroit Public Schools' 46,000 students. It came on the same day President Barack Obama was visiting the North American International Auto Show at Cobo Hall.\n\n\"Things have been happening for so long, and I think teachers felt like they had no voice,\" said Lacetia Walker, an instructional specialist in special education for DPS. \"This has been a way for us to draw attention to the conditions of the buildings, the fact that teachers' STEP pay has been frozen for years. ...\n\n“We realized that nobody is coming to save us, so we have to save ourselves.” Lacetia Walker, DPS Instructional Specialist\n\n\"We realized that nobody is coming to save us, so we have to save ourselves.\"\n\nDistrict officials said they had no choice but to close schools amid the sick-out.\n\n\"This means that 44,790 of the district's 46,325 students lost a critical day of instruction,\" spokeswoman Michelle Zdrodowski said. \"There were, however, nine district schools that stayed open today. We appreciate the teachers and staff at those schools for being in their classrooms and ensuring that their students are learning today.\"\n\nZdrodowski said the district has been meeting with teachers since last week to discuss their concerns but said the sick-outs could make a legislative fix harder.\n\n\"The only way we will be able to address the bigger issues is through an investment by the Michigan Legislature in the students and families of DPS,\" Zdrodowski said. \"Obtaining this support becomes more difficult with each sick-out that happens.\"\n\nSpeaker of the House Kevin Cotter, R-Mt. Pleasant, said the political maneuvering by the union \"goes against the very purpose of these schools by putting the wants of adults ahead of the needs of the children. These teachers deserve to be fired for turning their backs on the children in their care...\n\n\"These selfish actions do nothing to help Michigan children, and they do nothing to help the union members who want state support for their failing school district. These part-time educators want a handout, but the state of Michigan wants confidence that an improved DPS won't be torn apart from the inside.\"\n\nWalker said the sick-outs were organized by a grassroots group called DPS Teachers Fight Back, though teachers at individual buildings voted on whether to participate.\n\nThe closed schools are: Academy of the Americas, Adult Education Center - West, A.L.

Many say they’re also concerned about stagnant wages, super-sized classes and Gov. Rick Snyder’s controversial plan to divide DPS into two, one to pay off the district's debt, the other to educate children\n\n\"I feel like if this is the only way that someone will at least listen to all the atrocities that are going on in DPS, then I support the teachers 100%,\" said Jeffrey Gisstennar, president of a parents group at Renaissance and father of a sophomore. \"Teachers have one of the most important jobs on the planet.\"\n\nPhotos: Dilapidated conditions inside Detroit Public Schools\n\nDPS is in danger of running out of cash by April or May, according to emergency manager Darnell Earley. The district’s total debt, including unfunded pension liabilities, is estimated to be as high as $3.5 billion.\n\nLast week, State Sen. Goeff Hansen, R-Hart, introduced two long-awaited bills aimed at revamping public education in Detroit. It would, among other things, add additional financial oversight and a school board made up of appointees of Snyder and Mayor Mike Duggan, the latter being a point of contention for Detroit lawmakers who want local control immediately.

She wondered: Could Horizon Realty Advisors, the management firm, demand money at the start of a tenancy for an anticipated landlord expense after they moved out?\n\n�She contacted us, and we confirmed it. The fee was improper,� Hutchinson Cox attorney Frank Gibson said.\n\nNow, Horizon Realty, which manages Chase Village and four other Eugene and Corvallis rental complexes, is repaying the $400 cleaning fee to more than 1,000 tenants, who sued in a class-action lawsuit claiming the fee violated state law.\n\nHorizon has already refunded $246,920 in fees it charged tenants between Dec. 23, 2014 and Dec. 22 of last year, under a settlement reached late last month, documents filed in Lane County Circuit Court show.\n\nAn additional $43,790 in refund checks had been sent but hadn�t been cashed as of April 30, the documents say.\n\nRental deposits are standard policy for landlords, providing money in case tenants leave property in disrepair. But landlords refund deposits to former occupants if rentals are left in good shape.\n\nBut the plaintiffs and attorneys in the Horizon Realty case argued the non-refundable fee violated state landlord-tenant laws, which allow fees for late rent payments, checks that bounce, damaged smoke detectors and violations of pet policies, but not for anticpated cleanup at the start of a tenancy.\n\nThe suit also claimed Horizon Realty collected the $400 fee without listing it in the written rental agreement tenants signed, another violation of state law.\n\nTenants in December filed a notice to sue Horizon Realty and Chase Village LLC, the entity that owns the apartment complex. They formally sued in February.\n\nSometime between the pending suit notice and the lawsuit�s filing, Horizon Realty began refunding the fees, court documents show.\n\nHorizon officials declined to comment.\n\nAccording to the court documents, the case began last August, when Dillon Redican and Jessica Gold moved into Chase Village, on Marche Chase Drive east of Autzen Stadium. The LCC students signed a one-year lease agreement and a �move-in addendum,� which included the non-refundable $400 �restoration charge,� to clean carpets and touch up paint after they moved out.\n\nMiller, the UO law student, moved into Chase Village around the same time, according Gibson, who represented the tenants in the case against Horizon Realty.\n\nGibson said that Miller became suspicious of the charge and contacted his law firm.\n\nMiller then confronted a manager at Chase Village, who refunded her the $400.\n\nRedican and Gold, friends of Miller, retained Gibson and filed a civil lawsuit against Chase Village LLC and Horizon Realty, on behalf of themselves and other tenants who paid the fee.\n\nThe suit was later changed to include owners of two other Eugene apartment complexes managed by Horizon � Stadium Park, just north of Chase Village, and Forest Hills, off Goodpasture Island Road � and two Corvallis apartment complexes.\n\nHorizon Realty didn�t defend the fee in court documents, nor did the firm admit any wrongdoing. Instead, it began sending written notices to tenants informing them that �Horizon Realty Advisors LLC will refund any non-refundable restoration fees paid by tenants.� The notices added that the firm �will not charge tenants at residential properties that they own or manage any fee that does not comply� with state landlord-tenant law.\n\nFollow Elon on Twitter @EGlucklich .

  "latent_24504": "ST. PAUL, MINN. — While the signing of Eric Staal and Chris Stewart were headlining events for the Minnesota Wild in free agency, the offseason has been significantly more interesting than that. It may actually prove to be an important summer for the future of the organization with many draft picks and free agent prospects entering the system, revitalizing a prospect pool that, within the pro ranks, was woefully thin.\n\nSam Anas getting a pro contract wasn’t the media feeding frenzy that Jimmy Vesey has seen coming out of college. However, the Quinnipiac forward had an impressive junior season. His 24 goals were tied for seventh in the nation. He ranked 10th in points (50), tied for 21st in points per game (1.16), tied for second in power-play goals (10) and tied for 14th in shots (143).\n\nThe 5-foot-8 center proved a lot. His hands and offensive skill are strong and his small stature says nothing about his strength on the ice. At the 2016 Frozen Four, he played through a significant shoulder injury, skating hard till the end of the tournament despite taking a number of rough shots to his shoulder from North Dakota throughout the national championship game.\n\nNow, speaking after the Wild’s July development camp at Xcel Energy Center, he says his shoulder is “almost 100 percent” and that he will be ready to go at the start of the season.\n\n“I got a couple extra weeks to train, which is good for me, as I’m rehabbing the shoulder. It’s been a good summer and I’m looking forward to training camp,” he said after looking like one of the team’s best prospects playing on a line with two 1st round picks, Joel Eriksson Ek and Alex Tuch, in a development camp scrimmage.\n\nHe’s entering an interesting situation. He’s likely to start the season with the AHL’s Iowa Wild, a team that will have a significantly different look than the last two seasons when they finished dead last in the American League. The arrival of Tuch, Anas, Nick Seeler, Adam Gilmour, Mario Lucia, Chase Lang and Pavel Jenys has the AHL club looking young and promising.\n\nThe Right Fit\n\nAnd though few players have come up from Iowa and made NHL time stick in the last two seasons, it’s the Wild’s track record developing college talent and getting them into the NHL on a regular basis that intrigued Anas when deciding where to take his talents.\n\n“It seemed like the right fit for me,” he said. “It seemed like they had a good success rate of developing guys in the AHL and bringing them up to the NHL, and not just having guys kinda get stuck in the AHL.\n\n“They’ve done well with college guys in the past and seem to have a good understanding of my skill set and the type of player that I am. ”\n\nNothing but goosebumps seeing Lord Stanley hoisted #dreams — Sam Anas (@samanas7) June 13, 2016\n\nAnas obviously hopes to get to the NHL, but he enters Iowa as a player who is used to winning and putting the puck in the net, something there hasn’t been an abundance of in Iowa since moving to Des Moines from Houston. Anas averaged over a point per game in his final year of juniors and in all three NCAA seasons. Each season of his collegiate career saw Quinnipiac gain a berth in the NCAA tournament and he helped lead the team to the championship game as an alternate captain in his final season.\n\nThat national championship loss was a difficult way for Anas to end his career with the Bobcats. “It was definitely tough,” he said. “That was the worst taste in my mouth at the end of the season. So close. To think I could go back for another year and we would have had such a good group of guys. It was definitely a stressful time to make the decision [to go pro], but I’m glad I’m here now.”\n\nIt’s a unique program at Quinnipiac. They aren’t often thought of being among college hockey’s powerhouses and they aren’t stacked with top NHL draft picks. Yet, they entered the 2016 tournament as the number one ranked team in the nation and it was their fourth straight berth in the tournament. In two of those trips they made it to the national championship.\n\nAnas learned a lot from the school and the program’s architect, Rand Pecknold. “I think the biggest thing about Quinnipiac is our work ethic. We don’t have 10, 12 draft picks like North Dakota did or Boston College did. But we had guys that worked hard.\n\n“When you work hard and play to your system, you’re going to win games. Guys don’t play selfishly. They play for the team. You see guys blocking shots, taking hits, making hits. It’s everyone playing team first. I think no matter what level you’re playing at, those teams always seem to find a way to win.”\n\nThe Road to St. Paul\n\nThere aren’t many of openings on the NHL roster, and there is plenty of competition for those final slots with returning fringe players between Jordan Schroeder and Tyler Graovac, as well as a load of Iowa players looking to work their way onto the NHL roster like Zac Dalpe, Christoph Bertschy, Grayson Downing, Brady Brassart and Zack Mitchell.\n\nThe road up isn’t easy, but Anas has talent. His dedication to the team’s system and ability to see the game develop could help him make his mark in Iowa and garner interest for a call-up. However, the team will have an eye on if he’s able to maintain those skills in a significantly more physical game at the pro level. His determination during the NCAA national championship is a good sign for his ability to grind it out and play his game despite adversity. If he can do that at the pro level, the Wild may have found a player capable of adding depth scoring, which could help incoming coach Bruce Boudreau field a team where every line is an offensive threat.",
  "latent_24807": "By By Stephen Morgan May 3, 2015 in Health Scientists have confirmed that Ebola can be transmitted more easily through sexual relations than was previously thought. A female partner of an Ebola survivor died recently in what appears to be a case of infection through sexual contact. What has surprised health experts is that it seems to show that the virus remains alive and transmittable at least 5 months after recovery. The The incident involved the death of a 44-year-old Liberian woman who was the sexual partner of a man who suffered Ebola symptoms last September, but survived. The woman became sick in March this year and died just one week after having sex with him. The disease is transmitted through contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, such as saliva, blood, sweat, semen, breast milk, mucus, vomit and feces. However, it is sufficiently virulent for someone to catch it through infected drinking vessels or contaminated surfaces and other materials. While scientists are researching further into the incident, all the evidence in this case, points to the woman having been infected with the Ebola infection through sexual relations. Until now, scientists thought that patients were no longer contagious once they had recovered. The exception was that the virus might remain active in semen for the following three months. Therefore, health officials advised former patients to use condoms or abstain from sex for this period. That limitation now looks to have been overly optimistic. Until now, medial workers say they can only confirm 10 such cases, but \"We have suspected that having sexual contact with survivors could be a potential way for people to become infected. Prior to this outbreak we did have messages given to male survivors to abstain from sex for three months and they were provided condoms.\" Officials are now telling Ebola survivors to refrain from unprotected sex indefinitely. \"Until more information is known, contact with semen from a male survivor should be avoided. If male survivors have sex (oral, vaginal, or anal), a condom should be used correctly and consistently every time.\" At the moment, they are saying that abstinence and protection will not be life-long recommendations, but they can't yet give any precise estimates of how long it should last. More than 3,800 of the Ebola virus deaths were in Sierra Leone alone, according to World Health Organization's (WHO) figures Francisco Leong, AFP/File On the positive side, they believe that female Ebola survivors cannot transmit the virus because of differences in the reproductive system and immune cells which search out viruses. Even so, there are lots of \"ifs\" \"coulds\" and \"maybes\" surrounding the medical prognoses and public statements. The fact is that experts aren't really sure how long the virus remains transmittable, not only through semen, but other bodily fluids, because only a very small number of survivors have been studied. The World Health Organization, the C.D.C. and the Sierra Leone health ministry are just setting up an investigation to try to get more precise information on how long different bodily fluids remain contagious after a person is cured. However, if latest evidence proves that it can still be transmitted sexually after recovery, then we could be into an entirely new ball game. The spread of Ebola's could become far more insidious than now, effectively transforming it into a Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD). Of course, there are many differences between HIV/AIDS and Ebola, which experts can elaborate on, but there are also enough similarities to cause concern. Superficially, it might be reassuring that, another of the sexual partners of the man who transmitted Ebola to the dead Liberian woman, tested negative to the virus. But, the fact that he actually had two sexual partners in 7 months, shows how sexual habits and promiscuity can become one of Ebola's important transmission belts. One of the reasons why HIV spread more rapidly after its initial beginnings at the start of the 20th century was the urbanization of African countries. The building of major cities brought millions of people into close contact and that is even more so today. Cities led to a growth of promiscuity and prostitution and travelers brought HIV across the oceans to other countries. A typical squatter camp in South Africa, known officially as an \"informal settlement.\" flickr/hadsie However, a key reason why HIV was able to eventually become an epidemic, was that it was a silent killer. It spread rapidly, because there was a delay of many years between HIV infection and symptoms of AIDS. This meant those infected were passing it on to many partners without knowing it and the medical community only became aware of the virus once sufficient numbers of deaths eventually brought it their attention, and by which time it had taken on epidemic proportions. A key difference between AIDS and Ebola is the time between infection and full-blown symptoms. With Ebola, it is only a matter of days and that reduces the \"window of of opportunity\" for its spread as a sexually transmitted disease, though not its highly infectious character generally. Its symptoms are now more easily recognized by trained medical staff, which AIDS wasn't initially. Someone traveling internationally, who is sick, is much more likely to be diagnosed with Ebola than a person with HIV. However, it isn't those with Ebola symptoms who are principally spreading the virus in an STD form, but those who believe they are cured, and, therefore, don't know or don't believe that they are still infectious. This the twist; in effect it would be as if someone cured of AIDS could still pass on the illness, but in the case of Ebola, unlike HIV, it could kill within days. Given human nature, rationalizations and denial of illness is very common, and health warnings are unlikely to have much effect in stopping survivors from having sex, even if it is for only 6 months. The strict measures taken by health organizations and governments in Africa have succeeded in containing the disease for the moment, but, lets face it, policing sex is a practical impossibility. Reflecting these difficulties, Pauline Oosterhoff, who is a fellow at the Institute of Development Studies and a member of the Ebola Response Anthropology Platform wrote in the \"When I met members of a women’s secret society in Sierra Leone this February, they proposed drastic measures to stop Ebola from spreading through sexual contact...Male survivors need to be locked up because they cannot control their urge to have sex. Women need to be locked up because they cannot stop their husbands from forcing sex upon them. When I asked them whether using condoms might be easier than quarantine, I was greeted with rolling eyes and hissing. Their men would never accept this. “They would put holes in the condoms as soon as they saw them”. Female condoms? Forget it. “They are disgusting. They get stuck deep into women’s body.” There can be no doubt that Ebola could spread internationally through sexual contact. It is thought that HIV became a global epidemic after just one individual entered the US from Central Africa and Haiti. In regards to Ebola, some 24,000 people were infected with the disease in the last six months. In Western cities today, the same conditions are favorable for the spread of Ebola, as they were for HIV. Prostitution, involving multiple partners in a day, can become a fast lane for infection, when their clients then pass it on to the general population. The incredible speed at which Ebola could grow has been shown recently by the rapid spread of HIV among intravenous drug users in rural Indiana. While Ebola is not the same as HIV, the potential spread of the virus through sexual contact has apparently been underestimated. This should give us concern for a potential \"second wave\" of sexually transmitted Ebola infections, not only in Africa, but internationally. Until now, medical experts believed that survivors of the Ebola disease would only remain contagious as sexual partners for 3 months after their recovery. But new evidence tends to show that the infectious period can last almost twice as long.A female partner of an Ebola survivor died recently in what appears to be a case of infection through sexual contact. What has surprised health experts is that it seems to show that the virus remains alive and transmittable at least 5 months after recovery.The New York Times says that Ebola genetic material was found in a sample of semen which the man provided 175 days after he developed Ebola symptoms, which makes it 74 days longer than ever before found in a survivor.The incident involved the death of a 44-year-old Liberian woman who was the sexual partner of a man who suffered Ebola symptoms last September, but survived.

In the process, \"Bigfoot\" and \"Super Samoan\" proved that, despite being big men, they could lay it all on the line for five rounds, if need be.\n\nWhile impressive, former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Lightweight Champion Ben Henderson plans on showing the mixed martial arts (MMA) world -- and the heavyweights -- just what it's like to go \"hard\" for 25 minutes during his 155-pound main event fight against Josh Thomson at UFC on FOX 10 on Jan. 25, 2014.\n\n\"Smooth\" breaks it down to UFC.com::\n\n\"I think this is a great match-up, stylistically. You are going to see both of us going hard. I can and have gone 25 minutes and so has he. We've both gone all-out for five rounds at a high pace. I'm not talking about a slow 25 minutes like we sometimes see with heavyweights, where they just lean on one another; I'm talking about a non-stop, fast-paced 25-minute fight where both guys are getting after it.

We're maybe not great in one specific area that outshines all others, but we are both pretty solid in all areas. Fans are going to see a true mixed martial arts fight here. A lot of times a fight will stay standing for the full 25 minutes and people say what a great fight it was. But that's a kickboxing fight. I'm talking about an MMA fight between Josh and I.

It is a fact recognized by the U.S. and most other countries in the world,” read an August 8 letter to Corvallis city leaders from China’s Consulate in San Francisco.\n\n“To avoid our precious friendship from being tainted by so-called ‘Tibet Independence’ and ‘Taiwan Independence,’ we sincerely hope you can understand our concerns and adopt effective measures to stop the activities advocating ‘Tibet Independence’ and ‘Taiwan Independence’ in Corvallis,” it added.\n\nThe brightly colored mural, painted last month, runs 100 feet long and about 10 feet high along the top of a building at a busy intersection owned by businessman David Lin, who came to America from Taiwan in the 1970s.\n\nThe mural shows the immolation of a Tibetan monk against a bright yellow background and depicts a Tibetan monk being beaten by Chinese police, in addition to what the Corvallis Gazette-Times described as “images of Taiwan as a bulwark of freedom.”\n\nLin, 65, told Reuters he had long been concerned about China’s role in Taiwan and Tibet, and commissioned the mural because: “I feel that somebody has to stand up and do something.”\n\nA city official said Lin had indicated he had no intention of taking down the mural, and municipal leaders said they had informed the consular officials that there was no room for the city government to get involved in such a matter.\n\n“I responded to them that I was sorry to learn the art work caused concern,” Corvallis Mayor Julie Manning said, adding that she told Chinese officials in a written response that the U.S. Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, “and this includes freedom of artistic expression.”\n\nThe Chinese consulate then sent representatives to Corvallis to express concern in person on September 4.

  "latent_25070": "The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing launched back in May 2013, proving to be a sleeper hit among the gamers with its no-nonsense action combat and dark, Gothic settings. Fast forward a year, and the sequel is now available.\n\nWhat has changed since the first game? Or rather, are there any major changes given the relatively short 1-year development span? MMOGames’ Robert finds out from the staff of development studio, NeocoreGames.\n\nQ: Hi there, this is Robert from MMOGames. Can you please introduce yourself to our readers?\n\nA: Hey, I’m Julia, PR Manager at NeocoreGames, I’ll answer your questions with a little help from the other developers. If you consider them the parents of Van Helsing, I guess I’m like his godmother.\n\nQ: Not many people have heard of NeocoreGames. Can you briefly describe the company to us? For example, how many employees are there, where are you located etc.\n\nA: NeocoreGames is a small but growing indie developer in the heart of a small (and not really growing) European country, Hungary. The location and our roots have a lot to do with our beloved imaginary world, Borgovia. At the moment we have 40 people in our team and currently we don’t have any plans for additional expansion in the future. We prefer to keep it low because we’re not just team members but friends, in some cases even family members (married couples, siblings, cousins are also working in the team).\n\nQ: I mentioned the first game, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, in my introduction above as a sleeper hit. How true is this?\n\nA: Fortunately it’s true! The first Van Helsing game was on the “10 top sellers” list on Steam for weeks and as an indie developer it was an amazing experience for us. Our fans are devoted and their feedback helps us a lot with polishing the game. We really hope that we can give them more and more of what they like about the Van Helsing trilogy with the second part and next year with the third part of the game.\n\nQ: A year is definitely not long in making a sequel and having it available for sale. When exactly did development for The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II started?\n\nA: From the very beginning it was planned to be a trilogy, so the story and the outlines were ready before the first part came out. Although the main part of the development for Van Helsing II started after the release of the first part, it’s more like a continuous development. Our team is quite small, but the workload is shared among smaller groups, which makes it easier to deal with the DLCs, occasionally fix the bugs and develop the next part of the game at the same time. Also there are other (top secret) projects in progress.\n\nQ: What was the toughest problem faced during the development phase? And how was it solved?\n\nA: Sometimes the best thing about making bad decisions is that years later you look back and you can ask yourself with some truly honest amusement: “What were we thinking?” The very first incarnation of Van Helsing more or less resembled an anime-style character for various reasons, which we decided to change when we realized that it wouldn’t fit the desired atmosphere anymore. So we let the fans choose from three different characters and the community decided which one they prefered the most. Of course now we love our grim and tough Van Helsing much more than his first incarnation, a way too young and much too blond hero (by the way, you can find him in Van Helsing II as an easter egg).\n\nQ: In terms of storyline, is there a continuation from the first game? Have the settings changed drastically?\n\nA: The story of Van Helsing II picks up right where the first part left off. After Van Helsing defeated Fulmigati with the help of our charming Lady Katarina, it turns out that it was only the beginning of the real war. New enemies make their appearance and your Resistance is willing to face the challenge, so you can expect some serious battles in Van Helsing II. We stick to the gothic-noir-steampunk setting in all parts of the trilogy but the setting got a little more colorful with tons of new places, buildings, mountains and forests. Also we added dynamic weather effect to the game so there are some big changes but they all fit in the Van Helsing universe that we imagined at the very beginning.\n\nQ: Why the decision to allow players to import their characters from the first game?\n\nA: Easy question. Since The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a trilogy with – as you said – quite short development time between the parts we wanted to allow players to play all three parts, the whole game with one character from the very beginning until the final boss fight.\n\nQ: What was the one problem most persistent in the original game, which Neocore has fixed/ revamped in the new game?\n\nA: Well, we had problems with the multiplayer mode in the first game because of server problems. During the development of the second part we released patches, and constantly patched it up. Then we decided to implement a brand new netcode and a dedicated server has been set up to handle the communications between players and finally it worked. So basically we fixed the multiplayer problems before we released the second part, which obviously has the new netcode. According to the feedback from our fans it works perfectly now.\n\nQ: What inspired the new character classes in the sequel? And how are they different from each other in terms of uniqueness?\n\nA: With the first game we had a concept about Van Helsing being a Hunter, who can be ranged or melee of course and you can change it any time. But it turned out that our fans wanted more and quite different classes. Why did we choose the Thaumaturge and the Arcane Mechanic? I don’t think we have to explain the mage type character in an action RPG, with spectacular spells. The Arcane Mechanic although fits perfectly in the game’s steam-punk, gothic setting with all his gadgets and unique weapons. Of course all three classes have their own gear, skill trees, spells. The most important is that all three classes require different fight technics and tactics, for example with the Thaumaturge you have to be tactical because he has high damage and low HP, the Arcane Mechanic although has a whole army with himself thanks to his summoning skills.\n\nQ: Other than the intense combat, could you briefly guide us through some of the new features which are added?\n\nA: Gladly! In Van Helsing II we extended the Tower Defense mini-game a lot, now it’s more integrated in the game, it has 7 levels and it’s also optional (players can choose other quests instead of TD). We introduced the Trophy system, which allows players to decorate their Lair with trophies that give global modifiers to the game world, like empowering monsters, granting more spellpower to all allies or turning Katarina into a more lethal ghost. The Runecrafting system allows players to alter items to their liking. Beside Katarina, Van Helsing has a pet this time, called Chimera. I’ve already mentioned the Resistance management which is an important new feature in the game.\n\nQ: I must say that is an impressive list of new features. About the multiplayer co-op function, why is there a limit of 4 players imposed?\n\nA: The reason to this is not technical it’s more like an aRPG concept. More than 4 players would result in a cluttered game map, if you count in the 4 Katarinas, the Chimeras and the hordes of monsters. It would be a chaos. I guess that’s why they cut down the players in co-op with Diablo 3 too.\n\nQ: How many weapons, armors and gears are there for players to collect?\n\nA: Actually much more than in the first game: there are more than 250 unique weapon models, 50 plus set items and the total item count is more than 1000.\n\nQ: Another action RPG game, Diablo III, had its fair share of problem regarding to loot drop since launch. Will it be a potential problem in the game?\n\nA: We really don’t think that it can be a problem in Van Helsing II. The class specific loot dropping is balanced well.\n\nQ: Will players get to face the nemesis of Van Helsing, Count Dracula, in the game?\n\nA: Without spoiling anything, let’s just say that Van Helsing will finally have his chance to face not one, but more of his traditional enemies.\n\nQ: Are there any features of the game you will like to specifically highlight to our readers and convince them The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II is “the” game?\n\nA: I think the humor is what makes it “the” game. The Easter Eggs and pop-cultural references in the first part were a big success according to the feedback and humor is a really important part of the game anyway, we put much more of it in the second game. Hope you’ll like it!\n\nQ: Now that the game has launched, what is next for the Van Helsing universe, both short term and long term?\n\nA: We just released the first DLC (Ink Hunt) for Van Helsing II and there will be a couple more DLCs in the near future. We also have another top secret (and very exciting) project to announce before the release of the third part of the game that you can expect sometime next year!\n\nThank you for your time!\n\nRelated: Action",
  "latent_25216": "“Bad things should happen to bad people. We find someone not so bad, maybe he'll end up not so dead.”\n\nSera is an elven archer and companion in Dragon Age: Inquisition. She can be recruited during the quest A Friend of Red Jenny and is a potential romance option for a female Inquisitor.\n\nContents show]\n\nBackground\n\nSera is impulsive and reactionary, taking delight in humbling the established authority she views as arrogant and selfish. For her, it's not about what's right, it's about what's right now. She sees actions taken for the 'greater good' as just an excuse to hurt others who don't deserve it simply because it's easier. She was a member of the enigmatic group of rogues known as the Friends of Red Jenny, yet the coming of the Breach terrified her.[1] Fortunately, Sera and her \"friends\" can be frightening, too, and if she needs to put an arrow through some baddies so regular people can sleep at night, so be it. Sera fights for those caught in the middle, but she also needs order restored. The world has to be normal so she can play.\n\nSera was orphaned as a child in Denerim and was caught stealing at a young age. She remembers being from the Elven Alienage in Denerim as an infant, though Sera denies this and rejects the \"arsehole\" residents of the alienage as well as its \"stupid\" Vhenadahl, that so-called \"real\" elves always have and pray to.[2][3] Lady Taraline Emmald, a sick and barren woman, took her in and became Sera's patron. When she died of sickness, well before the Blight, Sera inherited her estate, but rejected it and the fortune that came with it. Being raised by humans, as well as the psychological abuse faced during her time as Lady Emmald's ward, cemented a distinctly non-elven point of view and a disregard for elven culture in general.[4] Sera's skills as a rogue and archer are self-taught, not trained by others.\n\nInvolvement\n\nDragon Age: Inquisition\n\nThis section contains spoilers for :\n\nDragon Age: Inquisition.\n\nAfter the Inquisitor meets with the Chantry and templars at Val Royeaux, an arrow with a message attached lands nearby, giving the locations of three satchels with instructions. Should the Inquisitor choose to follow these clues, resulting in confronting an Orlesian nobleman, who assumes that the Inquisition was targeting him. Then suddenly, Sera reveals herself and executes the noble with an arrow. She then introduces herself to the Inquisitor and offers to join the Inquisition to fight for those stuck in the middle of the chaos. While in Haven, a Herald who is not a Rogue may ask Sera, through a dialog option, to open the locked doors in the lower level of the Chantry. To do this, interact with one of the locked doors and the message \"Requires a rogue\" will appear, unlocking the necessary dialogue option with Sera (\"I need a lock picked.\"). On PC, if the message does not appear, try going into mouselook mode and using the interact button instead of the mouse. At Skyhold, Sera will surprise the Inquisitor by planning a picnic on the roof (only if your approval is high enough). Sera tells the tale of how her foster mother, Lady Emmald, lied to her about being unable to make cookies and kept the truth about buying cookies from the baker by telling her he [the baker] hated elves. When she discovered the truth, she resented Lady Emmauld and had an aversion to cookies ever since; calling them \"pride cookies\" because it reminded her that her foster mother elicited an unwarranted hatred between her and the baker and made her insecure about herself just to protect her own pride. She tells the Inquisitor she wants to make better cookies so she can overcome all the issues she associates with them and like them again. At any time, the Inquisitor can ask Sera to leave by telling her that she doesn't fit in with the Inquisition. If Sera's approval is too low, she confronts the Inquisitor and calls them an expletive. She expresses her disapproval of their abuse of power and is concerned life won't be \"normal\" again. If in a romance with the Inquisitor, she breaks up with her. The Inquisitor can threaten her or tell her to leave which causes her to leave the Inquisition. Alternatively the Inquisitor can convince her to stay for the sake of the \"little people\" she wishes to protect. If her approval continues to drop, she will eventually leave the Inquisition on her own. At any time, the Inquisitor can ask Sera to leave by telling her that she doesn't fit in with the Inquisition.

She invites the Inquisitor to partake in playing some pranks on people by throwing pies at random passerby's faces. Afterwards, they discuss possible changes to the Inquisition once the Exalted Council is over and invites the Inquisitor to be a Red Jenny. When Maryden Halewell starts singing \"Sera Was Never\", Sera breaks her lute calling the song creepy. In the end Sera went back to her life as a Red Jenny. If In the end Sera went back to her life as a Red Jenny. If Cassandra or Leliana is Divine, she offers the services of the Friends of Red Jenny to the Divine should the nobles get out of line. If not romanced, she has a romantic relationship with Dagna whom she affectionately nicknames \"Widdle\".\n\nInitial statistics\n\nDespite being an elf, Sera is \"human-trained\" rather than \"elf-trained\" for the purposes of what armor she can wear. She is the only companion with this quirk.\n\nEquipment\n\nWeapons Firm Hunting Longbow Firm Hunting Longbow Common Bow\n\nRequires: Level 3\n\nDamage: 50\n\n+6% Flanking Damage Bonus Armor Hunter Coat Hunter Coat Common Medium Armor\n\nRequires: Level 7\n\nArmor: 92-99\n\n+3 Cunning\n\nApproval\n\nSera was raised by humans and doesn't see herself as being particularly elven. Asking her about or supporting anything \"elfy\", such as elven heritage and the history of elves, will cause her to disapprove. She likes the world to be simple and believes most problems can be solved by fighting things out, but she is also frightened of magic and will disapprove of any actions supporting magic or mage freedom.\n\nSera is not used to acceptance from others, which means that she is slow to trust and does not respond well to people questioning her motives or actions. Agreeing with her will give approval and disagreeing with/questioning her will give disapproval.\n\nSera is unique amongst Inquisition's companions in that the amount of approval she gives may vary depending on the Inquisitor's race. Qunari will gain the most approval with her and elves will gain the least. Elves may also gain additional disapproval under certain circumstances.\n\nRomance\n\nThe player can start flirting with Sera soon after recruiting her into their party. Upon welcoming her into the Inquisition, the player has the option to tell Sera that they think they'll like having her around and they hope she feels the same. If the Inquisitor is female, Sera will flirt back. She will also mention that she'll need to start calling the Inquisitor something other than \"Herald\".\n\nIf a female Inquisitor has flirted with her at any point, Sera will approve if she's asked about herself. She will flirt back, saying \"Oh, yeah? Interested, are you?\"\n\nAlthough Sera's romance is available for all female Inquisitors, she will respond to the Inquisitor differently depending on their race and class. For instance, Sera expresses a particular fondness for female Qunari. (In her words, \"Woof.\") Alternatively, she has the hardest time opening up to a Dalish elf Inquisitor, due to her distaste of everything \"elfy\". Sera is also scared of magic and will express distaste about the Inquisitor's magic use if she is a mage, such as asking the Inquisitor to use less magic once they've chosen a specialisation, although the Inquisitor can gain approval by reassuring her that they'd never do anything to disappoint her. As the romance progresses, Sera will express that the Inquisitor is an exception to her beliefs about magic during party banter.\n\nAfter the Herald reaches Skyhold and is titled \"Inquisitor\", they can begin to pursue their romance with Sera more seriously. Sera will pull the player aside and congratulate them on their title, as well as express concern about The Elder One and what he means for her religious beliefs. During the conversation, she will say, \"How pretty are you that I actually think this shite is possible?\" If the Inquisitor flirts back, Sera will say that they should \"see how things go\" in terms of their relationship.\n\nAfter that, the Inquisitor is able to ask Sera at any time about where their relationship might be going. If Sera does not have high enough approval to pursue the relationship, she will continue to say that she needs to get to know the Inquisitor better. During this time, the Inquisitor can bring Sera along on missions in order to raise her approval. One opportunity for large amounts of approval comes after the completion of Sera's personal quest, when the Inquisitor can support Sera's actions or tell her that she caused too much harm. If the Inquisitor supports her, Sera will greatly approve and say that she is not used to \"that acceptance thing you're doing\". She'll say that the \"Lady\" Inquisitor is on her good side, and that she hopes that it lasts.\n\nAs her approval improves, a cutscene will occur where Sera tells the Inquisitor that the Inquisition needs pranks. If the player takes part in each prank, Sera will slightly approve. At this point the Inquisitor should have enough approval to officially begin the relationship by asking about where their relationship is headed. This will prompt a cutscene where Sera will say that she's noticed the flirting and seen the looks that the Inquisitor has been giving her. She will tell the Inquisitor that she likes her and doesn't want to share her. The Inquisitor can choose to decline the romance during this conversation, officially begin the romance and leave to go have sex with Sera, or begin the romance but state that she wants to wait before they begin having sex together. Sera will also start calling the Inquisitor a random nickname during this conversation. If the Inquisitor responds negatively to the nickname, Sera will change it to a different random nickname, but she will only do this once.\n\nAfter the relationship officially begins, the Inquisitor is able to kiss Sera any time she wants to when she's in Skyhold. Once Sera's approval is high enough, there will be a cutscene where the player eats cookies on the roof with Sera. After this cutscene they are also able to spend time together on the roof at any time the player chooses.\n\nIf the Inquisitor takes Sera adventuring, Sera will occasionally make passing references to their relationship during party banter, or make comments that prompt the Inquisitor to remark upon it. For example, Sera will propose a plan to Blackwall wherein she seduces a hypothetical man. The Inquisitor will object and Sera will then explain that at the point in the plan when the man proposes sleeping with her, Sera will tell him that she prefers his wife and then punch him in the face.\n\nEventually, Sera will mention to the Inquisitor that she bought them a hat. While the hat ended up being stuffed with apples in an attempt to mock Corypheus, the gift begins to make the Inquisitor wonder if she should give Sera a gift in return to express her fondness. The quest A Woman Who Wants for Nothing will begin, and the Inquisitor must ask the other members of the Inquisition if they know what type of gift she can buy Sera.\n\nWhile most of the Inquisition will make negative comments about the Inquisitor romancing Sera in response, talking to everyone is the only way that the quest can be completed. Most companions will not have any suggestions, but Vivienne will sarcastically remark that the Inquisitor should just shave her pubic hair to say something crude. The Inquisitor can agree or decline. If the Inquisitor rejects the idea in conversation with Vivienne, Dorian will also suggest it.\n\nRegardless of the Inquisitor's choice, she will need to talk to Sera after she has finally talked to everyone else in the Inquisition. When the Inquisitor mentions that she asked everyone for a gift idea but has no idea what to get, Sera will respond gleefully pleased over the fact that the Inquisitor talked to anyone at all about their relationship. The fact that the Inquisitor told everyone that she's the Inquisitor's lover makes her delighted, and she claims it's the best gift ever. She pulls the Inquisitor to bed as thanks, and the screen will fade to black as they kiss.\n\nIf the Inquisitor agreed to Vivienne's idea instead, a scene will show a naked Sera and Inquisitor in bed with Sera laughing in disbelief that the Inquisitor shaved something into her pubic hair. Sera will fall off of the bed in laughter and pull the Inquisitor down with her.\n\nAfter What Pride Had Wrought, Sera will comment that she believes everything in the temple was from demons, and not the elven gods. The inquisitor can say she disagrees, and if she is Dalish, she can remind Sera that she believes in the Creators. This will result in a fight, where the relationship will end, (with Sera saying she should have known she wasn't \"elfy enough\" for the Inquisitor) or the player can agree to Sera's request to say she was \"just kidding\" about her religious beliefs, continuing the relationship. Sera will disapprove if other races say \"But it's important\" or \"I've said I'm not her Herald\", but she will only end a relationship with an elf.\n\nWhen the Inquisitor approaches Sera later in the game, she will angrily tell the Inquisitor to leave her alone before attempting to storm off. The Inquisitor will follow Sera, demanding to know what she did wrong. Sera will say that she had a dream where the Inquisitor died. She claims that dreams show stuff that she doesn't want to think about. She will spend some time yelling at the Inquisitor about things in their relationship that piss her off, but she will gradually imply that she's actually angry about the fact that she's falling in love with the Inquisitor. The Inquisitor can point this out to her, or end their romance then. If the Inquisitor points out Sera's overuse of the word \"love\" in her angry rant, and tells Sera that she loves her back, Sera will respond by angrily tackling the Inquisitor around the waist as the screen fades to black. There will be a short scene afterwards where the Inquisitor and Sera are drinking together as says, \"We really need a bigger gap between fighting and kissing.\"\n\nThis section contains spoilers for:\n\nTrespasser.\n\nIf the Inquisitor is still in a relationship with Sera during the events of Trespasser , Sera will ask the Inquisitor to marry her. The Inquisitor can either say that it's enough that Sera is with her, or call her a loony and say, \"All the yesses. Every frigging one.\"\n\nQuotes\n\n(When meeting the Inquisitor for the first time.) \"The important thing is: you glow. You're the Herald thingy?\"\n\n\"The important thing is: you glow. You're the Herald thingy?\" (While removing an arrow from the aforementioned noble's head.) \"Blah, blah, blah! Obey me! Arrow in my face!\"\n\n\"Blah, blah, blah! Obey me!

After the Inquisitor defeats the Elder One, Sera will join the Inquisitor in her chambers when the Inquisition celebrates at Skyhold. Sera will confess how much she loves the Inquisitor's ability to stay herself despite all of the \"Herald\" stuff, and she can't wait to continue to stay by the Inquisitor's side. The two of them will walk out on to the balcony, looking over the beautiful landscape together as the scene fades to black and the credits roll (closing on a suggestion from Sera to push the bed off the balcony to see what happens).\n\nCodex entry: Sera\n\nCodex entry: \"Sera Was Never\"\n\nSera's Cabinet of Wonder Whose It Was\n\nSera's Past and Now Things",
  "latent_25244": "Every so often, the presentational masks acquired down the years by British conservatism slip. If only for a moment, the supposed convictions Tory politicians bang on about are reduced to mere window dressing, and what cynical old lefties tend to talk about as the venal pursuit of class interests suddenly looks like a matter of unanswerable fact. In UK terms, this might be the political meaning of the Panama Papers and David Cameron’s woefully belated admission that he did benefit from his father’s offshore activities. In a season of Tory nightmares and whatever the knock-on effect for the Labour party, the upshot is a sudden and sobering look at what the Tories might actually stand for.\n\nTen questions the prime minister has to answer about the Panama files Read more\n\nCameron would like us to think of his politics as a hybrid of the two strands of conservatism that preceded him: the belief in hard work and self-reliance embodied by Margaret Thatcher, and the patrician, socially concerned Toryism which still has a place in some Conservatives’ hearts. The result has been what the Tories have been selling us for the last 10 years: a utopia of home ownership and endless graft, where so long as you avoid being on “welfare”, the joys of social mobility can be yours, and we are – of course – all in this together.\n\nOn a bad day, this can still look like the politics of spivvery and cruelty, but the way that Cameron’s poshness spoke vaguely of noblesse oblige and social concern was arguably central to holding the whole package together. Perhaps, in the English imagination, cut-glass vowels still suggest falling-down country houses, the reassuring smell of horses and tweedy penury. Certainly, when Cameron has had to distance himself from financial and corporate misbehaviour, his accent and disposition have proved quite useful.\n\nBut the reality, as the headlines now buzzing around the prime minister prove, is that what remains of the old landed classes has largely blurred into the moneyed elites whose habits have once again been revealed in this week’s news: rich enough to buy property in the most expensive districts of the world’s big cities, and well acquainted with the world of offshore finance. Yes, career politicians of the centre left have had their own problems with such associations, which partly explains why Hillary Clinton cannot shake off Bernie Sanders, and why the reinvented Labour party now defines itself against Tony Blair. But despite the fact that Tory links with financial sharp practice are as old as time, the right kind of story can still hurt them too.\n\nWhich brings us to the letter we now know Cameron wrote to the president of the European council in November 2013, warning him against transparency moves on offshore trusts, its neat fit with the Cameron family’s complicated finances, and the extent to which, as he now confesses, the prime minister himself benefited. Only weeks before his message to Brussels, Cameron had given a speech to the Conservative conference assuring anyone listening that “this party is on the side of working people”, and rather condescendingly identifying the latter as those who set store by “never giving up, working those extra hours, coping with those necessary cuts”.\n\nCameron and Osborne’s supposedly exacting approach to public finances obviously had its limits\n\n“We build a land of opportunity,” he insisted. But in the letter, he specifically suggested to Herman Van Rompuy that offshore vehicles used for what high-end financial advisers call “inheritance planning” might best be left alone. Cameron and Osborne’s supposedly exacting approach to public finances obviously had its limits. And the prime minister clearly had a keen sense of his core constituency. As one wag put it on Twitter this week, “How fortunate for people with money in offshore trusts that the prime minister went out to bat for them.” Quite so. On top of Cameron’s problems, the role of an array of Tory donors named in the Panama Papers comes with an air of grinding familiarity. Then there are Osborne’s evasive answers to questions about whether he has benefited from offshore chicanery and other matters that are on the public record – such as the fact that in 2005, his family firm gained £6m from a complex London property deal with a firm based in the British Virgin Islands. And what of the Conservatives’ increasingly hopeless-looking candidate for London mayor?. Zac Goldsmith’s family wealth has long been held in a trust based in Switzerland, until 2010 he was registered as a non-dom, and he owns two valuable houses acquired through companies registered in the Cayman Islands. His veneer of ecological concern and vague bohemianism cannot quite distract from all this, nor from the fact that his quietly formidable Labour opponent Sadiq Khan is engaging in a modern class politics, to evidently positive effect.\n\nSome Tories are keenly aware of this stuff. With a leadership contest looming, they advise that the party ought to think very carefully. It might cast its collective mind back to 2005 and the rash decision to spurn that council-estate alumnus David Davis. It should consider that, whatever his financial arrangements, Boris Johnson might carry too much of the whiff of metropolitan privilege, and that there might be more to be said for either the comparative ordinariness of Theresa May, or – judging from recent whispers – the up-by-his-bootstraps new work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb. We shall see.\n\nOver the past few weeks I have spent more time than usual in London. One of the most illuminating experiences you can have in the modern capital is to take a ride on the Docklands light railway at around 6am, when the workers who keep the City going travel to their jobs. They have come from all over the planet, and they surely believeas a matter of instinct in the gospel of hard graft, self-reliance and social mobility that you hear from most Tory politicians.\n\nThe trains take them from the edges of south and east London – Beckton, Lewisham, Deptford – to Canary Wharf, which is when the awful inequality of modern Britain hits you like a hammer. And herein lies the problem for centre-right politics all over the world. As long as it seems to speak for the people in the Docklands penthouses rather than on the trains – the skivers rather than the strivers, perhaps – its problems will extend into the distance.",
  "latent_25586": "Kal-El Bogdanove writes;\n\nJon Bogdanove has been gone a long time.\n\nOr at least that’s what people think. And it’s true that since his epic run on Superman: The Man of Steel, which included the record-breaking success of The Death and Return of Superman, my father’s work has been hard to find.\n\nIn reality, he wasn’t gone, just out of sight, busily doing designs for DC Licensing that have ended up on everything from lunch boxes, to toys, to Six-Flags rides. You might not have noticed because most of those designs were done indistinguishably in the style of other artists – a skill that my dad first demonstrated drawing Batmen of every description in MoS #37, and on which Warner Home Products has relied since. He has also done spec pre-vis for several film and TV projects, now floating around now in the nebulous world of development. He even served as art director of a video game – hand animating the playable demo for what would have been Reverge Labs’ follow-up to Skullgirls, had that lovely little company not foundered.\n\nBut as far as mainstream comics fans are concerned, Jon Bogdanove has been in the wind.\n\nHe returns now to the world of comics, in collaboration with me and my writing partner Chris Faiella, on an all new title, Strongman. The book follows the adventures of Bron Bellman, a 1920s circus athlete who doubles as a pulp hero. Together with a troupe of lovable sideshow folk – who live somewhere between Todd Browning’s Freaks and Louise Simonson’s X-Men – Bron travels the world, getting in scrapes and defending the little guy.\n\nStrongman began his/its life as a video game pitch. It was one of ten or twelve our trio imagined on behalf of Reverge, to be brought to Disney Interactive. It was one of the two Disney selected as favorites – ultimately eschewed for being a shade too spooky. After that, the three of us soldiered on with the other ill-fated project – beloved in its own right – but none of us could let Strongman go. Each, on his own time, tinkered with the idea in secret, and ultimately we came together – each prepared to make the same confession: that he’d been noodling with Strongman in his off hours. After that, we realized we had no choice, we would have to bring Strongman to fruition in one form or another.\n\nThe book is a love note to all the things we like, and hope others will like too: Bron is an admixture of several real-life period strongmen who were capable of amazing things (for fun Google The Mighty Adam or Louis Cyr), pulp staples like Doc Savage, and the spirit of Jerry and Joe’s Superman. The world he inhabits wanders through Lovecraftian horror, hard-boiled prohibition crime, and fanciful Russo-Finnish folklore. And most importantly, the characters live and breathe in each other’s lives and hearts, in that way that makes you want to slip off and stay among them for longer than the stories can possibly last.\n\nWe desperately want to make a book where the stakes are intimate, personal, and human. We don’t want to tease you with twelve-issue galaxy spanning crises. We want you to have the vaguely Whovian experience of sitting down with any one of these stories, and feeling something resonant… Of turning the last page and feeling satisfied, like you got a real meal.\n\nAnd we’ve decided to bring all this about – the launch of a new series, the reclamation of a lost idea, and Jon Bogdanove’s return to comics – by way of Kickstarter – that democratic, crowd-funding ray of hope for indie comics.\n\nAnd to be honest, we may have mangled it from the get-go.\n\nWe launched at SDCC, which we have learned too-late, is the Kickstarter equivalent of beginning your safe trip through a lion’s den by rolling in honey and dusting yourself with Mrs. Dash. Actually, that’s a bit of a broken simile since it makes us sound irresistibly delicious, when what we really were was absolutely frack-all buried in the avalanche of awesome-splosion that is Comic Con. We even had some articles written up… no soap.\n\nA week later we are stalled at about $10k, a sight short of our goal of $200,000. And this last may be our other big mistake. Folks have expressed a bit of – to borrow Russ Burlingame’s phrase – “sticker shock” at our goal.\n\nI must admit I take a bit of issue with that complaint, though. We are not asking a high individual price. You can get the PDF in two languages for 15 bucks. At 150 luscious hand-washed pages, that’s 10 cents a whack! And the printed softcover is priced at a mere 45 clams, totally in-line with comic-shop prices. We don’t wanna take individuals for a ride, we just want a lot of individuals to get in on a good book!\n\nThe reason we set the price so high was to see if the vaunted crowd-fund model could possibly provide a living wage for working comics folk. We are committed to paying our colorist, letterer, and studio assistant a page rate comparable with DC or Marvel. Those rates are too low to begin with. And when you buy an indie comic, often you are buying it on the back of artists who are working for around three bucks an hour. C’mon folks! We’re all happy to drop six bucks a cup for fair-trade coffee. How about some fair trade comics!\n\nI promise, at our goal sum, no one’s getting rich on this Kickstarter. Chris and I will scrape some rent money, and my Dad will be able to meet his bills for the year of 18 hour days it will take to do this book (did I mention lovingly hand-washed pages?). We just want to get together and say, “Hey guys, we can do this, just readers and authors, without anyone going over a barrel.”\n\nPerhaps we should have broken it up into issue chunks. We may yet, if this tanks whole-cloth. We all really, truly LOVE Strongman, and we’ll find a way to bring this little-IP-that-could to the page.\n\nBut I am not ready to give up hope. I know that if just 4,000 people in this world of 8 billion back us with a softcover edition, we can do this thing. I know that number of you read The Death of Superman. I know that number of you love the same wonderful, rich genre material we love. I know that the power of social media can move mountains, and elect leaders, and I know that the readers of this site have moved markets before. I know that number of you are, to borrow even more liberally, true believers.\n\nThat is why I make this promise:\n\nWe are offering a special incentive to readers of Bleeding Cool. Back now at any level where you get the PDF or printed book and include the words “Bleeding Cool” in your message and you will receive a bonus piece of memorabilia: the art-rich recipe card for Bron’s Secret Vigorous Vitality Tonic! And that’s not all!\n\nIf we can crack $100,000 with Bleeding Cool backers, Chris, my father Jon, and I, will SHAVE OUR HEADS, adopt handlebar mustaches like our hero, go to Ralph’s, purchase kale and protein powder IN OLD-TIMEY CHARACTER… And videotape the whole thing for you to watch. That is how much we love Strongman.\n\nSo, if you love comics, and the men who make them behaving foolishly, then please visit our Kickstarter by going to http://kck.st/1bjqqVy and backing with the words “Bleeding Cool”.\n\nAlso check out the Strongman Facebook page at www.facebook.com/ strongmancomic .\n\nIf you have questions, contact us on Kickstarter. We will write back!\n\nAnd thank you for the time and brain space.\n\nAbout Rich Johnston Chief writer and founder of Bleeding Cool. Father of two. Comic book clairvoyant.

  "latent_25928": ",\n\nIt's been said that a dog is man's best friend, but for one Wetzel County girl, her dog is much more. It could perhaps even be said that this special dog, very much a best friend, is also a lifesaver.\n\nKathy Smith said that at the time she discovered the service dog organization, 4 Paws for Ability, she was actually searching for a tracking dog for her daughter, Trinity, who has nonverbal autism. Smith said her daughter had a tendency to wander off. Little did Smith know, her search for a tracking dog would lead her to the organization 4 Paws for Ability. This organization led her to what she calls \"a blessing,\" a beautiful golden retriever puppy with kind looking eyes-Tony.\n\n4 Paws, headquartered in Xenia, Ohio, provides a variety of service dogs, including autism assistance dogs, seizure alert and response dogs, mobility assistance dogs, hearing ear/signal dogs, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder dogs, diabetic alert and response dogs, peanut allergy dogs, and multipurpose assistance dogs. The last covers multiple disabilities that can include Down Syndrome, Fragile X, Apraxia, ADHD, a variety of mental health diagnoses, medically frail children, and life threatening medical illnesses like cancer.\n\nArticle Photos Pictured is what Kathy Smith calls “a match made in heaven” — Tony and Trinity Martie. Pictured are Tony and Trinity Martie moments after meeting. Kathy Smith says her daughter was not happy at first, but then was licked by the playful golden retriever. This is the result.\n\n4 Paws has received national media attention on MSNBC, Dateline NBC, Animal Planet, Good Morning America, CNN, and in The New York Times, The Washington Post, People Magazine, USA Today, and Parent's Magazine. Karen Shirk, founder of 4 Paws, has been recognized as a 2008 CNN Hero as well as a 2009 DIRECTV Hometown Hero.\n\nThe service dogs are trained to help children and veterans live more independent lives so they can better contribute to society. 4 Paws prides themselves on being the founding agency of autism assistance dogs with tracking, as well as never turning a qualified family away.\n\nIt's also been said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and the photos of Tony and Trinity describe this story the best. Smith says that 4 Paws strives to match the dog with the personality of the child. It's obvious that Tony and Trinity are, as Smith says, \"a match made in heaven.\" One photo Smith provided, a black and white one not pictured with the story, shows an angry Trinity after first meeting Tony. A second photo, taken just after the previous black and white one, shows Trinity with an expression similar to that of any other child playing with their pet. Smith says that this second photo was taken right after Tony licked Trinity on the face, usually something not allowed from a dog, especially a service dog. In this case though, Smith says that if Trinity is having a meltdown, she can tell Tony to \"nuzzle\" Trinity. \"This turns a meltdown from 10 minutes to three seconds,\" Smith says. Smith adds that Tony is trained in tracking, tethering, and behavior disruption.\n\nTony is just a year old now, whereas Trinity is five. Trinity is currently in kindergarten and Smith anticipates sending Tony to school with her in the future, perhaps even next year. She credits Tony for increasing Trinity's quality of life, stating that her little girl is like \"a different kid.\" Smith adds that Tony misses Trinity when she is at school. Despite the absences now though, it is obvious that this match made in heaven is on the right track to a bright future together.\n\nThe journey to bring Tony home was not as simple as just a phone call though.\n\nSmith was required to fill out a lengthy application, receive a note from Trinity's doctor, and raise $13,000. After raising the necessary funds, Smith was then required to go to a training in Xena from Oct. 22-Nov. 2. The average cost of a service dog is actually $22,000, which includes food, training, housing, and veterinary care. However, 4 Paws supplements the $13,000 with gift in-kind donations, grants, annual appeals to past donors, cause related marketing, and other fund raising activities.\n\nSmith credits several businesses with helping her on the journey to bring Tony home. The following businesses and organizations made cash donations to help: AEP Ohio (Kammer-Mitchell Plant), ACT Today, Bayer Heritage, Choo Choo's, Family Support Grant, Grisell Funeral Home, Immanuel Baptist Church, Jarvis Funeral Home, Lions Club of Pine Grove, Long Valley Baptist Church, Mike Certified Auto Repair LLC., Quota Club of New Martinsville, Sardis Tire, Wal-Mart (New Martinsville), and Roseland. Additionally, The Panic Attack, Slam 6 raised $1,015 at the Eagles Club in Paden City.\n\nThe following businesses made donations towards fund raisers: Ace Home Center, Arby's, Autozone, A-Won Buffet, Bee Electric LLC., Bruce Lanes, Burger King, Carmike Cinemas, Choo Choo's, Craft 2000, Domino's, Eat-N-Park, Family Hair Care, Fashion Bug, Fiesta, Garfield's, Gold Diggers, Go Mart 64, Gump's Septic Porta Potty, Hollywood Nails, Howell's Tire-N-Jenny Lube, J.C.

  "latent_25938": "Losing presidential candidates over the past quarter century have tended to become more popular in the months following the election. But former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has broken that trend, according to Gallup.\n\nThe latest Gallup poll reveals that a majority of Americans, 57 percent, continue to view Secretary Clinton unfavorably. There has been no change in this percentage since January 2017.\n\nClinton’s favorable rating hit an all-time low, 38 percent, early September last year. The highest it has ever been was 67 percent, which was in 1998 when she was first lady.\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, during her time serving as secretary of state, she received a 66 percent favorability rating.\n\nBut as for her current favorability rating, Gallup has yet to see any of the typical improvements for the two-time losing presidential candidate.\n\n“Losing presidential candidates since 1992 have experienced a boost of at least four percentage points in favorability when averaging their ratings from the day after the election through the following June,” Gallup found.\n\nSome increases were smaller than others, such as a mere 4 percent favorability growth post-election for Mitt Romney and Bob Dole.\n\nOn the other hand, John McCain’s favorability jumped by 14 percent. Al Gore’s rating increased by 10 percent, and 16 percent for George H.W. Bush.\n\n“Typically, losing candidates’ favorable ratings improve because political independents and supporters of the opposing political party grow to view the candidate more positively after the election. However, this has not happened for Clinton,” according to Gallup.\n\nThe research pointed out that many of Secretary Clinton’s appearances since the election have not been well received by the public, which has “viewed her comments as shirking blame for her loss.”\n\nShe has blamed her loss on the weakness of the Democratic Party infrastructure, former FBI Director James Comey mishandling an investigation, and the news media producing biased coverage.\n\nBut going forward, Gallup researchers acknowledge that Secretary Clinton is seen in a more favorable light when she is less political. But, with good and logical reason, her ratings suffer when she runs for office.\n\n“If she doesn’t seek to run again, her favorability is far less relevant and frees her from the constraints of public opinion.”",
  "latent_26113": "We're in a fortunate position here to have had access to information about the goings on behind the scenes on Thomas, have a read at these... Elliot poses with the crew for a photo! (L to R) Elliot, Ian McCue (Producer), Sharon Miller (Voice Director), Dave Peacock (Studio Manager), Keith Wickham (Voice Artist) and Ben Small (Voice Aritst) On Wednesday, 8th June 2011, I visited the Sound Company in Gosfield Street, London for my 18th Birthday. I was there to attend an actual recording session of Thomas & Friends and to see how they do the voice recording on the CGI Series. The Sound Company is the same studio where they do voice recording for many TV shows and films for the UK and US such as; The Magic Roundabout (2005 film), Valiant, Wallace and Gromit films: ‘The Curse of the Were-Rabbit’ and ‘A Matter of Loaf and Death,’ Peppa Pig, The Mr. Men Show, Ben and Holly’s Little Kingdom, Olivia and Yoko! Jakamoko! Toto! prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ? We at the studios at 14:00, the reception is very beautiful, it has comfy sofas, its own TV and old fashioned games like Space Invaders to play. After waiting for 10 minutes, the Producer on Thomas & Friends, Ian McCue, met us. He was the same guy who helped us organise my visit. Ian then took us upstairs to Studio 3, which looked very fancy with all the film posters on display on the left side of the room. There are two desks, one near the door; this is where Ian McCue sits and a larger desk with all the machines and computers that the Voice Directors work on. prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ? I met the manager of the studio, Dave Peacock, who is one of the Voice Directors on the Series, but he mention that he gets no credit for his work. I also met old faces like Sharon Miller (Voice Director) and Keith Wickham (Voice Artist on Thomas) who I had met from the Thomas Premieres in Leicester Square. prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ? We then started to have a nice chat while we were waiting for Ben Small to arrive. I was attending Ben’s recording session and the session was to start at 14:30 till 16:00. Sharon Miller told me that Michael Angelis, Teresa Gallagher and Kerry Shale had all done their recording sessions earlier that day, but they all had other commitments to attend to so I didn’t get to meet them unfortunately. Keith Wickham had finished his recording session when I arrived, but luckily, he was able to stay for my visit. According to Sharon and Dave, Michael Angelis or Brandon is the first person that records their voice on Thomas for each time a recording session is on because the Sound Company does the narration first before the voices for the characters. prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ? After 10 minutes Ben Small finally arrived at Studio 3 and was even happier to see me because I was there to support him in his recording session. It was 14:20 so we had another chat to pass the time. I even brought Krispy Kreme Doughnuts for us all to share, Keith started to ‘attack’ the doughnuts and we all laughed. 14:30 soon came and we all got into our positions to start the voice recording, the excitement began to fill up in my chest! prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ? I sat at the main desk next to Sharon and Dave, the voice recording booth is in front of the desk, the actor/actress opens a door on the left side of the room, down a narrow hall which was 20 yards long, opens another door on the right and then enters the room where they start recording their voice. The room has a huge sound proof glass where Ben can be able to see us, the main desk have a microphone that we can turn on in order to speak to Ben, but we turn it off when we record the voice. The voice recording booth has a small TV Screen with footage from the Thomas episode on it. There is a huge plasma TV Screen in the main room of the studio that is drilled to the top of the room, above the sound-proof glass so we can watch the episodes too. When they record the voice, they play the footage of the episode and white text appears so that Ben can say his dialogue in order to follow the sync of Thomas’ lip movement. There is a small yellow line in the centre of the screen, as soon as the text hits this line; Ben begins to record his dialogue for Thomas. prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ? Sharon and Dave hold a copy of the script so that they can change any lines if they need to. The voice artist doesn’t need a script because they have a TV Screen with the footage and the text appears so that they can record their lines. prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ? We soon began to record Ben’s lines. For each recording session, they do two episodes respectively. The first episode we recorded was just a brief scene at Brendam Docks; Ben only had 2 lines for this episode. Dave then used a computer that can be able to skip scenes back and forth; Ben mentioned that this actually staggers him and all the other voice artists because if they’re skipping the scenes, the voice artists don’t know the proper story plot. Then we went onto the second episode. It takes about 3 or 4 times to get the voice to sound right for Thomas, e.g. the panicked voices or the yawning. prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ? After Ben finished his lines, we all watched the finished result which also meant I actually saw one of the Series 16 episodes in its entirety. Some of the footage was not in its final render as some were still in pre-viz mode (similar to the Hero of the Rails footage on Nitrogen’s website), but the facial expressions and the lip sync on the characters were not static. Another surprise was installed for me; a staff member of the Sound Company came with a birthday chocolate cake and Ben, Keith, Sharon, Ian and Dave all sang ‘Happy Birthday’ to me. We all had one slice each, very tasty chocolate! All too soon, my visit then came to an end. A big thank you is due to Sharon Miller and Dave Peacock for watching the recording on Series 16, to Ian McCue for taking his time in order and help to arrange this visit and the birthday presents and to HiT Entertainment for making this visit possible. prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ? It truly was a fantastic adventure in The World of Thomas & Friends and I hope I will be able to attend another recording session some day. On 14th January 2008, I visited Shepperton Studios, along with the Day Out With Thomas Project Manager of HIT Entertainment, to see how the Thomas The Tank Engine & Friends TV Show is made. For those that don’t know Shepperton is part of the Pinewood group which collectively produce all the major films and TV shows in the UK, such as James Bond, Harry Potter, Last Of the Sumer Wine, The Weakest Link etc\n\nWe arrived at the studios at 11:00, the site is massive, it has own taxi company, refreshments rooms everything. A guy called Matt Porter, who is Head Of Production on the show, met us. Unfortunately this is point where my camera left me, as I could not take any photos once inside the main buildings. (shame!!!) A sacrifice well made all the same.\n\nMost of the buildings we saw are like aeroplane sheds and they were everywhere probably around 80 – 120 foot in height, the same in width and a minimum of 200 foot long. These was just buildings for the smaller filming requirements, we did not see those required for big film productions.\n\nMatt told us the basic history of filming the show at Shepperton and that it has been moved from stage E where the first series was filmed all the through to stage L the current stage. As the show got bigger so did the need for bigger filming space and workshops to accompany it. The giveaway, as to which stage we were visiting, would have been the huge image of Thomas on the buildings side.\n\nOpposite stage L was a building about 40 foot in height, 80 foot width and about 100 foot length this was the Thomas Workshop. Inside the shop was every tool imaginable. They could have recreated full size trains in there. There was 2 rows of workbenches going down one side of the room.\n\nDavid Eves has worked on Thomas since day one. He is in charge of everything that happens in the workshop. He told us what happened in the workshop and the preparation ready for filming. Everything apart from railway vehicle wheels is built on site. Wheels are bought in from specialist model makers. When there is a request for new characters, David has a look at the storylines, some designs and then searches for pictures and information on real locomotives that are similar in some ways to the designer’s request.\n\nOnce David and designers are happy with the basic loco, several designs are done i.e. different colours, facial expressions etc before the prototype are built. Once the designs are agreed, detailed line drawing from all angles are done with exact information on size, scale, colours etc. The prototype is then built Any last minute changes are then made and the character goes into production.\n\nSeveral facial expressions are done to accompany the line drawing, each character used to have between 7-10 faces, this has been reduced to 5-7 depending on how many / what roles the new character will have in the current series. Thomas has the most between 40-50 faces have been made, some are newer improved faces from the earlier series. Several of the major support cast have between 15-25.\n\nVery little other then wheels are actually bought in, sometime model railway items are bought from local shops either to use or to be a guide for a new item to be made to fit in with filming.\n\nEach workbench had something different happenning. On one a Harold The Helicopter was being repainted and the mechanism of another Harold being looked at. The next had trees on it and it was explained that there are hundreds of model trees. Trees for summer, winter spring, autumn and specialist trees like ones that are striked by lighting or falling onto tracks and roads. There was a specialist tree that was being finished for a feature in a new episode. Next to it was a newer improved red balloon, again going to be used in a new episode.\n\nFurther on was a model of Rosie stripped back to basics. The model was bare, made of brass and taken apart so we could see how it worked. The eyes are 2 balls that are linked together and sit in a plastic case that acts as the smokebox door cover on the front of an engine. If anyone has seen the film Short Circuit, it looked a bit like the robot on that with wires all around it’s eyes, only this was on a much smaller scale. I won’t say how the eyes actually work but it’s impressive. So much electronics are packed into those tiny areas.\n\nAt the next bench a lady was busy with plans for a new character and new feature for one of the new stories. She explained how it is made and showed some rough model faces that had been made with the spare materials. The new character’s line drawing was on the wall next to her.\n\nThe next bench had one of the new characters that had just recently finished being painted. Again we saw some facial expressions that were going to be made. Blacktac, a lot sticker then bluetac hold on the faces. According to Matt, blacktac is used on nearly everything, as it is a quick fix.\n\nThe next bench had a model of Whiff being looked at along with the tender of a new character engine. On the bench opposite was the line drawing for this engine and colour photo’s of what is the engine was based on.\n\nAcross the other side of the room was a large-scale model of Thomas. It stood about 1.5 feet tall. Inside the cab was fully detailed as though it was a real steam engine. Gauge glasses, regulator, steam brake, handbrake, injectors, pressure gauges, everything. It was in great detail. These types of models are used for close ups of the cab with the driver and fireman in. There were also 2 of James’s tenders. A large scale red one and a standard size black and yellow one.\n\nThe model team was great; all of them spared a few minutes of their time to explain about their work. We thanked them for there time, but the best was yet to come.\n\nWe left the workshop and entered stage L. The Island Of Sodor.\n\nAs you walk in you stare straight at a model set, which has the biggest camera hanging above it. The camera runs along rails above the set and can move to any part of the set. There are wires and pipes going underneath the set. This to electrify the rails and makes steam come up through the set. The sets are about 30f by 30f square on wheels. Whilst one set is being filmed another is being built. Whilst a set is being built some of the models are tested to make sure everything works prior to the start of filming. Hanging off the walls are 4 sky effects, one blue with clouds, 1 for evening / early morning, 1 is winter / cloudy and I is just plan sky blue. The skies go 3/4 around the set so all the area is covered and are about 30 foot in height. One thing to note is that all scenes needing that set for the series i.e. the docks is filmed at once. One set like the main sheds could appear in at least 10 stories. The sets have tiny holes in them where smoke and fog like effects can come through.\n\nThere were 4 large TV screens in one part where the show’s director Steve Asquith and his team were controlling the set. Behind them was a board with the episode numbers running across and to the left the scene needed in a grid when a scene has been completed that particular box is coloured in. Only 25 still photos are taken per episode, so only 1 or 2 per scene. These are for books etc.\n\nWe watched them film for around 5 minutes, the shot involved Thomas, Percy and one of the new characters. Matt then took us the back of the room where on a stacked shelving was some of the models and sets. The model characters needed for the series are decided by the director and his team and they are then taken out of storage. There are 9 containers full of models and sets.\n\nThe buildings are fantastic to detail, a lot of time and effort goes into sets to try and make it as realistic as possible. Matt explained that there are 3 model sizes that gets used in the main filming. The narrow gauge engines are actually built to a bigger size then the standard gauge engines, reason being more detail can be put onto the little engines. There is also a Jack gauge, as The Pack was also built to a scale larger then the standard gauge engines. This series will cost around £2.5m with a filming cost of about £1,000 an hour. Although parts of different episodes are filmed during the day, it takes about 5 days to film each episode. Although the sets are excellent due to budget and timescale the sets can sometimes not be as realistic as the team would like. But they do make every effort to try, you can tell by the quality of the buildings, particularly the station buildings. One of the guys on set is actually re-building a full size traction engine so his knowledge has often come into good use. We had a quick chat about Shackerstone (the heritage railway I work on) and what happens on a Day Out With Thomas event, he had heard of us. A lot of the new series voice recordings will be done in a portable van so as to be easier for new storyteller Pierce Brosnan, as he will be working on other projects as well as Thomas. Music is added at a studio not too far away from Shepperton.\n\nOur visit then came to an end. Out of respect and trust for being allowed on set certain information have not been mentioned.\n\nA big thank you is due to David Eves and his workshop team, to Steve Asquith and crew for letting us watch the filming, to Matt Porter for taking the time to give the tour and to HIT Entertainment for making it possible.\n\nIt truly was a great Day Out With Thomas The Tank Engine & Friends.\n\nThomas the Tank Engine has steamed through many a childhood since the Reverend Wilbert Awdry began writing stories about the little blue locomotive 40 years ago. The books are wonderful, but the TV adaptations – well, they’re wonderful too. To find out how the producers of Shining Time Station achieve such stunning results, I visited the famous Shepperton studios on the outskirts of prefix = st1 ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags\" ? London . prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ? It all began 12 years ago, when executive producer Britt Allcroft was working on a film about the ago of steam. The film’s technical consultant was none other than the Rev. Awdry, and Allcroft began thinking about interpreting his creations as TV characters. To some observers, a children’s series starring a steam locomotive seemed a big gamble – this was the age of space epics ad Steven Speilberg. Reverend Awdry himself was concerned that TV might destroy the delicate, period quality that the original book illustrations conveyed. He was a stickler for accuracy. He need not have worried. Authenticity became a major goal, and speciality bookshops were scoured for reference works.\n\nEdward gets a dusting down by Bob Gauld Galliers The Locomotives prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ? For the pilot film, the train models were scratch built from plastic. However, the problems were many and varied. To obtain better reliability, the producers turned to Marklin’s superbly engineered O Scale [1] locomotives with their die-cast metal frames. They added new acrylic bodies with radio-controlled eyes. To come off well on film, smoke must be quite dense. Marklin’s smoke system wasn’t quite up to the challenge, so it was replaced with one developed by the show’s staff and employing the chemical titanium tetrachloride. The engines were fitted with rubber bellows that pump air across the TTC, producing a chemical reaction and plenty of smoke. The bellows are used to crank and geared to the wheels, creating a totally authentic puffing effect. The steam that appears around the cylinders and wheels is produced by two smoke machines pushed by compressed air along pipes and up through holes in the set. The same smoke is used for background chimneys and to create fog and mist.\n\nThe many faces of Thomas The Tank Engine! The Many Faces Of Thomas prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ? Those removable faces bring the characters alive, even though the only moving parts are the eyes. Each character has its own basic face, which was first sculpted in clay. Then a rubber mould was made, and copies were cast in a mixture of resin and autobody filler. These were reworked to different expressions from which the final silicone castings were taken. Some members of the supporting cast have a basic 5 or 6 faces. Thomas, the star, has more than 40. Sockets in the back of the face incorporate two acrylic balls for the eyes. These are sprayed white with stick-on black pupils. Eye movement is radio controlled using two servos, one connected to the other. The first servo alone will give a side-to-side movement, while the second can make the first move up and down. Between these two servos, just about any eye movement can be achieved. Modelling Water prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ? Scaling water creates problems for David Eves, the special effects designer. For rain, an atomizer used for misting plants produces drops to scale. To shoot a rain scene, the set is normally dampened down and the engines given a light misting. During actual filming, the rain is restricted to a predetermined position between the cameras and the action, rather like a curtain, thus avoiding vital electrical equipment and lenses. To simulate a storm, smoke is added to the rain and churned up with a fan. Often the water you see is actually a sheet of clean, black plastic. The sand, rocks and grass dressed along the shore are reflected in a convincing fashion. The opening title shot, where we see Thomas and the windmill reflected in the pond, is an excellent example of this technique. When boats must move on the water, the plastic is edge-sealed with clay, and half an inch of real water is added so ripples can be created as boats are pulled across. Other Effects prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ? Snow is represented with very fine, dried paper pulp sifted onto the scene. For those large background areas, white felt is cut to shape and worked in. When a locomotive has to plough through snow, powdered glass is sprinkled on. The locomotives can push through it easily, but the tracks and wheels must be brushed after each take to maintain electrical contact. All the grass is a synthetic material used to display fruits and vegetables in grocery stores. It’s backed with wire mesh to bend and form it around the contours of the set. Too much uniformity is avoided by placing clumps of moss here and there. The skies are enormous airbrushed canvasses. There’s a summer sky with white clouds, a stormy grey sky, and a sunset sky that can also be lit to look like sunrise. Sets For The Series prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ? Three full-time model makers and two part-time free-lancers worked under the art director, Robert Gauld-Galliers, for 32 weeks on the latest, 26-part series. They made 70 sets, ranging from the fairly simple “run-by” scenes to major sets like the quarry. Most sets are 16 x 20 feet, but they tend to overlap and there are runoffs that extend beyond the set. Once a set is completed, all the scenes for the series requiring that set are filmed at the same time. A set may appear in as many as 15 episodes, presenting what must be a continuity nightmare. At a filming cost of £10,000 per hour, time is of the essence, with much forward planning and strict schedules. While one set is being dismantled and another set-up, the close-up and interior shots are being filmed. Building models for a TV show is quite different from doing it as a hobby. As model maker Martin Gaskell explained, “Most of our models are made for the camera. Whereas a model railway club would include intricate detail throughout a model, we will leave blank a part of a building that the camera doesn’t see.” “Realism is paramount,” model maker Mark Dorset pointed out. “It’s nice to be as authentic as possible, but you must know when to stop. I could spend hours getting things just right, but when you’re under the pressure of filming schedules you have to know when to say when.” “Most model makers make things too pristine,” added Martin. “Even when dirtying down, they tend to make it very clinical. We dirty down a tremendous amount for realism.” A Very Special Camera prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ? Much of the show’s quality is due to the special 35-mm movie camera used to film it. The camera was designed by director David Mitton and director of photography Terry Permane. Built in the prefix = st1 ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags\" ? United States with lenses ground in Japan , the camera incorporates an inverted periscope and can get down to within 1” of the track. The depth of field is an incredible 1” to infinity. But consider watching these marvellous films without the music by Mike O’ Donnell and Junior Campbell, both of Bluebird themes. Each locomotive has its own catchy theme, and I couldn’t imagine watching there delightful stories without them. It’s all the elements working smoothly together that make “Thomas” a wonderful show. [1] Webmaster note : The scale mentioned in this article is misleading. Rather than O-scale, the engines (Thomas, Gordon et al) were actually built to Gauge-1 model standards - the scale of choice for the series. The confusion may be due to Series 4 being prepared/filmed at the time of the article's writing - April 1993 where the narrow gauge Skarloey Railway engines were introduced and indeed modelled in O-scale to contrast their size with their standard track gauge (Gauge-1) brethren. Few readers with children under the age of 10 can have failed to notice the arrival of Thomas the Tank Engine ad Friends on Independent Television on Tuesday afternoons. The series is based upon the Reverend W. Awdry’s popular children’s books which sell in excess of 750, 000 per year. Southampton-based producer Britt Allcroft has turned the much-loved stories into 26 live-action animated episodes of around five minutes duration, narrated by no lesser personage than Ringo Starr. A considerable amount of model-making was obviously involved in construction of the trains and the sets through which they operate. But, how does one go about making such a series and what sort of model making skills are involved? prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" ? My investigations took me to a row of small industrial premises not far from Clapham Junction station, to the home of Clearwater Features who were producers for the series. With model-makers, Dave Payne and Jamie Jackson-More I went to find Thomas and the other characters neatly packed away in a storeroom alongside one of the workshop/studios. The Company specialises in animation and special effect work, it’s more usual projects involving characters such as robots and singing and dancing lemons for TV commercials. Dave and Jamie describe themselves as special-effects model makers and on Thomas they worked with a third team-member, Tom Vaine, to produce locomotives with many other model-makers and produce rolling stock and sets for the series. To obtain a satisfactory size and the necessary level of reliability, the model-makers worked in Gauge 1, using Marklin components as a basis for the locomotives. In fact, the Marklin items are barely recognisable, being confined to the chassis (often extensively modified), motor and wheels. The chassis had to be anglicised and new bodies constructed to represent the various characters from the books. In all, seven locomotives are featured, Thomas and Percy, the two small mischievous tanks, Gordon, Henry, Edward and James, and of course Toby the tram engine. These seven were built in just six weeks, a considerable achievement in view of their complexity, and the fact that none of the model-makers boast any previous railway modelling experience. Take the body off any one of the engines, and there’s almost as a much equipment as a James Bond car! The body shell has a flat, clear perspex front to the front to the smokebox and incorporates a pair of moving ‘eyes’. These can be moved up, down, sideways or round and round, by radio control. Receiver and servos to operate the eyes are mounted within the locomotive body and powered by four rechargeable batteries squeezed into the available space. Actual movement of the locomotives is by conventional two-rail electronification using the standard Marklin equipment which proved impressively reliable throughout the arduous nine months of filming. In addition the mechanism is linked to a diaphragm pump and smoke unit arrangement to realistically puff a specially formulated smoke. Plans to reproduce leaking glands and suchlike on stationary locomotives were simplified to the provision of a concealed smoke arrangement located under this track. The locomotive bodies capture well the character of those book illustrations although some adjustments to shape have been made in order to accommodate all the equipment. This is scarcely as drastic as it sounds, since close inspection of the books will reveal considerable artistic license in variation of shape from one page to the next! Thomas, of course, is the 0-6-0T with ‘short stumpy funnel, short stumpy boiler and short stumpy dome’, Percy is a diminutive and bulbous 0-4-0T, while the main line types range from James, an inside cylinder prefix = st1 ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags\" ? 2-6-0 , up to Gordon the big blue Pacific. The faces are separate resin castings fitted and changed between shooting sequences in order to obtain changes of expression. They are held in place with nothing more sophisticated than double-sided adhesive tape. To allow for differing boiler diameters and a variety of expressions, some 70 individual faces are available. Coupled with the wide range of eye movements they provide for great flexibility in the available expressions. The filming sequences involved live action – that is filming of moving models rather than the stop-frame animation technique which results in the slightly jerky movements associated with many of the TV children’s series. Thus convincing movements and reliable operation were essential. During the nine months of filming, Jamie was on hand to service and maintain the locomotives and the railway. It was a full-time job in keeping wheels and mechanisms clean, batteries charged and rails free from the combined effects of extraneous scenic materials, dirt and smoke oil. Sets were constructed on a rostrum some 3ft above ground level using the specialised techniques of the industry. Grass, for instance, is the plastic variety used in greengrocer’s shops, but specially treated to make it appear more convincing. Each set was used for all the relevant sequences and then dismantled and replaced by the next. Anyone who knows the books will realise that quite a substantial number of different sets would be required. The human characters in the stories, particularly the Fat Controller and the train crews featured much larger scale figures posed alongside enlarged parts of the trains such as cab sides. Thomas, however, does have a driver with an arm which moves to the ‘waving’ position. Apart from the locomotives, the model-makers had to provide a wide range of rolling stock, most of which was scratch-built using parts from the Tenmille range of gauge 1 accessories and fittings. Two other important characters are Bertie the Bus and Terence the Tractor, the latter quickly nicknamed ‘Drac the Trac’ by the film crew. Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends is the culmination of five years work by producer Britt Allcroft. The series was directed by David Mitton, with incidental music specially written by Mike O’Donnell and Junior Campbell. UK Television rights have been acquired by Central TV and UK video rights by the Guild Organisation Ltd. The model makers are hoping that their efforts will attract the kind of cult following received by such series as Magic Roundabout and Postman Pat. Certainly the commercial spin-offs from such a venture, in the form of a whole range of Thomas the Tank Engine goods, toys and models might provide a valuable shot-in-the-arm from the toy sector of the model railway market, with train sets based on the series attracting children into the hobby once more. For the moment, any such suggestions are purely thinking aloud. As I talked to the model makers and they pulled out some of the locomotives and set them out for photography it was interesting to note the reactions of other members of the Clearwater team. The little engines, had obviously been in stores for some while, since filming ended, and they were greeted with some obvious delight by several who witnessed our short photography session. Had these little characters endeared themselves to those who created and worked with them? I’ve a suspicion that I met several people who won’t ever see trains in quite the same way they did before Thomas. Note: Since the completion of Thomas the Tank Engine the model making team have formed an independent company, Penicott, Payne, & Lillie Ltd, offering models and special effects for film and TV.\n\nOriginal Thomas model from 1984\n\nThomas model taken apart to show working components\n\nSet decoration for Flying Kipper\n\nOriginal Percy and James models\n\nSet dressing 1984 - filming of Tenders and Turntables/Breakdown Train\n\nCrew look on at final scene of \"Thomas and Terence\"\n\nToby's old shed, yard and turntable At West London's Shepperton Studios, in a room the size of an aircraft hangar, Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends are being put through their electrically powered and rather sweet remote controlled paces. Wait a minute! Where are the actors? \"Actors sweat, really, and they're nasty and get ill and stuff,\" says David Mitton, the director and co-producer who supervises cheerful, brightly coloured locomotives with names like Thomas, Edward and Gordon. Meet Stepney, an engine \"He's the little yellow chap,'' Mitton says with a smile and the star of this week's 5 1/2-minute segment. In this particular plot, Stepney is chugging about the grassy valley when the fog descends and he loses his way.\n\n\"He's nearly smelted down,\" Mitton explains later. \"The diesels are waiting to get hold of him to melt him down badly.\" (In the world of Thomas, diesels are usually the bad guys.) Then again, this is popular children's TV, not life. So all must end well, though Thomas tales often pack a neat little moral.\n\nSet on the fictional Island of Sodor, the Thomas series began filming in 1984. This round marks the fifth spate of stories, with Alec Baldwin now narrating. Special effects supervisor David Eves is in charge of steam, fog and water. In addition, he knows the engines well, having helped his father, Peter, build the originals. \"When you see a lot of the rubbish the kids do watch,\" says Eves, looking up from his work table in an adjacent studio, \"Thomas has got a lot to offer. Adults watch it as well.\" He is not worried about competition from British rivals like Teletubbies, now demanding their share of the children's market. Says Eves: \"That's a bit of a passing fad.\" Much of the work on Thomas falls to chief model-maker Brian Rutland, who built such new characters as The Paxman Diesel and Harry Topper's Biplane. Rutland's team includes Martin Gaskell, a senior model-maker who works from some sketches provided by Britt Allcroft. As the series' original creator and producer, Allcroft has turned the late Reverend Wilbert Awdry's tales into an international franchise.\n\nThe show airs in 121 countries, including Canada, and has been translated into nine languages, including Norwegian, Korean, Welsh, and Estonian. Last month, an amusement park with a Thomas theme opened in Japan. Gaskell is busy moulding silicone rubber into beguiling, open-faced expressions so beloved in Britain and abroad.\n\nHe comes to the series after helping build the main spacecraft in the film Lost In Space. Now marking his third Thomas series, Gaskell is adamant \"I never do anything that's the same. Every job is different.\" So, too, is every expression, including 30 faces for Thomas alone. And though viewers often assume the engines' features move, only the eyes dart as a 12-volt current powers the engines down the track. Barrels of gravel, sand and stone are evident on the set, as is a periscope lens that allows Mitton and colleagues to view everything from the engines' eye level. Mitton knew the Rev. W. Awdry, the English cleric who wrote the Railway Series that gave rise to the Thomas phenomenon. Courtesy of CIREMI of the SiForums, we've managed to precure some Behind the Scenes pictures taken from Graeme MacArthur's own private collection from when he worked on the show. These have been marked for security reasons, please do not use them elsewhere! Apparently, they built about 70 layouts for the series roughly 16 x 20 ft. each. A 35mm movie camera was also developed, which allows ground shots down to 1 inch (about 2.5 cm) from the scenery. The camera also gives a focal point of a certain object from 1 inch/2.5 cm to infinity. Each set appeared in about 15 different episodes.\n\nOn to the layout itself. Most water on the layouts are pieces of (very clean) black plastic sheeting. When real water is needed, a dam of clay is used on top of the sheeting which is then filled with water. Any ships seen on this \"water\" are pulled along with strings. Things like rain are done with water vaporizers between the camera and the objects being filmed. Snow is either dried paper pulp or powdered glass sifted onto the sets. Skies are huge canvas paintings.\n\nAs for the trains, they are built in \"O\" Scale and started out as handmade units. Later, the producers converted to \"Marklin\" engines for better dependability. Thomas had more than 40 faces cast for him, while the other engines only had 5 or 6 each.\n\nFilming costs for the series are $16,700 (£ 10,000) per hour, and everything is done at Shepperton Film Studios on the outskirts of London, England. The crew are as follows:\n\nBritt Allcroft, Producer\n\nDavid Mitton, Director\n\nTerry Permane, Director of Photography\n\nRobert Gauld Galliers, Art Director\n\nNOTE: Before passing away in 1997, Rev. W. Awdry served as Allcroft's technical consultant. Select train models, buildings and scenery from the TV Series will be set up as a permanent display at Drayton Manor's Thomas Land. Whilst visiting the Park on 10th May, 2009, Callum Walker asked for and was given permission by the construction crew to examine the models close-up as they worked on the display.

  "latent_26282": "I wrote this Scotsman column when the votes for prisoners story first hit the headlines. My view has not changed....\n\n\"As is the way these days, John Hirst turned to Youtube to celebrate the success of his campaign to win voting rights for prisoners. An unkempt man in an unkempt room, he addressed the webcam with a bottle of champagne in one hand and a cannabis joint in the other.\n\nHe pointed out that one came courtesy of Sainsbury, the other from \"the local drug dealer\". He tells his audience that he mustn't drink too much, as he's a guest on the Radio Four Today Programme.\n\nThey couldn't be more different in appearance and lifestyle, yet Hirst - who killed his landlady with an axe as she watched television - is on the same side as Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. The previous Labour government delayed implementing a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights that the UK's blanket ban on prisoners voting in elections was illegal. The SNP government in Holyrood is totally opposed to extending the vote to prisoners. But the Liberal Democrat Westminster leader made it a personal crusade to put this right.\n\nTavish has his vote\n\nClegg has no compunction about endorsing fiscal policies which punish the law-abiding working poor, but supports Hirst, a man whose 15-year sentence for manslaughter stretched to 25 years because of his behaviour inside prison. I guess that's what is meant by moral relativism. The term was surely coined for the Lib Dems with their shifting principles.\n\nHirst is a frightening fellow. He educated himself in prison, clearly has intellectual ability and also won prisoners the right to make phone calls. Yet he appears unable to put matters of injustice into a context that reasonable people would understand.\n\nOn the video he rejoices that all prisoners without exception will get the vote - including \"paedophiles and murderers\" and there is no point \"moralising\" by discriminating between them. He says the expenses scandal means politicians no longer have any moral authority to govern us. (is raping children really equivalent to claiming for a widescreen telelvsion?) Yet he believes that taking a human life should not bar him from choosing a government to rule over the law abiding. He argues vociferously for fair play in the democratic process. Yet he subverts that democracy - and the will of the electorate - by appealing to the unelected ECHR to traduce the will of parliament. You can see why he has much in common with Clegg.\n\nHirst was interviewed by the award-winning Ayrshire novelist Andrew O'Hagan four years ago. In the disturbing piece, O'Hagan described how Hirst became disproportionately enraged at an un-named female who had spilt jam in his kitchen. \"You'd think I'd killed the landlady in here,\" he tells O'Hagan.\n\nHirst's victim was Bronia Burton, a 66 year old with arthritis who took in lodgers for extra cash. While watching television together she sent him out for coal; he returned with an axe and hit her over the head several times. He told O'Hagan how he put the kettle on, looked down at his feet and: \"Thought of that line from Laurel and Hardy: that's another fine mess you've got yourself into. As I'm sat there, I'm thinking, I'll get a life sentence, maybe I can study for a degree or something.\"\n\nThat's exactly what he did do, and boy, has it paid off. At the time of the ECHR judgment, 18 countries in Europe already allowed all prisoners the vote, 12 allowed some to vote and another 13 had a blanket ban like Britain. It's very different in America, where this power is exercised by individual states. Some allow voting. Others do not. Several extend the ban to convicted felons (that's those who have committed serious crimes) long after release.\n\nScotland, however, is part of the UK and electoral law is reserved to Westminster, even if justice is not. The first prisoners to get a vote are likely to be in Scotland, at next year's Holyrood elections. As of last month, there were 6,407 inmates in Scottish jails who may be affected - unsentenced prisoners and those on remand already have the vote.\n\nAlready there is considerable speculation, some of it jocular, as to how political activists might campaign in prisons next Spring. What about telephone canvassing, a method increasingly favoured by political parties? There could be hustings in prison, where candidates could answer questions about the quality of the rations. It would, of course, be a waste of time for the SNP, Labour and the Tories. If they have any sense of gratitude, all convicted criminals will back the Lib Dems.\"",
  "latent_26290": "Shares\n\nThere are many conspiracy theories about vaccines, and they circulate almost continuously. Some are relatively new, but most are at least a few years old. They all tend to fall into several defined types, such as the “CDC whistleblower” story, which posits that the “CDC knew” all these years that vaccines cause autism but covered it up, even going so far as to commit scientific fraud to do so. Of the many other myths about vaccines that stubbornly persist despite all evidence showing them not only to be untrue but to be risibly, pseudoscientifically untrue, among whose number are myths that vaccines cause autism, sudden infant death syndrome, and a syndrome that so resembles shaken baby syndrome (more correctly called abusive head trauma) that shaken baby syndrome is a misdiagnosis for vaccine injury, the antivaccine conspiracy theory that vaccines are being used for population control is one of the most persistent. In this myth, vaccines are not designed to protect populations of impoverished nations against diseases like the measles, which still kills hundreds of thousands of people a year outside of developed countries. Oh, no. Rather, according to this myth, vaccines are in fact a surreptitious instrument of population control designed to render people sterile, for whatever nefarious reasons the powers that be have to want to control the population.\n\nYou might recall how a few years ago antivaccinationists leaped on a statement by Bill Gates that “if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that [population] by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.” They used it to accuse Gates of being a eugenicist and that vaccines were in actuality an instrument of global depopulation. It was a ridiculous charge of course. In context, it was clear that Gates was referring to how the expected population increase from 6.8 billion to 9 billion could be blunted by providing good health care, including reproductive care and vaccines, to impoverished people in regions where the population increases are expected to be greatest. He was clearly referring to decreasing the expected population increase by 10% or 15%, meaning that instead of going up to 9 billion the population would only increase to between 7.65 and 8.1 billion. In other words, he was referring to how good health care could decrease the expected rate of population growth, not how vaccines could be used to depopulate the world. However, because of the prevalence of the myth that vaccines are sterilizing agents intended for global depopulation, the charge that Gates is a eugenicist, as obviously off base as it is to reasonable people, resonated in the anti-science world of antivaccinationists. Similar claims, namely that there is “something” in vaccines that results in infertility and sterilization, have been unfortunately very effective in frightening people in Third World countries and have played a major role in antivaccine campaigns that have delayed the eradication of polio.\n\nOf late, there’s been a new variant of this particularly pernicious bit of misinformation going around the usual social media sources. Naturally, the first place I saw this story was on the site of über-quack and conspiracy theorist Mike Adams, who proclaimed in his usual hyperbole-filled way, “Tetanus vaccines found spiked with sterilization chemical to carry out race-based genocide against Africans“:\n\nTetanus vaccines given to millions of young women in Kenya have been confirmed by laboratories to contain a sterilization chemical that causes miscarriages, reports the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association, a pro-vaccine organization. A whopping 2.3 million young girls and women are in the process of being given the vaccine, pushed by UNICEF and the World Health Organization. “We sent six samples from around Kenya to laboratories in South Africa. They tested positive for the HCG antigen,” Dr. Muhame Ngare of the Mercy Medical Centre in Nairobi told LifeSiteNews. “They were all laced with HCG.”\n\nAnother such story, by Celeste McGovern (who, if you look at her articles, is obviously very antivaccine) at the ever-quacky GreenMedInfo site entitled “Vaccine Conspiracy or Racist Population Control Campaign: The Kenyan Tetanus Shot“:\n\nWhen Catholic bishops in Kenya issued a press release last month questioning their government’s internationally-funded tetanus vaccine campaign directed at women and girls and warned that it might be laced with an experimental contraceptive that makes them miscarry their babies, it was barely mentioned by the mainstream media outside of Kenya. The BBC carried a brief story that dismissed the allegations as “unfounded” and suggested that even raising such questions was dangerous as it could frighten people from a “safe and certified” lifesaving vaccine.\n\nElsewhere, the John Rappaport has also flogged this nonsense in a story called “Depopulation vaccine in Kenya and beyond“:\n\n“Dr. Ngare, spokesman for the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association, stated in a bulletin released November 4, “This proved right our worst fears; that this WHO campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus but a well-coordinated forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine. This evidence was presented to the Ministry of Health before the third round of immunization but was ignored.” (“Mass Sterilization: Kenyan Doctors Find Anti-Fertility Agent in UN Tetanus Vaccine,” November 8, 2014, by Steve Weatherbe, earth-heal.com) You have to understand that every promoted so-called “pandemic” is an extended sales pitch for vaccines. And not just a vaccine against the “killer germ” of the moment. We’re talking about a psyop to condition the population to vaccines in general. There is much available literature on vaccines used for depopulation experiments. The research is ongoing. Undoubtedly, we only know a fraction of what is happening behind closed laboratory doors.\n\nThis story has been popping up all over the usual antivaccine social media sites. From here in the comfortable confines of our First World nations, it’s mainly a curiosity, something that gets the antivaccine contingent here riled up, but in Kenya and other Third World countries, where neonatal tetanus is a real concern, this myth has been popping up since the 1990s, causing great harm to vaccine programs.\n\nSo here is the basic outline of the myth that is going around this time. A group known as the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association (KCDA) has claimed to have tested several vials of tetanus vaccine. Why did the KCDA test these vaccines? Who knows? Actually, for some reason, due to the persistence of the common myth that vaccines are being used for sterilization and depopulation, this group of doctors apparently felt obligated to test this vaccine. In actuality, the KCDA is an arm of the Kenyan Catholic Church, created less than a year ago by John Cardinal Njue, Chairman of the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops, for this purpose outlined in a speech by Cardinal Njue dated Christmas Eve, 2013:\n\nThe Sanctity of Life and its fundamental principle, .[sic]Life begins at the Conception and ends with natural death‚ are under threat from worldly forces devoid of faith. The Catholic Church calls upon her faithful and all people of good will to appreciate the gift of life and safeguard it from the moment of conception to natural death. The Catholic Church will therefore continue to urge its Professionals especially in the medical and health care areas to be vigilant and to stand up for the moral principles and standards, as willed by God and promoted by the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church, The perfect teacher in matters of Faith and morals[sic]\n\nWhich leads Njue to proclaim:\n\nIt is therefore a good reason to celebrate as we Launch such an Association, the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association, bringing together Catholic Doctors to enable them walk the journey of faith in their profession and in Communion with each other and the Church. The Church in the Spirit of Christ invites all the Catholic Doctors to find in this Association, an opportunity to live the invitation of Christ.\n\nAnd finally:\n\nDear Catholic Doctors, allow yourselves to be enlightened by the Gospel so that your eyes of faith may penetrate the misleading attraction of the World that proclaims anti-life principles and courageously stand and be counted.\n\nIn other words, the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association is a recently formed, wholly owned subsidiary of the Catholic Church in Kenya, to which doctors have been recruited to uphold Catholic teachings in medicine, particularly with respect to reproductive health. No wonder the Kenyan Catholic bishops and the KCDA are working so closely together on this!\n\nBefore you can understand the why the claim that hCG is in the tetanus vaccine would produce fear that the vaccine is in reality a sterilization agent, you need to know about a previous experimental vaccine. hCG is what is commonly referred to as the “pregnancy hormone.” Pregnancy tests are based on detecting hCG, which can first be detected about 11 days after conception and whose levels rise rapidly thereafter, peaking in the first 8-11 weeks of pregnancy. In the past, attempts have been made to produce a vaccine that targets hCG and thus results in the inability to conceive a child. It is a technique that falls under the category of immunocontraception. It takes little more than a quick trip to Wikipedia (among other sources) to learn that as far back as the 1970s, hCG was conjugated to tetanus toxoid in order to make a vaccine against hCG, because hCG itself did not provoke enough of an immune response. It’s not necessary to know all the details and history. From the 1970s on, there have been clinical trials of such vaccine contraceptives using hCG, and it is possible to prevent pregnancy by this approach, although antibody response against hCG declines with time.\n\nThis brings us back to the claims being made, described in an editorial by Dr. Wahome Ngare for the KCDA that appeared in Kenya Today . According to this article, the WHO had embarked on a vaccination program against tetanus that somehow had aroused the ire and suspicion of the Catholic Church because it was aimed at girls and women. The reason, of course, is because in Kenya there is a high risk of acquiring tetanus during childbirth, but the Catholic Church saw more nefarious motives:\n\nOur concern and the subject of this discussion is the WHO/UNICEF sponsored tetanus immunization campaign launched last year in October ostensibly to eradicate neonatal tetanus. It is targeted at girls and women between the ages of 14 – 49 (child bearing age) and in 60 specific districts spread all around the country. The tetanus vaccine being used in this campaign has been imported into the country specifically for this purpose and bears a different batch number from the regular TT. So far, 3 doses have been given – the first in October 2013, the second in March 2014 and the third in October 2014. It is highly possible that there are two more doses to go. Unlike other mass vaccination exercise, [sic] this particular WHO/UNICEF organized and sponsored tetanus vaccination campaign was launched at the New Stanley Hotel in Nairobi which is extremely unusual for a public campaign. For this reason, many people, including health professional [sic] did not know about the campaign until the matter was addressed by the Catholic Bishops.\n\nOf course, the reason the vaccination campaign is targeted at women of reproductive age is because its primary purpose is to prevent neonatal tetanus. Targeting women of reproductive age leads to immunity in these women and the prevention of tetanus in their newborn babies. As the WHO stated in its response, these campaigns are very much targeted to districts where the highest incidence of neonatal tetanus has been observed. None of this stopped the KCDA:\n\nWith the help of Catholic faithful’s [sic] who put their own lives at risk, the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association managed to access the tetanus vaccine used during the WHO/UNICEF immunization campaign in March 2014 and subjected them to testing. The unfortunate truth is that the vaccine was laced with HCG just like the one used in the South American cases! Further, none of the girls and women given the vaccination were informed of its contraceptive effect. This proved right our worst fears; that this WHO/UNICEF campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus but is a well-coordinated, forceful, population control, mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine.\n\nNone of these charges are new. This is a conspiracy theory that’s been around at least since the 1990s and appeared in nations such as Mexico, Tanzania, Nicaragua, and the Philippines. No evidence of mass-sterilization was ever found, but these rumors did adversely impact vaccination programs in those countries.\n\nIt also sounds like an awful lot of cloak and dagger on the part of the KCDA just to get their hands on some tetanus vaccine. Much is made of the reluctance of WHO/UNICEF to provide the Catholic Church with vials of vaccine to test, but given the unreliability and dissembling demonstrated by the KCDA, it’s hard to imagine why the WHO would not want to provide vials of vaccine for them to test. Moreover, every vial wasted in this process would be one less potentially-lifesaving vial that could be administered to a Kenyan woman to prevent neonatal tetanus in her baby. In any case, somehow the KCDA obtained vials to test. It’s not clear how they got them or even whether they actually did get them, but they claim to have obtained six vials. The test they subjected them to appears to be the same test used to measure hCG in blood samples for pregnancy tests. If one takes Dr. Ngare’s story at face value, it sure sounds damning. The Kenyan government is even launching an investigation.\n\nThere’s just one problem.\n\nThe WHO has investigated already and found nothing wrong. Ngare’s claims are, to put it bluntly, completely without merit. As it pointed out:\n\nThere is a situation where ant- β-HCG antibodies can be produced by the body and that can act as a contraceptive, however, this requires the administration of at-least 100 to 500 micrograms of HCG bound to tetanus vaccine (about 11,904,000 to 59,520,000 mIU/ml of the same hormone where currently less than 1 mIU-ml has been reported from the lab results.\n\nAs UNICEF also points out, there is no laboratory in Kenya capable of accurately making these sorts of measurements on non-human samples (such as vaccines):\n\nThe tests were done in hospital laboratories in Kenya. The staff in these laboratories could not however tell whether the samples were vaccines or not, as this was not declared to the testing laboratories by the Catholic Doctors Association. The laboratories tested the samples for hCG using analyzers used for testing human samples like blood and urine for pregnancy. There is no laboratory in Kenya with the capacity to test non-human samples like vaccine for hCG.\n\nIt’s also been noted that these values might have been the results of a reaction between the preservatives in a standard tetanus toxoid vaccine and a serum/urine HCG test kit. Also, the vaccine in which hCG was linked to the tetanus toxoid is 20 years out of date. Indeed, in an e-mail interview, the original scientist who developed the hCG-tetanus toxoid vaccine even said that a different carrier, LTB, has been used, to avoid the very misinformation that has been associated with the valuable tetanus vaccination. Also, as the WHO and others responding to this rumor have noted, contraceptive vaccines based on hCG don’t last very long. Antibody titers against hCG decline rapidly after around three months.\n\nIn other words, there’s no evidence to support the claims of the KCDA, and they aren’t even plausible, given what is known about the history of vaccines using hCG coupled to tetanus toxoid. Quite simply, such vaccine linking hCG to tetanus toxin are basically history, long abandoned. They didn’t even work very well as long term contraceptive, with their effect fading after three months, much less as permanent inducers of sterility. The Catholic Church and the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association are thus engaging in fear mongering. They might believe they are doing good, but they are engaging in activity that could very well lead to the preventable deaths of Kenyan babies, as young women are frightened away from receiving the tetanus vaccine by their rhetoric and highly dubious laboratory results.\n\nNone of this, of course, has stopped Mike Adams from proclaiming this “vaccination genocide” and “medical crimes against humanity”:\n\nWhat is happening in Kenya is a crime against humanity, and it is a crime committed with deliberate racial discrimination. Normally, the liberal media in the United States would be all over a story involving racial discrimination and genocide — or even a single police shooting of a black teenager — but because this genocide is being committed with vaccines, the entire mainstream media excuses it. Apparently, medical crimes against black people are perfectly acceptable to the liberal media as long as vaccines are used as the weapon. As this story clearly demonstrates, “vaccine violence” is very real in our world.\n\nNo, what this story clearly demonstrates is how utterly out of touch with reality many of the people making these claims in the US are. If you doubt me, just take a look at some of Adams’ other claims, namely that there are five vectors for what he calls the “science-based genocidal assault on humanity”:\n\nVaccines Viruses Food Water Chemtrails (i.e. atmospheric deployment of chemicals)\n\nChemtrails? Yes, chemtrails. If you want any further evidence of just how far gone the cranks who argue that the tetanus vaccination program in Kenya is a racist depopulation program are, look no further.\n\nLest you think that this obsession over vaccination as a cause of infertility is limited to Kenya and other Third World countries, consider this. The very same theme frequently appears in antivaccine rants against Gardasil, which has been blamed without evidence for premature ovarian failure. Another favorite antivaccine trope is that polysorbate-80, which is used in some vaccines, causes infertility. Yes, we in the “advanced” First World nations are nearly as prone to falling for this sort of misinformation as Kenyans. Never forget that.\n\nAlso, never forget just how far antivaccine activists like Mike Adams and John Rappaport will go to demonize the object of their hatred: Vaccines.",
  "latent_26371": "This article is about a fictional character. For other uses, see Beren (disambiguation)\n\nBeren (also known as Beren Erchamion, \"the One-handed\", and Beren Camlost, \"the Empty-handed\") is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. He appears in The Silmarillion. He is a human, and his love for the elf maiden Lúthien is central to the Tolkien legendarium.\n\nCharacter overview [ edit ]\n\nHe was the son of Emeldir and Barahir, a Man of the royal House of Bëor of Dorthonion. His romance with the first-born is one of the great stories of the Elder Days.\n\nAppearances [ edit ]\n\nLiterature [ edit ]\n\nA member of the Apiaceae family Anthriscus sylvestris growing by woods\n\nBeren was the son of Barahir, the lord of Dorthonion. During his youth, the Battle of Sudden Flame destroyed his kingdom. Thenceforward the young Beren lived with his father and ten loyal followers as outlaws in the highlands at Tarn Aeluin, and they performed many acts of bravery, to the great frustration of Morgoth, the Dark Lord of Angband. But one of the group betrayed the others to Sauron, Morgoth's lieutenant, and they were all killed by orcs except Beren who was away scouting. Beren tracked down the orcs and killed the murderer of his father, and recovered his father's ring, a gift from Finrod Felegund, who had given the ring to Barahir as a symbol of gratitude for Barahir's saving his life. After this, Beren lived as a solitary outlaw, with the aid of animals, until he had established such a high reputation that the price on his head was equal to that on Fingon, high king of the Noldorin Elves. Beren was finally forced from Dorthonion by Sauron's army. He crossed a path of terror, passing an impenetrable boundary by the will of fate, into Doriath, where he saw the elf maiden Lúthien, princess of the Sindar and daughter of Thingol and Melian dancing on a green hill surrounded by hemlocks (the umbellifer family Apiaceae, not the tree genus Tsuga) [1], and fell in love with her instantly.\n\nThingol haughtily refused to give Lúthien's hand in marriage. He scornfully said that he would allow the marriage if Beren recovered one of the Silmarils, the three hallowed jewels which the Noldorin Elves had lost to Morgoth, from the Iron Crown of Morgoth. He intended the task to be impossible, but Beren vowed he would return with a Silmaril in his hand. Lúthien followed Beren and together, with the aid of Finrod and Huan the Hound of Valinor (both of whom died protecting Beren), they braved many perils, even besting Sauron, and finally reached Angband and came before Morgoth. Lúthien made the Dark Lord fall asleep through her singing, and Beren pried a Silmaril from his crown. He then attempted to go beyond his vow and take another one, but the tip of his dagger Angrist splintered and a shard struck the cheek of Morgoth. As they fled from Angband, the great wolf Carcharoth attacked them. Beren held out the Silmaril, hoping that its radiance would avert the beast, but he was mistaken. Carcharoth bit off his hand and swallowed it along with the Silmaril (thus Beren was called Erchamion, One-hand). The wolf, burned by the holy jewel, proceeded to run rampant through Beleriand. Lúthien and the unconscious Beren were rescued by the Eagles of Manwë.[2]\n\nBeren and Lúthien returned to Doriath, where Thingol demanded to know why Beren had returned. Beren claimed that his oath was fulfilled, saying \"even now there is Silmaril in my hand.\" When he showed the king the stump of his arm, the king was moved to compassion for Beren, and allowed him to wed Lúthien. But Carcharoth was still wreaking destruction throughout the land, so Beren then participated in the Hunting of the Wolf, in which Carcharoth was slain and the Silmaril recovered, but Beren was mortally wounded.\n\nLúthien's love for Beren was so strong that, hearing of his death, her spirit fell into darkness and fled to the Halls of Mandos. There, she sang a song of such grief and beauty that Mandos was moved to pity for the first and only time. He therefore gave Lúthien a choice: either that she would go to Valmar, healed of all memory of her grief, and let Beren pass beyond the Circles of the World, or that she and Beren would both return to Middle-earth for a time, and then both should die and her spirit, unlike that of all other Elves, would pass out of the world forever. She chose this second choice, forsaking her kindred and her immortality for her love. Thus Beren and Lúthien lived again, and dwelt on Tol Galen in the middle of the river Adurant in Ossiriand. There they stayed apart from other mortals; Beren was involved with the events of the First Age only one further time, when he waylaid a group of Dwarves who had destroyed Doriath and stolen the Nauglamír in which the Silmaril was set.\n\nLúthien bore Beren a son, named Dior, Thingol's heir, considered to be one of the fairest beings to ever live, for in him flowed the blood of Men, Elves and Maiar. Through his descendants, the blood of Beren and of Lúthien was preserved among the Eldar and the Edain. In fact, Elrond was Dior's grandson.\n\nBeren and Lúthien dwelt together for thirty-seven years more. In the year 503, the Green-elves sent the Nauglamir to Dior, and he knew that Beren and Lúthien had died. But it is not known where they passed, nor where their final resting place was.\n\nInternal lineage [ edit ]\n\nAdaptations [ edit ]\n\nThe BBC Radio adaptation of The Lord of the Rings includes a scene from The Fellowship of the Ring in which Aragorn summarizes the story of Beren and Lúthien for Frodo Baggins and his companions. Frodo later comes to realise the connection between their story and that of Aragorn and Arwen.\n\nThe animated adaptation of The Lord of the Rings includes a similar scene in which Aragorn is relating the story of Beren and Lúthien for the Hobbits, but here there is no connection made between the two to Aragorn and Arwen, since the latter does not appear.\n\nThe special extended edition of Peter Jackson's movie version of The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) contains a brief mention of the story. During the journey from Bree to Rivendell Frodo hears Aragorn singing quietly to himself one night and asks who the woman is of whom he is singing. Aragorn replies that he is singing of Lúthien. When Frodo asks what happened to her Aragorn replies, \"she died\". This is true enough, and can be seen as a reflection of Aragorn's concern over Arwen's renunciation of immortality for his sake.\n\nConcept and creation [ edit ]\n\nThe story of Beren and Lúthien, though mentioned only briefly in The Lord of the Rings, was a central part of the legendarium. Tolkien once referred to it as \"the kernel of the mythology\".[3] He went on to say that it \"arose from a small woodland glade filled with 'hemlock'\",[4] which he visited while serving in the Humber Garrison in 1918 (during World War I).\n\nIn the earliest versions of the legendarium as depicted in The Book of Lost Tales, Beren was a Gnome (a Noldorin Elf), son of Egnor (which might have been an early name for Aegnor).\n\nIt is widely believed that the story and the characters were largely inspired by the young Tolkien's romance with Edith Bratt, his future wife, who danced for her husband in the woodland glade.\n\nThe surname Tolkien derives from the German Toll-kühn meaning \"Foolishly brave\" [1]. The name Beren also means \"brave\" in Sindarin[5] and it is possible this was intentional by the author.\n\nThe tale of Beren and Lúthien also shares an element with folktales such as the Welsh Culhwch and Olwen and others— namely, the disapproving parent who sets a seemingly impossible task (or tasks) for the suitor, which is then fulfilled.\n\nIt may also have real-life parallels: some sources indicate that Edith's Protestant family strongly disapproved of Tolkien's Catholic Faith.[6] In addition, Tolkien's guardian, a priest of the Birmingham Oratory, forbade him from having any contact with Edith until he turned 21. Tolkien's guardian clearly feared that his young charge was in danger of losing the Faith. Tolkien obeyed to the letter, but telegraphed Edith on his 21st birthday. Although she was engaged to another man, she returned the ring and announced her engagement to Tolkien instead.\n\nThe Tolkien grave [ edit ]\n\nEdith and J.R.R. Tolkien lie in Wolvercote Cemetery (North Oxford). Their gravestone shows the association of Lúthien with Edith, and Tolkien himself with Beren. The stone reads:\n\nGrave of J. R. R. Tolkien and Edith Tolkien\n\nEdith Mary Tolkien\n\nLúthien\n\n1889–1971\n\nJohn Ronald\n\nReuel Tolkien\n\nBeren\n\n1892–1973\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

The data comes from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) questionnaire. In the pre-ACA surveys, 2,452 teenage girls and women were included, compared with 2,147 in the post-ACA years. The majority of participants were white, and analysis was limited to those aged 9-33 years.\n\nThe increase in vaccination could be due to the ACA’s provision requiring coverage of preventive health services without patient cost sharing in most health plans, but the investigators couldn’t say for sure.\n\nVaccination uptake was significantly higher for those with insurance coverage in both pre- and post-ACA groups (P = .0007 and P = .01, respectively).\n\nDespite these increases, vaccination rates are still low. There has been progress, but “physicians and public health professionals could assist in the acceleration of HPV vaccination uptake by increasing communication of HPV vaccination importance and by utilizing campaigns and materials that are readily available,” the investigators wrote.\n\nThe study was limited by a lack of data for teenage boys and men before implementation of the ACA and by the overlap in pre- and post-ACA data in the 2009-2010 wave because of the timing of the provision. Additionally, the data was self-reported.\n\nThe investigators reported having no relevant financial disclosures.",

(Prior to that the Folketing was the lower house of a bicameral parliament. This was amended following a constitutional referendum.) The parliament has 179 members: 175 are elected in Denmark, two in the Faroe Island and two in Greenland.\n\nThe country is divided into 10 multi-member constituencies (which in turn are divided into districts). Each constituency is assigned a set number of seats. A total of 135 seats are distributed in proportion to the votes in each constituency.\n\nThe other 40 seats are supplementary, and allotted to balance any difference between district-level results and the nationwide vote share. This is meant to ensure that the number of seats each party secures matches as closely as possible each party’s vote share, in accordance with Denmark’s constitution which requires not only regional representation but “equal representation of the various opinions of the electorate”.\n\nSimply put, if a party wins 20% of the vote it should have about 20% of the seats in parliament.\n\nThere is a 2% threshold to enter parliament (unless a party wins a constituency seat, in which case it would enter parliament even if it hasn’t met the threshold. This is unlikely in practice as winning a constituency seat would most probably mean that a party has won more than 2% of the vote nationally).\n\nThe threshold is low compared with most other countries. Germany, for example, has a 5% threshold, Sweden 4% and Turkey 10%.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Christiansborg Palace. Photograph: Robert Fried / Alamy/Alamy\n\nThe political parties\n\nDenmark’s voting system makes it near impossible for a single party to win an outright majority. No party has won one since 1903. This means that governments in Denmark tend to be coalitions, often even minority alliances with parliamentary support from other parties. The constitution allows for a government to rule without winning a vote of confidence, as long as it doesn’t lose a no-confidence vote.\n\nDenmark has a lot of political parties in comparison with the UK, where a less representative electoral system is used. Broadly speaking the parties can be divided into two main blocs: a red bloc on the left of the political spectrum, and a blue bloc to the right of centre.\n\nThe main parties in the red bloc are:\n\nThe Social Democrats (A), led by the incumbent prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt.\n\nRadikale, the Danish Social Liberal party (B). Leader: Morten Østergaard.\n\nThe leftwing Socialist People’s party (F). Leader: Pia Olsen Dyhr.\n\nThe socialist Red-Green Alliance (Ø).\n\nThe Alternative (Å), a green party founded in 2013.\n\nAnd in the blue bloc:\n\nThe centre-right Venstre (V), currently the main opposition party.

Leader: Søren Pape Poulsen.\n\nThe Christian Democrats (K). Leader: Stig Grenov.\n\nThe 2011 election\n\nAt the last election, Venstre won the most votes (26.7%) and seats (47). However, the incumbent centre-right coalition lost power to the centre-left because the red bloc emerged as the larger of the two groups in parliament. It won 50.2% of the Danish vote, which translated into 89 seats against the blue bloc’s 86.\n\nIncluding seats from the Faroe Islands and Greenland, the final tally for the parties supporting the Social Democrat leader Thorning-Schmidt was 92 seats, while the parties backing the outgoing PM Lars Løkke Rasmussen secured 87.\n\nThorning-Schmidt went on to form a minority coalition with the Social Liberal party and the Socialist People’s party and became Denmark’s first female prime minister.\n\nAt the more recent European parliament election, in 2014, the People’s party won the most MEPs, followed by the Social Democrats and Venstre.\n\nThe Danish electorate is highly engaged\n\nDenmark has one of the highest levels of voter turnout in the world. The proportion of the electorate who voted was 87.7% in 2011, 86.6% in 2007), 84.5% in 2005 and 87.2% in 2001.\n\nThe candidates\n\nThere are 799 candidates standing in this election, of whom 31% are women and 69% are men. Radikale and the Conservative People’s party have the most female candidates with 40% and 38% respectively.\n\nThe most common male candidate names are Anders, Henrik and Søren (14 candidates each), and the most common female name is Helle (nine candidates) followed by Anne (eight).\n\nOf the current group of MPs, 38% are women. Among EU members, only Sweden, Finland, Spain and Belgium have more women in parliament.\n\nWhat do the polls say?\n\nPre-election polls suggest the two main blocs are virtually tied. This year’s election could turn out to be a reversal of 2011: the Social Democrats may well emerge as the largest party, but the centre-right bloc could have the numbers to form a government.\n\nIf the seat distribution is as tight as the polls suggest, the four seats in Greenland and the Faroe Islands could prove decisive.\n\nBut as always with polling, the usual note of caution applies.

Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., a member of the Oversight Committee, said there is a confidential informant who wants to testify before the committees about the sale.\n\n\"We're not going to jump to any conclusions at this time,\" Nunes said at a news conference. \"Our job is to get the facts ... and we're going to do just that.\"\n\nRecent reports in The Hill newspaper said there was an FBI investigation into Russian officials engaging in bribery and extortion while trying to buy Uranium One, a Canadian company that controlled 20% of the U.S. uranium supply.\n\nRepublicans are now questioning why the Obama administration and the State Department, under Clinton's leadership, allowed the sale to the Russian government-run Rosatom, and whether donations to the Clinton Foundation had any role in the decision.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders applauded the new investigations, saying “I certainly think it’s a move in the right direction and it’s something we’ve spoken about several times here — that if there was any collusion whatsoever during the campaigns at any point, or any collusion at any point with another country, that they should look at the Clintons.”\n\nClinton dismissed Republican concerns about the sale of U.S. uranium mines to the Russians during her tenure as \"baloney\" during an interview on C-SPAN on Monday.\n\nShe said Republicans are just trying to draw attention away from the ongoing probes into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Three congressional committees — including the House Intelligence Committee — and special counsel Robert Mueller are conducting investigations of the election meddling.\n\n\"I think the real story is how nervous they (Republicans) are about these continuing investigations,\" Clinton said on C-SPAN.\n\nThe chairmen of the House Oversight Committee and the House Judiciary Committee also announced Tuesday that they have opened a joint investigation into decisions made by the Justice Department while it was probing Hillary Clinton's private email server.\n\nThat inquiry will look into such questions as why the FBI publicly announced an investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of State but did not publicly disclose an investigation of Trump's campaign associates.\n\n\"These investigations were initiated on a partisan basis, and will shed no light on Russia's interference in the 2016 election, but then again they are not intended to do so.,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. \"They are designed to distract attention and pursue the President's preferred goal – attacking Clinton and Obama.\"\n\nRep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who was chairman of the Intelligence Committee at the time or the uranium sale, said he wrote to former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to express concern about the deal back in 2010.\n\n\"We were questioning the policy about why 20 percent of America's uranium supply was going to a Russian-owned company,\" King said. \"It didn't seem to make sense to us.\"\n\nBoth Nunes and Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., are seen by Democrats as highly partisan leaders. Nunes served on Trump's transition team, and Gowdy chaired the special committee House Republicans created to investigate the 2012 attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi.\n\nNunes announced in April that he would temporarily give up control of the committee's Russia investigation while the House Ethics Committee investigated complaints against him for his handling of classified information.\n\nNunes has remained chairman of the committee, but Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, has officially been leading the Russia probe. However, Nunes has continued to issue subpoenas related to the investigation, sparking an outcry from Democrats.\n\nNunes has said that he did not recuse himself in April when he temporarily stepped aside from the Russia probe and still has the power to issue subpoenas. Nunes has been focusing on the \"unmasking\" of Trump aides by U.S. intelligence agencies — disclosing their identities in intelligence reports — an issue that he views as separate from the overall Russia investigation.\n\nRead more:\n\nHouse committees to investigate Justice Department decisions about Clinton probe\n\nTop Democrat fears House Intelligence Committee may split on Russia probe findings\n\nPelosi: Nunes' behavior on House Intelligence panel is 'beneath the dignity' of a chairman\n\nDevin Nunes temporarily steps aside in Russian meddling probe\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2yIh07u",

  "latent_26982": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, the mayor of Warsaw, introduced bus lanes on one of the city’s main arteries to cut travel times by public transport and to encourage more people to use it, not everybody in the Polish capital was impressed.\n\n“There was a lot of opposition,” Gronkiewicz-Waltz said.\n\n“It’s not easy to convince people to use public transport if driving a car is still quite an entrenched habit.”\n\nEight years later, Warsaw’s residents - or Varsovians - have not only got used to bus lanes but thanks to the city’s growing network of bike lanes they can now also cycle around town using one of the 4,500 municipal bicycles available for hire.\n\nGronkiewicz-Waltz, who took office in 2006 as the first woman to hold the position, says she wants to tackle Warsaw’s pollution and make Poland’s capital and largest city climate-friendly as a legacy for future generations.\n\n“Everybody wants to live in a healthy environment,” Gronkiewicz-Waltz told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview in Polish. “In my case it’s also about my daughter and grandchildren - they are an additional motivation.”\n\nAround the world, cities are increasingly at the forefront of action to curb climate change. Some have set ambitious emissions reduction goals, while others have pushed ahead with policies despite national-level foot dragging.\n\nAnd increasingly, many of the cities leading on climate change – Paris, Washington, Sydney, Cape Town – are run by women.\n\nIn two years, the number of women leading large cities that are at the forefront of climate action has risen from four to 16, according to the C40 Cities network of more than 80 cities committed to addressing climate change.\n\nBut while Gronkiewicz-Waltz sometimes has to tell her husband off for not sorting rubbish properly, she doesn’t think women are better climate defenders than men.\n\n“I don’t want to sound sexist,” she said. “Perhaps women pay more attention to green areas and cleanliness but men are sensitive, too.”\n\nREVOLUTION OF THE MINDSETS\n\nChanges happening in Warsaw are perhaps most visible on the banks of the Vistula, Poland’s biggest river.\n\nOne of is shores has been returned back to its natural state, allowing Varsovians to relax on a sandy beach, cycle, walk along its leafy banks and even enjoy cross-country skiing in the winter.\n\n“It’s like being on holiday,” said Gronkiewicz-Waltz.\n\nFollowing upgrading work, the city’s wastewater plant now generates nearly 50 percent of its power onsite, while later this year Varsovians will be able to test a new car sharing scheme - another initiative aimed at making the capital’s air cleaner.\n\nGronkiewicz-Waltz said many investments toward a greener environment in Warsaw have been possible thanks to funding from the European Union.\n\n“Modernising old trams, SKM (rapid city trains) would certainly have been impossible without EU funds,” said Gronkiewicz-Waltz, a former central bank head.\n\nShe said while changing mindsets and cutting planet-warming emissions in coal-dependent Poland was a struggle, the country had emerged as a pioneer in the battle against climate change, in part thanks to support from young people.\n\n“The difficulties were in changing some attitudes such as that a car is cool or that smog is not really all that harmful. Even the health minister was surprised that we should be fighting smog,” Gronkiewicz-Waltz said in a phone interview.\n\n“But now I think we are pioneers and climate conscience in Poland is maybe even stronger than in some Western countries,”\n\n“All this was perhaps a bit of a revolution in our civilization, and maybe because of that it wasn’t easy, but we’ve done it.”",

(Photo: Jin Liangkuai, AP)\n\nHANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Vietnamese naval vessels and Chinese ships collided Wednesday in the South China Sea as Hanoi sought to prevent Beijing from setting up an oil rig in an area claimed by both nations, a Vietnamese government official said.\n\nThe official said no shots were fired and there were no reports of injuries in the incident, the most serious in years between the two countries at sea. If neither side steps down, clashes could break out between the two navies in what has long been regarded as a possible global flashpoint.\n\nChina's stationing of the oil rig over the weekend has been seen as one of its most provocative steps in a gradual campaign of asserting its sovereignty in the South China Sea, parts of which are also claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations.\n\nTwo foreign diplomats said Vietnam dispatched up to 29 armed naval and coast guard ships to areas near the oil rig when it became aware of China's intentions. Citing a Chinese diplomat, one said the Vietnamese deployment was meant to be a \"show of force\" to get Beijing to withdraw the rig.\n\nAll spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the information.\n\nChina moved the giant deep-sea oil rig to an area close to the Paracel Islands on May 2 accompanied by a large flotilla of naval vessels. It also announced that no foreign ships would be allowed within a 3-mile (4.8-kilometer) radius of the $1 billion rig.\n\nVietnam immediately called the deployment illegal and demanded China withdraw the rig, around 220 kilometers (140 miles) off the Vietnamese coast.\n\nThe Vietnamese official said Vietnam's ships were outnumbered by the Chinese flotilla escorting the rig.\n\nHe said the ships were trying to stop the rig from \"establishing a fixed position\" at the spot where it wanted to drill.\n\nChina's assertiveness along with its growing military and economic might is alarming many smaller countries in the region even as they are aware they need to keep relations open with a vital trading partner.\n\nThe United States, which is undertaking a military and economic \"pivot\" toward Asia in part to counter Chinese influence, shares the concerns of the smaller nations. In a strongly worded statement in Washington on Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called China's action \"provocative and unhelpful to the maintenance of peace and stability in the region.\"\n\nVietnam has limited leverage in dealing with its giant neighbor and vital economic partner. It can't afford damaged ties with Beijing and has no hope of competing with it militarily. While it is no longer as isolated as it once was, the country can't expect much diplomatic help from powerful friends.\n\n\"China seems intent on putting down its footprint squarely in contested waters and force Hanoi's hand. It appears a critical juncture has occurred and one would expect Hanoi to be weighing its options,\" said Jonathan London, a Vietnam expert at the City University of Hong Kong. \"Hanoi's back is against the wall, though China's policies — which according to virtually everyone except China are baseless legally — have brought about this situation.\"\n\nChina occupied the Paracel Islands 40 years ago, and 74 U.S.-backed South Vietnamese forces died in a subsequent military clash. The Vietnamese and Chinese navies clashed again in 1988 in the disputed Spratly Islands, leaving 64 Vietnamese sailors dead.\n\nIn 1992, China awarded a contract to U.S. energy company Crestone to explore for oil and gas in the Spratly Islands. Vietnam protested the move. Two years later, Vietnam's navy forced the company's oil rigs to leave the area.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1qdqLk4",

  "latent_27554": "Preview | Recap | Notebook\n\nGrizzlies-Hornets Preview\n\nBy TAYLOR BECHTOLD\n\nPosted Mar 21 2013 4:16PM While the Memphis Grizzlies couldn't get on track offensively, their outstanding defense proved up to the challenge against one of the NBA's highest-scoring teams. The Grizzlies aren't likely to face as difficult of a task on Friday night when they visit the New Orleans Hornets, one of the lowest-scoring teams in the Western Conference. Memphis (46-21), however, will have to remain focused following a dramatic 90-89 overtime victory over Oklahoma City on Wednesday. Marc Gasol tipped in Zach Randolph's miss with less than a second remaining to give the Grizzlies an emotional win over the defending conference champs. Mike Conley finished with a team-high 24 points, while Jerryd Bayless added 20 and hit a key 3-pointer with 3.7 seconds left to send the game to overtime. Gasol and Randolph combined for 29 points and 33 rebounds despite shooting 11 for 35. With Memphis making just 36.0 percent as a team, its defense keyed the victory. The Grizzlies held an Oklahoma City team that ranks near the top of the NBA in scoring (106.4) to just 83 points in regulation, 2 of 18 shooting from 3-point range and a season-low 35.7 percent from the field. \"We win in a variety of ways. It's never pretty,\" said Conley. \"That's that grit-and-grind motto right there. We just find a way to win however it is.\" Memphis, which leads the NBA at 89.2 points allowed per game, won for the 16th time in 19 games and kept pace in a three-team fight with Denver and the Los Angeles Clippers for third place in the West. Now the Grizzlies will try to snap a two-game road skid on Friday against the Hornets (23-46), who rank near the bottom of the West at 93.9 points per game Southwest Division-worst New Orleans is also coming off a last-second victory as Anthony Davis overcame a stomach ailment and tapped in the go-ahead bucket in an 87-86 win over Boston on Wednesday. \"I was really tired, but I knew my team needed me, so I was trying to fight through it,\" said Davis, who had nine points and eight rebounds. \"I'm glad I did. It was a big win for us.\" Ryan Anderson had 21 points and Eric Gordon added 18 to help the Hornets rally from a 13-point second-half deficit and snap a four-game losing streak. New Orleans, though, will have to find a way to knock down its open looks against the defensive-minded Grizzlies after averaging 85.3 points on 41.7 percent shooting in its last four games. Memphis looks to take three of four in the season series after winning 96-89 in New Orleans on Dec. 7 and 96-85 at home on March 9. The Hornets limited the Grizzlies to 36.4 percent shooting in a 91-83 win in Memphis on Jan. 27. Randolph totaled 35 points and 20 rebounds for Memphis in the first two games against New Orleans before missing the last contest because of a left ankle sprain. Anderson has been a key weapon for the Hornets, averaging 18.0 points and hitting 11 for 25 from 3-point range over the three meetings. Davis, meanwhile, had one of his best games against the Grizzlies earlier this month, totaling 20 points and 18 rebounds.

Lopez had 23 points, including a key putback and a pair of free throws in the final 1:11, and the Hornets beat the playoff-contending Memphis Grizzlies 90-83 on Friday. Lopez also had 10 rebounds and Davis added 18 points and 15 boards for New Orleans, which has won two in a row against teams in playoff contention, the first coming against Boston on Wednesday night. \"Our big guys did a good job playing with a great amount of intensity and they were the difference in the game,\" said guard Greivis Vasquez, who had 12 points and nine assists. \"When you have a guy like Robin Lopez, the way he played tonight, it's huge. If he does that consistently, I think we can be a different team for sure.\" Mike Conley scored 20 points while nearly leading the Grizzlies back from a 16-point fourth-quarter hole. His consecutive 3s had Memphis as close as 83-81 with 2:36 left, but Vasquez answered with a big 3 on a kick-out from Eric Gordon and Lopez's putback made it 88-81. Gordon, who scored 11 points, had only two assists, but Vasquez said Gordon deserved credit for the pass that set up his momentum-changing 3 with 1:50 left. \"He got me a wide-open shot,\" Vasquez said. \"He could have easily scored or got a foul and he just kicked the ball out to me and I was ready to hit that shot.\" Marc Gasol had 16 points for the Grizzlies, while Zach Randolph added 14 and Jerryd Bayless 12. \"We were just not playing defensively and the game got away,\" Gasol said. \"They did a great job of rebounding and we did not help on the drive and did not contest shots. They just had an open lane for rebounds.\" Lopez and Davis helped the Hornets outrebound Memphis 49-33. Lopez had six offensive boards, a key factor in the Hornets' 22-12 advantage in second-chance points. \"Everybody was being aggressive,\" Lopez said. \"I got some cleanup baskets. Anthony was attacking and they had to box him out. They left me wide open.\" Hornets coach Monty Williams conceded that he left Lopez in the game longer planned - nearly 30 minutes - because Ryan Anderson was in foul trouble. The way Lopez, in his fifth season, and Davis, a rookie, played together this time left Williams bullish about how the pair might blossom in upcoming seasons. \"At some point, we are going to have a big tandem in this city that is going to be one of the best in the league,\" Williams said. The Hornets also wound up outshooting Memphis 47.4 percent (36 of 76) to 41.1 percent (30 of 73). \"It was a disappointing loss. They really took it to us on the glass,\" Memphis coach Lionel Hollins said. \"Both Davis and Lopez worked hard all night. You just have to tip your hat to them.\" Coming off an impressive overtime victory against Oklahoma City, Memphis dominated early, forcing seven early turnovers and going up by 11 when Conley's free throws made it 21-10. That turned out to be the largest lead of the game for the Grizzlies. New Orleans pulled into a 27-all tie on Gordon's 3 in the middle of the second quarter. After that, Memphis managed to maintain a slim lead for much of the second period until Al-Farouq Aminu's inside basket sparked an 8-0 run to close the half, capped by Gordon's last-second floater that gave New Orleans a 48-43 lead at the break. Memphis was back within a point after Randolph scored inside to make it 56-55, but the Hornets then put together an 11-1 run late in the third period, with eight straight points coming from Lopez before Anderson added a 3 to make it 67-56. Anderson's second 3 gave New Orleans its largest lead at 76-60. Memphis then began to make one final push during which Conley scored 11 points on three 3s and a pair of free throws, but the Hornets, who have blown several double-digit leads this season, uncharacteristically made all the plays they needed to in the clutch. NOTES: The victory marked the first time the Hornets (24-46) have won two straight since the All-Star break. ... A shot by Anderson that was ruled a 3 on the floor late in the first quarter was changed to a two-pointer on video review in between periods. Still, the two 3s Anderson made gave him 187 for the season, tied for third most in a single season in franchise history with Baron Davis. ... Anderson has accounted for just more than 40 percent of all made 3s by the Hornets this season. ... Conley, who came in as the NBA's steals leader with 148, had two more in New Orleans. ... Memphis (46-22) has lost three straight on the road to fall to 19-14 away from home. ... The Grizzlies finished with a 16-0 advantage in fast-break points.\n\nCopyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

Scenes that had already been filmed were shot again featuring Fox.[2]\n\nIn 2010, he portrayed Daniel Graystone in the science fiction television series Caprica, and became a regular director on the television series Glee.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nStoltz was born in Whittier, California, the son of Evelyn B. (née Vawter),[3] a violinist and schoolteacher, and Jack Stoltz, an elementary school teacher.[4] He has two sisters, Catherine, an opera singer,[5] and Susan, a writer.[6]\n\nStoltz was raised in both American Samoa and Santa Barbara, California, where as a child he once earned money playing piano for local musical theatre productions.[7] He attended the University of Southern California, but dropped out after his junior year.[8] He moved to New York in 1981 and studied with Stella Adler and Peggy Feury.[9]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nIn the 1970s Stoltz joined a repertory company that performed ten plays at the Edinburgh Festival. He returned to the United States in 1979, when he entered USC as a drama student, but subsequently dropped out to pursue film and TV roles.[10]\n\nIn 1978, he was cast as Steve Benson in the TV adaptation of Erma Bombeck's The Grass Is Always Greener over the Septic Tank.[11]\n\nDirector Cameron Crowe and Stoltz became friends while making Stoltz's first feature film, Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), which Crowe wrote and in which Stoltz had a minor role. According to Stoltz, Crowe promised Stoltz a role in all of his future films.[12]\n\nHe appeared in each of Crowe's next four films, The Wild Life, Say Anything..., Singles, and Jerry Maguire.\n\nOriginally cast as Marty McFly for Back to the Future in late 1984, he was replaced after about a month of filming when Michael J. Fox (the director's first choice for the role) agreed to divide time between the movie and his television sitcom Family Ties.[13] The director, Robert Zemeckis, said that while Stoltz provided an admirable performance, it lacked the precise comedic sense that Zemeckis was seeking.[14] Some of the original footage, where Stoltz does not appear but was on set, was used in the film.[15] Stoltz playing the character was referenced in the 2010 episode of Fringe titled \"Peter\" when, in a parallel universe, a theater marquee reads \"Back to the Future starring Eric Stoltz\".[16]\n\nIn 1985, Stoltz garnered attention with a Golden Globe nomination starring as Rocky Dennis in Mask. Among other roles in the 1980s, he appeared in the 1987 hit Some Kind of Wonderful, written and produced by John Hughes.[citation needed]\n\nDuring the 1990s, Stoltz went back and forth between stage, film, and television, appearing in studio and independent films such as Pulp Fiction (1994) and The Waterdance (1992). He also produced the films Bodies, Rest & Motion in 1993, Sleep with Me in 1994, and Mr. Jealousy in 1997.[citation needed]\n\nHe continued to appear on the New York stage, both on Broadway (Three Sisters, Two Shakespearean Actors, Arms and the Man) and off-Broadway (The Importance of Being Earnest, The Glass Menagerie, Sly Fox and Our Town). He was nominated for a Tony Award as Featured Actor for his performance as George Gibbs in the 1989 Broadway revival of Thornton Wilder's Our Town.[17]\n\nA performance of this production was featured on Great Performances: Live from Lincoln Center, which received a 1989 Emmy nomination.[18]\n\nOn television, he had a recurring role as Helen Hunt's character's ex-boyfriend on Mad About You (five episodes, 1994–1998), spent a year on Chicago Hope (1994), and did some TV and cable movies such as Inside (1996) (directed by Arthur Penn) and The Passion of Ayn Rand (1999), with Helen Mirren. Stoltz received the Indie Sup(Y)port Award at the 1998 Los Angeles Film Festival.[19]\n\nDuring the first part of the 2000s, he starred with Gillian Anderson in The House of Mirth (2000), based on the novel by Edith Wharton. From 2001 to 2002, he had a recurring role as the English teacher-poet August Dimitri in ABC's Once and Again, wherein Julia Whelan's character, a teenager, fell in love with his character. He directed an episode of the show in 2002.\n\nIn 2003, he played his first leading TV role in Out of Order, which was canceled after five episodes. In 2004, he appeared in The Butterfly Effect as a child molester; the following year, he guest-starred in the NBC sitcom Will & Grace as Debra Messing's love interest. He was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for his direction of the cable movie My Horrible Year! (2001).[20] He also directed a short film entitled The Bulls[7] as well as the highest rated episode of Law & Order in 2005, entitled \"Tombstone\". He appeared in the music video of The Residents' \"Give It to Someone Else\", featured on The Commercial DVD.[21]\n\nHe has contributed essays to the books City Secrets—New York as well as Life Interrupted by Spalding Gray and appears on the children's CD Philadelphia Chickens.[22]\n\nBeginning in 2007, Stoltz directed episodes of the drama series Quarterlife, which began airing as webisodes and were then picked up to air on the NBC network in 2008. Stoltz played a serial killer in need of medical attention in three episodes of the fifth season of Grey's Anatomy.[23] He has also directed two episodes of Grey's Anatomy.\n\nStoltz starred as Daniel Graystone, inventor of the Cylons, in the science fiction television series Caprica, a prequel set 58 years before the Battlestar Galactica series.\n\nHe became a regular director of Glee, directing a total of 12 episodes, including \"Nationals\", in which the Glee club finally wins the championship.[24]\n\nIn 2011 Stoltz was seen back on the silver screen with the film Fort McCoy; he earned accolades for his leading role as a conflicted barber of German heritage forced to suppress his American patriotism after moving his family to a post–World War II military base housing a German POW camp.\n\nStarting in 2014, Stoltz became the producing director of the CBS political drama series Madam Secretary. The following year he became one of its four executive producers, alongside Morgan Freeman and Barbara Hall, and has directed more than ten episodes, as well as starring alongside Tea Leoni in several episodes as her brother, Will Adams.[25]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nActor [ edit ]\n\nFilms [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nDirector [ edit ]\n\nFilms [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Notes 2005 The Bulls Short film 2007 The Grand Design Short film 2017 Confessions of a Teenage Jesus Jerk Independent film 2016 Class Rank Independent film\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nHe has directed many shows on The Learning Channel, TLC Network.\n\nProducer [ edit ]\n\nFilms [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Notes 1993 Bodies, Rest & Motion 1994 Sleep with Me 1997 Mr. Jealousy Executive producer 2005 The Bulls Short film (executive producer) 2006 The Lather Effect Associate producer 2007 The Grand Design Short film (executive producer) 2011 Fort McCoy",
  "latent_27666": "In September, after Doug Ford made a promise on behalf of Rob Ford that Rob Ford had no intention of keeping, the mayor’s staff finally felt compelled to distance itself from the mayor’s older brother and best friend. “Councillor Ford speaks for Ward 2,” Rob Ford’s chief of staff, Mark Towhey, said in a statement, “and he’s Vice Chair of Budget Committee and Build Toronto among other official functions. He has insightful opinions on many issues but he does not speak for the Mayor or the Mayor’s Office. Mayor Ford speaks for himself.”\n\nMayor Rob Ford talks with brother Doug Ford during recent proceedings of the city's compliance audit committee, which decided not to prosecute him for campaign finance violations. ( DAVID COOPER / TORONTO STAR )\n\nFive months later, after a committee decided not to prosecute Rob Ford over alleged campaign finance violations, he held a press conference in the mayor’s office. He delivered a statement, immediately left the room, and had someone else take questions from reporters on his behalf: his campaign manager, Councillor Ford. It’s complicated. Doug Ford has been the most vigorous defender of his brother’s words and behaviour, the most consistent advocate of his brother’s waning political agenda, and the fiercest counter-critic of his brother’s foes — an unquestionable asset, especially as the mayor withdrew from the media and other conservatives publicly and privately distanced themselves.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nDoug Ford has also been responsible for some of his brother’s biggest failures. His flippant dismissal of Margaret Atwood and casual endorsement of library closures galvanized opposition to the mayor’s cost-cutting plans. His self-professed “backroom vision” for a mega-mall and a giant Ferris wheel in the Port Lands led to the administration’s first major defeat. The brotherly weight-loss challenge he conceived — then won by a mile — caused the mayor stress and embarrassment. Atwood derisively suggested that Doug Ford is a co-mayor. While that is an exaggeration, no councillor, including the deputy mayor, holds nearly so much informal power. Centrists have complained that Doug Ford has engaged in bare-knuckle vote-whipping efforts, threatening to either run a Ford-backed candidate against them or fund robocalls intended to undermine them if they refuse to support the administration’s agenda. But councillors say he has also served as a bridge of sorts. A natural salesman who is social even with people he doesn’t like, he has done some of the relationship-building and give-and-take that is unnatural to his shy and uncompromising brother. On occasion — in urging his mayor to attend a Pride event, in supporting a recent compromise on firefighter hiring — he has demonstrated a pragmatism critics say Rob Ford lacks.\n\n“I’ve always believed that Doug actually makes Rob a smarter mayor,” said Councillor Adam Vaughan, a critic. “I think he brings the word ‘yes’ to that office . . . Doug has had the ability to get him to say yes to a few things.” Some of the mayor’s aides have privately moaned about the additional headaches Doug Ford has created for them. Early in the term, an administration official asked one of their council loyalists to serve as an informal advisor to Doug Ford in an attempt to keep him on message.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\n“They usually try to muzzle me up,” Doug Ford said half-jokingly on the radio in November. He did not say who “they” were. Rob Ford, known for his unfiltered manner, has sometimes himself sounded like a worried PR handler on the weekly radio show they co-host — responding to Doug Ford’s hyperbole with a nervous “wow” or groan, admonishing him with an irritated “you can’t say that,” snapping at a jibe about his weight-loss failings. Their banter is jocular and competitive, and Doug Ford has raised eyebrows with one-upping cracks at the mayor’s expense. When Rob Ford has been asked about Doug Ford, though, he has usually responded with unabashed sentimentality. “Some brothers don’t get along,” he told Maclean’s in 2011. “We love each other past the point of love.” With files from Paul Moloney\n\nRead more about:",

  "latent_27722": "Pin 7 Flip 21 Shares\n\nIt’s a mood; it’s not the rest of your life\n\nWe all have days where we feel “blah,” somehow less than ourselves. Some days that “blah” feeling gets amped up by a factor of 100.\n\nWe drag ourselves through our morning routine, stagger to work, and plop down in our chairs (if that’s the kind of work we do) and we wonder “what the daylights happened to me?”\n\nNow while the biological causes of these ultra-bad moods are varied, let’s just look at what we can do for ourselves to navigate the day.\n\nGuideline One: A bad day isn’t the end of the world. Nowhere is it written that every day must have sunshine, complete with unicorns frolicking on the lawn. You are not letting anyone down by having a bad day.\n\nGuideline Two: It also isn’t written that you feel guilty or shamed about feeling bad, either. Give yourself permission and space to deal with that bad mood without judging yourself.\n\nGuideline Three: It’s a mood. It’s not the rest of your life.\n\nGuideline Four: Remember, while our emotions are real, they are not all of reality itself.\n\nGuideline Four: Yes, we do have to meet the world, and sometimes our mood is the pits. How do we avoid alienating those we care about—and those we report to?\n\nI suggest “stepping back”. Stepping back is a process in which we deliberately avoid known stress triggers in order to minimize the impact of our mood on our environment—and ourselves.\n\nIt’s a good idea to establish a “safe haven” and a “safe routine”—a place where you can de-stress and a set of activities that help you shed the negative emotions from a bad day.\n\nSometimes it’s very tough to identify what the cause of a rough day is. Sometimes we wake up with the subtle feeling that something is “off,” or wrong.\n\nI’ve found the best way to deal with this feeling is to go about a normal routine as much as possible, while reminding myself of the guidelines above.\n\nThere are days, and we all have them, where it is enough to simply endure, to keep the most critical of our responsibilities met, to have no fear of asking for help from others, and to simply get through the day as best we can.\n\nThe most important thing to do is to avoid leveling judgment against ourselves.\n\nWe always tend to be our own worst critics—and criticism is the last thing a person having a bad day needs.\n\nWhat do you do when you have a bad day?

There's division over whether automatic tax hikes should target the individual rates or the business side of the equation. After their Wednesday lunch, lawmakers also suggested that instead of the trigger setting off tax increases, it could instead require the party to cut discretionary spending.\n\nWhile most lawmakers aren't drawing any red lines at this point, there is widespread concern in the conference that the trigger could backfire if the country enters a recession. They also worry that the trigger could interject uncertainty into the tax bill, something that lawmakers say could undermine the underlying goal of generating growth.\n\nRead More",
  "latent_27759": "The number of workers trapped in insecure jobs has rocketed by a shocking 660,000 (27%) over the past five years, highlighting a growing trend in zero-hours contracts and other forms of employment that offer little or no guarantee of hours or basic working rights.\n\nA newstudy commissioned by the Trade Union Congress (TUC), from the Learning and Work Institute, shows that many more people are finding themselves driven from traditional industries into precarious jobs.\n\nThe TUC estimates that 10% of the UK workforce now work in insecure jobs, or more than 3million people up and down the country – up from 2.4 million in 2011.\n\nThe number of waiters and care workers alone in insecure work, including zero-hours contracts and temporary agency work, has more than doubled since 2011.\n\nUnison general secretary Dave Prentis said: “Homecare workers are under severe pressure to provide top-notch – and often intimate – care, while building vital personal relationships with the people they care for.\n\n“But with many on zero-hours contracts, it makes it a lot likelier they won’t be regularly caring for the same individuals. It also means care workers are understandably reluctant to challenge their employers when things aren’t as they should be, for fear of losing work.\n\n“Unfortunately that’s why the non-payment of travel time, minimum wage violations and visits too short to dispense proper care are all too frequent.”\n\nAccording to the TUC, restaurant and pub waiters make up one fifth of the increase, rising by 146,000 (+128%) over the past five years. 1 in 4 (259,000) are now stuck in insecure work.\n\nEducation workers account for over one tenth of the increase, rising by 82,000, affecting 1 in 10 workers in the sector. While social care accounts for a tenth of the increase, rising by 66,000 (+133%) since 2011 – 1 in 10 are now in insecure jobs.\n\nTUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “Insecurity at work is becoming the new normal for too many workers. It’s happening across new and old industries, with workers forced onto shady contracts whether they’re Uber drivers, bar staff or teaching assistants.\n\n“People need jobs they can live on and build a life around. But if you don’t how much work you will have from one day to the next, making ends meet is a nightmare.\n\n“How is a working parent supposed to plan childcare when they don’t know the hours they’ll be working?\n\n“And how can it be right that in 2017 workers are at the mercy of bad bosses who can just take away all their hours or throw them off the job with no notice?\n\n“The rules that protect workers need to be dragged into the 21st Century. The government’s Taylor review is a prime opportunity to sort this.\n\n“But we also need to get more people into unions. Workers in unionised workplaces are twice as likely to be on secure contract.

  "latent_28028": "Some of you don’t like the fact that I don’t like credit cards. One of my regular readers criticized me for putting too much blame on credit cards. He thinks that the lack of personal responsibility is what causes people to misuse credit cards, not the credit card itself. I agree that personal responsibility is the key to sound money management, but credit cards are a horrible financial product. The universal default provision, which many of you are familiar with, is the best reason why it is such a horrible product.\n\nWhat is the universal default provision?\n\nIt is a clause in many credit card agreements which states that if you are late on ANY credit payments, the credit card company reserves the right to increase your interest rate at any time without notice. Not only will it kick in if you are late on a different credit card, it also applies if you are late on a utility, mortgage, or car loan payment. Your “fixed” interest rate of 9% could increase to 29% in one day if your credit card contains this provision.\n\nIs It Fair?\n\nThis is a matter of opinion. On one hand, when you sign on the dotted line to receive a credit card, you are agreeing to all of the terms and conditions of the card. On the other hand, does anyone ever read all of that fine print? Plus, it’s seen as shady and opportunistic on the part of the credit card company. Although, it does make a little sense on the part of the credit card company. You may have had a great credit score in 2005 that allowed you to receive a great interest rate, but now your credit score is 100 points lower for late payments. Shouldn’t the credit card company have the right to charge you more interest since you are a higher risk to them?\n\nCongress and Legislation\n\nSince 2003, Congress has attempted to pass several bills to completely eliminate the use of the universal default provision in credit card terms. Congress views it as a predatory lending practice. So far, Citi Bank and JP Morgan are the only credit card issuing institution to remove their universal default provision. United States Senator, Carl Levin, has given the credit card issuers an ultimatum, either they remove it themselves, or Congress will do it for them. So Far, Bank of America, Discover Card, and Capital One are still defending the provision.\n\nThere is a lot of money to be lost for the credit card companies if they lose the battle. I’m not a fan of credit cards for many reasons, and this is one of them. They cause you to spend more money, they tempt you to spend when you shouldn’t spend, and they will take any angle to make more money off of you when possible. If credit card companies ever create policies that benefit the consumer, I’ll consider using them. I know there are many of you out there that make a couple hundred dollars a year by paying for everything on a cash-back rewards program card, but it only takes one wrong move or one personal disaster to allow the credit card company to make their money back from you.

  "latent_28166": "Bike theft takes just seconds -- and can be a team effort. That's what the News4 I-Team learned as it watched Metro Police fight the hundreds of bike thefts near Metro stations in D.C. each year. And they tracked bikes to see where they ended up after being stolen. (Published Wednesday, Aug. 20, 2014)\n\nThe would-be bike theft happened in seconds.\n\nFirst, a guy in a red jersey with the number 3 on the back showed up to scope out bikes parked in a bike rack outside the NoMa Gallaudet Metro station in northeast D.C. Then he gave a thumbs-up sign to another guy, who was himself riding a bike.\n\nThe bike-rider pulled a large set of bolt cutters from a newspaper stand and went in for the steal.\n\n“It’s kind of like a wolf pack mentality,\" Metro Transit Police Chief Ronald Pavlik, who said the team approach is typical of bike theft in the District. \"They have no problem doing it in the open.”\n\nBut these thieves picked the wrong bike on this day. They tried to take a \"bait bike\" belonging to Metro Transit Police. Before the duo could get away with the bike, police chased them down and arrested both men.\n\nThe bait bike program started two years ago to combat one of Metro’s biggest crimes: bike theft. Last year, more than 400 bikes were stolen from Metro stations. There were 1,060 bike thefts in the rest of D.C., one of the fastest-growing cities for bicycle riding in the country.\n\nMany of the crimes happened in busy sections including K Street in Georgetown, F Street in Penn Quarter and 14th Street in Columbia Heights -- or around Metro stations.\n\n“It’s something we're challenged with every day,\" Pavlik said.\n\nMost of the crimes happen late morning to early afternoon, when commuters are at work, as the News4 I-Team saw at the Braddock Road Metro station in Alexandria, Virginia. This time, however, the man worked alone. He spotted the bait bike attached to a railing after getting off Metrorail.\n\nNews4 cameras caught him pulling on the bike, checking the wheels and positioning the seat before riding off. Metro police arrested him, charging him with grand larceny.\n\n“It was just sitting there, sir,” the man told the News4 I-Team’s Scott MacFarlane. “It's not my bike, it truly isn't. I made a mistake. I made a mistake.\"\n\nMetro says high end bikes are usually the target, and they may be broken down for parts. \"Is it reused? Resold? That's the bigger question,\" Pavlik said.\n\nIt’s a question the News4 I-Team wanted to know too. So the team borrowed a popular bike from Performance Bicycle to set up at different areas around the D.C. area hit hard by thieves, and added a GPS tracking device which tracked the bike’s every move.\n\nPerformance Bicycle's manager, Jonathan Brandenburg, said he often hears about bike thefts from customers. “Usually it's the whole bike. Occasionally, bits and pieces of the bike going,\" said Brandenburg. “Ultimately, no bike lock is 100 percent.”\n\nIt was on 14th Street in Columbia Heights where the News4 I-Team bike first got noticed, around 3 p.m. Two guys checked out the bike, which was locked up in front of a coffee shop. The two pulled up to the rack, left their unlocked bike next to the News4 bike and walked away -- only to return minutes later with bolt cutters.\n\nBait Bikes Are Stolen as Police, I-Team Watch\n\nIt took just a few seconds for one of the guys to bend over and cut the cable lock on the News4 bike before taking off. But this time, the thief was being tracked, with the tracking device on the bike sending minute-by-minute locations to a cell phone.\n\nThe I-Team eventually found him three blocks away in front of a convenience store, where he had stopped. But when an I-Team producer approached him, the man didn’t want to talk. He ran away, leaving our bike behind.\n\nIt was another team effort at the West Hyattsville Metro station, where the News4 bike attracted two guys on a different day. At this station, 11 bikes have been stolen this year.\n\nOne of the guys appeared to be the lookout as the other one used bolt cutters to break the lock on the bike. He quickly stuffed the bolt cutters down in his pants and rode off on the bike.\n\nThe News4 I-Team followed both the men -- one of them riding on the handlebars -- about a mile down the road to an apartment complex. And again an investigative producer tried to talk to them.\n\nThat’s when the chase kicked into high gear: One man took off on foot, while the other rode down a bike trail along Sligo Creek. The News4 I-Team followed him to a second apartment complex across town and eventually a house in a Hyattsville neighborhood.\n\nThe Best Way to Lock Your Bike\n\nJonathan Brandenburg, the manager of Performance Bicycle, shows how you should lock your bike to deter theives. (Published Wednesday, Aug. 20, 2014)\n\nThe man living at the house told us he did see a guy come by on a bike, but he didn’t know him. However, the GPS signal showed the bike was still in the area.\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes, the man finally admitted he had bought the bike from the crook for $50, but didn’t know it was stolen.\n\nHe pulled the News4 I-Team bike out from the back of a van in his front yard and returned it, an hour and a half after it had been swiped. The guys who stole it got away.\n\nMORE INFO: Wondering how common bike thefts are across the nation? The FBI says 194,549 bikes were stolen in 2012, the last year for which data is available.

  "latent_28265": "In the United States, divided government describes a situation in which one party controls the executive branch while another party controls one or both houses of the legislative branch.\n\nDivided government is seen by different groups as a benefit or as an undesirable product of the model of governance used in the U.S. political system. Under said model, known as the separation of powers, the state is divided into different branches. Each branch has separate and independent powers and areas of responsibility so that the powers of one branch are not in conflict with the powers associated with the others. However, the degree to which the President of the United States has control of Congress often determines his political strength - such as the ability to pass sponsored legislation, ratify treaties, and have Cabinet members and judges approved.\n\nThe model can be contrasted with the fusion of powers in a parliamentary system where the executive and legislature (and sometimes parts of the judiciary) are unified. Those in favor of divided government believe that such separations encourage more policing of those in power by the opposition, as well as limiting spending and the expansion of undesirable laws.[1] Opponents, however, argue that divided governments become lethargic, leading to many gridlocks. In the late 1980s, Terry M. Moe, a professor of political science at Stanford University, examined the issue.[2] He concluded that divided governments lead to compromise which can be seen as beneficial, but he also noticed that divided governments subvert performance and politicize the decisions of executive agencies.\n\nEarly in the 20th century, divided government was rare, but since the 1970s it has become increasingly common.",

There are millions of people in desperate situations from Ebola victims to victims of war in Syriawho are highly dependent on the humanitarian activities of the UN.\n\n“It’s an act of great cynicism to allow someone who does not have background and qualification in this area to be put forward.”\n\nMr Lansley would replace Baroness Valerie Amos. The Labour MP Grahame Morris has written to the Prime Minister about the appointment.\n\n\"Are you not concerned that the appointment of Mr Lansley would send the message that Britain sees the UN as a convenient dumping ground for failed Tory politicians?” wrote Mr Morris.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Lansley said: “There will be a UN recruitment process and he would not wish to pre-empt that or take it for granted. The appointment is a matter for the Secretary-General.”\n\nMr Lansley was previously tipped as a future EU Commissioner, but lost out on that role this summer.",

  "latent_28577": "In the spring of 2008, William Deresiewicz taught his last class at Yale. In the summer of 2008, he published an essay explaining how an Ivy League education had messed up his life, and the lives of his students.\n\nElite schools, Deresiewicz argued, give their students an inflated sense of self-worth. They reward perfectionism and punish rebelliousness. They funnel timid students into a handful of jobs, mostly in consulting and investment banking (and now Teach for America). For a real education, he went on to suggest, you might want to head to one of the wonkier liberal arts colleges, or to a state school.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nFor those sensitive to the advantages of Deresiewicz’s pedigree (a B.A. and Ph.D. from Columbia, followed by 10 years on Yale’s English faculty), this might sound like a rarefied form of whining. But Deresiewicz’s essay took off. Then an undergraduate at Yale, I remember reading it with a quiet mix of amazement and horror. A former professor could say this stuff? About us?\n\nIn his new book, \"Excellent Sheep,\" Deresiewicz expands his argument into a full-on manifesto about the failures of the meritocracy. His timing is good. Ambitious families continue to arm their children with APs, SAT prep courses and expensive admissions advisors. At the same time, despite big financial aid packages, the student bodies at elite schools remain staggeringly affluent.\n\nSo do the schools. Yale has an endowment of some $20 billion; the University of Connecticut, 90 minutes down the road and with a student body three times as large, has an endowment one-sixtieth that size. As public institutions suffer round after round of cuts, Ivy League endowments keep swelling. When we speak of inequality, it’s not just in individual income where the disparities have grown starker.\n\nI reached Deresiewicz by phone in Portland, Oregon, where he has lived since leaving academia. Over the course of two conversations, we spoke about funding for public universities, the appeal of the homeless-to-Harvard narrative, and why admissions counselors never reward kids who blow off calculus.\n\nSo, what makes someone an excellent sheep? Can you go to, say, Harvard and not be an excellent sheep?\n\nI don’t mean to sort every student in the world into excellent sheep and not-excellent sheep, branding people as if they were cattle. Here’s my point. In the last 50 years, the system that takes kids in the Ivy League and comparable schools has evolved to create a certain kind of student. Yes, it’s possible to go to Harvard and not be an excellent sheep. The point is that the system is pushing you very hard in that direction.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWhat are some characteristics of that excellent sheep-ness? Even if students aren’t livestock, as you point out.\n\nFirst of all, they tend to be timid and risk-averse, because the system requires perfection. There’s constant busyness, the constant accumulation of credentials. And this is the sheep part: conformity. You’re doing the same things that everyone else like you is doing, in order to get the same goals that everyone like you wants. I would also add — and I’m not the first person to write about it — that there’s an enormous sense of anxiety among these students that goes beyond the normal adolescent anxiety.\n\nBasically, the system is 50 years old, but it’s getting worse all the time.\n\nWhat happened 50 years ago? Or when, historically, do you think that this educational shift begins?\n\nThat’s a very easy question to answer. But let me just add one more characteristic that may be the most controversial. I would also say that there’s intellectual shallowness. Which doesn’t mean these kids aren’t smart. They’re smart, and they’re very academically accomplished. But there’s a big disconnect now between being academically accomplished and being intellectual. Being intellectual means really getting into something and studying for its own sake, not “I need to get an A in this class, because it’s one of 20 things I need to do right now.”\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nOK, back to the history.\n\nIvy League and comparable colleges used to serve the WASP aristocracy, and the admissions process was completely different. Basically, if you went to a New England prep school, you almost certainly got in. And then there was a deliberate decision, especially at Yale in 1964, to change the system. We went from an aristocracy to what we call a meritocracy, where it didn’t matter where you went to high school, it didn’t matter your color, your gender. We’re going admit the best and the brightest, as judged by SATs and grades and other criteria.\n\nWhat’s happened since then has just been a credentials arms race.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIf you talk to admissions counselors at elite schools, they’ll swear that they want bright, curious, quirky kids — not just well-credentialed winners. Are admissions counselors being dishonest? Or are the standards so skewed that those types of kids won’t even make it past the first cut?\n\nI think that people who work in admissions offices really have the best intentions. I really do.\n\nI think that they’re looking for quirky kids with something special. But every kid has to pass that bar of having really great grades. You can’t be so quirky that you say, “You know what? I’m a word person. I’ll never become a scientist, so I’m not gonna care about getting an A in calculus, because I’d rather read another book.” I mean, forget it. You can’t be that kid. Also, the kids that do get in have become so good at gaming the system. They know how to look like that kind of person. Kids know how to manufacture the appearance of being an interesting person. That’s not the same as being an interesting person.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThere are more than 20 million Americans enrolled in some sort of college or university program right now. Only a fraction of them are going to these elite schools. I guess my question is, “So what?” How much does what happens in this narrow channel of elite education really matter?\n\nFirst of all, Harvard only admits about 2,000 kids a year. But about 35,000 kids apply. I know this is a rough estimate, but James Fallows has an essay about this from a few years ago, where he estimates that 10-15 percent of American high school students are caught up in the selective college admissions process.\n\nThat is roughly 400,000 kids a year. They’re still worth talking about. And then, actually this does impact everybody, if only because this is the leadership class. Our leaders are also excellent sheep: They’re timid; they’re risk-averse. They’re self-serving. They are intellectually underpowered and very full of themselves, because they’ve been told their whole life how wonderful they are, and therefore, that they deserve everything they’re getting.\n\nHow do you think our society …\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nEntitlement. That’s called “entitlement,” by the way.\n\nOK, so you would say we have this entitled meritocracy, which is a direct product, in some ways, of students’ experiences in high school and in elite colleges.\n\nYes.\n\nDo you think that we still need elite institutions, though? I mean, is it valuable to have schools that gather top students together, but we should be choosing those students differently? Or would you say that, just by having an educational elite, our system will always produce entitled people who go on to wreck the world?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nI would say both. I think reforming Ivy League admissions standards is tough but relatively realistic, and it’s happened in the past. One thing schools could do would be to have fewer hoops. You can only list certain extracurriculars on your application. You can’t take more than a certain number of APs.\n\nUltimately, to me, the real problem is that we have a handful of institutions that, through some historical accident, have ended up being the training ground for our leadership class. Other countries don’t do it like this; it doesn’t work this way in Canada. It doesn’t work this way in France. It doesn’t work this way in Germany, and it’s part of the reason that those societies have lower levels of inequality. So what we really need to do is the other huge thing that we did in the decades after World War II, which is a massive investment in public higher education.\n\nWhen an excerpt from your book was published in the New Republic last month, a lot of the blowback was from Ivy League alumni who come from working-class backgrounds. They cited the gigantic financial aid packages that schools like Princeton and Harvard offer. Can’t Ivy League schools fulfill this dream of social mobility? Or are we over-attached to that vision of elite schools as social mobility engines?\n\nWe’re over-attached in two respects. First of all, because we’ve evolved in the direction of this winner-take-all society. Public universities were an enormous engine of social mobility; they were the great engines of social mobility in the decades after the war. Part of the problem is the idea that you have to go to one of 10 schools if you’re going to enjoy social mobility, or if you’re going to be able to make it into the elite echelons of society.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nYes, there are people who can tell that story about themselves: “I came from a working-class background,” “I came from a middle-class background. We could never have afforded these schools.” But the other problem with this notion: There aren’t a lot of kids like that anymore, and the numbers don’t lie. These places are very class-segregated. Those stories of the kid who really was able to rise up from poverty, they become an alibi for the way the system mainly works.\n\nWhat’s the appeal, then, of that homeless-to-Harvard kind of narrative?\n\nWell, because it’s the embodiment of the American Dream, which we’d like to believe is still in good shape. But it’s not.\n\nIt’s the same reason people play the lottery. People have a wildly unrealistic idea of their chances of winning. This notion that a kid can go to Harvard: The chances that it’s going to be your kid are infinitesimal. It’s easier to set up a lottery that gives people the illusion that they have a chance, and that doesn’t cost me or you any money, than to make the kinds of commitments in terms of taxation that are actually going to hurt, that are going to take money out of affluent people’s pockets, to create a system where people really do have a decent chance.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nReading your book, I got the sense that your target wasn’t just elite education, but this larger class system that we have. At times, I felt like I was reading a critique of the bourgeoisie, or maybe what David Brooks calls “Bobos” — I don’t know if you’re familiar with his idea of Bobos, the bourgeois bohemians.\n\nYes, of course, absolutely.\n\nSo, what is your target here?\n\nWell, let me step back. My book is addressing a number of different issues and a number of different audiences, and the reason I talk about all these things is that I think they’re related, and that they need to be talked about together, and we always talk about them in isolation from one another. But there is a larger message, and the larger message is directed at this very unequal society that we’ve developed, where you have an upper middle class that David Brooks very aptly calls “bourgeois bohemian.”\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nDoes that class create these schools? Or do the schools create the class?\n\nBoth. Historically, the schools obviously existed already, and, through their changes in admissions policies, from the ’30s through the ’60s, they created a new class. They created the modern meritocracy.\n\nBut what’s happened in the last 50 years is that the meritocracy has in turn re-created the schools in their own image. They have created a system that took the meritocracy from what it was supposed to be, and made it what I refer to as a \"hereditary meritocracy.\" If your kid is going to get into one of these schools, with some exceptions, they have to be stuffed full of education resources almost from the moment they’re born, almost from the moment they start school.\n\nI just saw a cartoon in the New Yorker of two rich people, and one of them is saying, “The meritocracy worked for my grandfather, the meritocracy worked for my father, and now the meritocracy is working for me.” And this is exactly the point.\n\nAnd this goes beyond legacy admissions?\n\nOh, no, no, this is not about legacy admissions. Legacy admissions are an issue, but this is not about legacy admissions, I really want to be clear about that.\n\nOne phrase that I quote in the book is that the college admission process is the way that we launder privilege in this country. Instead of saying, “You get to go because you're born,” which is obviously unfair, we say, “You get to go because you have really great scores and grades and you've done a million extracurricular activities.” But the only way to get to that point is if you have rich parents. I mean, again, there are exceptions, but there are not a lot of exceptions.\n\nIn your book, you describe this leadership class as one that demonstrates “a Victorian engorgement with its own virtues.”\n\nRight. They think that they got to where they got because they’re such great people. I didn’t say that line in reference to the kids, I said it in reference to the whole adult elite. Listen, every elite has a way of justifying itself. I don’t think any elite ever said, just listen, we’re stronger, so we took what we wanted. There’s always some ideology that rationalizes it. And our ideology is meritocracy, and it says, you got all this because you deserved it. Nobody wants to see that, no, actually, you got all this because your parents put you in a position to get all this. I quote another student in the book saying of her peers at Yale, that they’re aware of themselves as an academic elite, but not as a social or economic elite.\n\nWon’t there always be elites, though? I feel like the education system will structure itself in such a way as to create an elite, no matter what steps are taken to democratize it.\n\nThat’s not clear. And I think that that’s an excuse.\n\nLet me put this a different way: I think you’re right, but it certainly could be better, and I think it’s incumbent upon us, if we care about justice, if we care about democracy, to do everything we can to fight it. That’s what those postwar reforms were about, right? Not just reforming elite private college admissions to let in the working-class Jewish kids from Brooklyn, but also, and I think more significantly, this enormous expansion of public higher education.\n\nThe new rise in inequality coincides with — I’m not saying this is the only factor by any means — but it coincides with the withdrawal of investment in public higher education, which has been dropping for 35 years, and is now about half, on a per student basis, as it was then.\n\nReally, it’s been that steep a decline?\n\nIt was already steep before 2008, and then after the financial collapse, it’s been like another 25 percent drop.\n\nYikes.\n\nYeah.\n\nLast year Virginia Foxx, a member of Congress from North Carolina, said that she felt confused by high levels of student debt. She had worked her way through college in the 1960s, and she hadn’t fallen behind, so why were students today struggling? As a millennial, I remember that being an especially depressing comment to read.\n\nRight, this is someone who doesn’t understand. Is she a Republican?\n\nYes, she’s a Republican.\n\nI would love to know what tuition at UNC was in the ’70s. I know what it was at Berkeley in the ’70s, and throughout the University of California system. I can tell you to the exact dollar. It was zero.\n\nWhat people, states, voters, politicians figured out is that instead of all of us paying taxes to support public higher education, we could just have the students take out loans.\n\nSo, I’m curious, if you were talking to a high school senior today, what would your advice be?\n\nThink about where you’re going to college. Think carefully about where you’re going to college. Most kids go to the most prestigious school that’ll let them in. Why are you doing this?\n\nI think these second-tier liberal arts colleges are great places. I mean, not all of them, but I think they have a great institutional model. And public universities have certain advantages, like a more diverse population. There are obviously a few drawbacks, but one way of splitting the difference, possibly, is an honors college or an honors program.\n\nKenneth Griffin, a hedge fund manager, recently gave $150 million to Harvard to improve its financial aid. I imagine that you don’t feel like that’s the best way for the money to be used. I’m curious, if we do reinvest in higher education elsewhere, what would the investment look like?\n\nFirst of all, whatever: It’s nice of him to do that. Also, in the larger scheme of what it takes to fund a higher education system, while $150 million is a huge amount for any individual, it’s not a lot of money in terms of what it costs to fund the whole system.\n\nWe did this before. We know how to do this. The problem is we don’t have the political will, or we don’t believe we have the political will. So we do what we did in California in the ’50s. They raised taxes, and they looked to create great public higher education systems.\n\nListen, I think I know what a great college education looks like. It looks like students learning in small classrooms face to face with instructors who are well paid and well treated.",
  "latent_28599": "It's by a narrow margin, but New Jersey voters actually do support a proposed law that would require dog owners to put their animal in a safety restraint or crate when in the car.\n\nFlickr User Grilled Cheese\n\nAccording to today's Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll , 45 percent of registered voters in the state support the law, with 40 percent opposing it. The bill , introduced by Assemblywoman Grace Spencer last month, would require that pets not traveling in a crate be restrained by a harness or similar device, with violators subject to a $20 ticket and possible animal cruelty charges.\n\nEarlier this year, officials from the New Jersey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals held a press conference in which they said that failure to restrain animals would be construed as animal cruelty, subject to criminal fines and penalties. Spencer says confusion over the current state of the law led to the introduction of her bill. That confusion has also led to the introduction of a rival measure that would specify that driving with an unrestrained dog does not constitute cruelty to animals.\n\n\"These proposals have received both attention and ridicule,\" says Dan Cassino, a professor of political science at Fairleigh Dickinson, and a survey analyst for the poll. \"But it seems like New Jersey voters are taking this seriously.\"\n\nOddly, the divide on the dog restraint proposal falls along party lines. Democrats, and their usual supporters, are much more likely to support it than Republicans. A majority of Democrats, (51 percent) say they support the legislation, compared with just 36 percent of Republicans.\n\nCassino says, \"It's pretty rare that we find such a clear partisan split on an issue that's outside of the normal political discussion, but here we have a clear instance in which Democrats support government intervention in what had been a private sphere, and Republicans oppose it.\"\n\nAnother other major split on the legislation comes from animal ownership: the bill has the support of 48 percent of voters who don't own a dog, compared with only 38 percent support among people who do. A majority of those who own dogs 52 percent oppose the bill. However, only about 1 in 3 New Jersey voters 35 percent own a dog.\n\n\"The people who are going to be most impacted by this bill, people who actually own dogs don't like it,\" explains Cassino. \"If nothing else, buying a restraint is going to cost them money. However, if politicians are just looking at the overall numbers, the dog owners are outnumbered pretty badly.\"\n\nOpinions could change quickly on the issue. Voters still don't know much about it. Thirty-five percent of New Jersey voters say that they've heard \"a lot\" or \"some\" about the proposed law, with 44 percent saying that they've heard nothing at all. Those who own dogs seem to be paying attention to the law: 47 percent say that they've heard \"a lot\" or \"some\" about the bill.\n\nIn a question Cassino concedes was \"a lark,\" 86 percent of Garden State voters, across party lines, say that it is \"unacceptable\" to transport a dog in a safety crate on the roof of a car, as Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney admitted doing during a family road trip.\n\nThe poll of 901 registered voters was conducted by telephone with both landline and cell phones from September 6, 2012 through September 12, 2012, and has a margin of error of +/-3.3 percentage points.",

  "latent_28716": "Dollhouse season two is on DVD, which means it's time to rediscover Joss Whedon's most challenging show. We spoke to star/producer Eliza Dushku about the show's challenges, the criticisms Dollhouse faced...and the Echo/Paul outtakes that were too much for TV.\n\nFor those of you who missed it, Dollhouse was a show that ran for two seasons on Fox, about people whose minds have been erased, allowing them to be programmed to be whoever a paying client wants. And in the second season, newly out on DVD, the questions about the morality of this technology get amped up massively, as we see the true evils behind treating people like property — and we explore the idea that the abuse of this technology leads to the apocalypse.\n\nWe were lucky enough to get about 20 minutes on the phone one-on-one with Eliza Dushku today, and here's what she told us.\n\nSo now that the whole series is going to be on DVD. What do you think people will get out of it when they watch it all in one go?\n\nWe had toyed with the idea of having the show go on [as a serialized adventure], and not having stand-alone episodes. The inevitable thing with Joss' characters is that you start to feel for each character. And with each episode, every character got so deep, and so much was revealed. I would know that even as I was watching, or reading the scripts from show to show, that wait time in between is brutal. So when you get to see all these characters and all stories, strung together, it'll be just what the fans are waiting for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what do you hope people get out of your performance in particular, when they watch a second time around?\n\nAs far as the evolution of Echo, it was such a challenging and awesome part to play, especially in the second season as she's really becoming a person. She knows who she is. She's flipping in and out of these personalities, and learning how to control them and bring them out at different times. I've never done something like that. The speed at which we shot - in a perfect world, with all those different characters, it would have been cool to spend more time on each one, but I think also, there's something to be said for just putting it out there, and just watching the schizophrenia of it all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHalfway into the second season, there's that one episode where it jumps forward in time, and suddenly Echo has control over her personalities. It's really exciting, but also a relief to see that. Was it a relief for you too, that you were finally able to play that?\n\nYeah I mean... for Enver [Gjokaj] and Dichen [Lachman] and everybody who played a doll, the doll state was probably one of the most difficult things to do. It provided a deeper connection — and I felt like you really root for Echo by the second season because you see that she's coming into her own person. [And since you didn't know] who you're rooting for when she's changing [personalities], it was awesome to get to know her - and to open up the question at the end of, \"What if Caroline [isn't worthy of Echo's sacrifice]. I'm saving this body for her, and what if we don't like who she is?\"\n\nI love it, I miss it. It's been so long since I've done interviews about the show. I have all these beautiful, nostalgic feelings coming back. It's bittersweet. I'm so proud of what we did, I wish we could have gone on forever, we had so many fans, and now people can show their friends and show their kids - once their kids are a certain age of course. It's preserved, and it gets to live on forever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo you mentioned about Caroline. The first few times we met Caroline, it wasn't clear if she was really someone we could root for.\n\nShe was a whiny little brat. Those are the exact words I used to Joss. \"The Caroline character is kind of a whiny little brat, I don't know if we're going to be able to root for her.\" He was like, \"But you know, we have to be have some place to go.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWas that something you worried about, during the evolution of this series? Who people could root for, and who they couldn't?\n\nOne of the cool things about Joss and his characters is, I feel like you're almost rooting for... the person you least expect to, in every episode. When you look at the character development with Fran [Kranz]'s character and Olivia [Williams]' character... and also, when I look back at my role as Faith, you have these characters who you think you wouldn't root for in a million years, and they do horrible things. And then you have an episode where you really start to find some unexpected beauty there, and compassion for these people. By the end I sort of feel like you were rooting for everybody, because that's the beautiful thing about the true human characters that he creates. They're flawed, and they're not perfect, and they sometimes do horrible things and in the end you look at them as a whole. [Laughs] The tragic humans that we all are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd of course you were producing Dollhouse as well as starring in it. What do you think you learned about being a producer from Dollhouse?\n\nWell, on the one hand, people would say, \"A show about prostitution and human trafficking on Fox? It sounds like a perfect fit.\" Looking back, it may not have been the best fit for the show. We originally pitched a show and felt like that everyone got it and everyone was on board, and then before the show was supposed to air, I think Fox panicked and felt the show was going deeper than they had maybe expected and it was beyond fun one-off episodes where we're running out, being assassins or... it really started to make people uncomfortable. Which I suppose, was what we had intended to do. People have said, Joss has definitely got to go do a cable show, where you can really have the freedom to get fucked up. Maybe when he's finished Avenging.\n\nHave you talked to him lately? Has he told you anything about it?\n\nA little bit. We got to see each other. Nathan Fillion had a barbecue recently. I'm just so psyched for him, it's just the perfect project for Joss. He has an awesome ensemble cast, and nobody works with an ensemble like does. I'm just thrilled to see what happens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou mentioned human trafficking and prostitution. Some people felt like Dollhouse was a show that was about rape, more even than prostitution. Do you think there was anything to that?\n\nWell, I mean that's definitely sort of the question, the moral question, of the show. Is it morally right to have this kind of technology and abuse technology, and then the question is, like, are they volunteers? And they're volunteers, does that negate [the idea] that it's rape? And so that was, I think, the black and white and gray areas that we explored. In some situations, absolutely. In Sierra's case, she was taken advantage of in her doll state, and it was horrifying. It goes to explore what those boundaries are, and what they aren't, I guess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you feel happy with how the show ended?\n\nYeah, I thought it was beautiful. It was really full circle and having the cast and the apocalypse back from \"Epitaph One,\" which I just loved, and sobbed when I first saw it at Comic Con. It's such a complex show, and so much had happened, and yet the way they tied it up and really brought closure, not just to the characters but to everybody that was on the show, the actors... it was just comforting to see it end that way, to have that closure.\n\nWhat do you think it would be like for Echo to be trapped in a basement for a year with Paul Ballard in her head?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat should be the next show. It would be great play, wouldn't it? Would they ever leave the house? We did a few outtakes of the final scene with Paul in Echo's mind, that were not appropriate for television. All the things we could do, the places we could go. But it's beautiful, you know.\n\nI cried when I read it. Joss would just off people - anyone - you just read the script, and you see a bullet just go through Paul's head, and you go, \"How could he?\" But there's always a reveal and there's always a payoff somewhere. He does things so intentionally and so much vision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat about Echo and Boyd? He was such a paternal figure to her, and then he turns out to be this completely different person. How do you think that changes how you view their relationship from the beginning?\n\nI think it makes it all that much heartbreaking, for both of them. He absolutely was this paternal father figure. [But] what we want and what we do are different things sometimes. And he was corrupt from the get go, and it makes you look back and [see that] there were moments of true connection and true affinity between them and it made it all that much more heartbreaking. And it felt like something we did together with the character of Faith... people will do horrible things, and yet that's what makes it all the more disturbing and riveting, that people connect to it. Yeah, in the end he was really, really, really bad, but we knew that the show was going to be ending, and whether or not Joss had it in his mastermind plan all along, that was a twist. That was the kind of twist that I feel like people scream and go crazy over, and go, \"No, no, how could he?\" But that's riveting storytelling right there. The betrayal and the abandonment and the wonderfully juicy stuff that makes us react and bond and have these feelings for the characters.\n\nSpeaking of Faith, do you think there's any chance at this point you might play Faith again?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter twenty years in this business, I feel like you never know. I know for sure that Joss is a lifelong friend and talent, and we'll be seeing each other again for sure.\n\nDollhouse season two is out on DVD now.

  "latent_28956": "Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky\n\nBased on Stanislaw Lem’s science fiction novel of the same name, Andrei Tarkovsky’s iconic film Solaris is set aboard a space station orbiting a planet where a crew of scientists is studying its ecosystem. A scientist is sent to the space station to account for strange events that have been taking place onboard. Solaris charts a psychological territory haunted by phantoms, in which the real and the imagined are inextricably mixed, presenting a critique of faith in pure reason. As Tarkovsky writes in Sculpting in Time: “Solaris had been about people lost in the cosmos and obliged, whether they liked it or not, to take one more step up the ladder of knowledge. Man’s unending quest for knowledge, given him gratuitously, is a source of great tension, for it brings with it constant anxiety, hardship, grief, and disappointment, as the final truth can never be known.” Frequently compared to Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, Tarkovsky’s directing style is marked by long takes with slow, careful framing, allowing the film’s themes of memory and love to take root.\n\nShadow Play is a series of films that tread nimbly between reality and illusion, acknowledging the artificial nature of cinema. Referencing the tradition of shadow puppetry, the origins of cinema in phantasmagoria, and Plato’s Allegory of the Cave, each film draws on the metaphors of light as reality and shadow as artifice. In Plato’s The Republic, the allegory of the cave illustrates the difference between truth and illusion. Many writers have noted that Allegory of the Cave (written c. 360 BCE), bears great resemblance to the contemporary movie theater.",

And though things are definitely serious out here, that’s a reminder we could all use.\n\nHer latest series—which I’m affectionately calling “Astrology for Assholes”—is less social commentary, more insane reading of the not-so-ideal traits of each sign.

The study of sports science traditionally incorporates areas of physiology (exercise physiology), psychology (sport psychology), anatomy, biomechanics, biochemistry and biokinetics.” [1] Thanks to the research done by Sports Scientists, we have a better understanding of how our bodies work in different environments, importances of nutrition, how to improve as athletes regardless of skill level, and what type of equipment can improve our game. And many of these findings incorporated STEM and Computer Science skills to collect this information.\n\nCheck out the video below from the Nike Explore Team Sport Research Lab, where sports scientists unlock vital athlete insights and analyze performance data.\n\nWithin all the areas of Sports Science, Computer Science and STEM are used regularly to design new technologies that allow the scientist to retrieve important data needed to analyze and interpret the players. This data has changed the world of sports in the last few decades. The information allows them to know how most humans react to certain nutrition limitations, weather interactions, stress, and much more! Then they use that information to improve how athletes play the game as well as how to improve on the human body in terms of their health. “The fact that the use of data and media, the design of models, the analysis of systems etc… increasingly requires the support of suitable tools and concepts which are developed and available in Computer Science.” [2]\n\nOne example of CS-STEM being used in Sports Science is in the area of gear and equipment used by athletes. Computer Science is used to determine how a body reacts with certain gear in different environments, then engineers use this data to improve gear quality for an athlete.

Clyburn (S.C.), who led the effort to censure Wilson.\n\nA resolution of disapproval is the softest form of punishment that the House administers. But the debate over Wilson grew far beyond a remark by a back-bench minority-party lawmaker. It encapsulated the increasing partisan tensions of the health-care debate, while igniting tensions among many black lawmakers who suggested that Obama is being treated harshly because some voters cannot accept him as the nation's first black president.\n\nIn the past six days, Wilson and his likely Democratic opponent in his 2010 reelection battle, Iraq veteran Rob Miller, have each raised more than $1.5 million through a frenzy of small donations to their campaigns, according to Democratic and Republican aides.\n\nDuring the debate Tuesday, Minority Leader John A.

Krueger\n\nThere have been many instances over the years of San Diego not getting its artistic due, but there was a particular case in 2011 that really got me upset. Jeffrey Deitch, the parasitic, bespectacled art dealer from New York had just been put in charge of the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles (MOCA). His first MOCA curatorial was Art in the Streets, a highly touted exhibition on graffiti and street art. The exhibition was all the buzz from coast to coast, with one New York Times arts writer proclaiming Deitch a “risk taker” and that Art in the Streets was “the first major American museum exhibition devoted to street art.”\n\nThe problem with the latter statement was that, just a year before, the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego (MCASD) had held a thorough and well-received exhibition focusing on street art at its Downtown location. Titled Viva la Revolución: A Dialogue with the Urban Landscape, the show not only highlighted many of the same artists that participated in Deitch’s MOCA exhibit, but artists such as Banksy, Shepard Fairey and Space Invader did both commissioned and non-commissioned pieces all around San Diego.\n\nWhat’s more telling is that Deitch was in attendance when the San Diego show opened. It’s certainly possible that he was simply surveying whether a show on street art could be pulled off in a museum setting, and that he already had the idea himself to try one at MOCA, but in the end, the MOCA show got most of the national attention and acclaim.\n\nSo yes, while San Diego was, indeed, the first city to host a major museum exhibition devoted to street art and graffiti, our collective relationship with the medium has been slow to develop and remains dubious. While we’re quick to embrace a selfie-worthy mural, actual graffiti, no matter how aesthetically pleasing, is usually quick to go.\n\nRecently, graffiti photo website Bombing Science came to town to take pictures of San Diego’s scene. Fred has been photographing for the Montreal-based site since its beginning in the late ‘90s and has watched San Diego evolve over the years.\n\n“The graffiti scene in San Diego looks pretty active,” says Fred, who remembers coming to San Diego in the ‘90s and seeing a lot more graffiti. “For a North American city of its size, the scene is pretty healthy. You have the Writerz Blok graffiti hall of fame and two classic streetwear brands, Tribal and Wildstyle Technicians, that are making the city a magnet for international graffiti writers. But the way the city is built and the fact that it is kept really clean is limiting the scene, which is a good thing for some people I guess.”\n\nFred adds that our sister city has been much quicker to embrace graffiti and street art.\n\n“You have much more graffiti on the street level in Tijuana because it’s a free-for-all. But on the other side you have San Diego with the laid-back vibe and good quality graffiti in many spots. It’s just, well, different.”\n\nClick here to read the first part of this photo series.",
  "latent_30034": "By Brandon Turbeville\n\nTwo days after Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu stated that U.S. President Donald Trump had promised to end American weapons shipments and support to Kurdish fanatics fighting in Syria, the United States military has been videotaped doing just that.\n\n“The U.S. military was filmed on Monday delivering more than 100 Humvees to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northern Syria,” writes Leith Fadel of al-Masdar News.\n\nYou can view the video at this link\n\nCavusoglu stated explicitly that Donald Trump told Turkish President Erdogan that the United States was soon going to end weapons shipments to the YPG.\n\n“Mr. Trump clearly stated that he had given clear instructions, and that the YPG won’t be given arms and that this nonsense should have ended a long time ago,” the Associated Press quoted Cavusoglu as saying.\n\nThe Washington Post reports confirmation that the Trump administration is planning to draw down support for Kurds in Syria. The article, written by Carol Morello and Erin Cunningham, stated,\n\nDownload Your First Issue Free! Do You Want to Learn How to Become Financially Independent, Make a Living Without a Traditional Job & Finally Live Free?\n\nDownload Your Free Copy of Counter Markets Initially, the administration’s national security team appeared surprised by the Turks’ announcement and uncertain what to say about it. The State Department referred questions to the White House, and hours passed with no confirmation from the National Security Council. In late afternoon, the White House confirmed the weapons cutoff would happen, though it provided no details on timing. “Consistent with our previous policy, President Trump also informed President Erdogan of pending adjustments to the military support provided to our partners on the ground in Syria, now that the battle of Raqqa is complete and we are progressing into a stabilization phase to ensure that ISIS cannot return,” the White House statement said, referring to the recent liberation of the Syrian city that had served as the Islamic State’s de facto capital.\n\nHowever, “pending adjustments to the military support provided to our partners on the ground in Syria” does not necessarily equal ending support to the YPG. In addition, it should be noted that the weapons shipments and Humvees shown above are allegedly being shipped to the SDF, a collection of Arab and Kurdish religious fanatics, terrorists, and cultural-marxists. While the group is being used for the same purpose as that of the YPG (establishing an area that is outside of the control of the Syrian government held by military force and backed by the United States) and is essentially a the same organization, the two groups are officially separate on paper. The SDF is nothing more than a bridge organization between Arab terrorists and Kurdish terrorists once again masquerading under the label of “moderates” and yet another example of using semantics and name changes to accomplish an overarching goal. The YPG and the SDF are, for all intents and purposes, the same organization and should not be misconstrued as anything else.\n\nThat being said, others have suggested that the shipments may have been those which were already en route and that a cease in the shipments will be forthcoming, suggesting that the shipments will indeed stop once those in the pipeline have ceased.",

I have been Gregor and Nick and Vardaman and Huck and Raskolnikov and even Humbert Humbert.\n\nIt’s an old notion, but because of books, I’ve always imagined that, even if I were just some shy girl from nowhere, rapt in a tattered book, I might be anything at all. In my mind, anyway. Because it didn’t matter to me that these characters were men. Just as it didn’t matter if they lived in a different era or belonged to another class or happened to be French or Russian or British. None of this prevented my imagination from taking on and fleshing out these vantage points, and neither did sex. Whatever the particulars of my own anatomy, I had lived and sometimes died in their bodies.\n\nI might have lived my life like that—my girl-body like an anchor at the bottom of the sea and my mind buoyed above in the airy world, tether and kite. I might have, except for what happened when I read great books by women.\n\nFirst among these was The Far Pavilions, that massive colonial romance novel that I hauled around for the second half of the fourth grade (the first half I’d weight-trained with Roots). M. M. Kaye (whom notably did not write under our shared name Mollie/Molly) was the first writer whose own life intrigued me. While I was the princess Anjuli and the soldier Ashton by turn, depending on whether it was a chapter of love or war, I was also, for the first time in my single-digit years as a literate being, imagining myself the author.\n\nFor lovers of macho male writers, try this on for size: In addition to writing books nearly equal in weight to a fourth grader, M. M. Kaye was a strong-willed woman who labored all but alone for five days delivering an out-of-wedlock child, while a tiger ate a water buffalo under her verandah. She eventually married her lover, a soldier, in the final days of World War II and the pair crisscrossed the map in the name of a diminishing empire, from Kashmir to Cyprus and Kenya and beyond. After that, he waited on her for fifteen years while she labored to write the book that was, at least in the year of my birth, the Gone with the Wind of the British Raj.\n\nOf course, I read Gone with the Wind too. I was fourteen, a budding Scarlet O’Hara, at least in terms of my souring personality. It was Thanksgiving and my first time home from boarding school, but I could not bring myself to spend time with the family I had been missing so badly. Margaret Mitchell, I learned, had dressed as a boy and went by the name Jimmy until she was fourteen, but I wasn’t interested in being a boy.\n\nScoff, if you must, the low taste. Romance. Bah. (And, yes, there is much to say about my attraction to white colonialist and Confederate women, all of it apt. We are all the products of our particular bookshelves.) But realize that Holden can be as much of a struggle for high school girls to appreciate as Scarlet would be—I assume, since none I know have read it—for high school boys. The real difference is, high school girls are taught to appreciate both, while boys are permitted to indulge their adolescent gynobibliophobia until the condition becomes irreversible. Girls are taught to read phallic symbolism and Oedipal crises, but as a high school teacher I had to read the first pages of The Color Purple aloud to my class so the boys would make it past the word “pussy.”\n\nI am generalizing, of course. But polarization isn’t what I intend. What I would like is to see the hierarchy (reason/phallus on top, sentiment/pussy/chick at the bottom) tipped sideways to make a spectrum, and maybe even stirred up a bit. I would like to see this for the sake of girls and women, yes, and also boys and men, whose imaginations have been kept out of one realm of experience just as women’s bodies have been kept out of another.\n\nOne problem is that women writers typical of high school curricula are heavy on the suicides, Sylvia Plath, Virginia Woolf, Anne Sexton, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and so forth, so when their work is read, it comes with an implied warning. But I met a living woman writer my sophomore year. She was Jill Ker Conway, whom I knew from her Road to Coorain (one of my first encounters with nonfiction) had grown up on a farm as I had and had worried about her thick ankles, which looked fine to me when she sat across from me, perched on an arm chair in my school’s living room looking elegant and college presidential and yet so human. Then I left New England for the South for college and met Maya Angelou, who spoke-sang from a university pulpit. The effect this had on me was something akin to an exquisite electrocution, a sensation that left the very reach of my body zinging like a violin string. Soon after this I was introduced to Joyce Carol Oates. Oates is the most under-appreciated writer of our time, said my professor, a Styron scholar whose Contemporary American Lit class required its own bookshelf to hold the assigned readings and an entire auditorium to hold the students lest they riot for seats. It was an important moment, but I didn’t hear him say that this was probably the result of gender biases because I was still fascinated by the news that Oates came from—of all places—the same dilapidated Upstate farming hollows where I’d grown up. The beautiful, troubling book in my hand had been put on paper by someone who was once not so different from me. By extension, one day maybe I could write a beautiful, troubling book that wasn’t my diary, that wasn’t me whispering to myself. Maybe, if she could do it, I could climb up that kite string.\n\nSomewhere in this line of books—I’ve reread Out of Africa too many times to recall my first encounter—came Isak Dinesen/Karen Blixen, who launched me beyond my borders. I read Barbara Kingsolver’s The Poisonwood Bible lying in a yak pasture in Tibet, Louise Erdrich’s Love Medicine and Clarice Lispector’s Family Ties high in the Sangre de Cristos, Jean Rhys’s Wide Sargasso Sea on a black sand beach, and Laura Esquivel’s Like Water for Chocolate in a town surrounded by volcanoes with a fifteen-year-old Quechua cook who told me after she had never read a book before. I also read many magnificent male writers in those years, Hermann Hesse, Michael Oondatje, James Baldwin, James Welch, Mario Vargas Llosa, Salman Rushdie, absolutely everything by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Wallace Stegner, and all of the one-namers: Faulkner, Updike, Stendhal, Tolstoy, Styron, Balzac, and Borges. The latter I escaped into, fully and gladly abandoning my limited self to the heights of imagination; the former I felt I embodied.\n\nAs college graduate suffering that great bafflement of a first “real world” job teaching sophomore English to the offspring of oligarchs in El Salvador, it was Julia Alvarez’s novel In the Time of the Butterflies that served me my first professional break-through. This time the book rocked me not because it resonated with my own experience, but because it walked a middle ground between my own and my students’ who until then had most definitely not tried on the personae of Communist insurgents. Because teaching is about sparking the fire in others, not stoking our own.\n\nNadine Gordimer, Annie Dillard, Leslie Marmon Silko, Joan Didion, Toni Morrison, Marilynne Robinson, Isabel Allende, Jane Smiley, Hilary Mantel, and so many others: these are living women novelists writing for the ages. And their literary progeny are many and multiplying. There will be more still if the stockers of bookshelves—parents and teachers and reviewers and so on—remember to read like girls: to read overwhelmingly the literature of experiences unavailable to them in life, to recognize how work that reminds them of themselves resonates differently, and to appreciate both.\n\nMale writers affected me, moved me, changed and inspired me. But male writers do not offer a way for a girl to be more than a receptacle for literature. The women writers, in contrast, did more than transport my mind away from my body. Whether I’ll ever write anything worth reading remains to be seen, but I have followed these women writers and others like them, almost without meaning to do so. I have marched, climbed, and crawled in the quest for stories. I have faced off against men with guns, against bureaucracy, against the implications of my own conflicted presence. I have met my lover in a garden full of ginger and hibiscus. I have given birth above a bullring, in the middle of a war. I have tried my best to help, and I have done, in spite of my best intentions, harm. Yes, sometimes, it’s funny to watch my adult life evolving along the same lines as my childhood novel reading: the romance maturing into realism and nonfiction. But if I hadn’t had such models as these writers, I might have stayed shy girl from nowhere living a life split between what was on the page and the girl I was. I might never have become the author of my own pages and my own life.\n\nDon’t we owe our daughters this? And our sons, don’t we owe them the imaginary experience of being other than they are? Of being men who turn into bugs, of being criminals, of succumbing to their own courage, of being cyborgs and lionhearted kings and soldiers humping their frail boy-bodies through the sad swamps of past wars, yes, but also of giving birth or giving in to love, of being bound so tightly that madness ensues, of total vulnerability and violation, of suffering maternal love so fierce it slaughters the beloved?\n\nPhoto by Jeremy Avnet",
  "latent_30108": "Published: 00:36 GMT, 4 October 2016 | Updated: 01:05 GMT, 4 October 2016\n\nJacob Furedi, a journalist and student at University College London thinks students are being nannied\n\nThe drunken travails of Kingsley Amis’s Lucky Jim — a shambolic junior academic — have long become a byword for the excesses of university life.\n\nFlirting, seduction and seeing how many pints you could fit in between lectures were once relatively harmless pastimes on campuses across Britain.\n\nYet today, too many universities seem determined to nanny students who are deemed too fragile to be exposed to the rough and tumble of the real world.\n\nConsider the fact that, this week, it emerged that all new students arriving at Oxford and Cambridge are being asked to attend ‘consent classes’ aimed at preventing rape and sexual harassment at the universities.\n\nAt Oxford, the courses are compulsory as part of freshers’ week, while the student union is urging rugby players to attend anti-sexism workshops to fight ‘lad culture’.\n\nAt Cambridge, consent classes are also being held for freshers, with students of some colleges having to opt out if they don’t wish to attend.\n\nNot everyone is happy to accept instruction in how to avoid raping somebody or becoming a rape victim, however.\n\nAt York University, a number of students on campus recently protested against their own ‘sexual consent class’ by walking out.\n\nAccording to union officials, the lessons were necessary to protect students’ ‘well-being’, suggesting they had rather forgotten that the students they were attempting to instruct were actually adults.\n\nInnocent fun: Students enjoy themselves in the traditional way, but for how much longer?\n\nUnfortunately, barmy student unions are all the rage these days. Take my own, University College London Union (UCLU), which claims to represent me, a 20-year-old final year undergraduate and one of the thousands belonging to the student body.\n\nIt has outlawed, under the guise of its ‘Zero Tolerance to Sexual Harassment’ policy, ‘offensive sexual noises’ in union bars because students supposedly aren’t able to cope with hearing a few grunts in a public space.\n\nSo far, so laughable. But the right-on political correctness of modern student unions and their campus ayatollahs has a far more sinister aspect, as we shall see.\n\nBy any measure, Isis would seem a bad bunch, what with their penchant for beheading innocent civilians and journalists. Justifying their actions isn’t easy — which is why I was so struck when an official at UCLU attempted to do just that.\n\nYes, when the university’s Kurdish Society decided to invite former student Macer Gifford, a Briton who heroically chose to fight with the Kurds against Isis, a student union officer insisted he be ‘no platformed’ — banned from speaking.\n\nAccording to the union official, the fight against Isis ‘is a very contentious topic’ and ‘far too complex [for students] to understand in black and white’. He went on to maintain that ‘one man’s freedom fighter is another man’s terrorist’.\n\nThis week, it emerged that all new students arriving at Oxford and Cambridge are being asked to attend ‘consent classes’ aimed at preventing rape and sexual harassment at the universities\n\nNow, ethical relativism — that right or wrong depends on an individual’s point of view — is not always without merit.\n\nBut I found myself instinctively appalled by the decision. In some situations, morality is a matter of black and white.\n\nAnd the failure of a student union official to condemn Isis, an intrinsically evil organisation, pointed to something deeply amiss with the current state of universities.\n\nNot only was the official’s reluctance to denounce Isis worrying, but his insistence that an external speaker with differing views be silenced demonstrated how universities are no longer the tolerant, open-minded institutions they were.\n\nSimply, student leaders have lost the plot. Rather than treating students as young adults, our union officers treat us like oversized children. From their assumption that students are too vulnerable to be exposed to certain ideas, to the imposition of what they deem ‘acceptable’ moral values, their influence means that the university experience is now a far cry from the rigorous, mind-expanding education that one might expect.\n\nFrom the very beginning of my time as a student at UCL, it was clear that the union had decided it knew what was best for us.\n\nAccording to union officials, the lessons were necessary to protect students’ ‘well-being’, suggesting they had rather forgotten that the students they were attempting to instruct were actually adults\n\nIts mission, regardless of its claims to be tolerant and inclusive, soon appeared to be nothing less than the moral policing of students’ personal lives.\n\nThus on Mondays, university cafés were banned from serving meat on the grounds that a chicken sandwich was both unhealthy and bad for the environment, because rearing animals demands more resources than growing an equivalent amount of crops.\n\nThe arrogant assumption that a student union was entitled to impose a vegetarian lifestyle on me and my fellow students shows just how little value these people attach to personal choice.\n\nThis disregard was seen again in UCLU’s call to ban smoking in outdoor spaces on campus. Within the resolution’s guidelines, the union laments the dangers of active and passive smoking.\n\nSmoking is bad? Who knew?\n\nWhile it would certainly be inappropriate if the union started handing out packs of Marlboros, its officials need to respect the fact that students — adults — are capable of making rational decisions. Smokers know it would be healthier to go on a juice cleanse and a jog rather than to light up again, but whether they act on that should be their prerogative.\n\nThis assumption that students need mollycoddling in every aspect of their lives is directly harming education. For this attitude is not just confined to the student union, but is seeping into UCL’s faculties.\n\nRather than treating students as young adults, our union officers treat us like oversized children\n\nUCL’s archaeology department now warns students that historical events ‘may be disturbing, even traumatising’ and permits its students to ‘step outside’ class if they find dealing with the past too difficult — a move akin to allowing medical students to bunk off because they’re afraid of the sight of blood.\n\nOutside of the classroom, the university is doing its utmost to stamp out all sources of fun on campus. Now alcohol, that staple of student life, has come under threat from union officials. Contained within its ‘responsible drinking’ guide, UCLU warns that ‘drinking doesn’t have to be a way of life’.\n\nAlthough it’s certainly true that you don’t need alcohol to have a good time, the suggestion that students require constant reminding to ‘alternate [booze] with some water’ makes a joke of the notion that we are capable of living independent lives.\n\nAnd while the union claims that ‘mocktails [non-alcoholic cocktails] are a great way to start the night’, its risk-averse approach to alcohol signals, once again, its desire to infantilise students.\n\nThis is reflected, too, in the union’s ban-happy approach to anything that might be considered offensive. It outlawed the playing of pop star Robin Thicke’s song Blurred Lines because, with lyrics such as ‘I know you want it’, the song supposedly promotes rape and is ‘dangerous’.\n\nIt has also prohibited the distribution of The Sun newspaper because, with its frequent photos of scantily clad women — though no longer Page Three — it is deemed inherently ‘misogynistic’.\n\nThis flurry of blacklisting is driven by the belief that students need a bunch of jumped-up, right-on, soya-consuming activists to shield them from the horrors of the world.\n\nIt’s not surprising, therefore, that UCLU exhibits a shameless disregard towards free speech.\n\nDespite the fact that the union maintains ‘freedom of expression is a fundamental human right’, it does not tolerate views that clash with its own. Within its resolution ‘to campaign for freedom of speech’, it also agrees to ‘continue to advocate “No platform for fascists” ’.\n\nThus the union took it upon itself to ban the UCL Nietzsche Club because some of the German philosopher’s ideas were adopted by the far-Right decades after his death.\n\nNow alcohol, that staple of student life, has come under threat from union officials\n\nThe fundamental assumption underlying all this activity — that students are feeble creatures who cannot cope with any material they may not like — is absurd. Universities, by nature, are supposed to be places where ideas are challenged.\n\nIndeed, by silencing certain ideas, the union risks leaving problematic beliefs dangerously unchallenged.\n\nThe dire state of freedom of speech on campus is further demonstrated by the union’s insistence that students should shut their mouths not just because of what they are saying, but because of who they are.\n\nFor instance, UCLU issued a letter of support to Goldsmith University’s BME (black or minority ethnic) network, which maintained that white people shouldn’t be allowed to attend their meetings because discussion couldn’t take place with ‘oppressors’ in the room.\n\nSo, under the guise of anti-racism, the union decrees that students shouldn’t be able to say something because of the colour of their skin — a divisive assumption uncomfortably close to what anti-racists have fought against in the past.\n\nSuch is the danger of the union’s obsession with so-called identity politics, which focuses largely on an individual’s race, class and gender.\n\nFortunately, however, the clique behind the student union doesn’t represent the student body. This isn’t surprising, given that only 12 per cent of students bothered to vote in UCLU’s elections. Some posts only had one candidate.\n\nStudent outside UCL: 'UCLU exhibits a shameless disregard towards free speech'\n\nThe schism between UCLU and its students was revealed in the uproar that arose after the union issued a statement praising the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) movement against Israel, an outside organisation which lobbies corporations, artists and academic institutions to sever ties with the Jewish state — without consulting the student body.\n\nHowever, while this outcry was a refreshing reminder that the union doesn’t rule unquestioned, it wasn’t enough to cower its illiberal tendencies.\n\nSadly, what I’ve experienced in London merely reflects the rise of censorship and moral policing that has become endemic on university campuses across the UK.\n\nMore than a fifth of student unions in the UK uphold ‘safe spaces’, where students are only allowed to profess a prescribed point of view at certain events — often protecting the student union’s orthodox perspective from being criticised.\n\nForty per cent of unions also have ‘no-platforming’ policies in place against potentially offensive speakers. If this creeping intolerance is going to be combated, students cannot rely on their unions to help out.\n\nRather, the onus is on students to turn universities back into places of rigorous education. This means refusing to roll over meekly when unions nanny students, and instead demanding to be treated like rational adults.\n\nAnd when unions attempt to silence speakers, students must refuse to accept the decision.\n\nIt’s imperative that we protest against intolerance.\n\nAs for sexual consent courses, Warwick University student George Lawlor was bullied online and branded a ‘rapist’ and ‘misogynist’ by activists last year after he dared to question consent workshops, and argued that most men ‘don’t have to be taught to not be a rapist’.",
  "latent_30166": "Korean scientists have used graphene sheets to make a transparent and lightweight loudspeaker which, they say, can be attached to windows and computer screens.\n\nGraphene, whose isolation led to the Nobel prize in physics for Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, is a single layer of graphite. Owing to its remarkable mechanical and electronic properties, it is set to revolutionise modern technology and new uses for it are continuously being discovered. However, one of the big challenges is to fabricate large area films of graphene.\n\nNow, Jyongsik Jang and coworkers from Seoul National University have used inkjet printing and vapour deposition to deposit graphene oxide onto poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), which is then reduced to create a graphene film. This demonstrates not only a new method for making controlled graphene films, but also a new use for the material: for making a thin transparent loudspeaker.\n\nThe speaker system consists of a PVDF thin film sandwiched between two graphene electrodes. The speaker works because when an electrical current from the sound source is applied, the converse piezoelectric effect causes the PDVF film to distort, creating sound waves.\n\nSuch a system would be easy to install and usable anywhere where sound is needed, Jang explains. They could even eventually be used as noise cancelling devices by creating anti-noise waves (same amplitude but with inverted phase to the original sound).\n\nAlthough similar speakers are already available commercially, using PEDOT:PSS electrodes, Jang’s new system demonstrates advantages over this existing technology in terms of cost and power consumption. ’Graphene is cheaper than other electrodes, such as metals and conducting polymers,’ he says, ’and the graphene-based acoustic actuator does not need expensive high power voltage amplifiers due to low power consumption.’\n\nIn addition to praising the authors’ device, Jinyue Jiang, an expert in optoelectronic materials at the University of Nebraska, US, is impressed by their new deposition technique. ’The beauty of this technique lies in its potential for large scale production and its ability to control the location of graphene - [depositing] graphene thin films on various substrates,’ he says.\n\nHowever, Jang concedes that more work needs to be done to improve sound quality and reduce prices before commercialisation is possible. As such, they are now looking to improve bass response by modifying the PVDF film.\n\nYuandi Li\n\nLink to journal article\n\nFlexible and transparent graphene films as acoustic actuator electrodes using inkjet printingKeun-Young Shin, Jin-Yong Hong and Jyongsik Jang,?Chem.

  "latent_30294": "Nashville Is Finally Tackling Its Sidewalk Problem\n\nAngie Henderson has been advocating for a more walkable Nashville for 17 years. Much of that time, the native Nashvillian and mother of two zeroed in on filling sidewalk gaps or finishing trail connections — a piece-by-piece approach to improving the pedestrian network. A couple of years ago, she realized that wasn’t going to be enough.\n\nOnly an estimated 37 percent (or 19 percent — calculations vary) of Nashville’s street network has sidewalks. Walking infrastructure is missing on about 1,900 miles of city streets.\n\n“When you grow up in Nashville and you drive everywhere, that’s kind of your reality,” Henderson said. “As my children got older, it just became clear to me that we’re not going to move the needle much unless we change the [sidewalk] policy.”\n\nSo in 2015, Henderson decided to run for office on a safe streets platform. And she won.\n\nOne of her first moves as a Metro Council member was to push for a new sidewalk ordinance — a citywide policy to help fill gaps in the pedestrian network.\n\nThe legislation went into effect July 1. It requires developers of single family homes to construct sidewalks if the property is within the designated “urban area” of Nashville, if they build near a commercial center, or if the property abuts another property with sidewalks. If builders forego sidewalks, they will have to pay a fee — $178 per linear foot — which will go into a fund for sidewalk construction in targeted areas.\n\nThe sidewalk ordinance will also close loopholes that allowed commercial developers to avoid building sidewalks, Henderson said.\n\nOver time, the process set in motion by the bill should complete the sidewalk grid in much of Nashville. The legislation dovetails with the city’s new general plan, which pinpointed key areas where sidewalk construction should be prioritized. The city estimates it will potentially generate about $8 annually for sidewalks.\n\nWhen Henderson began talking to the planning department about a new sidewalk bill in February of 2016, the city was primed for the discussion. Nashville is growing fast, and many new arrivals hail from more walkable cities, according to Henderson.\n\n“As people have moved here from other cities, it has really been helpful to the conversation.” she said. “Having people come from other communities and be like, ‘What the heck Nashville? What’s wrong with y’all?’ I think it’s really helped us build some momentum.”\n\nBut Henderson still wanted to tread carefully, so as not to anger builders who might oppose sidewalk mandates. She worked with a liaison at the local Chamber of Commerce to help mediate discussions with developers, and a number of meetings were held to get feedback from the construction industry and hear their concerns.\n\nSome adjustments to the bill incorporated their feedback — for instance, the legislation is designed not to mandate building isolated “sidewalks to nowhere.” But ultimately, few major concessions had to be made. Thanks to tools like Walkscore, many builders already knew how much people value walkability. “There really was a groundswell around sidewalks, and I think the builders were keenly aware of that,” she said. “I think they get it.”\n\nThanks to Henderson’s careful consensus building, support for the bill was nearly unanimous by the time it came up for a vote. It passed with 37 sponsors in the 40-seat Nashville Metro Council.",

  "latent_30606": "Penn and Teller‘s unique brand of magic feels like it’s been around forever. Over decades, it has permeated many levels of popular culture, through their successful Showtime show Bullshit, their long running Las Vegas stage act, appearances on The Celebrity Apprentice or cult movies from the Eighties. The duo hopes to continue that notoriety as they prepare another multimedia onslaught in the coming months.\n\nNew plans include a new TV show called Smoke and Mirrors and a movie focused on the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. The former is currently in development while the latter is in post-production, with an eye on the coming festival season.\n\nVariety first reported on the projects. Penn said (of course, because Teller is the quiet one) the following about the film:\n\nIt’s about Vermeer, and it’s about an American scientist and inventor who has done some amazing research and experimentation.\n\nThat’s a pretty odd description for a film from a pair of famous illusionists but you can be sure it’ll be revealing and interesting. Vermeer is best known for the painting “Girl With A Pearl Earring,” which inspired a 2003 film starring Scarlett Johansson. The artist’s use of light has also influenced many cinematographers and more than a few film directors. Apparently, Penn and Teller have already shot the film and it’s being edited.\n\nThe TV show, Smoke and Mirrors, is said to have its DNA in Bullshit, where Penn and Teller regularly disproved common misconceptions. This one will apparently be more personal, while expressing a similar skepticism. The show is “like spending an evening with Penn and Teller in their living room,” Variety says.\n\nAlso of note the title, “Smoke and Mirrors,” was the name of a never-produced Sega CD video game starring Penn and Teller. The primary goal of the game was to trick any friends who watched you playing it. The Wikipedia entry is fascinating and, maybe, provides an idea of what this new show will hold.",
  "latent_30674": "When a drug addict gives himself an intervention, it usually goes like this: “Okay, I’m totally quitting after this next hit.” And you know what happens next.\n\nA real intervention — like the ones we enjoy on reality TV — involves the people who care about the addict getting together with a professional to force a “bottom” with consequences if the addict will not seek help immediately. The real problem for the GOP is that the only people interested in intervening are also on the junk.\n\nLet’s be honest: The GOP isn’t even at its bottom.\n\nThat was 2008.\n\nThey lost the presidency and became a nearly insignificant minority in the House and the Senate after the late Senator Arlen Specter (D-PA) switched parties. Then, in a mere two years, they won back the House and nearly the Senate. And that victory only fueled their delusion.\n\nRepublicans thought they won because people were rejecting “big government,” though they’d also savaged the president for cutting Medicare. But in November of 2010, the unemployment rate was 9.6 percent and rising. What Americans were really rejecting was the lingering aftermath of the Bush-era financial crisis — a disaster that King Midas couldn’t have fixed quickly enough.\n\nStill, the GOP took their landslide victory as a sign that their ideas/addiction were working. They just needed to double down, veer to the right, defund Planned Parenthood, demand women have unnecessary ultrasounds, deregulate Wall Street again and repeal Obamacare three dozen times.\n\nAnd if they were going to nominate an “electable” candidate for president in 2012, they were going to damned well make sure he’d adopted all of their most extreme views before they let him out into the general election.\n\nNow, after the “electable” guy has lost, they attack him for making an excuse that is—like what Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock said about pregnancies from rape being a “gift”—the party line inartfully conveyed.\n\nYes, Mitt Romney said that President Obama only won because he’d been generous with “gifts” to his constituency. What else was Mitt going to tell his donors? “I hired smug fools who only told me I what I wanted to hear”?\n\nSince Mitt made that sneering comment, GOP presidential frontrunners for 2016 have lined up for their chance to whack him.\n\nBut the more “serious” thinkers in the GOP aren’t just distancing themselves from Mitt Romney, they’re digging a little deeper.\n\n“The ground game is really important, and we have to be, I mean we’ve got to give our political organizational activity a very serious… proctology exam,” former Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour said, during a panel at the Republican Governors Association. “We need to look everywhere.”\n\nLOL.\n\n132\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n133",
  "latent_30847": "READER REPORT: Time to regulate the cannabis industry BRIAN KATIPO\n\nThe number of people charged with cannabis-related offences who subsequently were charged with a different offence within the next 12 months show a correlation between drug offending and committing other crimes.\n\nCurrently, the New Zealand cannabis industry is worth millions of dollars per year and is totally unregulated due to the legal status of cannabis. This has led to all sale and distribution being controlled by career criminals who have no ethics when it comes to selling this product to children or trying to push harder damaging drugs to their customers.\n\nIt is also causing many ill people in this country to suffer unnecessarily.\n\nOur government bought into the \"war on drugs\", started in the US.\n\nThere are 2 main areas of regulation to be considered, in relation to cannabis, which are medicinal and recreational.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n* Peter Dunne says medical cannabis in tragic Alex Renton case was worthwhile\n\n* Helen Kelly calls for referendum on legalising cannabis at election\n\n* Let doctors decide on medicinal cannabis\n\n* New research coming on benefits of medicinal cannabis\n\nMedicinal Cannabis\n\nThe use of cannabis for purposes of healing predates recorded history. The earliest written reference is found in the 15th century BC Chinese Pharmacopeia, the Rh-Ya.\n\nIn more recent history William Turner, the naturalist considered the first English botanist, praised it in his New Herbal, published in 1538, the great British herbalist Nicholas Culpeper wrote in his book \"The English Physician\" (1652) of its many uses, Queen Victoria's physician, William O'Shaughnessy, was well known for his use of cannabis for many ailments including menstrual cramps.\n\nBy 1850, cannabis had made its way into the United States Pharmacopeia which listed it as a treatment for numerous afflictions, including neuralgia, opiate addiction, incontinence, convulsive disorders, excessive menstrual bleeding, and uterine bleeding, among others.\n\nThe UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961) is often quoted as to what our cannabis law is based on, but article 49 actually states \"The use of cannabis for other than medical and scientific purposes must be discontinued as soon as possible but in any case within twenty-five years\". In other words, medicinal cannabis was never banned under this international treaty.\n\nModern studies of THC (the ingredient of cannabis that produces the \"high\") has led to 2 main discoveries.\n\nThe first was the Endocannabinoid system in the human body. This is a major system in mammals and deficiencies in the body's natural ability to produce endocannabinoids has been shown to be a cause of many illnesses.\n\nThe second discovery was CBD, which is another main ingredient of cannabis. This does not produce a high but is a vital part of the medical effectiveness of cannabis. Clinical endocannabinoid deficiency (CECD) can be helped with various types of cannabis.\n\nMany strains of medicinal cannabis are now produced with very low levels of THC but high levels of CBD. Although illegal in New Zealand, oils produced from these high CBD low THC strains are sold as health supplements in many parts of the world including Australia and the UK.\n\nDifferent strains of cannabis and associated oils are now internationally recognised to be the most effective substances for many debilitating diseases and have saved the lives of many people in the world. Epileptic type illnesses can be greatly improved by high CBD strains and many types of pain (including that from terminal cancer) can be helped with strains having higher levels of THC.\n\nInnocent people in this country are suffering and even dying from illnesses that could be treated with various types of cannabis but our law is abandoning them. The main excuses that are used to restrict medicinal cannabis in NZ are that, this could lead to the legalisation of recreational Cannabis (which has not been the case for Morphine etc.) and that more research needs to be done (as if thousands of years is not enough).\n\nRecreational Cannabis\n\nThe main reasons that are given by prohibitionists for banning recreational cannabis are;\n\n1) It is a gateway drug to harder drugs: cannabis is not related to either Methamphetamine or Heroin. The only link here is the status of cannabis in the law. It has been shown over and over again that Pharmaceutical painkillers (Opioids) and alcohol are much more likely to lead to Heroin addiction.\n\n2) Cannabis is addictive: cannabis has been scientifically proven to be less addictive than nicotine, alcohol and caffeine.\n\n3) We already have 2 legal damaging drugs (nicotine and alcohol) we do not need another: Cannabis is a lot less damaging than either of these drugs so it people are so concerned why are they not trying to ban Alcohol.\n\n4) It will make it easier for children to get hold of: By removing the control from criminals and putting the control to licenses that have been vetted by the police and introducing an age limit we will actually make it harder for children to get hold of.\n\nSummary\n\nWe need to\n\n- Regulate this industry so that those in desperate medical need can get the help they require.\n\n- Keep cannabis distribution out of the hands of criminals and ensure that children do not have the easy access that currently exists.\n\n- Stop criminalising a significant percentage of our population, who commit no crime except for choosing a safer drug to relax than is available to them legally.\n\n- Educate our population and stop lying to them.\n\nComments",
  "latent_30976": "European historians oppose publication by Suhrkamp of Robert Service’s Trotsky biography\n\nBy Wolfgang Weber\n\n23 November 2011\n\nIn a letter dated July 30, 2011, to Ulla Unseld-Berkéwicz, who heads the major German publishing house Suhrkamp Verlag, 14 prominent historians, political scientists and publicists from Germany and Austria oppose the firm’s planned publication of Robert Service’s biography of Leon Trotsky. The World Socialist Web Site is today publishing this letter.\n\nThe authors and initial signers of the letter are Professor of Political Science and Contemporary History, Dr. Hermann Weber (Mannheim University) and Professor of Sociology, Dr. Helmut Dahmer (Technical University, Darmstadt).\n\nThey support the criticism of Service’s biography of Trotsky set forth by David North in the book In Defense of Leon Trotsky (published by Mehring Books, 2010). In June of this year, the American historian Bertrand Patenaude associated himself with North’s critique in a review of Service’s book for the prestigious American Historical Review (AHR). He agreed that the book by Service is a hastily concocted diatribe that violates the basic standards of scientific work, and that the book’s publishers failed to meet professional standards of editorial care and integrity. (See “The American Historical Review discredits Robert Service’s biography of Leon Trotsky”.) Neither Service nor his publisher have to date responded to this criticism or rebutted it.\n\nThe letter to Suhrkamp Verlag states: “North and Patenaude have pointed out a host of factual errors by Service… Service’s sources are unreliable. Sources that are very difficult to access and hardly verifiable for most readers often have nothing to do with the claims made, or demonstrate the opposite. Contrary to the announcement made by Suhrkamp, Service has not sought to deal with Trotsky and Stalin in an ‘impartial and genuine’ manner. Instead, the aim of his work is to discredit Trotsky, and unfortunately he often resorts to the formulas associated with Stalinist propaganda.”\n\nThe authors and signatories of the letter draw special attention to the numerous passages in which Service appeals to anti-Semitic prejudices, and cite a series of direct quotations to substantiate this. Their verdict at the end of the letter to the publisher is: “We are of the opinion that the book by Service is misplaced in your highly regarded publishing house.”\n\nTo great acclaim in many press organs, from both right-wing academics and ex-radical intellectuals, the biography by the Oxford professor Robert Service was published in 2009 by Harvard University in the United States and Macmillan in the UK. In 2010, it was published by Ediciones B in Spain and Latin America, and several weeks ago by Perrin in France. A forthcoming German edition by Suhrkamp was announced some time ago.\n\nProfessor Hermann Weber (83) is regarded throughout Europe as a leading figure in research into the communist movement and Stalinism in the twentieth century. From 1975 to 1993, he held the chair of Political Science and Contemporary History at the University of Mannheim. He has published numerous standard works on the history of the German Communist Party (KPD), the Socialist Unity Party (SED) in the former East Germany, the Comintern, and the Stalinist terror. His book, Geschichte der DDR (History of the GDR) is still a bestseller. In his role as head of the research project “Commintern” by the German-Russian Commission of Historians at the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research and as associate editor of Jahrbuch für historische Kommunismusforschung (Yearbook for historical research on communism), he still takes an active part in debates on science and research.\n\nProfessor Helmut Dahmer is an outstanding expert on the works of Leon Trotsky and for over 20 years has been responsible for their publication in a scholarly-critical series of 10 volumes.\n\nOne of the first additional signatories of the letter was Dr. Hartmut Mehringer. Unfortunately, this recognised expert on the socialist opposition inside the Third Reich died unexpectedly on October 17 of this year after an illness. Mehringer completed his doctoral thesis on the development of the theory of permanent revolution in the years 1848-1907. In the 1970s, he published works by Leon Trotsky and later held a leading position at the Institute for Contemporary History in Munich and Berlin.\n\nOther signatories are:\n\nBernhard Bayerlein, a lecturer at the University of Cologne and researcher at the Centre for Contemporary History Potsdam, author of numerous publications on the history of the communist movement in Germany and on Stalinism.\n\nHeiko Haumann, professor emeritus for Eastern European and Modern History at the University of Basel.\n\nWladislaw Hedeler, historian and writer living in Berlin, an expert on the history of the Soviet Union.\n\nAndrea Hurton, historian and writer living in Vienna.\n\nProfessor Mario Kessler, lecturer and researcher at the Centre for Contemporary History, Potsdam. Professor Kessler began his academic career in East Germany and after reunification qualified for the second time. A focus of his research and publications has long been the theme of the workers’ movement and the Jewish question.\n\nOskar Negt, professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Hanover. As a member of the Socialist German Student Association (SDS) beginning in 1956, he was a spokesman of the extra-parliamentary opposition in the 1960s.\n\nProfessor Oliver Rathkolb, professor of contemporary history and director of the Institute for Contemporary History at the University of Vienna. He has established an international reputation for his research on the Nazi era and the political history of Austria and Europe.\n\nHans Schafranek, a historian in Vienna. His main focus is reflected in numerous publications on the subjects of Stalinism, Trotskyism and the Spanish Civil War.\n\nPeter Steinbach teaches contemporary history as a professor at the University of Mannheim and is the scientific director of the German Resistance Memorial in Berlin.\n\nReiner Tossdorf, lecturer in East European History at the University of Mainz.\n\nRolf Wörsdörfer, lecturer at the Technical University of Darmstadt and specialist in the history of Eastern Europe and Yugoslavia.\n\nAs the list demonstrates, the authors and signatories represent very different political views and scientific schools of thought, but they have one thing in common: they feel a responsibility to historical truth and the defence of scientific standards in historiography.\n\nThe letter has had some effect on the publisher Suhrkamp. After it arrived, the printing of the book was postponed. In a letter to Professor Helmut Dahmer, Dr. Sparr, the representative of Frau Unseld-Berkéwicz in the management of the publishing house, wrote that the allegations are being taken very seriously and further expert opinion has been sought.\n\nBut as of today, Suhrkamp has evidently not made a decision to abandon publication. The fact that the firm has not made any detailed statement in response to the historians’ factual letter, while bookstores and delivery chains have already announced delivery of the book for January 2012, suggests that they intend to publish.\n\nEven if Suhrkamp does publish the book, the letter is a heavy blow to Robert Service and his attempt to “finish off” Trotsky as a world historical figure by means of historical falsifications and slanders, thereby committing, as hailed in the British press, “a second assassination of Trotsky.”\n\nThere is no other historical figure of the twentieth century who was so hounded and vilified as Leon Trotsky. The Stalinist apparatus attacked him with historical falsifications and hate campaigns, murdered tens of thousands of his followers, and finally killed him. The anti-communists in the West angrily maligned Trotsky as well because they correctly recognised in him a principled and incorruptible Marxist and socialist.\n\nThe fact that Trotsky has become the object of ferocious attacks and slander in the twenty-first century is a testament to his contemporary relevance. Under conditions of the most profound crisis of world capitalism since the 1930s, the ruling circles fear a revival of socialist ideas. That many historians and journalists now confront these slanders and defend the historical truth is to be welcomed. The World Socialist Web Site is committed to fostering and enriching the reawakened interest in the person and ideas of Leon Trotsky. We will make known the historians’ letter to the widest possible public and encourage the broadest possible discussion.\n\n**\n\nIn Defense of Leon Trotsky is available at Mehring Books.",
  "latent_30996": "Proposed legislation that would allow discrimination against LGBT people based on religious beliefs failed or faced major setbacks in four separate states Tuesday, dealing a significant blow to what some have seen as a new front for LGBT rights opponents.\n\n\"[Tuesday was] a very important rebuffing of the latest anti-gay and anti-choice tactics, but I wouldn't say that we're out of the woods yet,\" said Evan Wolfson, president and founder of Freedom to Marry. \"Our opponents have lost the argument about gay people, they've lost the argument about marriage and all they have left is distractions, diversions, and desperate attempts to carve out the license to discriminate as they have tried in every other civil rights chapter in our nation's history.\"\n\nLawmakers in Idaho, Kansas, South Dakota, and Tennessee either voted down, blocked, or backtracked on legislation in the states that would have allowed individuals, religious organizations, businesses, and, in the case of Kansas, government employees to discriminate against LGBT people in the form of denying services and other recognition based on religious beliefs.\n\nLGBT and civil rights advocates say that while the battle over these issues is far from over, Tuesday's developments are encouraging and could send signals to other states contemplating similar measures.\n\n\"This is an incredible development and very encouraging,\" said Eunice Rho, advocacy and policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"People across the country are seeing discrimination is just wrong, plain and simple, no matter how they try to justify it with these bills.\"\n\nThe bills come in the wake of the growing marriage equality movement in the United States, where marriage is legal for same-sex couples in 17 states and the District of Columbia, and where federal courts have struck down marriage bans in Oklahoma, Utah, and Virginia in recent months.\n\nAlthough Idaho, Kansas, South Dakota, and Tennessee do not allow marriage for same-sex couples, lawmakers backing the bills say the proposals are preemptive measures to protect businesses with religious beliefs should same-sex couples be allowed to marry there someday, citing cases where businesses were sued for denying services to same-sex couples.\n\n\"Just in the last week and a half, we've seen liberal, activist judges overrule the will of the people in our neighboring states, Kentucky and Virginia, by overturning their constitutional amendments defining marriage as between a man and a woman,\" said Sen. Mike Bell, sponsor of the Tennessee bill. \"And it's shame, it's a shame that we're here discussing the protections of business owners' rights in this regards. Because of liberal court judges across the country, we must stand prepared.\"\n\nMoments later, Bell pulled the bill from the state's Senate Judiciary Committee after concluding with legal experts that the state's law already \"protects our business owners from the type of lawsuit harassment we've seen in other states.\"\n\nBut opponents of these bills say they are \"trojan horses\" and would ultimately undermine nondiscrimination and human rights laws at municipal and state levels. They are \"a dangerous solution to a nonproblem,\" Wolfson said.",

It came two days after a Dalit youth was killed in a Borsad village in Anand, allegedly by upper caste men, for watching a garba at a temple.\n\nThe teenaged boy was attacked in Limbodara village in Gandhinagar district around 5.30 pm when he was returning from school after an examination. Hours before the attack, the boy had told The Indian Express that he too was assaulted on September 25 when he was with Piyush Parmar (24) who was attacked, allegedly by Darbars, for sporting a moustache.Day after Dalit youth’s murder in Gujarat: ‘They banged his head against wall, they kept kicking him’\n\nParmar works for a private power transmission firm in Gandhinagar. Following the attack, an FIR was registered on September 27 at the Kalol police station under provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.\n\nAdvertising\n\nOn September 29, another Dalit, Kunal Maheria, who works for a private telecom company, was attacked for sporting a moustache. An FIR was lodged the following day.\n\nKajal, elder sister of the 17-year-old boy, said: “He is in pain, he received seven stitches. He was attacked with a blade. We have no idea who the two men were. He came home running with a bleeding back. We rushed him to the Civil Hospital in Gandhinagar.”\n\n“The first time he was beaten, we did not file an FIR because he is still in school and we thought it could affect his future. Only Piyush and Kunal Maheria filed the FIRs. But this is too much. We are not safe in our own village,” Kajal said.\n\nGandhinagar SP Virendrasingh Yadav said: “We are looking into the matter, making sure there is no bias. The boy has been attacked and an FIR has been filed under Section 326 of the IPC (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means). The boy was attacked with a blade by two men on a bike who had covered their faces.

We do not know if the two persons who attacked him belong to another caste or not.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dalit activists in Gujarat have called a protest meet Wednesday outside the Vidhan Sabha.\n\n“The call for protest is not from any Dalit organisation or group. Various activists have come together and we think enough is enough. In the last one week, there have been many cases of Dalits being attacked. In Limbodara village, two people were beaten up for sporting a moustache. In Anand, a Dalit was killed for attending a garba. There has been no statement from the government. We will demand the resignation of the Home Minister if we are not assured of action being taken in the cases,” Dalit activist Subodh Parmar said.\n\nTo protest the attacks over a moustache, Dalits near Sanand have adopted a twirled moustache logo as their WhatsApp display picture.

  "latent_31246": "Actually this isn’t written by someone called Mavis, but instead by RPS chum and former Wired staffer Duncan Geere, who you may remember from his Sim City 2000 retrospective. In this first of four parts, he takes you through the ropes of basic coding via the modern marvel that is Minecraft. Everything’s done in game, and it all begins by punching a tree. Take it away, Duncan.\n\nNew year! New you! New Kids On The Block! New Romantics! Nu-Metal! New Games Journalism! January is the perfect time for personal improvement – most people try and lose weight, quit drinking or speak a new language. But you’re going to learn how to code, and you’re going to do it by playing Minecraft.\n\nThere’s a brilliant mod called ComputerCraft that was released just over a year ago, on Christmas Eve 2011. It’s the creation of a very smart chap called Dan200, and it adds in-game computers with a full OS, filesystem, and a selection of built-in programs. Over the course of a short series of articles, I’m going to teach you how to write software that can password doors, automatically mine, make a big digital clock for your base, and even send chat messages to other players’ in-game computers.\n\nThat’s just the beginning of what’s possible. If you explore further, you’ll find printers, touchscreen monitors, printers, programmable jukeboxes, games-within-games, or even pull in the contents of Minepedia so you can get Minecraft help from a computer in Minecraft.\n\nIt runs on the widely-used and easy-to-learn programming language Lua, so as well as learning some basics of programming languages in general, you’ll also be able to “update your CV” with a “transferrable skill”. Eat that, careers advisor.\n\nGetting started is easy. You can download ComputerCraft from the Minecraft forums. It’s free. However, it does require a little bit of fiddling around in java folders, so there’s actually an easier option.\n\nThe awesome Technic Pack includes ComputerCraft by default and doesn’t require any mucking about, so if you prefer then you can just download the Technic Pack and run it that way instead. If you do that, make sure you select “Tekkit” in the drop-down when you login. In these tutorials I’ll be working from version 1.481 of ComputerCraft, running in 3.1.2 of Tekkit Classic.\n\nSo, where do we start? Well, it’s Minecraft, so go punch a tree. Then, build a shelter, start a mine and so on. You don’t need to go overboard, but make sure you’ve got a creeper-proof place to work from – either below the surface or raised above the ground. The last thing you want when you’re coding is a green face leering over your shoulder.\n\nYou’ll also need some supplies, but not much. For this tutorial, you’ll need about ten blocks of stone (not cobblestone, you need to run it through a furnace first), four redstone, one bit of paper, and a single pane of glass. Once you’ve got all that together, you’re ready to go.\n\nThe first thing you’ll want to build is the computer itself. For this, place a pile of redstone dust in the centre of your crafting bench as a CPU, a pane (not block) of glass below it as the screen, and fill out the rest with a stone shell. Voila. You’re Alan Sugar. Now to turn you into Bill Gates.\n\nPut your computer down somewhere nice (a fence post or two makes a nice desk) and right click it. You’ll get a command prompt.\n\nThis will now behave quite a lot like a regular computer. It has a text editor, a file system with directories, and so on. For those of you that remember fiddling around with DOS, you’ll immediately be somewhat at home. If you don’t, don’t worry – I’ll talk you through the very basics.\n\nFirst, let’s explore around a bit. Type “ls” and it’ll list the files in your current directory. There should only be one, called “rom”. Go into that directory by typing “cd rom” – which translates to ‘change directory rom’. If you ls again here, you’ll see a bunch of files and folders. Type “cd ..” to go back up a level to what’s called the root folder – the top of the chain. If you get lost, typing “cd /” will take you back to the start from wherever you are.\n\nIt’s worth noting that files and directories look identical in this interface. To work out whether something is one or the other, use the type command. For example, in the root directory, typing “type rom” should return the word “directory”, indicating that it’s a directory.\n\nLet’s get coding. We’ll start with something very simple.\n\nType “edit helloworld” at the command prompt to open a new folder in the text editor called helloworld. A blank screen will appear with a flashing cursor and “Press Ctrl to access menu” at the bottom. At the top, type the following, paying careful attention to upper and lower case.\n\nprint(“Hello world!”)\n\nThen hit control, then enter to save that file. Then control again, right arrow to move to exit, and then enter to exit the text editor. The “print” command tells the computer to output something to the screen, so all we’re doing here is telling the computer to output the words “Hello world!” to the screen.\n\nNow type “helloworld” at the command prompt to run your program. If all goes well, it should look something like this.\n\nIf not, go back through the steps again making sure you didn’t miss anything out. If it hangs at any point, hold ctrl-T to terminate the current program. If you want to start completely from scratch, hit Esc to leave the ComputerCraft interface, whack your computer with a pickaxe until it drops and place it down again. Or just type “reboot” or hold down ctrl-R for a second. But the first option is more fun.\n\nFor kicks, you can type “ls” again to see that there’s now a file in the root directory called “helloworld”. That’ll stay there until you reboot the computer, but to keep it more permanently (or perhaps transfer it between machines), you’ll want a disk drive.\n\nBuild one of those by placing a pile of redstone dust in the middle and centre bottom slots of the crafting bench and filling the rest out with stone again.\n\nPlace the disk drive next to one of the faces of the computer. But a disk drive is useless without a disk, so to make that, combine one sheet of paper with a pile of redstone dust. Right-click the disk drive, and put it in the slot. If you’ve been lucky enough to find a record on your travels, you can also put that in the disk drive and use the “dj” command to play it.\n\nNow if you use the computer and type “ls” you should see a directory called “disk”. Anything you put in there will stay there, permanently, so long as you keep hold of that disk. To copy our helloworld program there for safe keeping, go back to the root directory and type “cp helloworld disk/helloworld“. This is basically telling the computer: “copy the file called helloworld to a new file called helloworld in the directory called disk”.\n\nTo check it’s worked, destroy the computer with your pickaxe (and even the disk drive if you want), and then place it all back — not forgetting to put the disk back in the drive. Then type either “cd disk” then “helloworld” or just “disk/helloworld” to run the program.\n\nCongratulations, you’re a programmer. A bad one, sure, but you now know how to navigate the Lua filesystem, create files, and save them to disk. You also know how to print text to the screen. Next week, I’ll show you how to create an intruder alarm, a passworded door and a digital clock for your base.\n\nIn the meantime, feel free to have a poke around the filesystem and particularly the /rom/programs directory. If you want to look inside a file, just type “edit “. You can’t do any damage that simply breaking the computer with your pickaxe and placing it down again won’t fix.\n\nIf you want to be extra-prepared for next week, gather a bunch more of each of the resources from above (particularly redstone), as well as some iron bars. Good luck hacker, see you then.",

  "latent_31812": "BEIJING (Reuters) - More than 10,000 armed police in China’s western Xinjiang region staged a mass rally in the capital Urumqi, state media said, as authorities rolled out a rapid-response air patrol system to quell unrest that the government blames on Islamist militants.\n\nParamilitary policemen stand in formation as they take part in an anti-terrorism oath-taking rally, in Kashgar, Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, China, February 27, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer\n\nThe rally held on Monday, complete with circling helicopters and armored vehicles, was at least the fourth such mass display in the region this year, intended as a show of force after a recent uptick in violence.\n\nHundreds have died in Xinjiang in the past few years, mostly in unrest between the Muslim Uighur people, who call the region home, and the ethnic majority Han Chinese.\n\nXinjiang’s Communist Party secretary Chen Quanguo told the ranks of armed police lined up outside Urumqi’s international convention center that they must realize the “grim conditions” facing the region’s security.\n\n“Bury the corpses of terrorists and terror gangs in the vast sea of the people’s war,” Chen said, according to the Xinjiang government’s official news site Tianshan Net on Tuesday.\n\nAt an Urumqi airport later that day, Chen dispatched 1,500 armed police to the “frontlines” in the Xinjiang cities of Hotan, Kashgar and Aksu.\n\nThose cities, which have seen their own mass rallies in recent weeks, are part of the region’s southern Uighur heartland, where recent violence has flared. Three knife-wielding attackers killed five people and injured five others before being shot dead in Hotan this month.\n\nPeople’s Armed Police (PAP) and military helicopters, as well as 10 civilian aircraft, carried the forces as part of an “all new” air-land mechanism that would bring high-speed armed helicopter patrols anywhere over Xinjiang’s vast and rugged territory, a notice posted to the Ministry of Defence’s website said. It did not give further details on the patrols.\n\nThe PAP is a specialist branch of paramilitary police akin to soldiers tasked with safeguarding domestic security and responding to riots, terrorist attacks and other emergencies.\n\nThe air patrols have been rolled out along with a string of new measures in the ethnically divided region, including mandatory satellite tracking devices for vehicles in some areas, and increased rewards for anti-terror tips.\n\nState media that Xinjiang’s spending on public security jumped 19.3 percent in 2016 to more than 30 billion yuan ($4.37 billion).\n\nRights groups and exiles say anger at tightening Chinese controls on the religion and culture of Uighurs is to blame for violence in the region, though China routinely denies any repression.",
  "latent_31826": "The notion that humans act rationally in day-to-day actions has been an unwillingly accepted conventional wisdom throughout most of the history of schools of economic thought. The recent growth of research into behavioural economics is turning the tide and seeking to produce insights into how our minds work which may then be used as inspiration for new economic models that take into account this irrationality. This research has uncovered many features about how we as consumers react to different stimuli which has inevitable implications on how marketing campaigns are effective in influencing consumer behaviour. As Peter Drucker said “The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well the product or service fits him and sells itself” and I will explore to what extent behavioral economics can give us a deeper insight into the consumer’s mind.\n\nAccording to Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow people’s mental capacities can be categorised into two systems; system one thinking and system two thinking. System one is the brain’s “fast, automatic, intuitive approach” whereas system two is the mind’s “slower, analytical mode, where reason dominates”. People generally use system one thinking for most of their day to day activities like grocery shopping or deciding where to eat. People typically reserve the much slower and lazier system 2 for calculating their budgets or balancing their chequebooks. Given that most consumer decisions are made using System 1 thought processes marketers therefore tend to benefit from a deeper understanding of how the system 1 thinking works. However there is also a hypothesised link between system one and two thinking whereby system two thinking can help guide system one thinking. For example when you first purchase a good you may undertake careful research about what brand is the best value for money, which would be classified as system two thinking, but then you will automatically buy that same brand every time and hence undergo system 1 thinking. This lends itself to a self-reinforcing cycle whereby brands with large consumer bases tend to maintain them regardless of the quality or price of their competition.\n\nIn order for a firm to begin an increase in their consumer base they must employ marketing strategies to target system two thinking to capture new consumers of that good. They should therefore have advertising campaigns that include rational arguments such as being the cheapest brand whilst ensuring they employ techniques tailored towards system one behaviour like ensuring they have memorable and easily distinguishable branding.\n\nCompanies can also exploit the psychological effects of priming, where there is an implicit memory effect in which exposure to a stimulus influences a response to a later stimulus. What this means is that the consumers subconsciously remembers something when they are exposed to a certain stimulus, like seeing or hearing an advert, which will then lead to the influencing of a response when they are in a different environment. This can be seen in marketing since certain adverts push consumers to the point of purchase, for example you could see a billboard for MacDonald’s whilst driving along the motorway which can make you more likely to then eat at MacDonald’s for lunch.\n\nAs well as this there is significant research into the impacts of choice architecture. The fashion through which choices are presented to the consumer are credited with actually influencing their behaviour, making them more or less likely to purchase the product. This applies to only some firms like restaurants which sell multiple products. The most obvious way in which it does this is it simplifies the presentation of the options; giving a clear description and an unambiguous price making the consumer more likely to make a purchase. However a more interesting and conniving way it influences people is through the decoy effect. This is where a much more expensive product, the decoy, is placed in the menu which makes the other options look much more reasonable than they would without the decoy. The theory behind this lies on one major assumptions that if someone is overloaded with choice, like in a restaurant, they will make the decision based on the other dishes since choices are much easier to make relative to other offers than on their own.\n\nTherefore while the work of behavioural economics continues to reveal that consumer decisions are more complex than our previous models took into account, it also creates new realms of opportunity for marketers to appeal to their consumers through rational and irrational messages alike.\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_31849": "December 10, 2014 at 1:34 PM\n\nA man who was convicted as a teenager of killing street musician Ed “Tuba Man” McMichael pleaded guilty Wednesday afternoon to an unrelated fatal shooting in Bellevue on Christmas Eve 2012.\n\nJa’Mari Alexander-Alan Jones, 21, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for killing DeShawn Milliken in the Mirror Lounge at Munchbar, a restaurant/bar in Bellevue Square. The King County Prosecutor’s Office plans to recommend an 18-year prison term when he is sentenced on Jan. 9\n\nMilliken, 30, of Renton, was fatally shot just after 1 a.m. during an altercation in the lounge, which was crowded with hundreds of people celebrating a Seahawks‘ win against the San Francisco 49ers the day before.\n\nSecurity video footage from the bar showed Jones talking with a man near Milliken and his sister, according to the court papers. Milliken seemed to recognize Jones and tackled him. Destiny Milliken appeared to fight with the other man, Michael Cheatham, who had entered the bar with Jones.\n\nAbout 8 seconds later, DeShawn Milliken turned away from Jones, but was then tackled by Cheatham.\n\nJones then pulled out a handgun, pointed it at DeShawn Milliken and fired at least five shots, according to charging papers.\n\nMilliken was a former Garfield High School homecoming king, student-body vice president, football star and honor student.\n\nThe homicide prompted Kemper Freeman Jr., developer of Bellevue Square, to close down Munchbar.\n\nJones was one of three youths who pleaded guilty in April 2009 to manslaughter in the death of 53-year-old Ed “Tuba Man” McMichael, who was beaten during an October 2008 robbery near Seattle Center and later died of his injuries. Jones was 16 at the time.\n\nJones, Billy Chambers and Kenneth Kelly served time in Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration detention for McMichael’s death. Because no witnesses came forward after McMichael’s death, King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg said, his office was forced to charge the three teens as juveniles instead of seeking to have them charged as adults, which would have meant longer sentences.\n\nChambers is serving a six-year sentence in federal prison on a firearms charge unrelated to the McMichael slaying.",
  "latent_31894": "A reporter at Chicago’s Soldier Field for the Grateful Dead’s climactic last show on July 5 described the record-breaking crowd as a “rolling sea of graying beards and ponytails, flowing skirts, cowboy hats and backward caps, flower crowns and bandannas.”\n\nMaybe that’s just who could afford tickets to one of the most expensive concerts in history. From where I was, watching the show at a bar in Baltimore with fellow Dead fans, I didn’t smell any patchouli. My combat boots were not out of place. I stood next to an older black woman who nodded her head, with stately dreadlocks attached, to the rhythm emanating from the speakers. I debated transgender issues during set break.\n\nThe night marked the outro of a glorious era of American music. After 50 years, thousands of shows, and millions of inspired fans, the Grateful Dead’s “long strange trip” came to an end, culminating in a five-day California-to-Illinois Fare Thee Well tour. I was not among the privileged 71,000 who got to see the final concert in the flesh, but I jammed and cried along with my friends and the millions of live-streamed webcast viewers who made it the largest online music pay-per-view event of all time.\n\nAs a technologically inclined, black, gay hip-hop artist from East Baltimore who grew up on punk rock, I am not what most would consider a “typical” Dead fan. I don’t own a stitch of tie-dye. I wouldn’t even really call myself a “Deadhead”: I only discovered and fell for the Dead in 2012, at a relentless friend’s urging—17 years after Jerry Garcia died. Being born in the final days of Generation X with an ear calibrated to digital music, I am more likely to reach for my phone 10 minutes into an “epic jam” than to scream “woo!”\n\nAnd yet, the Dead’s lyrics moved me.\n\n“Shakedown Street” is, to me, a tale of a disdained city no more at home in 1985 than 2015. The exhortation of “Sugaree”—“just one thing I ask of you…just don’t tell ‘em you know me”—would resonate with every adulterer and closeted gay man on Earth. “Throwing Stones,” one of the Dead’s few political tracks, inspires me as much as any hip-hop does: a reminder that beyond all divisions of race, class, gender, and orientation, we are one human race on a (increasingly fragile) “big blue ball spinning, spinning free.”\n\nAnd then there are the shows. A gathering of Deadheads—be it at Soldier Field for the Dead themselves; for offshoot bands Furthur and Phil Lesh & Friends; or for any number of Dead cover bands—is a place where people shed divisions and embrace a universal “phamily,” one that cuts across the boundaries of sex, class, and race. After a few inspirational songs I was intrigued; after my first Furthur show I was hooked; and I cried during “Jerry’s last show”—every time I watched it on YouTube.\n\nThe Grateful Dead’s live performances are timeless, obliterating ticket inventories in 2015 as they did in 1970, their music seemingly unbound by language or culture or even sound itself. As one deadhead blogger recalls, the band has always managed to bring together diverse elements of humanity:\n\nYou could see birds of every color at a show, black deadheads, latino deadheads, white deadheads, purple deadheads, gay deadheads…straight deadheads, junkie deadheads, corporate deadheads, intellectual deadheads, stoner deadheads, punk deadheads, jewish deadheads, christian deadheads, pagan deadheads, buddhist deadheads, atheist deadheads, deadheads with ties, republican deadheads, commie deadheads, activist deadheads, rich deadheads, poor deadheads, kind veggie burrito deadheads, I need a miracle deadheads, grubby parking lot deadheads, tapers, spinners, the whole panoply of universal color and expression.\n\nLast Sunday I stood next to my ex-punk rocker friends, complete with tattoos, tearing up during “Cassidy” at the line “fare thee well now,” and crying as hard as any “hippie” during the second set.\n\nSoldier Field may have been a sea of grey ponytails and flowing skirts, but watching around the world, we were all there. All ages. Baby Boomers, Gen Xers, Millennials. Republicans and Democrats. Hippies, punk rockers, business people, and construction workers. One big “rainbow flag of inclusiveness,” as the 48-year Dead veteran and ex-NBA star Bill Walton put it.\n\nDead fans of color do exist. We were at the shows—even if we didn’t necessarily appear in the pictures. LGBT Dead fans exist, and they danced alongside evangelicals and Orthodox Jews. The loss of one of the world’s legendary bands is mourned worldwide—even the Wu-Tang rapper RZA has touted his company Boombotix’s 50th-anniversary commemorative Grateful Dead speaker. Who else but Jerry Garcia could be a point of commonality for Barack Obama and Ann Coulter?\n\nThe final show ended with the words of drummer Mickey Hart echoing through the air, “This feeling we have here—remember it, take it home and do some good with it.”\n\nWe took that message home—home to East Baltimore, Brooklyn, Brazil, and the White House, as we did his next words: “Please be kind.”",
  "latent_32016": "I looked into the passenger side window of the car as it rolled past, and I could see that the driver was wearing a hat with the Miami “U” on it. Normally, in my neighborhood, that would stand out. I grew up in USC Trojan country, about 15 minutes north of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nBut this was New Year’s week in 2001 — better known in Los Angeles County as Rose Bowl Week. That year, it was the national championship game, No. 1 Miami vs. No. 2 Nebraska. So if you walked down the street anywhere in L.A., you saw Nebraska red and white and Miami green and orange.\n\nMostly green and orange.\n\nSo it wasn’t really the hat that stood out to me as the car rolled by. It was what I saw when the car passed me and I looked back as it drove away. There was a bumper sticker on the back fender that read GO CANES! and a Florida license plate — which, if you’ve never seen one, is also green and orange, like it was designed with the Hurricanes in mind.\n\nI thought, That guy drove all the way to L.A. from Miami? For a football game?\n\nI was six years old at the time, so I didn’t understand how far that really was (it’s almost 3,000 miles). I just knew it was far. I knew Nebraska was far away, too, but I hadn’t seen many cars with Nebraska plates driving around.\n\nAfter that, I started noticing Hurricanes bumper stickers and Florida plates everywhere. When I walked around town, I saw number 11 Ken Dorsey jerseys lining the sidewalks. There were pops of Nebraska red and white here and there, but you couldn’t get away from the green and orange.\n\nIt was like the Hurricanes had taken over Los Angeles.\n\nLater that week, Miami destroyed Nebraska in the Rose Bowl, 37-14, and it wasn’t even that close. I remember watching it on TV. It’s a game that has always stuck in my memory. The way the Hurricanes played, the way they won, the way their fans flooded L.A. — everything about Miami just felt larger than life.\n\nAfter the Hurricanes won the national title, the USC colors came back out and pushed the green and orange out of Pasadena, and L.A. went back to being Trojan Country. The years that followed were the glory years of Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart. Heisman trophies, national title games, the Bush Push — iconic stuff. So if you were a kid playing youth football during that time, odds are you wanted to play college football at USC.\n\nI know I did.\n\nThe problem was, by the spring of 2013, when I was preparing for my senior year at West Hills Chaminade in L.A., I only had two scholarship offers. Neither was from USC.\n\nSome recruits are into the signing day drama. I really wasn’t. I wanted to commit early. I wanted to know where I was going so I could focus on my senior year — on being the best quarterback I could be for my team while preparing for the next level.\n\nOf the two offers I had on the table, one was from San Diego State.\n\nThe other was from Miami.\n\nNot to knock San Diego State, but the favorite in that race was pretty clear — not to mention the fact that Miami had recruited me throughout my junior year. They were the first program to show a genuine interest in me, and they never let up.\n\nSo in May of 2013, with no offer from the Trojans in sight, I committed to Miami.\n\nFive months later, halfway through my senior season, my dream school came knocking.\n\nAnybody who has ever been recruited will tell you: Just because you’ve verbally committed doesn’t mean the recruiting process stops. The letters keep coming in and the phone keeps ringing. Even though I was strong in my commitment to Miami, I still took the phone calls and visited other campuses, including USC and UCLA.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, in the span of six days, I received an offer from each. Offers to play in the Pac-12. Offers to stay at home in L.A.\n\nUCLA is a fantastic program, and they were really on the rise at that time. But USC was the one offer outside of Miami’s that I truly considered. I mean, I had grown up dreaming of playing at USC. There was a lot to consider, but in the end, it didn’t take long.\n\nI had seen the 30 for 30 documentary The U, so I was aware of Miami’s history and those teams in the ‘80s and early ‘90s. And I saw firsthand what happened in Pasadena in 2001 — I’ll never forget that. So I knew what Miami once was, and what it could be again.\n\nBut they hadn’t been that for a while. By the time I committed, they were coming off a 7-5 season and hadn’t hit the 10-win mark in eight years. It was something I thought about a lot — the direction of the Miami program at the time. But the more I thought about it, the more I knew Miami was where I wanted to be.\n\nI realized I didn’t want to just have a torch passed to me and told not to drop it. That’s what I would have had at USC. Like, “Here’s a Ferrari. Don’t crash it.”\n\nI wanted to be a part of something different. I wanted to help build something. I wanted to blaze my own trail and help bring Miami back to prominence. I liked the sound of that challenge.\n\nPlus, Miami believed in me before anybody else. James Coley, the Hurricanes’ offensive coordinator at the time, traveled across the country and found me in USC’s backyard before the Trojans even knew my name. And that meant something to me.\n\nSo I said no to my dream school.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, signing day was just the formality I had hoped it would be. I made my decision. I was going to be a Hurricane. All I had to do was make it official.\n\nThe final semester of my senior year, I spent almost every night in front of my bathroom mirror.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nI didn’t enroll early at Miami. After signing day, I went back to Chaminade to finish my senior year. I was set to report to Miami that summer, and Coach Coley sent me film and a playbook to study in the meantime. So every day after school, I went home and watched a couple of hours of film — spring practice, cut-ups from the previous season’s games, whatever. And then I hit the playbook, hard.\n\nThen I would practice calling out plays at the line — all the protections, all the checks. And the best place to do that was in my bathroom mirror.\n\nSo I would be standing there, staring back at myself, pretending I was in the huddle.\n\n“All right, all right,” I’d say, looking around at myself and my imaginary teammates. “Gun doubles right, two jet, all stops. On one, on one. Ready? Break!”\n\nI’d break the huddle with a clap and mentally trot up to the line, then lean to one side and point at the wall behind the medicine cabinet to identify the Mike linebacker.\n\n“Five-one, five-one. Mike’s 51.”\n\nThen I’d settle in and bend down into the mirror.\n\n“Down … setttt … check, check!”\n\nI did this over and over with just about every call in the book. I did everything just like I would in a game — well, everything except drop back after the snap, because I’d end up in the bath tub.\n\nI wanted to get it to where everything I said was automatic. No stuttering, no hesitation, no uncertainty. I wanted to call every play with authority. Most freshmen redshirt and it takes some time before they get their opportunity. I figured the same would happen for me. Ryan Williams was a fifth-year senior who had solidified himself as the starter.\n\nBut you never know when you might get your shot. And I wanted to be ready, just in case.\n\nThat April, just as I was about to graduate and report to Miami, Ryan Williams tore his ACL in spring practice.\n\nI was going into Miami as a true freshman to compete for a starting job.\n\nThose first few months at Miami are honestly kind of a blur. I arrived on campus in May, and after a pretty intense quarterback competition, I was named the starter just over a week before the season opener. It was pretty surreal — just a few months after calling out mock plays to myself in my bathroom mirror in L.A., I was on the road in Louisville, calling out real plays as a true freshman in an ACC game.\n\nWe lost that game at Louisville and then won two straight, but I don’t think I fully understood what was happening to me until Week 4.\n\nWe were on the road.\n\nAt Nebraska.\n\nIt was sold out. I’m talking almost 92,000 people — record attendance for a stadium that had been around for 90 years. And that place was rocking. It was so loud that when I got to the line to run our first play, my facemask was literally rattling.\n\nYou can’t simulate that in your bathroom mirror.\n\nThat was the moment when I stopped and said to myself, You’re not in high school anymore.\n\nI threw for 359 yards that day, the most by a true freshman in a single game in Miami history. But we lost the game, and my true freshman season turned out to be a tough one. We finished 6-7 and lost in the Independence Bowl.\n\nWe came back last season and took a good step forward, finishing 8-4 in the regular season. But that’s the thing: An 8-4 regular season is a good season at a lot of schools. Not at Miami. Down here, that’s average. People expect 10 wins or better. And they should. That’s a standard set by those teams in the ‘80s and early ‘90s and by that 2001 team I watched when I was a kid.\n\nIt’s a standard this current team shouldn’t — and doesn’t — shy away from.\n\nI knew when I came to Miami that we wouldn’t turn things around overnight. It was going to be a challenge — a process. We won six games in 2014, eight in 2015, and now our goal is to get back to that 10-win mark in 2016. Coach Mark Richt has brought a new energy to this program. I can feel it in the meeting rooms, at practice and all over Miami. Everywhere I go now, I have people coming up to me saying, “Good luck this season,” or, “Can’t wait to see you guys do something special.”\n\nThat fanbase that took over Los Angeles in 2001, that team that dominated Nebraska — we can be that again. But it’s gonna take everybody. It starts with the players and coaches, and then it’s on the rest of the South Florida community and fanbase. I think Miami truly is a sleeping giant. This is a place where, if we can win and build some momentum, we can win big, just like Hurricanes teams of the past have.\n\nMy goal when I came here was to leave this Miami program in a better place than when I found it — or, more accurately, when it found me. It’s truly an honor to wear this jersey, knowing all the great players who wore it before me and what they stood for. But now, we’re trying to blaze our own path and create our own identity as we move into this new era of Hurricanes football.\n\nWe’re still The U. I think a lot of people have forgotten that.\n\nNow it’s our job to make them remember.",
  "latent_32021": "Why did we even need insurance? First, we wanted to know that, if we had a medical catastrophe, we would not exhaust our savings. Second, uninsured patients are billed more than the rates that insurers negotiate with doctors and hospitals, and we wanted to pay those lower rates. The difference is significant: my recent M.R.I. cost $1,300 at the “retail” rate, while the rate negotiated by the insurance company was $700.\n\nAn insurance broker helped me sort through the options. I settled on a high-deductible plan, and filled out the long application. I diligently listed the various minor complaints for which we had been seen over the years, knowing that these might turn up later and be a basis for revoking coverage if they were not disclosed.\n\nThen the first letter arrived — denied. It never occurred to me that we would be denied! Yes, we had listed a bunch of minor ailments, but nothing serious. No cancer, no chronic diseases like asthma or diabetes, no hospital stays.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

For me, it was a corn on my toe for which my podiatrist had recommended an in-office procedure. My daughter was denied because she takes regular medication for a common teenage issue. My husband was denied because his ophthalmologist had identified a slow-growing cataract. Basically, if there is any possible procedure in your future, insurers will deny you.\n\nThe broker then proposed that the three of us make individual applications. Perhaps one or two of us might be accepted, rather than the family as a group.\n\nAs I filled out more applications, I discovered a critical error in my strategy. The first question was “Have you ever been denied health insurance”? Now my answer was yes, giving the new companies reason to be wary of my application. I learned too late that the best tactic is to apply simultaneously to as many companies as possible, so that you don’t have to admit to a denial.\n\nI completed four applications for each of the three of us, using reams of paper. I learned to read the questions carefully. I mulled over the difference between a “condition” and “something for which you have sought treatment.” I was precise and succinct. I felt as if I was doing a deposition: Give the minimum true information, and not a word more. I was accepted by exactly one insurance company. So was my daughter, although at a 50 percent premium over the standard charge for a girl her age. My husband was also accepted by one insurer but was denied by the company that approved me.\n\nOur premiums, which were reasonable at first, have increased substantially over the last six years; the average annual increase has been 20 percent. I now am paying premiums that are more than double what they were initially. And because these are high-deductible policies, we still are paying most of the medical bills ourselves.\n\nThe new health care reform legislation is not perfect. Nothing that complex could be. But I have no doubt that the system is broken and reform is absolutely essential. If we are not going to have universal coverage but are going to rely on employer plans, then we must offer individuals, self-employed people and small businesses a place to purchase insurance at a reasonable price.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf members of Congress feel so strongly about undoing this important legislation, perhaps we should stop providing them with health insurance. Let’s credit their pay for the amount that has been paid by the taxpayers, and let them try to buy health insurance in the individual market. My bet is that they all would be denied. Health insurance reform might suddenly not seem to them like such a bad idea.",
  "latent_32343": "The November 7 cut off date to have your say on same-sex marriage is looming. Let's take a look at where we're at.\n\nIt's not over yet 0:52\n\nIT’S bigger than Brexit: Percentage-wise, more Australians have now cast their votes in the $122 million same-sex marriage survey than the Brits did for Brexit.\n\nThey thought voting would slow to a trickle, but now, almost three-quarters of Aussies have had their say.\n\nAlmost 12 million survey forms have been returned as campaigners from both sides of the debate make a final push urging people to vote.\n\nAlmost 16 million forms were sent out in September, and 11.9 million (74.5 per cent) of them have been returned, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) estimated figures revealed today.\n\nThe Brexit return rate was 72.2 per cent.\n\nForm scanning is now under way at the ABS, so today’s figures are based on a count of forms scanned, rather than earlier estimates that were based on the weight of the bulk containers of returned forms waiting to be scanned.\n\nBecause of this, the ABS says the number of returned surveys is up more than 300,000 from last week, not the one million today’s result seems to show.\n\nThis Friday, October 27, is the recommended deadline for mailing votes to ensure they are received by the ABS by the November 7 closing date.\n\nThe last day votes can be received by the ABS is in a fortnight: November 7.\n\nResults of the postal survey will be released on November 15.\n\nABS deputy Australian statistician and taskforce lead, Jonathan Palmer, said people should send back their completed survey forms in the reply paid envelope right away.\n\n“We’d like to ensure we have the highest participation rate possible for this voluntary survey,” he said.\n\n“We strongly recommend that you post back your completed forms straight away and certainly no later than 27 October to make sure you have your say.”\n\nMany believe the Yes vote will prevail as polls have suggested most Australians support same-sex marriage, and the Yes campaign has welcomed today’s ABS figures.\n\n“This is incredible, it’s such a wonderful sign of how seriously people take this issue and an incredible reflection on the Australian people who have understood the power of this vote,” Equality Campaign director Tiernan Brady said.\n\nThe most recent poll showed almost 60 per cent of those who had already voted had ticked Yes.\n\nBut this lead has steadily been decreasing over the course of the campaign, with Yes campaigners now focusing on “lazy” Yes voters to have their say.\n\nThey worry that about two million people under the age of 35, most of who say they would vote Yes, who have yet to actually cast their vote.\n\n“There is no room for complacency and no reason to think someone else’s vote will win this,” Brady said.\n\nMeanwhile No campaigners dispute the latest polls.\n\n“The reality is that support for gay marriage has never been what the yes campaign has claimed,” a Coalition for Marriage spokesman said.\n\n“There are still millions of Australians who are yet to vote in this survey. We are going for every last one. If they, like so many others, are tired of the bullying tactics of the Yes camp, then they should make sure they vote ‘no’ and return their ballots as soon as possible.”\n\nProportionally, more Australians have now voted in the postal survey than Americans in the election that saw Donald Trump become president; or Irish who voted in that country’s same-sex marriage referendum, and in the UK’s Brexit..\n\nKEY DATES\n\n• The ABS recommends you post your vote by Friday 27 October.\n\n• Survey forms must be received at the ABS by 6pm (local time) on November 7 to be included in the count.\n\n• Survey results will be published on November 15.\n\n• More information is available at www.marriagesurvey.abs.gov.au",
  "latent_32717": "Canada is preparing to embark on a far-reaching program of financial surveillance of senior public officeholders, from Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Governor-General David Johnston and Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin down to thousands of elected politicians and senior bureaucrats.\n\nMany who will be affected by the program are unaware of what is coming. One who is aware, retired Supreme Court justice Louise Arbour, is stunned by its reach to her children.\n\nIn a little-known law that Parliament has already passed, these officeholders are known as \"politically exposed persons\" and deemed at risk of being involved in corruption, money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Financial institutions, from banks and insurance companies to investment dealers and real estate brokers, will be required to keep special tabs on them. And not only them, but on their children, other family members and \"close associates.\"\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe law, part of a Conservative budget omnibus bill last year, has not taken effect yet. It awaits cabinet approval of regulations that will set out its precise scope.\n\nThose regulations propose a vast reach: For 20 years after the politically exposed persons (PEPs) leave office, the financial institutions will need to keep their eyes on them, their family and associates. The financial institutions' first job is to identify the PEPs; then to assess their risk; and then, if the institutions determine the PEPs are a high risk – there is little public explanation on how the banks are expected to do this – they will need to monitor the PEPs' account activity. The institutions will need to report suspicious activity (anything they suspect is connected to terrorism or money laundering) to a federal intelligence agency known as Fintrac, which investigates and can turn over files to the Mounties or the Canada Revenue Agency.\n\nThe law also reaches back 20 years to former senior office holders, such as prime ministers Paul Martin and Jean Chrétien, their children, relatives and associates. (Mr. Martin said through an aide that he has never heard of the law.)\n\nThe law is raising questions about how to protect against corruption in the political offices of the nation without making unwarranted or arbitrary incursions on former office-holders' privacy and the privacy of their children, spouses and associates. Just last month, a judge sentenced Lise Thibault, a former Quebec lieutenant-governor, to 18 months in prison for fraud and breach of trust. Separately, Quebec's Charbonneau Commission revealed corruption in the province's construction industry, affecting high-level politicians and senior bureaucrats. And the Senate has been roiled by allegations of financial misdeeds, with one member, Mike Duffy, currently on trial. (The new PEP law covers the Senate and members of federal and provincial legislatures. It also covers mayors.)\n\n\"I think corruption is growing by leaps and bounds,\" Garry Clement, a former national director of the RCMP's proceeds of crime program, said in an interview. \"It's far greater than people are willing to accept.\"\n\nThe law also raises questions about the financial costs, which some say will be in the millions of dollars, perhaps tens of millions, each year that will be borne by each large financial institution, and ultimately by the consumers.\n\nSome question how effective the law will be. Canada has had a similar law in place since 2008 covering foreign PEPs – senior officeholders who work on behalf of foreign countries, or merely in them, such as ambassadors – and a Senate report two years ago found that no foreign PEP had been caught laundering money because of the provisions, according to Matthew McGuire, a member of an anti-money laundering advisory committee to the federal finance department.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"It's a wide net that catches very few fish,\" Mr. McGuire said in an interview, of the law that will cover domestic PEPs. He said 31,000 financial entities in Canada will have monitoring responsibilities under the law.\n\nFinance Minister Joe Oliver stressed Canada's international obligations to combat money laundering, in a statement to The Globe: \"Money laundering has become a serious global problem, which is why it is being dealt with by the International Financial Action Task Force, which includes 36 member countries, including all G7 member countries. Canada has a strong anti-money laundering regime that meets international standards. The principles of our regime are based on IFATF guidelines.\"\n\nIn 2012, the Financial Action Task Force, to which Canada belongs, required its members to include domestic PEPs in their anti-money-laundering rules.\n\nThe law also raises questions about governance. The measures were contained in Bill C-31, formally known by the title \"An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on February 11, 2014 and other measures.\" The 359-page bill's lengthy summary mentions amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act, but says nothing about PEPs. There was not a single mention of PEPs in House of Commons debates on the budget bill, a Globe and Mail review found. There were just two brief mentions at meetings of the finance committee. It also passed unnoticed by Canadian newspapers.\n\nThe little-known 2008 law on foreign PEPs has also come as an unpleasant surprise to some of those it has affected. Ontario sisters Catherine and Emilie Taman both said in interviews they received mysterious phone calls from their separate banks, asking intrusive questions. (Emilie Taman is running for the New Democratic Party in an Ottawa riding in the federal election.) Catherine's banker eventually explained why: Her mother was a foreign PEP. The Taman sisters' mother is Ms. Arbour, who apart from being a retired Supreme Court judge is also a former international war-crimes prosecutor and a former United Nations human rights commissioner. Catherine said when she refused to answer the questions (on her mother's advice), her account was frozen, which she discovered when she tried to use her bank card in a restaurant. A letter she provided to The Globe showed her bank asking questions such as, \"From whom/where are you getting money?\" \"How did you accumulate your wealth/net worth?\"\n\nHow the banks knew the Taman sisters were Ms. Arbour's daughters was a mystery to all three women, but experts contacted by The Globe say a small group of private companies provide lists of foreign PEPs and their families, and banks run new customers through those computerized lists, for a fee. There are similar lists for domestic PEPs.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn a commentary published in Thursday's Globe, Ms. Arbour calls the program a \"useless bureaucratic nightmare,\" and says that her children should be left alone by their bankers.\n\nOthers, however, say it is an important tool in fighting corruption in high places. The banks are circumspect about the new requirements. The Royal Bank of Canada referred questions to the Canadian Bankers Association. That association said, in a written reply to The Globe's questions, \"Generally, banks will determine if a client is a politically exposed domestic person (PEDP) or a family member of a PEDP, assess the risk of the individual and monitor their account as appropriate. Each bank would have its own policies and procedures and would assess the risks based on each individual situation.\"\n\nMichelle Alexander, a spokeswoman for the Investment Industry Association of Canada, said her group has asked the government to reduce the law's reach to five years forward and back, from 20. It has also asked for clarification of the term \"close associate.\"\n\n\"I used to work with Joe Oliver. He was my boss many years ago. Am I a close associate?\"\n\nPC Financial letter to client"
