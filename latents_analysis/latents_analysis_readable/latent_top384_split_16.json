The researchers then shine a black light on it, which emits long-wave ultraviolet light that look bluish-purple (and make anything white-ish, including your teeth, seem to glow). When the UV light hits the titanium dioxide, it produces a reaction that neutralizes the odors, breaking up the smelly gases into smaller particles that don’t stink as much.\n\nJacek Koziel, an associate professor of agricultural and biosystems engineering, and his team are seeing great promise using photocatalysis in lab settings in the realm of reducing various stink-producing compounds, like dimethyl trisulfide and butyric acid, by 40 to 100 percent. The results have also been pretty good in limited real-world testing at a Northeast Iowa pig farm, with a 16 percent total reduction of foul odors, according to the researchers.\n\nBesides its stinky odor, farm animals waste is also bad for the environment since it releases greenhouse gases, like nitrous oxide, into the atmosphere, among other issues. According to Koziel, their system also reduced nitrous oxide emissions by nine percent.\n\n“That’s actually quite puzzling, but if that holds true in more replicated experiments and in whole facilities, that would be an awesome finding,” he told The Ames Tribune.\n\nThe researchers’ next step is more complete real-world testing at Iowa pig farms, including coating barn ceilings and walls with the titanium dioxide and hitting it with black light. Koziel says it’s important to study the system outside the lab since conditions – like air flow – differ from one livestock facility to another. If the testing continues to go well, the research team plans to bring the system to market with their industrial partner, Pureti Group LLC, which produces the titanium dioxide coating.\n\nSaveSave\n\nSaveSave\n\nSaveSave",
  "latent_110": "Wolfenstein II The New Colossus\n\nPC graphics performance/analysis review\n\nIt's time to check out that PC release of Wolfenstein II The New Colossus for Windows relative towards graphics card performance with the latest AMD/NVIDIA graphics card drivers. Multiple graphics cards are being tested and benchmarked. We have a look at performance with the newest graphics cards and technologies.\n\nNote: before we begin a disclaimer - Wolfenstein II The New Colossus will not sit well with everybody in relation to the Nazi theme and visuals, the intense gore levels and really, some disgusting things that will happen in the game. If you cannot stomach it or do not like the theme, please stop reading this review and move onwards to a game that suits you.\n\nThat said, welcome to this review. Wolfenstein II The New Colossus is unique in the sense that it isn't a DirectX 3D title, it is based 100% and solely running on the Vulkan API. And that works out really well for this AMD sponsored title, as well as their graphics cards. Wolfenstein II The New Colossus for PC offers pretty nice graphics quality, proper CPU utilization and if you want to, super high framerates. We'll test the game on the PC platform relative towards graphics card performance with the AMD/NVIDIA graphics card drivers. Multiple graphics cards are being tested and benchmarked with the latest cards such as the GeForce GTX 10 series included as well as the latest Radeon RX series 500 and Vega graphics cards. You are going to need a reasonably modern PC with at least a mainstream graphics card to run the game nicely. We test with the game based on the final release for PC / Windows from this week, all patched up combined with latest AMD Radeon Software Crimson ReLive and Nvidia drivers.\n\nThis article will cover benchmarks in the sense of average framerates, we'll look at all popular resolutions scaling from Full HD (1920x1080/1200), WQHD (2560x1440) and of course Ultra HD. UHDTV (2160p) is 3840 pixels wide by 2160 pixels tall (8.29 megapixels), which is four times as many pixels as 1920x1080 (2.07 megapixels).",

Orexin A is part of the orexinergic system and it helps regulate the sleep-wake cycle by increasing arousal levels and maintaining wakefulness. A relationship between the orexinergic system and the AD neurodegenerative process has been examined in a few studies with conflicting results.\n\nHow the Study Was Conducted: The authors sought to evaluate the possible involvement of the orexinergic system by measuring CSF orexin levels in untreated AD patients and comparing them with healthy controls, as well as examining the role of the orexinergic system in sleep impairment in patients with AD. They measured CSF levels of orexin, the AD biomarkers tau proteins and β-amyloid 1-42, as well as assessing sleep variables (including total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep onset, rapid eye movement [REM] and non-REM sleep stages). The study from August 2012 through May 2013 included 48 untreated patients: 21 patients were included in the mild AD group and 27 were classified as having moderate to severe AD. There also was a group of 29 healthy controls.\n\nResults: Patients with moderate to severe AD presented with higher average orexin levels compared with controls and they had more impaired sleep compared with controls and patients with mild AD. In the overall AD group, orexin levels were associated with total tau protein levels and sleep impairment. Cognitive impairment was associated with sleep deterioration.\n\nDiscussion: “Our study has shown that, in AD, increased CSF orexin levels are linked to a parallel sleep deterioration, which appears to be related to cognitive decline. Hence, our results demonstrate that, in AD, orexinergic output and function seem to be overexpressed with disease progression and severity, possibly owing to an imbalance in the neurotransmitter networks regulating the wake-sleep cycle toward the orexinergic system promoting wakefulness.”\n\n(JAMA Neurol.

In particular, other studies on the role of arousal, sleep alterations and orexin in the pathogenesis of AD could suggest new preventive/therapeutic approaches,” he concludes.\n\n(JAMA Neurol.

  "latent_212": "Twilight Zone: The Movie is a 1983 American science fiction horror anthology film produced by Steven Spielberg and John Landis as a cinematic interpretation of the 1959–64 TV series created by Rod Serling. The film stars Vic Morrow, Scatman Crothers, Kathleen Quinlan and John Lithgow with Dan Aykroyd and Albert Brooks in the prologue segment. Burgess Meredith, who starred in four episodes of the original series, took on Serling's position as narrator. In addition to Meredith, six actors from the original series (William Schallert, Kevin McCarthy, Bill Mumy, Murray Matheson, Peter Brocco, and Patricia Barry) had roles in the film.\n\nThe film is a remake of three classic episodes of the original series and includes one original story. Landis directed the prologue and the first segment, Spielberg directed the second, Joe Dante the third, and George Miller directed the final segment. Dante recalled that in the film's original conception the four stories would be interwoven with characters from one segment appearing in another segment, but later problems with the film precluded this.[3]\n\nThe film garnered notoriety before its release for the stunt helicopter crash which took the lives of Vic Morrow and two child actors, Myca Dinh Le and Renee Shin-Yi Chen, during the filming of the segment directed by Landis. The two child actors were hired illegally.[4] Their deaths led to a high-profile legal case, although at the end of the trial no one was found to be criminally culpable for the accident.[5]\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nTwo men are in a car driving along a lonely country road very late at night. The conversation turns to what episodes of The Twilight Zone they found most scary. The passenger then asks, \"Do you want to see something really scary?\" and says to pull over. He turns into a monster and attacks the driver.\n\nCast\n\nAlbert Brooks as the Driver\n\nDan Aykroyd as the Passenger\n\nThe film's narrator, Burgess Meredith, then recites the season 4 opening narration of The Twilight Zone:\n\nYou unlock this door with a key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension; a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, and a dimension of mind. You are moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. You have just crossed over into The Twilight Zone.\n\nThe opening narration for the film's only original segment borrows from \"What You Need\" and \"A Nice Place to Visit\":\n\nYou're about to meet an angry man: Mr. William Connor, who carries on his shoulder a chip the size of the national debt. This is a sour man, a lonely man, who's tired of waiting for the breaks that come to others, but never to him. Mr. William Connor, whose own blind hatred is about to catapult him into the darkest corner of The Twilight Zone.\n\nBill Connor is bitter after being passed over for a promotion in favor of a Jewish co-worker. Drinking in a bar after work with his friends, Bill utters slurs towards Jewish people, black people, and Asian people. A Black man sitting nearby asks him to stop. Bill leaves the bar angrily, but when he walks outside, he finds himself in Nazi-occupied France during World War II. A pair of SS officers patrolling the streets interrogate him. Bill cannot answer satisfactorily since he does not speak German. A chase ensues, and Bill ends up on the ledge of a building, where he is shot at by the officers.\n\nHe falls from the ledge and lands in the rural South during the 1950s. There a group of Ku Klux Klansmen sees him as an African-American man, whom they are about to lynch. Bill vehemently tells them he is white, to no avail. While trying to escape, he jumps into a lake and surfaces in a jungle during the Vietnam War, being fired at by American soldiers, one of whom throws a grenade. Instead of killing him, the grenade launches him into occupied France again. There he is captured by the SS officers and put into an enclosed railroad freight car, along with Jewish prisoners. Bill sees the bar with his friends standing outside looking for him. He screams for help, but they cannot see him or the train as it pulls away.\n\nCast\n\nNote: Originally, this segment was to end with Bill returning to his own time after redeeming himself by saving the lives of two Vietnamese children during a helicopter raid on their village. The aforementioned scene was dropped due to the death of Morrow and two child actors during filming.\n\n\"Kick the Can\" [ edit ]\n\nThe second segment is a remake of the episode \"Kick the Can\". The narrator starts with this monologue:\n\nIt is sometimes said that where there is no hope, there is no life. Case in point: the residents of Sunnyvale Rest Home, where hope is just a memory. But hope just checked into Sunnyvale, disguised as an elderly optimist, who carries his magic in a shiny tin can.\n\nAn old man named Mr. Bloom has just moved into Sunnyvale Retirement Home. He listens to the other elders reminisce about the joys they experienced in their youth. Mr. Bloom says just because they are old does not mean they cannot enjoy life anymore. He tells them that later that night, he will wake them and that they can join him in a game of kick the can. Leo Conroy objects, saying that now that they are all old they cannot engage in physical activity.\n\nWhile Mr. Conroy sleeps, Mr. Bloom gathers the rest of the residents outside and plays the game, during which they are transformed into childhood versions of themselves. They are ecstatic to be young again and engage in activities they enjoyed long ago, but their thoughts soon turn to practical matters such as where they will spend the night, since they will no longer be welcomed in the retirement home and their families won't recognize them. They ask to be old again. Mr. Bloom grants their wish. Leo Conroy wakes up and witnesses one resident, Mr. Agee, who still remains young, and asks for Agee to take him along. Agee tells Conroy that he cannot go with him.\n\nThe segment ends with Conroy kicking a can around the yard, having changed his attitude on life, while Mr. Bloom leaves Sunnyvale and moves into another retirement home, to spread his good-natured magical skills to other senior citizens.\n\nCast\n\n\"It's a Good Life\" [ edit ]\n\nThe third segment is a remake of the episode \"It's a Good Life\". The name of the main character Helen Foley is from the episode \"Nightmare as a Child\". The opening narration is borrowed, in part, from \"Night Call\":\n\nPortrait of a woman in transit: Helen Foley, age 27. Occupation: schoolteacher. Up until now, the pattern of her life has been one of unrelenting sameness, waiting for something different to happen. Helen Foley doesn't know it yet, but her waiting has just ended.\n\nHelen Foley, traveling to a new job, visits a rural bar for directions. While talking to the owner, she witnesses Anthony—a young boy playing an arcade game—being harassed by a local. Helen comes to the boy's defense. As Helen leaves the bar, she backs into Anthony with her car in the parking lot, damaging his bicycle. Helen offers Anthony a ride home.\n\nWhen Helen arrives with Anthony at home, she meets his family: Uncle Walt, sister Ethel, and mother and father. Anthony's family are excessively welcoming. Anthony starts to show Helen around the house, while the family rifles through Helen's purse and coat. There is a television set in every room showing cartoons. She comes to the room of another sister, Sara. Helen calls out to the girl, who is in a wheelchair and watching television, and gets no response. Anthony explains that Sara had been in an accident; Helen isn't able to see that the girl has no mouth.\n\nAnthony announces that it is time for dinner, which consists of ice cream, candy apples, potato chips, and hamburgers topped with peanut butter. Confused at first at how the family eats, Helen thinks that this is a birthday dinner for Anthony. Ethel complains at the prospect of another birthday; Anthony glares at her, and her plate flies out of her hands. Helen attempts to leave, but Anthony urges Helen to stay and see Uncle Walt's \"hat trick\". A top hat appears on top of the television set. Uncle Walt is very nervous about what could be in the hat, but he pulls out an ordinary rabbit. Anthony insists on more, and a large, mutant rabbit springs from the hat. As Helen attempts to flee, she spills the contents of her purse, and Anthony finds a note inside stating \"Help us! Anthony is a monster!\" When the family points the finger at Ethel, she reveals to Helen that they are not Anthony's real relatives; Anthony brought them to his house to be his surrogate family after he killed his parents, and presumably he is doing the same with Helen. In punishment for writing the note, Anthony puts Ethel into the television set where she is pursued and eaten by cartoon monsters.\n\nHelen attempts to escape only to have the door blocked by a giant eye. Anthony vents his frustration at everyone being afraid of him. He makes the entire house disappear, taking himself and Helen outside the physical plane of existence. Anthony says that he sent his \"family\" back where they came from, since they didn't want to be with him. He cannot understand why everyone is unhappy with him, since he believes he provided for their every possible desire.\n\nHelen offers to be Anthony's teacher, and help him find new uses for his power. After extracting a promise that she would never leave him, Anthony welcomes Helen's offer and makes her car reappear. As they drive through a desert landscape, meadows filled with bright flowers spring up alongside the road in the car's wake.\n\nCast\n\n\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\" [ edit ]\n\nThe fourth segment is a remake of the episode \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\". Its opening narration is borrowed, in part, from \"In His Image\":\n\nWhat you're looking at could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare. It isn't. It's the beginning. Introducing Mr. John Valentine, air traveler. His destination: The Twilight Zone.\n\nWhile flying through a violent thunderstorm, airline passenger John Valentine is in an airplane lavatory as he tries to recover from a panic attack due to a fear of flying. The flight attendants coax Valentine from the lavatory and back to his seat.\n\nValentine notices a hideous gremlin on the wing of the plane and begins to spiral into another severe panic. He watches as the creature wreaks havoc on the wing, damaging the plane's engine. Valentine finally snaps and attempts to break the window with an oxygen canister, but is wrestled to the ground by another passenger (an off-duty security guard). Valentine takes the passenger's gun, shoots out the window (causing a breach in the pressurized cabin), and begins firing at the gremlin. This only serves to catch the attention of the gremlin, who rushes up to Valentine and destroys the gun. After they notice that the plane is landing, the gremlin grabs Valentine's face, then simply scolds him for spoiling its fun by wagging its finger in his face. The creature leaps into the sky as the airplane begins its emergency landing.\n\nThe police, crew, and passengers write off Valentine as insane. However, the aircraft maintenance crew arrives and finds the damage to the plane's engines complete with claw marks, while a straitjacketed Valentine is carried off in an ambulance.\n\nCast\n\nThe ambulance driver is the car passenger from the prologue. The driver turns to Valentine and says \"Heard you had a big scare up there, huh? Wanna see something really scary?\" The scene fades out to a starry night sky accompanied by Rod Serling's opening monologue from the first season of The Twilight Zone:\n\nThere is a fifth dimension, beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call The Twilight Zone.\n\nHelicopter accident [ edit ]\n\nDuring the filming of the \"Time Out\" segment directed by Landis on July 23, 1982, at around 2:30 a.m., actor Vic Morrow and child actors Myca Dinh Le (age 7) and Renee Shin-Yi Chen (Chinese: 陳欣怡; pinyin: Chén Xīnyí, age 6) died in an accident involving a helicopter being used on the set. The two child actors were hired in violation of California law, which prohibits child actors from working at night or in proximity to explosions, and requires the presence of a teacher or social worker. During the subsequent trial, the illegality of the children's hiring was admitted by the defense, with Landis admitting culpability for that (but not the accident), and admitting that their hiring was \"wrong\".[4]\n\nIn the scene that served as the original ending, Morrow's character was to have traveled back through time again and stumbled into a deserted Vietnamese village where he finds two young Vietnamese children left behind when a U.S. Army helicopter appears and begins shooting at them. Morrow was to take both children under his arms and escape out of the village as the hovering helicopter destroyed the village with multiple explosions which would have led to his character's redemption. The helicopter pilot had trouble navigating through the fireballs created by pyrotechnic effects for the sequence. A technician on the ground did not know this and detonated two of the pyrotechnic charges close together. The flash-force of the two explosions caused the low-flying helicopter to spin out of control and crash land on top of Morrow and the two children as they were crossing a small pond away from the village mock-up. All three were killed instantly; Morrow and Le were decapitated by the helicopter's top rotor blades while Chen was crushed to death by one of the struts. A report released in May 1984 by the National Transportation Safety Board stated:[6]\n\nThe probable cause of the accident was the detonation of debris-laden high-temperature special effects explosions too near a low-flying helicopter leading to foreign object damage to one rotor blade and delamination due to heat to the other rotor blade, the separation of the helicopter's tail rotor assembly, and the uncontrolled descent of the helicopter. The proximity of the helicopter (around 25 feet off the ground) to the special effects explosions was due to the failure to establish direct communications and coordination between the pilot, who was in command of the helicopter operation, and the film director, who was in charge of the filming operation.[7]\n\nThe deaths were recorded on film from at least three different camera angles. As a result of Morrow's death, the remaining few scenes of the segment could not be filmed and all of the scenes that were filmed involving the two Vietnamese children, portrayed by Myca and Renee, were deleted from the final cut of the segment.[8]\n\nMyca and Renee were being paid under the table to circumvent California's child labor laws. California did not allow children to work at night. Landis opted not to seek a waiver. The casting agents were unaware that the children would be involved in the scene. Associate producer George Folsey, Jr. told the children's parents not to tell any firefighters on set that the children were part of the scene, and also hid them from a fire safety officer who also worked as a welfare worker. A fire safety officer was concerned the blasts would cause a crash, but did not tell Landis of his concerns.[4][6]\n\nThe accident led to civil and criminal action against the filmmakers which lasted nearly a decade. Landis, Folsey, production manager Dan Allingham, pilot Dorcey Wingo and explosives specialist Paul Stewart were tried and acquitted on charges of manslaughter in a nine-month trial in 1986 and 1987.[4][9] As a result of the accident, second assistant director Andy House had his name removed from the credits and replaced with the pseudonym Alan Smithee.[4]\n\nRelease and reception [ edit ]\n\nTwilight Zone: The Movie opened on June 24, 1983 and received mixed reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated each segment individually, awarding them (on a scale of four stars): two for the prologue and first segment, one-and-a-half for the second, three-and-a-half stars for the third, and three-and-a-half for the final. Ebert noted that \"the surprising thing is, the two superstar directors are thoroughly routed by two less-known directors whose previous credits have been horror and action pictures... Spielberg, who produced the whole project, perhaps sensed that he and Landis had the weakest results, since he assembles the stories in an ascending order of excitement. Twilight Zone starts slow, almost grinds to a halt, and then has a fast comeback.\"[10] The New York Times' film critic Vincent Canby called the movie a \"flabby, mini-minded behemoth.\"[11]\n\nIn the modern day, critical reception is still divided; on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 61% \"fresh\" approval rating, based on 36 reviews, with a rating average of 5.8 out of 10. The critical consensus was \"The Twilight Zone: The Movie suffers from the typical anthology-film highs and lows; thankfully, the former outnumber the latter\". On Metacritic, the film has a score of 38 out of 100, based on six reviews, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\nAccording to Box Office Mojo, it opened at #4, grossing $6,614,366 in its opening weekend at 1,275 theaters, averaging $5,188 per theater (adjusting to $15,076,555 and a $11,825 average in 2009). It later expanded to 1,288 theaters and ended up grossing $29,450,919 (adjusting to $67,129,396 in 2009).[12] Having cost $10 million to make, it was not the enormous hit which executives were looking for, but it was still a financial success and it helped stir enough interest for CBS to give the go-ahead to the 1980s TV version of The Twilight Zone.\n\nIt was released to LaserDisc and VHS several times, most recently as part of WB's \"Hits\" line, and was released for DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray on October 9, 2007.\n\nNovelization [ edit ]\n\nRobert Bloch wrote the book adaptation of Twilight Zone: The Movie. Bloch's order of segments does not match the order in the film itself, as he was given the original screenplay to work with, in which \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\" was the second segment, and \"Kick the Can\" was the fourth. Both the movie's prologue and epilogue are missing in the novelization. Bloch claimed that no one told him the anthology had a wraparound sequence. Bloch also said that in the six weeks he was given to write the book, he only saw a screening of two of the segments; he had to hurriedly change the ending of the first segment, after the helicopter accident that occurred during filming.[13] As originally written, the first segment would have ended as it did in the original screenplay (Connor finds redemption by saving two Vietnamese children whose village is being destroyed by the Air Cavalry). The finished book reflects how the first segment ends in the final cut of the film.\n\nSoundtrack [ edit ]\n\nJerry Goldsmith, who scored several episodes of the original series, composed the music for the movie and re-recorded Marius Constant's series theme. The original soundtrack album was released by Warner Bros.

  "latent_232": "Tim Truman: The Interview\n\nby Michael Hutchison FANZING : First of all, thanks for granting us an interview! For those in our audience who may only know you from your most recent DC/Vertigo Jonah Hex mini-series, why don't you recap some of your more prominent projects, DC and otherwise? TIM TRUMAN : Thanks for inviting me. Well, I was pretty lucky getting started, in that my first regular feature (no pun intended) really put me on the map. The character was Grimjack for First comics (written by John Ostrander ). Grimjack started out as a monthly backup in Mike Grell's Starslayer, and proved to be an overnight success. The term \"grim and gritty\" was initially coined in the Grimjack lettercolumn \"Spill Yer Guts.\" It was one of a handful of books that helped usher in a whole age of hyper-violent, down and dirty comics, and set the stage for books like Marvel's Punisher.\n\nAfter that I did Scout and Scout: War Shaman with Eclipse comics. I'm very proud of that series, and along with Grimjack it's really what secured a sizable fan readership for me, for which I'm very thankful. I started my own company, 4Winds Publishing, and published several works that had only been seen in South America and Europe, as well as Sam Glanzman's science fantasy, Attu. With 4 Winds I produced an intensively researched biography of Simon Girty, a Revolutionary War renegade who defected to the British and fought alongside the Indians. The two-book series book was called Wilderness and it was incredibly successful-- especially outside the comic book market! I reprinted it three times-- twice with 4Winds and once via Eclipse. Wilderness is a real cult item with historians and historical re-enactors. Original copies of the two signed and numbered hard cover editions now sell through antiquarian book sites for $500. Luckily, it's about to be reprinted again, by my friend Roger Broughton in Canada. Roger is also reprinting a book that I did with Tim Bradstreet for serialization in Europe, Dragon Chiang, a science fiction tale about an ass-kicking Chinese Communist truck driver. I still think it's some of my best writing and drawing, and Bradstreet did an amazing job inking my penciled art. Dragon Chaing was translated and published in the US by Eclipse. However, as the book was announced when Eclipse was in dire straits, it had a really small print run the first time out. I'm really glad that it's going to see light of day again in a month or two. People are always asking Tim and me for it at cons. It's a rare commodity, in it's original form. Another of my favorites that I did during this time was the revamping of the old pulp character the Spider for Eclipse. At about this same time I did the three issue Hawkworld miniseries for DC comics, which re-introduced Hawkman character to the DC universe. Hawkworld won the European Haxtur award for Best Comic-- something I'm quite proud of and which few people know about. After Hawkworld I worked on a series of collaborations with horror and suspense novelist Joe R. Lansdale. The first of these was Jonah Hex: Two Gun Mojo. This book really helped make western comics viable again, and I'm proud to have been associated with the books. Joe's writing style really shook a lot of comic book writers up and introduced a whole new way of language and writing to the medium. Frankly, I think a lot of people have tried to ape Joe's style and have never really quite gotten the point yet. No one does Joe better than Joe. Joe and I also did Lone Ranger and Tonto, a book that earned the ire of Rush Limbaugh and the praise of Native American Rights groups, due to our portrayal of Tonto as-- well, as a regular guy! I've done several things with the Grateful Dead -- limited edition tour t-shirts, tour banners, and the like. I was the only artist to appear in every issue of the Kitchen Sink Grateful Dead Comix series. Some of my best illustrating has been for the Dead and the post-Dead aggregations. Few folks in comics know that I do a full color, tabloid sized Comix Page for the Grateful Dead Almanac every three months! The Comix Pages are written by lyricist Robert Hunter -- one of my favorite people on Earth. More people probably see these strips than any other of my work. Over 100,000 people receive the Almanac. It's free--- just go to Dead.net and you can see the old ones, and sign up for a quarterly mailing (Don't worry-- the Dead organization doesn't sell your name to spammers!). My association with Hunter continued with the graphic novel Dog Moon, which he wrote and I drewfor Vertigo/DC. Dog Moon is a truly beautifully written piece of work. I did an authorized biography of Carlos Santana, one of my favorite guitarists. As it turned out, he's a big fan of my Scout comic. More recent projects have been Black Lamb for DC's Helix line, Turok for Acclaim or Valiant or whatever they are now, plus the Kents and Guns of the Dragon for DC's regular line. Now, I'm writing Dark Horse's regular Star Wars comic. Lucasfilm recently astounded me by requesting that I become the permanent writer for the book. Very flattering and gratifying, I must say. I was floored. I got to do the Anakin one-shot, which was also an honor to be chosen to do. I'm more pleased with these various Star Wars stories than just about any I've ever written. I'm also writing, penciling and inking a book for them called Aurra Sing: Bounty Hunter, based on one of Lucasfilm's new characters. I've just done a couple of new things with my big brother Joe R. Lansdale: An 8 pager called Brer Hoodoo -- a horror take on both the Uncle Remus stories and the Robert Johnson crossroads legend.; a cover for a limited edition collection of short stories and excerpts called Vale's Visit; and a story for the CBLDF Benefit book, Murder by Crowquill. By the way, fans who haven't seen my new work this year are going to be in for what will hopefully be a pleasant surprise. My drawing style has been going through some heavy changes, becoming super detailed and more ornate. I'm really excited by it-- and more in love with drawing and the comics medium than ever before. FANZING : Like most people on David Letterman and Saturday Night Live, you're here because you have something to plug. But before we get to \"Creature Commandos\", let's talk a bit about you. Since all of your e-mails to me are signed \"The Truman Family\", I'm assuming you have one. What's family life like for a comic book creator? TIM : Busy! I try to balance my family life with my professional life and my very bad music habit. I have a wonderful family. We're also wonderfully crazy. Things get pretty exciting around here sometimes. I'm just glad that I got to stay at home and watch the kids growing up. I have a lot of memories that a lot of parents miss, the modern times being what they are. FANZING : How did you get into the industry, and what was your first professional project? TIM : I came into comics from the role playing games industry. My first professional comic book projects were Starslayer and Grimjack for First comics. They needed a guy who could help invent a new type of comic book tough guy. My portfolio was full of comic book tough guys-- seedy, unkempt mercenaries and warriors-- barbarian gunslingers who've hired Keith Richards as a tailor. FANZING : When did you know you wanted to be an artist (assuming you were an artist before you were a writer)? TIM : My mom says I've been drawing ever since I could hold a pencil. So I guess that's when it started. It sounds romantic, but it's true: some of us don't have a choice. By all rights I shouldn't be drawing at all. I hold my pencil in a funny way-- what's called a \"tripod\" position. My teachers always berated me for it and tried to get me to hold a pencil normally, but I never caved in. I knew that it wasn't right for me, and that this was how I needed to hold a pencil for absolute control. I've recently discovered that this almost imperceptible tripod pencil grip is a classic sign of certain small motor problems that have to do with ADD and a very mild degree of Tourette Syndrome. Not a noticable thing to anyone who isn't a TS specialist, and something that won't get worse. However, it's something that might very well have affected my willingness to pursue drawing-- or even guitar playing-- as a way of life. I've talked to guys who've said that it's very rare for a person who holds their pencil in this way to become a practicing artist. Go figure. Looks like I was going to draw no matter what. FANZING : What do you do for fun when you get away from the art studio? TIM : I play music with my band. I haunt guitar stores like comics fans haunt comics stores. I trade guitars and amps. I restore old guitars. I collect CD's. Just about all my leisure activities involve music. FANZING : You've worked on Jonah Hex twice now, I believe. Why do you like Hex? TIM : Three times actually. I like Hex because he sort of served as a template for me, for what I wanted to do in comics. I never really like superheroes that much-- just a few who are more Science Fiction oriented, like Fantastic Four, Iron Man, SubMariner, Metamorpho, Eclipso and others like that. Generally speaking, super heroes always looked like some sort of gay Nazi statuary to me (no slam on gays intended-- I know many gay people who think the same thing!) I always like adventure stuff, or science fiction stuff. Creepy and Eerie were my textbooks when I was growing up. I collected comics-- or at least I bought them. We lived in some pretty rural areas. However, I liked Creepy and Eerie magazines the most-- and later, National Lampoon. Anyway, Hex looked like he'd be more at home in Creepy than in a color comic. He was drastic for his time-- just like the Hex that Joe and I do is a wee bit drastic for ours at least north of the Mason-Dixon Line. FANZING : And maybe you can answer this: why does Jonah's scar continue across the open space of his mouth? I've always wondered about that. TIM : You know what Hex would do to me if I'd tell you that? C'mon, man FANZING : What other DC characters would you like to work with in the future? TIM : Metamorpho. Eclipso. Claw the Unconquered (who appears in the last half of Creature Commandos, by the way), Captain Fear, in a big way. I got to do Guns of the Dragon, so that took care of two of them right there-- Enemy Ace and Bat Lash. I got to do a Gunner and Sarge story for Michael Golden when he edited the Sgt. Rock Special. And Gunner's in Creature Commandos (albeit a rather drastically altered gunner-- victim of the military industrial complex, and all that). OH, and Blackhawk and Challengers of the Unknown. I was BORN to do the Challengers! And just like Kirby wanted them to be done, too! I'd also like to do an Elseworlds with Batman set in Fritz Lang's Metropolis. I think somebody tried to do a Superman Elseworlds that way, but I seem to recall that it totally missed the Commie and Nazi elements big time.\n\nAnd I'd like to do an adult humor version of Fox and Crow. Just because if I said it to anyone, they'd say it couldn't be done. I love it when they say that! FANZING : Were you really friends with Gardner Fox (creator of numerous Silver Age characters)? Could you tell us about him and how you came to know him? TIM : I met him at a Gencon (role playing games convention) where he and I were both guests. I was walking by the cafeteria on my way back to the TSR artists' area and noticed this older gent and his wife sitting there, all alone. I said hello, and he gave me this big friendly smile. Somehow he looked out of place-- a rather dapper elderly gentleman, in the midst of these t-shirt-wearing role playing gamers. I asked someone who the old gent was. They said \"Oh, some writer. Gar Fox! \" I couldn't believe it. Here was the man who wrote the first fantasy novel I'd ever read: Kothar: Barbarian Swordsman. Here was a man whose work was quite possibly the reason I was at this con as a guest! I went over and introduced myself and told him as much: that he was the reason I fell in love with fantasy genre. He was a total gentleman--- lovely man, very warm and dignified. I gave him a print that I'd done of John Carter of Mars riding a thoat. A week later, I received a letter from him, thanking me. It was written on an old typewriter-- probably the same on he used to type the Kothar novel with-- at least I like to think so. Anyway, after that, we wrote each other quite frequently. I got to do one story with him, which appeared in my Killer Tales anthology for Eclipse. FANZING : Your Hawkworld mini-series was quite a re-working of the old Hawkman legend. I was surprised to read that it was actually intended to be a back-story for the old Katar Hol Hawkman which wouldn't contradict any of the old Silver Age stories. Are you disappointed that, once it was mostly out of your hands, it led to this mess of retroactive continuity that wiped out all the old Gardner Fox stories? And can you see any way to fix this mess, short of an \"it didn't happen\" solution? TIM : Yeah-- I'd been very reverent towards the source material, despite my take on things like the nature of heroes and on whose backs a Utopia would have to be built. My series would have established a new history that would still have worked hand in hand with the old continuity-- especially the Silver Age continuity. Guys like Tony Isabella and Don Thompson hated the series when it first came out. They were too used to reading comics, and I wasn't approaching the pacing of Hawkworld like a comic. Each book of the three books was a chapter in a science fiction novel. The character at the end of the series was not the same person we'd met at the beginning of the series-- event had changed him. We got to see the events and the changes in each chapter. I tried to write Scout this way, too. Few comics ever approach their characters in this manner, yet it's one of the most basic rules for novelists. Anyway, if they'd have just let us say that the events in the miniseries happened years before Katar came to Earth, everything would have been fine. Chronologically, it would have been 1) my series, set on Thanagar, explaining things like why Katar is such a weapons collector and student of the antiquities and how he came by his police training. Then would come 2) the DC stories that we've read before. All could remain more or less intact, despite my character revisions and 3) Katar and Shayera, modern day-- their continuities tied to both the old Silver Age stuff and to my miniseries. End of predicament. Instead, someone insisted that Katar and Shayera come to Earth in the weeks immediately following my series. It didn't work. It trashed too much continuity. Big predicament. My bud John Ostrander did the best with what they handed him. I served as a rather useless story and character consultant. FANZING : Creature Commandoes. This is a project you've been pitching and working for quite a while. What's the latest on the publishing schedule? When will it come out? Is this a mini-series or an ongoing project? Also, is this a DC or a Vertigo title? TIM : It's a regular DC title. I think it'll be out in the early fall. Check with DC editor Peter Tomasi for the exact date. FANZING : You say that these are not the cheesy old World War II Commandoes, yet there are a lot of similar elements. The team consists of a werewolf, a Frankenstein monster, a vampire and a harpy. Does this contradict or wipe out the earlier team, or do they take their name because of the remarkable similarity to the wartime characters? TIM : With Creature Commandos, I was NOT reverential to the source material, I have to say! Those stories certainly have their fans, God bless 'em all. However, to me they represent the lowest period in American comics-- silly stories, workmanlike art, horrible printing (plastic plates on thin newsprint!) They were one of the titles over which I just threw up my hands and quit reading comics for awhile. So I felt very safe doing my own thing. I did so with a vengeance-- both literally and figuratively! Illustrator Scott Eaton and I have created a clean slate that touches on the old series, but isn't explicitly tied to it. FANZING : From the artwork you sent to me I could detect your love for the Silver Age characters. We've got the \"Patchwork Man\" a name (if not the same character) from the pre-Moore Swamp Thing. And a redesigned Zazzala the Queen Bee (!) of all people, who was a semi-lame villainess in the old JLA. I don't think she's been seen since Elongated Man defeated her and joined the League back in JLA #105, and we're talking a quarter-century ago! How the heck did you choose to bring her back? TIM : Actually, Patchwork Man was the original character's name (refer to DC Who's Who ). As for Zazzala and the other bad guys, they were all chosen from the old Gar Fox and John Broome JLA stories. I went through the DC hardcover collections and started pickng out the most interesting inter-dimensional villains. Those who made the final cut were put in the series. FANZING : Anything else you'd like to tell us about Creature Commandoes? TIM : Only that Scot Eaton is going to tear people's heads off with the art. It's amazing-- especially so after the 3rd issue. By that time, I knew who the artist would be and I was able to write the story with Scot's style in mind. Very important for me. He's been on the scene a long time, but he's never really had anyone sort of tailor a story for him and him only. He's finally getting the recognition he deserves from the various editors and execs. They're treating him like some new young \"find,\" when in truth he's been drawing for them and other companies for years! Scot is the only artist who can draw this. You'll see why with issue 3 and those that follow (which are set on an inhospitable alien planet). FANZING : You are an active contributor to the Comic Book Defense Fund. Care to tell us a little about them and how you became involved? TIM : When one of the in-house legal execs was apparently busy giving DC some bad, bad advice about how to handle Joe and I during the Winter Bros. VS DC fiasco, [EDITOR'S NOTE: this refers to blues rockers Johnny and Edgar Winter, who sued when Tim's Book RIDERS OF THE WORM AND SUCH parodied them] the CBLDF stepped in to assist us. We'd already spent thousands of dollars over just two months with a separate lawyer. It was clear that we couldn't afford this much longer. Both Joe and I were investigating routes that would protect our families in case the money ran out, we lost our lawyer, and the salaried legal sharks that the Winters' had hired ate us for breakfast. They wouldn't have won-- the law was clearly on our side, protecting our rights as artists to comment on our society and things that influenced it. However, they would have chewed on us real good., I can guarantee that. I was selling my guitar collection and all the artwork that I'd amassed over the years-- tons of Toth, Heath, and Severin art, plus some of my own pieces that I considered personal milestones of some sort. For a while the CBLDF represented us without payment or expectation of payment. They really smoothed things out. In the end, DC and Time/Warner wholeheartedly backed us and supported our rights and their property. Warner's lawyers were amazing. The CBLDF helped us through a very tricky period, and helped all of us get into the same boat. I was very glad about this-- I really enjoyed working with DC. They've always treated me very professionally. FANZING : If you were a tree that could be uprooted by Superman and swung at an enemy, what kind of tree would you be? TIM : I'd want to be the tree that they made my Gibson Les Paul from. FANZING : What are your views on the current state of the comic book industry? TIM : I think that the Net holds the key to our prosperity. We can still cater to supporters of comics in a very direct way. There are still plenty of comics fans out there-- just like there are plenty of re-enactors and frontier history buffs who bought Wilderness and helped me sell out of three different printings. We really have to cater to the specialty market now. John Ostrander and I are investigating plans to do just that. More news as it develops! FANZING : Do you do any work outside of comic books? TIM : Yes, the aforementioned work for the Grateful Dead, mentioned above. I just did a T-shirt and a CD cover for them-- Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions, the '64 acoustic version of the group. I've done medicine show bottles for comedian Rev. Billy Wirtz -- a real nice ands incredibly funny southern humorist and musician. He's the Joe R. Lansdale of comedy. Grammy-winning fusion guitarist Jon Finn wants me to work on a project with him. I was consultant for the Turok video game. The bastards have owed me some royalties for awhile, by the way, for a couple of characters which I created. I've also designed characters for Universal Studios animation dept. and served as a historical consultant for some of their projects as well as for the outdoor drama, Tecumseh! (a play which I once adapted into comics form). I'd really like to illustrate a children's book some day, too. FANZING : If the comics industry collapsed tomorrow, what would you do? TIM : I'd still be drawing. I'd still be writing. But I'd sure be playing and fixing a lot more guitars! I'd sell art and self-produced limited edition comics on the NET and live happily ever after. FANZING : Finally, if you could BE a DC Comics superhero, who would it be? TIM : Spike of Sugar and Spike. He has ADD, too! Yep, Spike, without a doubt. All characters are  DC Comics\n\nThis column is © 1999 by Michael Hutchison.",
  "latent_425": "It should come as no surprise to college basketball fans that freshmen have come to possess a significant portion of the star power in the sport. Just look at this year’s NBA draft, where the first upperclassman was not selected until Duke sophomore Luke Kennard with 12th pick. So while some returning players will undoubtedly have a major impact in 2017–18 season, it’s important to get to know the new faces who may come to occupy the spotlight.\n\nWith that in mind, SI.com will be introducing you to the top 25 incoming freshmen in college basketball and breaking down the impact those players could have this season. We move to the No. 3 overall recruit, Texas’s Mohamed Bamba.\n\nWhat he means for Texas’s recruiting class\n\nNo other recruit in this class may do more to change the long-term trajectory of his program than Bamba. He chose the Longhorns over the nation’s two premier recruiters, Duke and Kentucky, as well as Michigan. Bamba would be tracking toward a top-five selection in the 2018 NBA draft regardless of which program he picked, but in Austin, he’ll have the opportunity to turbocharge Shaka Smart’s process of building Texas into a Big 12 power.\n\nBamba is the linchpin of the Longhorns’ haul, and they’re also adding four four-star 2018 prospects: point guard Matt Coleman, power forwards Jericho Sims and Royce Hamm and shooting guard Jase Febres.\n\nHow he fits\n\nThe Longhorns have room to fill in their frontcourt, with Shaquille Cleare graduating and Jarrett Allen heading to the NBA. But those specifics are beside the point: Bamba is too good to keep off the floor. The complexion of his game is such that he would be a valuable addition anywhere.\n\nBamba offers certain traits (rim protection, rebounding, the quickness to defend in space) that would prop up every team’s defense, and he’ll pitch in as a close-range finisher on offense, even if his skills are less developed on that end of the floor. Texas rated out in the top 25 nationally in adjusted points allowed per possession last season, according to Kenpom.com, and now the Longhorns are adding a player with the size, mobility and instincts to fundamentally alter the ways in which even elite opposing offenses will try to score on them. It is not inconceivable that Bamba will be one of the best defensive players in college basketball.\n\nTeam outlook\n\nBamba’s commitment was the first piece of great news Smart got in late May. The second was guard Andrew Jones’s decision to withdraw from the NBA draft pool. Those two developments will, almost certainly, ensure Texas tops the 11-win mark it posted during a disappointing 2016–17 campaign. Even with the departures of Allen, Cleare and leading scorer Tevin Mack (who transferred to Alabama), the Longhorns can set their sights on at least 20 victories (the total they posted in Smart’s first season in charge) and an NCAA tournament berth.\n\nPushing Kansas for the Big 12 title feels like a stretch, but Texas should battle West Virginia for second place in the conference.",
  "latent_471": "by\n\nMário Soares visto pelo jornalista António Marinho (actual Bastonário da Ordem dos Advogados, António Marinho e Pinto), no «Diário do Centro» de 15 de Março de 2000\n\nMÁRIO SOARES E ANGOLA\n\nA polémica em torno das acusações das autoridades angolanas segundo as quais Mário Soares e seu filho João Soares seriam dos principais beneficiários do tráfico de diamantes e de marfim levados a cabo pela UNITA de Jonas Savimbi, tem sido conduzida na base de mistificações grosseiras sobre o comportamento daquelas figuras políticas nos últimos anos.\n\nEspanta desde logo a intervenção pública da generalidade das figuras políticas do país, que vão desde o Presidente da República até ao deputado do Bloco de Esquerda, Francisco Louçã, passando pelo PP de Paulo Portas e Basílio Horta, pelo PSD de Durão Barroso e por toda a sorte de fazedores de opinião, jornalistas (ligados ou não à Fundação Mário Soares), pensadores profissionais, autarcas, «comendadores» e comentadores de serviço, etc.\n\nTudo como se Mário Soares fosse uma virgem perdida no meio de um imenso bordel.\n\nSei que Mário Soares não é nenhuma virgem e que o país (apesar de tudo) não é nenhum bordel. Sei também que não gosto mesmo nada de Mário Soares e do filho João Soares, os quais se têm vindo a comportar politicamente como uma espécie de versão portuguesa da antiga dupla haitiana «Papa Doc» e «Baby Doc».\n\nVejamos então por que é que eu não gosto dele(s).\n\nA primeira ideia que se agiganta sobre Mário Soares é que é um homem que não tem princípios mas sim fins.\n\nÉ-lhe atribuída a célebre frase: «Em política, feio, feio, é perder».\n\nSão conhecidos também os seus zigue-zagues políticos desde antes do 25 de Abril. Tentou negociar com Marcelo Caetano uma legalização do seu (e de seus amigos) agrupamento político, num gesto que mais não significava do que uma imensa traição a toda a oposição, mormente àquela que mais se empenhava na luta contra o fascismo.\n\nJÁ DEPOIS DO 25 DE ABRIL, ASSUMIU-SE COMO O HOMEM DOS AMERICANOS E DA CIA EM PORTUGAL E NA PRÓPRIA INTERNACIONAL SOCIALISTA. Dos mesmos americanos que acabavam de conceber, financiar e executar o golpe contra Salvador Allende no Chile e que colocara no poder Augusto Pinochet.\n\nMário Soares combateu o comunismo e os comunistas portugueses como nenhuma outra pessoa o fizera durante a revolução e FOI AMIGO DE\n\nNICOLAU CEAUCESCU, FIGURA QUE CHEGOU A APRESENTAR COMO MODELO A SER SEGUIDO PELOS COMUNISTAS PORTUGUESES.\n\nDurante a revolução portuguesa andou a gritar nas ruas do país a palavra de ordem «Partido Socialista, Partido Marxista», mas mal se apanhou no poder meteu o socialismo na gaveta e nunca mais o tirou de lá. Os seus governos notabilizaram-se por três coisas: políticas abertamente de direita, a facilidade com que certos empresários ganhavam dinheiro e essa inovação da austeridade soarista (versão bloco central) que foram os salários em atraso.\n\nINSULTO A UM JUIZ\n\nEm Coimbra, onde veio uma vez como primeiro-ministro, foi confrontado com uma manifestação de trabalhadores com salários em atraso. Soares não gostou do que ouviu (chamaram-lhe o que Soares tem chamado aos governantes angolanos) e alguns trabalhadores foram presos por polícias zelosos. Mas, como não apresentou queixa (o tipo de crime em causa exigia a apresentação de queixa), o juiz não teve outro remédio senão libertar os detidos no próprio dia. Soares não gostou e insultou publicamente esse magistrado, o qual ainda apresentou queixa ao Conselho Superior da Magistratura contra Mário Soares, mas sua excelência não foi incomodado.\n\nNa sequência, foi modificado o Código Penal, o que constituiu a primeira alteração de que foi alvo por exigência dos interesses pessoais de figuras políticas.\n\nSoares é arrogante, pesporrento e malcriado. É conhecidíssima a frase que dirigiu, perante as câmaras de TV, a um agente da GNR em serviço que cumpria a missão de lhe fazer escolta enquanto presidente da República durante a Presidência aberta em Lisboa: «Ó Sr. Guarda! Desapareça!». Nunca, em Portugal, um agente da autoridade terá sido tão humilhado publicamente por um responsável político, como aquele pobre soldado da GNR.\n\nEm minha opinião, Mário Soares nunca foi um verdadeiro democrata. Ou melhor é muito democrata se for ele a mandar. Quando não, acaba-se imediatamente a democracia. À sua volta não tem amigos, e ele sabe-o; tem pessoas que não pensam pela própria cabeça e que apenas fazem o que ele manda e quando ele manda. Só é amigo de quem lhe obedece. Quem ousar ter ideias próprias é triturado sem quaisquer contemplações.\n\nAlgumas das suas mais sólidas e antigas amizades ficaram pelo caminho quando ousaram pôr em causa os seus interesses ou ambições pessoais.\n\nSoares é um homem de ódios pessoais sem limites, os quais sempre colocou acima dos interesses políticos do partido e do próprio país.\n\nEm 1980, não hesitou em APOIAR OBJECTIVAMENTE O GENERAL SOARES CARNEIRO CONTRA EANES, NÃO POR RAZÕES POLÍTICAS MAS DEVIDO AO ÓDIO PESSOAL QUE NUTRIA PELO GENERAL RAMALHO EANES. E como o PS não alinhou nessa aventura que iria entregar a presidência da República a um general do antigo regime, Soares, em vez de acatar a decisão maioritária do seu partido, optou por demitir-se e passou a intrigar, a conspirar e a manipular as consciências dos militantes socialistas e de toda a sorte de oportunistas, não hesitando mesmo em espezinhar amigos de sempre como Francisco Salgado Zenha.\n\nConfesso que não sei por que é que o séquito de prosélitos do soarismo (onde, lamentavelmente, parece ter-se incluído agora o actual presidente da República – Cavaco Silva), apareceram agora tão indignados com as declarações de governantes angolanos e estiveram tão calados quando da publicação do livro de Rui Mateus sobre Mário Soares. NA ALTURA TODOS METERAM A CABEÇA NA AREIA, INCLUINDO O PRÓPRIO CLÃ DOS SOARES, E NEM TUGIRAM NEM MUGIRAM, APESAR DE AS ACUSAÇÕES SEREM ENTÃO BEM MAIS GRAVES DO QUE AS DE AGORA. POR QUE É QUE JORGE SAMPAIO SE CALOU CONTRA AS «CALÚNIAS» DE RUI MATEUS?».\n\n«DINHEIRO DE MACAU»\n\nAnos mais tarde, um senhor que fora ministro de um governo chefiado por MÁRIO SOARES, ROSADO CORREIA, vinha de Macau para Portugal com uma mala com dezenas de milhares de contos. *A proveniência do** dinheiro era tão pouco limpa que um membro do governo de Macau, ANTÓNIO **VITORINO, *foi a correr ao aeroporto tirar-lhe a mala à última hora.\n\nParece que se tratava de dinheiro que tinha sido obtido de empresários chineses com a promessa de benefícios indevidos por parte do governo de Macau. Para quem era esse dinheiro foi coisa que nunca ficou devidamente esclarecida. O caso EMAUDIO (e o célebre fax de Macau) é um episódio que envolve destacadíssimos soaristas, amigos íntimos de Mário Soares e altos dirigentes do PS da época soarista. MENANO DO AMARAL chegou a ser responsável pelas finanças do PS e Rui Mateus foi durante anos responsável pelas relações internacionais do partido, ou\n\nseja, pela angariação de fundos no estrangeiro.\n\nNão haveria seguramente no PS ninguém em quem Soares depositasse mais confiança. Ainda hoje subsistem muitas dúvidas (e não só as lançadas pelo livro de Rui Mateus) sobre o verdadeiro destino dos financiamentos vindos de Macau. No entanto, em tribunal, os pretensos corruptores foram processualmente separados dos alegados corrompidos, com esta peculiaridade (que não é inédita) judicial: os pretensos\n\ncorruptores foram condenados, enquanto os alegados corrompidos foram absolvidos.\n\nAliás, no que respeita a Macau só um país sem dignidade e um povo sem brio nem vergonha é que toleravam o que se passou nos últimos anos (e\n\nnos últimos dias) de administração portuguesa daquele território, com\n\nos\n\nchineses pura e simplesmente a chamar ladrões aos portugueses. E isso não foi só dirigido a alguns colaboradores de cartazes do MASP que a dada altura enxamearam aquele território.\n\nEsse epíteto chegou a ser dirigido aos mais altos representantes do Estado Português. Tudo por causa das fundações criadas para tirar dinheiro de Macau. Mas isso é outra história cujos verdadeiros contornos hão-de ser um dia conhecidos. Não foi só em Portugal que Mário Soares conviveu com pessoas pouco recomendáveis. Veja-se o caso de BETINO CRAXI, o líder do PS italiano, condenado a vários anos de prisão pelas autoridades judiciais do seu país, devido a graves crimes como corrupção. Soares fez questão de lhe manifestar publicamente solidariedade quando ele se refugiou na Tunísia.\n\nVeja-se também a amizade com Filipe González, líder do Partido Socialista de Espanha que não encontrou melhor maneira para resolver o\n\nproblema político do país Basco senão recorrer ao terrorismo, contratando os piores mercenários do lumpen e da extrema direita da Europa para assassinar militantes e simpatizantes da ETA.\n\nMário Soares utilizou o cargo de presidente da República para passear pelo estrangeiro como nunca ninguém fizera em Portugal. Ele, que tanta\n\nausteridade impôs aos trabalhadores portugueses enquanto primeiro-ministro, gastou, como Presidente da República, milhões de contos dos contribuintes portugueses em passeatas pelo mundo, com verdadeiros exércitos de amigos e prosélitos do soarismo, com destaque para jornalistas. São muitos desses «viajantes» que hoje se põem em bicos de pés a indignar-se pelas declarações dos governantes angolanos.\n\nEnquanto Presidente da República, Soares abusou como ninguém das distinções honoríficas do Estado Português. Não há praticamente nenhum amigo que não tenha recebido uma condecoração, enquanto outros cidadãos, que tanto mereceram, não obtiveram qualquer distinção durante o seu «reinado». Um dos maiores vultos da resistência antifascista no meio universitário, e um dos mais notáveis académicos portugueses, perseguido pelo antigo regime, o Prof. Doutor Orlando de Carvalho, não foi merecedor, segundo Mário Soares, da Ordem da Liberdade. Mas alguns que até colaboraram com o antigo regime receberam as mais altas distinções. Orlando de Carvalho só veio a receber a Ordem da Liberdade depois de Soares deixar a Presidência da República, ou seja logo que Sampaio tomou posse.

  "latent_610": "Free Rift exclusive Echo Arena, launching this summer\n\nFor the next six weeks, Oculus is knocking $200 off the price of the Oculus Rift headset , by far the lowest price we've seen yet for PC VR. I talked to Oculus' VP of content Jason Rubin about the price drop, who said \"We're at that point where if you hand Rift to anybody, there's plenty for them to do, assuming that they're a gamer. Because of that, we're very encouraged to expand the user base… So we're going to push the hardware. And the way we push the hardware is by price.\"\n\nThe price drop is part of a \"Summer of Rift\" initiative that also includes the launch of free multiplayer game Echo Arena . Echo Arena the latest in a line of free games published by Oculus Studios, including Lucky's Tale and Robo Recall, that are exclusive to the Rift. Exclusivity has been a sore subject in the VR community ever since Oculus announced plans for its own store, and it was no surprise that shortly after launch, modders released a hack called Revive to make Rift-exclusive software playable on the HTC Vive. Oculus released an update that blocked the software, then rolled it back after an outcry, and that was that.\n\nNow, a year later, Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey (who recently left the company) is contributing $2000 to the CrossVR Patreon , makers of Revive. I asked Rubin what he thought of Luckey contributing to a project aimed at making Rift exclusives playable on other hardware, and if there's been any policy change at Oculus regarding Revive. What I got was a passionate answer about the importance of exclusives when launching new hardware and some not-so-subtle shade about Valve's approach with SteamVR. Here's his response in full.\n\n\"With regards to the more specific question about Revive and hacking, stuff like that, Oculus never really set out to block it. It kind of happened by accident. Since then, it has not happened by accident. I think we have a 100 percent record, since that moment, at which [CEO Brendan Iribe] said we would no longer do hardware checks, effectively, that we have not broken Revive.\n\n\"To a certain extent, I am a little at a loss, because Sony decided they wanted to get into the VR industry, and they said 'wow, we need to make software,' and they made software, and that software's exclusive. And that's awesome, because they've made some really interesting titles, I've seen some really brilliant things done, and I can say to my developers that I'm working with, 'wow, that was a great idea that Sony funded. We should take that, and something else, put them together and make a new mix, something that steps on the shoulders of giants and uses what they've done.'\n\n\"Likewise Google brought out a platform, and they said, we really need some software, so they went out and they funded a bunch of software, including, for example, Gunjack 2. We worked on Gunjack 1 with CCP. And that's great, because they come up with amazing stuff, and it eventually rolls off of exclusivity windows, and comes over to our platform, our stuff goes to their platform. It's all great, and we love it, and we understand it.\n\nI applaud all those companies for doing what they're doing, because they make the job of bringing VR to the masses easier for me, and they make it better for consumers. Jason Rubin\n\n\"When Microsoft comes out, I would imagine Microsoft will run the same playbook, because that's the playbook they run on Xbox. They will say, 'we need to fund VR content, we need to make interesting things so that people have a reason to use our hardware.' This all makes sense to me. I applaud all those companies for doing what they're doing, because they make the job of bringing VR to the masses easier for me, and they make it better for consumers. It is the right way of doing things. There is a single exception to that list. I don't get it.\n\n\"So our goal has been, from the beginning, to spend the right amount of money to create the ecosystem that I believe, in the last 90 days, is finally kicking into full gear. There have been people saying 'That's wrong! What you're doing is wrong for VR! What you're doing is bad for me—I'm not your customer, but it's still bad for me!' Okay. I don't know how to respond to that. All I can say is my goal, and the goal of this company, has been to create the best possible content for VR, and then to have that content drive VR adoption.\n\n\"And if somebody sees something we've done is a good idea, for example The Climb, one of our highest selling titles, it is an exclusive to our platform, and they go off and they make Climbey for another platform, great! That's awesome. No problem, no argument. We would never say anything negative. That's the way the industry works. I stole a lot from Donkey Kong Country when I made Crash Bandicoot. Insomniac stole a lot from Crash Bandicoot when they made Ratchet & Clank. Including our crates.\n\n\"In any event, that is the way the industry works. [Mortal Kombat's] Boon and Tobias stole from Street Fighter. Street Fighter then stole back from Boon and Tobias. These are the ways people make content, and the more investment, the faster we move. So I have just been following the same playbook that pretty much everybody's been following, and to a certain extent I don't understand the kerfuffle.\"\n\nRobo Recall, a Rift exclusive developed by Epic Games\n\nWhile Valve released minigame collection The Lab with the launch of the Vive last year, and has said more recently it has three VR games in development , you can see the difference in their approach to launching a new VR platform compared with Oculus and Sony. Valve hasn't funded exclusives for SteamVR, and much like it did with Steam Machines, it found a hardware partner in HTC to assume much of the risk. And as we recently reported , that arrangement didn't work out so well for the companies that made Steam Machines.\n\nLast year Gabe Newell responded to a Redditor's email explaining that \"We don't think exclusives are a good idea for customers or developers… We're in a much better position to absorb financial risk than a new VR developer, so we are happy to offset that giving developers development funds (essentially pre-paid Steam revenue). However there are no strings attached to those funds—they can develop for the Rift or PlayStation VR or whatever the developer thinks are the right target VR systems.\" But it's also unclear how many, if any, developers have received that funding .\n\nEarlier this year Newell said that, while Valve thought the rollout of VR was going well so far, \"We're also pretty comfortable with the idea that it will turn out to be a complete failure. If you don't try things that don't fail you probably aren't trying to do anything very interesting.\"\n\nIt's safe to say that Oculus is less comfortable with the idea of VR failing. Funding exclusives, in Rubin's mind, is the best way to push VR forward. And he has a point—that approach has a long track record of success in the console business. But as Revive has shown, it's not quite that simple on PC.\n\nAs for Palmer Luckey's contributions to Revive's Patreon?\n\n\"Palmer is a citizen,\" Rubin said. \"He's not an employee of Oculus since he left, and he's free to do whatever he would like to do, and certainly, for me on a personal level as well as the company, wish him the best in whatever he does.\"",

Add your marijuana to the grinder and twist a couple times to attain the perfect consistency. The herb should be in small clumps, not a fine powder. 2. Position a rolling paper on a flat surface. The adhesive strip should be facing away from you. Some smokers prefer to crease the paper in quarters to more easily roll the joint, though this not entirely necessary. 3. At this point feel free to add a filter to one end as this makes for a cleaner, healthier smoking experience. A filter can be made from a corner of the rolling paper box, rolled into a small tube. 4. Keep your left index finger on top of the filter tip and pinch the sides of the paper between your middle finger and thumb as you fill the paper with marijuana. 5. Make sure you spread the herb evenly across the paper, as this will determine the shape of your joint. Some smokers prefer to use more marijuana in the middle of the joint, however. If that’s the case, gradually taper the amount of marijuana used down as you approach the ends. 6. Here's where it gets a bit tricky. Carefully pinch both sides of the paper together and roll them back and forth a few times. This will help to “roll” the marijuana and produce less canoeing while smoking. 7. Roll outwards from the middle by applying pressure between your thumb and forefingers. (Note: Some marijuana may spill out, which is totally normal and fine. Do not re-start the joint because a few flakes have fallen out. We’ll use that excess marijuana later.) 8. Make sure the joint isn't too tight or too loose. It may take a little practice before you get the right consistency. It should be a little bit looser than a cigarette. Too tight and you won’t be able to pull, too loose and your joint will require many re-lights. 9. Use your left hand to pinch the joint at the filter while your right hand and left thumb slowly roll the paper into a cylinder. 10. As you roll, use your fingers to feed the paper underneath the adhesive strip taking care to make sure you have enough of the adhesive strip showing to wet and seal the joint. 11. Lick the sticky side of the paper and begin rolling downward around the joint while turning with your left hand. 12. Run your fingers down the joint a couple times to make sure the marijuana is equally divided and then tap a couple times so it becomes tighter. 13. Use any excess marijuana that has fallen out of the joint to carefully pack in the tip. Some smokers find a paperclip helpful in tapping loose marijuana in. 14. When the joint is completely rolled, close the top by twisting into point. Lick the entire joint and dry it out by briskly passing it back and forth over a lighter flame. 15. Congratulations! You’ve now hopefully rolled a perfect joint! The only thing left to do is enjoy your hard work!",
  "latent_752": "Can hugs make you healthier? New research sheds light on the major health benefits of social support\n\nIt's February. Are you sick? If you are, don't fret. The Centers for Disease Control tells us that cold and flu season peaks in January and February, so statistically speaking, your sniffles are nothing special. And, believe me, I feel for you. I have a 4-year-old daughter who is the most thoroughgoing germ collector known to humankind. Every day she trots home from her language immersion preschool, an international clearinghouse for viruses. I’ve lost count of how many times she has walked in coughing and sniffling, a little pouty and with her arms outstretched, looking for a consolatory hug. Of course I toss caution aside like a gum wrapper because that little hug feels like the greatest damn thing ever. The irony here is that despite all that, and even though it's February, I'm not sick. How does that work? Some new research from Carnegie Mellon University might give us some clues.\n\nIn 1991, CMU psychology professor Sheldon Cohen published a landmark study in the New England Journal of Medicine showing how stress can compromise our immune system and leave us more vulnerable to the common cold. Committed to finding practical ways of reducing both stress and illness, Cohen’s later studies focused on the stress-relieving powers of what he calls \"social support\": a catch-all phrase for the caring, empathy and reassurance you receive from those around you -- from the people who, whether they admit it or not, think you are mostly awesome. Social support comes in many forms: the long phone chats with your BFF, hanging with your bros, your church group, your reading club, and the first 60 minutes of a family get-together, before anyone mentions an upcoming election.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIn their most recent study, Cohen and colleagues used questionnaires to assess how socially supported each of their 406 study volunteers felt, and used daily telephone interviews to tally up the interpersonal conflicts that had happened that day. The researchers recorded one more thing that hadn’t been studied before: the number of hugs each volunteer had received.\n\nWith a description of each participant’s social milieu and number of hugs in hand, Cohen then put participants’ disease immunity to the test. In exchange for a healthy sum, participants agreed to have nasal drops containing an infectious dose of a common cold virus deposited in their noses. Participants were then quarantined in a hotel room to see to what extent they would develop signs and symptoms of a viral infection. To assess volunteers’ response to the “challenge virus,” Cohen’s group used objective measures such as whether or not anything came out of participants’ noses, and if so, how much it weighed.\n\nThe study revealed some powerful effects of social support and hugs on participants’ ability to fight off an infection. Both social support and hugs buffered the harmful effects of stress on participants’ susceptibility to illness. That is, stressed-out people who got more social support and hugs were less likely to get sick than stressed-out people who got less support and fewer squeezes. The findings suggest that hugs are a potent delivery system for social support. Cohen found an effect from “make-up” hugs, which were given at the end of a conflict, but an even a stronger protective effect from hugs that were given “just because.”\n\nOf course, providing social support can be a time-consuming affair, and not everyone is willing to do it. On the phone with Cohen, I refrained from quoting the line from the 1999 comedy \"American Pie,\" where nice-guy Oz tries explaining the art of being sensitive and supportive to his self-absorbed friend:\n\nOz: \"You ask them questions, and listen to what they have to say and shit.\" Stifler: \"I dunno, man, that sounds like a lot of work.\"\n\nStifler's not alone. This can be a common problem among men. Cohen pointed out: “Women tend to be the providers more often than men, but may not be more effective.” So I went digging into the literature and found a few hug studies whose findings literally made me sick, like this one. There’s a perceived stigma surrounding physical contact, and some men seriously need to get over it. I could have asked Cohen if the study suggests a way out of Stifler’s dilemma: Does one good hug get you out of there more quickly? Is a hug worth a thousand words? I can imagine him telling me that I’m missing the point.\n\nNow for the multibillion-dollar question. Should doctors be prescribing hugs along with eating right, sleeping and regular exercise? Are hugs the new Brussels sprouts for the immune system? I talked with a San Francisco pediatrician who works on the front lines.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nDr. Rachel Malina arrives to work on winter mornings to be greeted by a line of sniffling tots. Her eyes lit up when I first mentioned Cohen’s hug study. \"Pediatrics offices are huggy places,” said Malina, lost for a moment in a smile. “You get lots of kid-hugs and they make you happy.\" When I asked her about how we might put Cohen's findings to work in everyday practice, her smile turned to scrutiny: \"Kids get lots of hugs and kids get sick all the time. I wouldn't go to work and start prescribing hugs. Hugs spread germs, too.\" I told Malina that I think I get sick less now that I have a young daughter. She quickly retorted: “Your daughter exposes you to a lot of viruses, and that better prepares you to produce the antibodies needed to fight them the next time you encounter them.”\n\nI ran this by Cohen, who agreed that hugs spread germs but then pointed me to another study that looked at parents' susceptibility to the common cold. Using the old routine of viral nose drops and quarantine on 795 parents, the researchers found that parents who had one or two kids were 48 percent less likely to get sick than non-parents, while parents who had three or more kids were 61 percent less likely to get sick. Now for the kicker. Seeing Malina’s argument coming, Cohen and company measured the amount of virus-specific antibodies found in each parent’s blood and found a benefit of parenthood that was independent of antibody levels. That is, once the beneficial effect of having the antibodies was controlled for, there seemed to be an additional protective effect of just having the little angels in your life.\n\nSo how does medical science explain all of this? Cohen leaves the door wide open by saying that: \"All of the social variables contain possible explanations.\" He added: “It’s fairly clear now that family and social relationships play a major role in health outcomes, but of course we don’t know as much as we’d like to know about this.”\n\nSo I gave the parents study to Malina, who conceded: \"This is very compelling.\" As I presented her with more and more of Cohen's research I could see her stance soften a little.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nI asked her point blank if she'd changed her mind about all this over the course of our conversations. She paused for a second and instead of an answer, she gave me a hug.",

Meanwhile, when it comes to the Nexus lineup, the Google exec doesn't think Nexus devices are popular enough just yet to warrant brick-and-mortar stores. \"I don't think the program is far enough along\" for stores to make sense, Rubin said, according to ATD.\n\nGoogle and Android products are, of course, already available in carrier stores and big box chains like Best Buy. Otherwise, buyers can purchase products like the Nexus 7 tablet, Nexus 4 smartphone, or Chromebook laptop via Google Play.\n\nReports about Google stores first emerged earlier this month in a post from 9to5Mac. The blog's sources speculated that Google's upcoming Project Glass would be more successful if customers could stop by a physical store and try them out. Project Glass, however, is still in its infancy and not yet widely available for purchase.\n\nMicrosoft's first retail store popped up in 2009 in conjunction with the launch of Windows 7. In talking about the new Surface tablet recently, Microsoft chief financial officer Peter Klein said that retail stores have in fact boosted sales.\n\n\"People really need to touch and see and play with it,\" Klein said of the Surface during the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference. As a result, Microsoft is offering the Surface at more retailers with the Surface Pro launch.\n\nAt that same conference, meanwhile, Tim Cook argued that Apple Stores are \"like prozac.\" For him, the retail stores are less about selling and more about serving, he said.\n\n\"The store acts as a gathering place; it's a place that has an important role in the community,\" according to Cook, who said Apple Stores served 120 million people during the last quarter and 370 million in 2012.\n\n\"They are the face of Apple for almost all of our customers,\" he continued. \"People don't think about the Cupertino headquarters; they think about the local Apple Store.\"",

  "latent_1550": "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\nAs millions of PC gamers jump onto the Battlefield 4 open beta today, most will simply skip over or ignore the fact that PunkBuster anti-cheat software is being installed on their machines as a requisite for playing the game. Battlefield 3 veterans might not even bat an eye considering PunkBuster is a part of BF3's installer and most won't question a cheating countermeasure that has become par for the course for the Battlefield series.\n\nBattlefield 4 has drawn some concern on player forums for its use of PunkBuster as a countermeasure for competitive multiplayer cheating but it's likely EA and DICE will continue to use the software going forward. Upcoming titles Watch Dogs and Assassin's Creed: Black Flag from Ubisoft will also likely continue the publisher's tradition of using PunkBuster. Cheaters are reviled in all forms of competition sure enough, but it's shocking that software like PunkBuster has existed for over ten years and is still a go-to solution for major publishers like EA and Ubisoft.\n\nJust how bad is PunkBuster and why are major developers and publishers still using it? The answers really aren't all that complex. Let's start by dissecting PunkBuster's Terms of Service as an example. The following is an official statement taken from Even Balance, the developer behind PunkBuster:\n\nIn order for games having PunkBuster integrated to be more secure, the part of PunkBuster that needs full access to the computer for scanning purposes now must run all the time at the system level.\n\nThis is truly frightening. I've spoken to many IT professionals over the years and none of them see why any anti-cheat device would have to persistently run in the background as a start-up program and scan local files let alone run at any time other than when a game is actually launched and being played.\n\nEven worse, PunkBuster's ToS openly admits to scanning all parts of the user's operating system and hard-discs. While Even Balance claims that it does not collect personal information, the fact that it scans and has access to such files is hardly reassuring.\n\nLicensee understands and agrees that the information that may be inspected and reported by PunkBuster software includes, but is not limited to, devices and any files residing on the hard-drive and in the memory of the computer on which PunkBuster software is installed. Further, Licensee consents to allow PunkBuster software to transfer actual screenshots taken of Licensee’s computer during the operation of PunkBuster software for possible publication.\n\nThe really scary bit is at the end there. Since PunkBuster openly admits to running even when games are not being played, users are granting the software free reign to take screenshots at any point of system operation. This includes private e-mails, online banking statements, photos, classified company documents, and any other private and sensitive information a user may access while using their personal computer.\n\nIt's wild that a software developer would expect users to be compliant with what they openly describe as the \"invasive nature\" of their software. PunkBuster justifies this by asserting that gamers should care more about cheating countermeasures than they do system security.\n\nLicensee agrees that any harm or lack of privacy resulting from the installation and use of PunkBuster software is not as valuable to Licensee as the potential ability to play interactive online games with the benefits afforded by using PunkBuster software.\n\nThat's right, the ability to play a game where some percentage of cheaters are caught outweighs any user's personal privacy and security. In what world is this trade-off worth it? It's hard to imagine that most anyone who reads the ToS word-for-word wouldn't find this at least somewhat, if not totally, unsettling. Most invasive software applications get away with such reprehensible practices because they rely on the vast majority of users simply skipping over and agreeing to the ToS because they can't be bothered with the time it takes to get through all the technical and legal jargon.\n\nThe intrusive nature and open access on the part of PunkBuster is particularly worrying because the software has a history of being hacked. Hackers who gained access to the PunkBuster software at the master server end on one occasion and were able to manipulate and exploit the software on individual users' machines. That hackers could potentially scan and gain full access to all files on an individual system makes anyone who runs the software a very enticing target.\n\nThis is not to say that other anti-cheat measures aren't flawed in some way in their own right. GameGuard, a go-to solution for many Asian MMO's, installs as a rootkit on user machines and has been known to cause numerous system issues. FairFight doesn't snoop on player's computers or scan their hard-discs but its algorithms have drawn some criticism from some highly skilled players who were banned because their performance was so good it was deemed to be the result of cheating. Incidentally, Battlefield 4 is using a combination of PunkBuster and FairFight during the open beta.\n\nMore than anything, these issues reveal a severe lack of well-designed and effective anti-cheat tools for PC games that developers can turn to. PC gaming has certainly seen a major resurgence in recent years thanks in part to content services like Steam and the diligence of developers to optimize for the platform. Hopefully, one or more viable and effective anti-cheat solutions will present themselves to faithfully suit this renaissance and provide an alternative to current options.\n\nThe real question is, why don't big entities like EA and Ubisoft who have become increasingly reliant on PunkBuster over the years develop their own anti-cheat software? They would save plenty of money down the line and would have their very own proprietary software to boot. Heck, they could even license it to other developers and make a nice return on investment in the process. It's actually quite surprising that the market for anti-cheat middleware isn't bigger when so many big publishers and developers are desperate for solutions.\n\nOther developers and content publishers have utilized their own proprietary anti-cheat solutions to fairly good effect. Blizzard has used Warden for its online titles over the years and has kept the competitive StarCraft II scene clean. Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) is used for over 60 games on its Steam service, including DOTA 2, one of the most highly played competitive games worldwide. Red5 Studios, the developers behind Firefall, announced development of their very own anti-cheat software cleverly titled RedHanded.\n\nWhile alternatives may be developed down the road, major issues with PunkBuster remain. But game developers shouldn't accept PunkBuster's ToS and players shouldn't stand for it. No single game will ever be worth the trade-off in security and privacy. Players can actively contact EA and Ubisoft and express their concern on official forums over PunkBuster by stating that they're not willing to sacrifice security and privacy for the sake of a game. How and when they can offer alternate solutions, on the other hand, is entirely up to the developers and publishers themselves. So long as cheaters exist to ruin the fun of online multiplayer, developers will likely continue to see PunkBuster as a necessary evil in providing a level playing field.",

Something went wrong with it so they had to fix it\n\n“Strength is one of my attributes. It is something that you have to work on. I do want to continue developing my strength as it is as a key part of my game. I am a defender and I need to use that but I also need to fill out more and bulk up to progress.”\n\nSakho, who made his Reds debut in Monday's 2-2 draw with Swansea City, has settled in quickly to life on Merseyside.\n\nThe decision to leave his boyhood club wasn't taken lightly. The Paris-born defender of Senegalese descent had devoted more than a decade of his life to PSG and helped them clinch the French title last season.\n\nClub president Nasser Al-Khelaifi described him as “a child of the club” earlier this summer and begged him to stay but Sakho rejected their offer of a new contract.\n\nWith Brazilians Thiago Silva and Alex for company, coupled with new boss Laurent Blanc's £30million purchase of fellow centre-back Marquinhos from Roma, the 23-year-old opted to seek a fresh challenge.\n\n“Of course coming here was a big step for me,” said Sakho, who is set to make his home debut against Southampton tomorrow.\n\n“I'd been with Paris Saint-Germain from the age of 12 but there comes a time in every player's life when you have to make some career choices.\n\n“I had achieved everything I had wanted to do with Paris Saint-Germain. We had won the title, and I made the decision a while ago that I wanted to take on something else.\n\n“I knew I wanted to experience a different culture and learn new things and when Liverpool came in for me I was easily convinced. I was happy to leave in the end.\n\n“It's all going well for me here so far. I've settled in quickly. I left Paris to join an ambitious club and I'm very excited about the project here.”\n\nSakho's story began in the tough Goutte d'Or neighbourhood in the French capital. From a young age it was clear he was blessed with talent but by his own admission he was also a tearaway.\n\nHis bad behaviour led to PSG staff threatening to expel him from their Academy. After the death of his father when he was just 14 he considered quitting football but he returned to the club and knuckled down.\n\nSakho established himself as one of PSG's most exciting prospects and went on to make his first-team bow at the age of 17 in 2007.\n\n“I grew up in an area of Paris that isn’t all sweet and nice,” he said.\n\n“At that age, you have to put yourself about a bit and earn some respect. When I was 14 I tried to impose myself a bit on the other players around me, but it was soon made clear to me that I needed to focus and concentrate, go to bed early and work hard.\n\n“It was a bit physical, a bit verbal. I was just a teenager. It was made clear that if I didn’t step back in line, I would be in trouble.\n\n“When you are that age, your mum can say 'you have to be in bed by 10pm' but the man at the youth centre telling me? The response was what you would expect - 'you are not my dad, who are you to tell me?'\n\n“But I soon learned that I had to focus. I had to conform and do the right thing. It was for my own good.\n\n“The rebellious phase was a bit before the death of my father but I decided after that to take a step back and I concentrated on becoming a professional footballer. Life was pretty hard at that time but I took it on as an obligation to myself to become a pro and all that comes with it.\n\n“I wanted to provide for my family and, at the same time, indulge my passion for football.”\n\nSakho made more than 200 appearances for PSG over six years and was the youngest captain in the club's history.\n\nHowever, the influx of new signings following the takeover by Qatar Sports Investments two years ago began to limit his opportunities. That huge investment in the squad continued this summer with PSG spending 100 million euros.\n\n“There is a big project underway there and that reflects their ambition, but my situation was based more on my desire to genuinely compete and that is something I know I will have at Liverpool,” he said.\n\n“It was an impulse to leave Paris Saint-Germain. There are so many new players coming into the club but they didn't push me out. It was all about me wanting to go out and compete.\n\n“They are two different styles, the influx of big money or building player-by-player to fill out the squad.\n\n“The Paris model was very business minded in that sense. But I have come here to a club that functions with a family mentality. That is what suits me and I feel already that we have everybody in this family group and we are all heading towards the same goal.”\n\nSakho would have been richer penning a new deal at PSG or staying put and seeing out the final year of his contract before leaving on a free transfer. However, the 6ft 2ins defender grabbed the chance to help spearhead Liverpool's push for a Champions League spot this season.\n\nHe is the most expensive centre-back in the club’s history but insists that £15million fee won't weigh heavily on his broad shoulders.\n\n“For me the price they paid is of no significance,” he said.\n\n“Personally I am not bothered by it. I have been brought here to fill a need of the club. The most important thing is to come here and wear the shirt with pride and to take the club as high as possible.\n\n“I came here for the football, not the money. I had a year left on my contract and in four months I could have signed for someone on a Bosman. I put football and the chance to move here above personal gain.\n\n“There are a lot of very good players at Liverpool and the club has shown great ambition for this season. They have big ambitions for the Premier League and obviously the clear objective of qualifying for the Champions League.\n\n“That appealed to me as did the chance to move to another country and to another culture. I think I will be suited to the English style of play too.\n\n“For me, the Premier League is the best competition in the world. It demands a great deal of rigour and concentration from all players and that can only help me develop as a person and as a player.\n\n“I felt I had done it all with Paris and that it was time for me to turn the page. This is a new page in the history of Liverpool and for me – I want to make my mark on that page.”\n\nSakho never considered Carragher's vacant 23 shirt\n\nMamadou Sakho maybe viewed as a long-term replacement for Jamie Carragher at Anfield but the France international says he never considered asking for the vacant No 23 shirt.\n\nThe £15million centre-back, who opted for No 17 “just because it was free”, played alongside the Kop legend in a charity match last year.\n\n“It was a good game and it was a pleasure for me to meet such a notable figure in Liverpool's history,” Sakho said.\n\n“I never had any intention of taking on his number. You have to respect the established players and also the ex-players.\n\n“I know Jamie Carragher wore 23 and I have great respect for him and for his shirt. He has been a pillar at this club for so many years.”",

  "latent_1808": "I’m sure all of you bought the Humble Indie Bundle last week (if not, shame :), and it’s still on sale!), which raised over $1million for charity, indie developers and the EFF. It was a very successful experiment in both selling indie developed games, the key factors being that there was no DRM and you could pay what you wanted for the collection of games.\n\nHowever, in a very illuminating blog post, Wolfire estimates that up to 25% of the downloads of the game are pirated, as they define it: “users download from shared links from forums and other places without actually contributing anything”, not including torrents. Now remember that this is a bundle of games which are all DRM-free, that you can pay as little as $0.01 for and where you personally decide who gets the money: charity, the EFF, the developers or a combination of any. Despite this, people are still finding ways to get it for free.\n\nNow there are two ways to look at this. Either:\n\n1. This proves that there is an absolute need for DRM to prevent unauthorised downloads, since even giving the option to pay just one cent does not prevent piracy.\n\nOR\n\n2. This proves that DRM and price are irrelevant factors when it comes to piracy.\n\nMy disagreement with point of view 1. is that I have yet to hear of any game that uses DRM that has not been cracked and ended up on bittorrent. Yes it may take some time for newer/harder methods to be broken, but they always get there in the end – witness the Ubisoft ‘always online’ DRM which has now been cracked in two different ways. Therefore the argument that DRM prevents piracy is false. At the very best it delays it by a month.\n\nBut if point of view 2. is correct, doesn’t this mean that that 25% of people who downloaded a copy of the bundle for free (approx. 25,000 people) are pirates? Well ‘pirates’ is an extremely nebulous term which can be defined to mean what people would like it to mean at any one time. Avoiding using that term means you have to look in detail at the kind of people who are actually downloading titles for free. Here is a non-exhaustive breakdown formed from my own thoughts, those of Wolfire and from some commenters on their blog:\n\nCrackers whose only goal is to break DRM on titles to be the first to get the game online = a very small minority of people who do it for the prestige for themselves or their group\n\nThose who refuse to pay = a group of people who won’t pay for anything digital be it games, movies or music, mostly for a personal belief that by doing so they are giving a finger to the ‘system’\n\nThose who are unable to pay = they don’t have any money to pay\n\nThose who can’t pay = people who don’t have credit cards/PayPal accounts or access to one, in the West most likely to be kids, elsewhere in the world, likely to be a heck of a lot of people (see comments in the Wolfire blog by people from South Africa and Russia for instance)\n\nThose who are lazy = can’t be bothered filling in card details or going through PayPal login, especially for cheap impulse purchases\n\nThose who expect anything they download to be free\n\nOut of these, in the case of the Humble Indie Bundle we can discount: crackers since there was no DRM, and those ‘unable to pay’ since you could pay 1 cent if you wished. What’s left is the 25,000 who downloaded the games for free.\n\nNow those guys who refused to pay, not even a cent (which they could choose to give to charity btw), well they are just selfish wankers in this case as there is no ‘man’ they are ‘sticking’ anything ‘to’. Not saying they are always selfish wankers despite the fact I don’t agree with their beliefs, but in this case they definitely are.\n\nThis then leaves three main groups: those who can’t pay even though they want to (kids, no credit card for personal or poor credit reasons or those in countries with no/poor credit card systems or cards that cannot be linked to PayPal), those who can’t deal with complicated payment systems and those that believe that anything downloadable is free (all ages, all races, all over the world).\n\nIf we go back to point 2. above, we find this agrees with it.\n\nDRM is irrelevant as these people are not crackers proving a point and because they would not have bought a DRM copy anyway since they would always have got their copy through filesharing or a free link where it’s already been cracked.\n\nPrice is irrelevant in two ways. The ‘free downloaders’ to whom digital == free do not care if the game originally cost $100 or$1, it doesn’t even register with them. This is a generation where a digital video of their friends on holiday is equivalent to a video of the film Iron Man for instance. The reasons for this I won’t go into here to keep this post small, but I will discuss at some point. Secondly those who couldn’t pay or were too lazy to pay wanted to pay, but were prevented by technical/financial admin/national/tedious payment system reasons.\n\nThe payment issues can be solved by giving people as many ways to pay as you possibly can, thus preventing them from having to seek out a free version. The remainder, to whom everything digital is intrinsically free are not your customers anyway as I’ve mentioned in a previous post, so don’t worry about them.\n\nSo, this being the case, Wolfire’s decision that they are not going to do much about the free downloading (other than request those people torrent it instead to save their server bandwidth) makes perfect sense. In their own words:",
  "latent_1952": "This election has rightly been characterized as one that will deeply affect the future direction of the country: Americans are being given a choice with potentially large consequences. One arena in which there are profound differences that has not been adequately debated is the future course of inequality.\n\nMitt Romney has been explicit: inequality should be talked about only in quiet voices behind closed doors. But with the normally conservative magazine The Economist publishing a special series showing the extremes to which American inequality has grown — joining a growing chorus (of which my book “The Price of Inequality” is an example) arguing that the extremes of American inequality, its nature and origins, are adversely affecting our economy — it is an issue that not even the Republicans can ignore. It is no longer just a moral issue, a question of social justice.\n\nThis perhaps provides part of the explanation for why inequality and poverty should suddenly appear as part of the Romney-Ryan makeover, as they attempt to portray themselves (to use a phrase of some 12 years ago) as compassionate conservatives. In Cleveland on Wednesday, Paul Ryan gave a speech that might lead one to conclude that the two Republican candidates were really concerned about poverty. But more revealing than oratory are budget numbers — like those actually contained in the Ryan budget. His budget proposal guts programs that serve those at the bottom, and little could have done more to enrich those at the top than his original tax proposals (like the elimination of capital gains taxes, a position from which he understandably has tried to distance himself). Every other advanced country has recognized the right of everyone to access to health care, and extending access was central to President Obama’s health care reform. Romney and Ryan have criticized that reform, but have said nothing about how or whether they would ensure universal access. Most important, the macroeconomic consequences of the Romney-Ryan economic program would be devastating: growth would slow, unemployment would increase, and just as Americans would need the social protection of government more, the safety net would be weakened.\n\nWe’d all do well to pay a bit closer attention. That American inequality is at historic highs is undisputed. It’s not just that the top 1 percent takes in about a fifth of the income, and controls more than a third of the wealth. America also has become the country (among the advanced industrial countries) with the least equality of opportunity. Meanwhile, those in the middle are faring badly, in every dimension, in security, in income, and in wealth — the wealth of the typical household is back to where it was in the 1990s. While the recession has made all of this worse, even before the recession they weren’t faring well: in 2007, the income of the typical family was lower than it was at the end of the last century. While Obama may not have done as much as he should to counteract the steep downturn he inherited from George W. Bush upon taking office — and he underestimated the depth of the problems that had been passed along to him — he did far more than his predecessor. And he could have done far more, as the dimensions of the problem became clearer to everyone, had he not faced such strong opposition in Congress.\n\nThere are many forces giving rise to this high and rising inequality. But the fact that America’s inequality is greater than other advanced countries’ says that it’s not just market forces. After all, other advanced countries are subjected to market forces much like those confronting us. Markets don’t exist in a vacuum. Government policies — or their lack — have played a critical role in creating and maintaining these inequities.\n\nInequality in “market incomes” — what individuals receive apart from any transfers from the government — has increased as a result of ineffective enforcement of competition laws, inadequate financial regulation, deficiency in corporate governance laws, and “corporate welfare” — huge open and hidden subsidies to our corporations that reached new heights in the Bush administration. When, for instance, competition laws are not enforced, monopolies grow, and with them the income of monopolists. Competition, by contrast, drives profits down. What is disturbing about Romney and Ryan is that they have done so little to distance themselves from the economic policies of the Bush administration, which not only led to poor economic performance, but also to so much inequality. Understandably, perhaps, Romney has not explained why those, like him, in the hedge fund and equity fund business should be able to use a loophole in the tax law to pay 15 percent taxes on their earnings, when ordinary workers pay a far higher rate.\n\nOur government does less to correct these inequalities than we did in the past, or than other countries do, and as disparities in “market” incomes have increased, its efforts have diminished. It’s not just a matter of redistribution, as some suggest. It’s in part a matter of ensuring that those at the top pay a fair share of their taxes. And it’s in part a matter of ensuring that those at the bottom and in the middle get a fair start in life, through access to education, adequate nutrition and health, and not being exposed to the environmental hazards that have come to plague many of our poor neighborhoods.\n\nBut Romney’s campaign likes to play tricks with numbers. When he unleashed a tirade against the bottom 47 percent of supposedly freeloading Americans (for which he has since apologized), he failed to note what should have been obvious and has been pointed out repeatedly since he made that remark: those Americans do pay large amounts in taxes. These include (and I’m hardly the first to point this out) payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, excise taxes, and even part of the corporate income taxes that our major corporations manage to pass on to their customers. He failed to note, too, the many older Americans barely above poverty who receive social security payments, for which they contributed through a lifetime of work. Yes, the rich may pay a high and increasing share of the country’s total tax revenue, but that’s only because they have a high and increasing share of our national income— not because their rates have gone up.\n\nMany of the very rich, like Romney, are avoiding taxes because of numerous loopholes that favor the rich, and capital gains taxes that are taxed at less than half the rate of other income. The 14 percent rate Romney reportedly paid on his income last year is well below that of Americans of comparable income who worked for their money doing things like creating a real business. Tax havens like the Cayman Islands (condemned by the Group20 and all economic experts) facilitate another level of tax avoidance. That the practice is legal is not an economic justification — the loopholes that allow it were put in place by the rich and the bankers, lawyers and lobbyists who serve them so well. We can be sure that the money is not in the Cayman Islands just because it grows faster in the bright sunshine there.\n\nPutting all this together isn’t the politics of envy, as Romney’s camp likes to complain, or even about shaking a finger at the country’s real freeloaders. It’s about cold, hard economics. Tax avoidance and low rates on capital gains — and the inequality they amplify — are weakening our economy. Were the rich paying their fair share, our deficit would be smaller, and we would be able to invest more in infrastructure, technology and education — investments that would create jobs now and enhance growth in the future. While education is central to restoring America as a land of opportunity, all three of these are crucial for future growth and increases in living standards. Tax havens discourage investment in the United States. Taxing speculators at a lower rate encourages speculation and instability — and draws our most talented young people out of more productive endeavors. The result is a distorted, inefficient economy that grows more slowly than it should.\n\nThe Romney campaign, however, has defended inequality or brushed it aside. To do so, it has employed a handful of economic myths. Here are a few of the most important:\n\n(1) America is a land of opportunity. While rags-to-riches stories still grip our imagination, the fact of the matter is that the life chances of a young American are more dependent on the income and wealth of his parents than in any of the other advanced countries for which there is data. There is less upward mobility — and less downward mobility from the top — even than in Europe, and we’re not just talking about Scandinavia.\n\n(2) Trickle-down economics works (a k a “a rising tide lifts all boats”). This idea suggests that further enriching the wealthy will make us all better off. America’s recent economic history shows the patent falsehood of this notion. The top has done very well. But median American incomes are lower than they were a decade and a half ago. Various groups — men and those without a college education — have fared even worse. Median income of a full-time male worker, for instance, is lower than it was four decades ago.\n\n(3) The rich are the “job creators,” so giving them more money leads to more and better jobs. This is really a subset of Myth 2. But Romney’s own private sector history gives it the lie. As we all know from the discussion of Bain Capital and other equity firms, many made their money not by creating jobs in America but by “restructuring,” “downsizing” and moving jobs abroad, often using debt to bleed the companies of money needed for investment, and using the money to enrich themselves. But more generally, the rich are not the source of transformative innovations. Many, if not most of the crucial innovations in recent decades, from medicine to the Internet, have been based in large measure on government-financed research and development. The rich take their money where the returns are highest, and right now many see those high returns in emerging markets. It’s not a surprise that Romney’s trust fund invested in China, but it’s hard to see how giving the rich more money — through more latitude to escape taxation, either through low taxes in the United States or Cayman Islands hide-aways — leads to a stronger American economy.\n\n(4) The cost of reducing inequality is so great that, as much as idealists would like to do so, we would be killing the goose that lays the golden egg. In fact, the engine of our economic growth is the middle class. Inequality weakens aggregate demand, because those at the middle and bottom have to spend all or almost all of what that they get, while those at the top don’t. The concentration of wealth in recent decades led to bubbles and instability, as the Fed tried to offset the effects of weak demand arising from our inequality by low interest rates and lax regulation. The irony is that the tax cuts for capital gains and dividends that were supposed to spur investment by the wealthy alleged job creators didn’t do so, even with record low interest rates: private sector job creation under Bush was dismal. Mainstream economic institutions like the International Monetary Fund now recognize the connection between inequality and a weak economy. To argue the contrary is a self-serving idea being promoted by the very wealthy.\n\n(5) Markets are self-regulating and efficient, and any governmental interference with markets is a mistake. The 2008 crisis should have cured everyone of this fallacy, but anyone with a sense of history would realize that capitalism has been plagued with booms and busts since its origin. The only period in our history in which financial markets did not suffer from excesses was the period after the Great Depression, in which we put in place strong regulations that worked. It’s worth noting that we grew much faster, and more stably, in the decades after World War II than in the period after 1980, when we started stripping away the regulations. And in the former period we grew together, in contrast to the latter, when we grew apart.\n\nAs I have explained in detail elsewhere, the cost of these myths goes far beyond the damage to our economy, now and in the future. The fabric of our society and democracy is suffering. The worry is that those at the top are investing their money not in real investments, in real innovations, but in political investments. Their big contributions to the presidential and Congressional campaigns are, too often, not charitable contributions. They expect, and have received, high returns from these political investments. These political investments, exemplified by those the financial institutions made, yielded far higher returns than anything else they did. The investments bought deregulation and a huge bailout — though they also brought the economy to the brink of ruin and are a source of much of our inequality.\n\nSuch political investments undermine and corrupt our democracy. But there are other manifestations: America is fast becoming a country marked not by justice for all, but by justice for those who can afford it. (Just one of many examples is that no banker has been prosecuted, let alone convicted, for banks’ systematic lying to the court regarding the fraudulent practices that played so large a role in the 2008 crisis.) And with the increasing influence of money, especially notable in this election, the outcomes of our political process are becoming more like one dollar, one vote than one person, one vote. It’s even worse, because political inequality leads to economic inequality, which leads in turn to more political inequality, in a vicious spiral undermining our economy and our democracy.\n\nRecognizing all this is not class warfare. It is simply acknowledging the realities of life in the United States, which Romney has not done. That should be cause for concern: if you don’t recognize that there is a problem, and if you don’t understand the sources and consequences, you will never work to solve it.\n\nObama has at least touched on key elements: his education policies, from “the race to the top” to the reforms of student loan programs, will enhance opportunity. His tax proposals will do a little bit about the extremes at the top. His jobs and investment programs will expand growth now, and in the future, and these will be of enormous benefit to those in the middle. Romney and Ryan have tried a hard tack to the center in their rhetoric in recent weeks. But let no one be deceived: their tax policies will lead to even more inequality at the top, the continued hollowing out of the middle, and more poverty at the bottom. Worst of all, they will lead to a more divided society that endangers our future — our economy, our democracy and our sense of identity as a nation.\n\nJoseph E. Stiglitz , a winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics and a former chief economist of the World Bank, is University Professor at Columbia University.

  "latent_2058": "A team of developers from the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) has launched a new encrypted email service that could put an end to government snooping – with a little help from bitcoin.\n\nThe system, called ProtonMail, works by encrypting the data in the browser before it ever comes into contact with the server. So, even if someone gains complete access to the server, it won’t do them any good because ProtonMail does not store the encryption key.\n\nGroup effort\n\nProtonMail was conceived by PhD student Andy Yen, who called on fellow CERN scientists to examine the problem of online privacy, or rather the lack of it, and see if they could come up with a solution.\n\nYen took to CERN’s Facebook group and the response was overwhelming. Within days, dozens of people decided to join the effort and more than 40 individuals took part in the discussion. The team eventually came to include both CERN and MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) scientists, including four PhD physicists.\n\nThe core team of six started meeting at CERN’s Restaurant One and eventually they came up with ProtonMail.\n\n“We’ve basically separated the message that’s encrypted apart from the key – all the encryption takes place on your computer instead of our servers, so there’s no way for us to see the original message,” Yen told Forbes.\n\nHe argues that ProtonMail differs from all other email systems, which store the key to decrypt messages.\n\nNSA blowback?\n\nYen and his associates were prompted to develop the service following revelations made by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nThe Snowden leak proved what many technologists suspected for years – that the NSA was gaining access to commonly used technology to snoop on people – but many were taken aback by the sheer scale of the operation exposed by the whistleblower.\n\nCERN scientists are not alone in their belief in the right to privacy. Many Internet users have started using encrypted communications in light of the Snowden affair.\n\nAccording to Canadian broadband management company Sandvine, the volume of encrypted internet traffic has skyrocketed in recent months.\n\nIn its ‘Global Internet Phenomena‘ report for the first half of 2014, the firm found that the percentage of encrypted Internet traffic in Europe had quadrupled in recent months. A similar trend has been observed in other parts of the world.\n\nProtonMail is looking to tap this relatively large pool of Internet goers who would like to keep their communications private. The system uses end-to-end encryption, but unlike many encryption tools it is designed to be intuitive and simple to use.\n\nBitcoin accepted\n\nProtonMail is currently in public beta and the team is working on Android and iOS apps. These should launch by the end of the summer, and if all goes according to plan, the service will move out of beta at around the same time.\n\nIt is still possible to sign up for an invite to participate in the beta testing, but server capacity is limited, Yen said, due to higher than anticipated demand.\n\nSince the service is encrypted and, thus, cannot be used to serve targeted ads, such as Google AdSense, the team has decided to adopt a freemium model to make the service pay.\n\nProtonMail is free, but additional features and storage will be available. Full pricing tiers have not yet been announced, but the basic paid account will provide 1GB of storage for $5.\n\nSince ProtonMail is all about security and privacy, it does not track its users or gather any personally identifiable information. Of course, an additional level of security and anonymity is provided by one of the payment methods – bitcoin.",

We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nSecurity forces arrested several Palestinians during October and November on suspicion of planning to carry out a suicide bombing attack in the Tel Aviv region, the Shin Bet announced on Monday.\n\nThe suspects include a woman from Jenin, named by security forces as Yasmin Sha’aban, and four residents of the Tulkarm area.\n\n“According to the plot that was hatched, Sha’aban was the designated suicide bomber. She was supposed to carry out the attack with an explosive vest hidden in her clothes while disguised as a pregnant Jewish woman,” the Shin Bet said.Sha’aban had intended on receiving an entry permit into Israel for medical reasons, and exploit it to carry out a mass casualty bombing of Israeli civilians.The suspects have confessed to planning the suicide bombing and other terrorist attacks, the Shin Bet said. The suspected bombers were in touch with an operative from Gaza, who helped instruct them on how to assemble explosives, according to the investigation.Following the arrests, security forces seized a homemade semi-automatic rifle, a hunting rifle, ammunition, and explosives.The suspects intended to stay in an apartment in Israel used by illegal residents as part of their preparations, the Shin Bet added. There the Palestinian woman was meant to put on her explosives vest and head to the Tel Aviv area.Hamas and Islamic Jihad planned to claim joint responsibility for the attack, according to the investigation.However, there is no evidence that the central leaderships of Hamas or Islamic Jihad in Gaza were aware of this particular plot.The suspects also confessed to planning to bomb a bus carrying soldiers and to kidnap a soldier.Sha’aban and another suspect have been charged at the Samaria District Court with terrorism offenses.The arrests underline “the high motivation that exists among terrorist operatives to carry out attacks, with an emphasis on the period after Operation Pillar of Defense,” the Shin Bet said.The incident also pours light on how Gazan terrorist organizations seek to orchestrate attacks out of Samaria, and how they help would-be terrorists arm themselves and plan attacks.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_2507": "The Airports Commission chaired by Sir Howard Davies, former chairman of the Financial Services Authority, has today published its report on the next steps for aviation in Britain.\n\nDavies report won't stop our campaigns, say Heathrow and Gatwick chiefs Read more\n\nAfter years of consultation and industry lobbying, the commission has recommended a third runway should be added at Heathrow. The only problem is that many feel it avoided the far more important questions: whether Britain needs any more runways at all and if a better approach would be to tackle the small numbers of very frequent flyers.\n\nThere’s an argument from some industry lobbies such as Runways UK that British business is suffering from an aviation capacity crisis. To profit from emerging markets like those in Asia, they say, more space is needed for flights in the south-east, most probably at Heathrow or Gatwick.\n\nBut, contrary to popular impressions, official figures point to the trend of a “general decline” in business flights, clearly visible in Office for National Statistics data, and acknowledged by the Airports Commission itself. Only about 11% of flights abroad are now accounted for by business travel.\n\nWhat has happened, however, is a huge growth of short-haul leisure flights from Britain’s busiest airport, Heathrow, which has crowded out the potential for new business routes to emerging markets. But this aviation boom has little to do with the hyped democratisation of travel. It is benefiting a small minority and in curious ways.\n\nOver half the UK population doesn’t fly even once a year. A very small minority flies three or more times per year, just 15% of UK residents, and that group accounts for seven out of 10 of all flights taken.\n\nAnalysis of data from the International Passenger Survey by Sean Geeling, a PhD student at the Tyndall Centre at Manchester University, reveals an even more interesting twist. The places in Britain which are home to the most frequent flyers are shown to be the City of London, the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and Surrey. He found the most common destinations these UK residents are flying to are recognised tax havens.\n\nUK regional airports have ample, spare capacity if additional business routes are needed. If government policy better supported Britain’s regional development with business incentives, their use might also balance out Britain’s south-east-heavy economic model. Reining in the flight – literal and financial – of the super wealthy could bring additional, unexpected bonuses.\n\nBut this, of course, assumes that business needs to fly more and would benefit from doing so. There are several reasons to believe this is not the case. Aviation is hugely subsidised and compared to other economic sectors enjoys multibillion-pound tax breaks, from its fuel to its VAT-free tickets and duty-free emporia.\n\nShould sustainability professionals fly less? Read more\n\nIt also has a massive, polluting, carbon free-rider pass over the rest of the economy. Taking 1990 as a benchmark year and with targets set for 2050, aviation has been given special treatment, allowing its emissions to actually rise by 120%. Because aviation is given so much room, it means that for the UK to meet its climate targets, all other economic sectors have to squeeze into a smaller carbon budget and make disproportionately deeper emissions cuts of 85%. Even this allows for emission levels that many consider far too risky.\n\nWhat if business could get by, regardless, by flying less? It’s already an active debate among the small number in the international environmental movement who feel compelled to fly.\n\nEvents that followed the eruption in 2010 of Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull suggests there is more pain-free wriggle room to downwardly adapt than typically acknowledged. It pumped out a cloud full of fine silica particles, which are potentially lethal to jet engines, and like flicking a switch it brought airports across Europe to a standstill. The loss of the global economy’s airborne arteries could have been a death knell for business. But, the world didn’t end and people adapted astonishingly quickly in ways that had other environmental benefits.\n\nThere was an upward spike in the use of video-conferencing facilities saving business travellers time, money and fatigue. One major provider saw bookings go up by 38% in the UK, 12% across Europe and 9% in the US. “As one business contracts, another expands,” as BT’s advert said of its video conferencing. The co-operative retailer John Lewis reported that a big effort from “local hero” producers prevented any major interruption of supplies.\n\nWhat’s more, stranded people turned to each other for help. The Swedish carpool movement spread its horizons, setting up a new Facebook group called Carpool Europe to share cars and rides. Twitter came into its own with hashtags like #putmeup and #getmehome. The Eurostar train service used spare capacity to carry 50,000 additional passengers over four days who would otherwise have flown. More ferries sailed and more coaches and trains ran in the UK, particularly on routes such as London to Scotland, where it had become more commonplace to fly.\n\nParcel-delivery services within Europe such as FedEx and UPS shifted from planes to trucks where possible. And Norway’s then prime minister, Jens Stoltenberg, stranded in New York, used an i-Pad to keep running the Norwegian government.\n\nWith a strong economic and environmental case against expanding airport capacity, coupled with declining business demand, the argument is now being made to democratise flying and apply the polluter pays principle by introducing a frequent flyer levy.\n\nThe Airports Commission was scheduled to report after the general election for political reasons. In waiting so long they’ve fallen behind the debate and they have answered the wrong question. Instead of waving more planes into the air, they should keep more feet on the ground and work out how better to manage the skies.",

  "latent_2604": "I had a call the other day from a woman whose 32 year old daughter had moved away from the family home for the first time, a year or two before. Her daughter had accused the mother of being too controlling (calling and texting her several times a day, telling her what she should do). She was making life choices the mother disagreed with, and she wondered if I would “straighten her daughter out” for her! She’d paid for counselling for the daughter several times before and the daughter had quit because it wasn’t working for her. She hoped that this time it would be different because I was a Bahá’í! No, no, no, and no!\n\nThe first thing she had to realize is that while parents have a great responsibility for the education of their children . . .\n\nIn this New Cycle, education and training are recorded in the Book of God as obligatory and not voluntary. That is, it is enjoined upon the father and mother, as a duty, to strive with all effort to train the daughter and the son, to nurse them from the breast of knowledge and to rear them in the bosom of sciences and arts. (Abdu’l-Bahá, Baha’i World Faith, p. 398-399)\n\nIt’s the only place in the Writings I can find which actually refers to God as a “stern Lord”:\n\nShould they neglect this matter, they shall be held responsible and worthy of reproach in the presence of the stern Lord. (Abdu’l-Bahá, Baha’i World Faith, p. 398-399)\n\nWith that being said, the parents’ role is finished once the child reaches the age of 15.\n\nUp to the age of 15 years, children are under the direction of their parents. (Universal House of Justice, Lights of Guidance, p. 154)\n\nFrom that point on, the child is responsible to God for the choices they make.\n\nThe importance of attaining spiritual maturity at the age of fifteen is that it marks that point in life at which the believer takes firmly into his own hands the responsibility for his spiritual destiny. (Universal House of Justice, Messages of the Universal House of Justice, 426.2)\n\nWe might think that our 15 year old child is not mature enough to assume this responsibility, but Shoghi Effendi tells us:\n\nIt matters not whether they mature later in one country than in another. The command of Bahá’u’lláh is universal, irrespective of any variance in the age of maturity in different countries and among different peoples. (Shoghi Effendi, Lights of Guidance, p. 233)\n\nThe House of Justice gives further guidance:\n\nAs important as it is for parents to exercise their moral authority in assisting the youth not to make unwise decisions, it is also incumbent on the parents as Bahá’ís to give due consideration to the significance of the spiritual impact of the Faith upon the youth and recognize that the youth must have some latitude to respond to the stirring of their hearts and souls, since they, beginning at the age of 15, must assume serious spiritual obligations and duties and are themselves alone ultimately responsible to God for the progress of their own souls. The capacity for mature thinking on the part of youth differs from one to the other and according to age; some attain this ability earlier than others; for some it is delayed. Parents are generally in a position to judge these matters more accurately than others and must consider them in their attempt to guide the youth in their families, but the parents must strive to do so in such a way as not to stifle their children’s sense of spiritual responsibility. (The Universal House of Justice, 1992 Oct 28, Manner of Appealing to Youth)\n\nThere’s only one parental role after the age of 15, and that’s of giving consent to marriage.\n\nIt hath been laid down in the Bayan that marriage is dependent upon the consent of both parties. Desiring to establish love, unity and harmony amidst Our servants, We have conditioned it, once the couple’s wish is known, upon the permission of their parents, lest enmity and rancour should arise amongst them. (Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i-Aqdas, p. 42)\n\nEven then, the parent can’t interfere until the formal request for consent is given.\n\nAs to the question of marriage, according to the law of God: First you must select one, and then it depends on the consent of the father and mother. Before your selection they have no right of interference. (Abdu’l-Bahá, Baha’i World Faith, p. 372)\n\nThe second thing she needed to realize is that the tension between parents and children is often the catalyst the adult-child needs to break free and start their own lives. Hopefully, they will continue to make good choices after they leave home; but if the parent is too controlling, the adult-child needs to push back in order to assume their autonomy. Sometimes this can take the form of acting out – the pendulum of behavior swings from one extreme to another, before coming back to centre, several years later. It’s an important part of our spiritual growth, as the House explains, so we don’t need to be alarmed by it:\n\nA titanic, a spiritual struggle, unparalleled in its magnitude yet unspeakably glorious in its ultimate consequences, is being waged as a result of these opposing tendencies, in this age of transition through which the organized community of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh and mankind as a whole are passing. (The Universal House of Justice, Messages 1963 to 1986, p. 193)\n\nWe need to understand that:\n\nMany will be the setbacks, the shocks and the disturbances, which the commotions of a convulsive age must produce; yet no force, however violent and world-wide in its range and catastrophic in its immediate consequences, can either halt these processes or deflect their appointed course. (Shoghi Effendi, Chronology of Major Letters of the Guardian)\n\nAnd take comfort in the fact that it’s a privilege to guard them:\n\nHow great, then, the privilege, and how staggering the responsibility, of those who are destined to guard over them and to bring them eventually to full fruition. (Shoghi Effendi, Chronology of Major Letters of the Guardian)\n\nAnd the only way we can do it, is to focus on our own development, and align ourselves with the Will of God:\n\nNothing short of utter, of continuous consecration to His Will and Purpose can enable them to fulfil their high destiny. (Shoghi Effendi, Chronology of Major Letters of the Guardian)\n\nHowever, this can be a heartbreaking time for a parent, especially a Bahá’í parent, if we see our children doing things so far removed from the Teachings. But there is absolutely nothing we can do except pray for them, imploring God to intercede and to protect them from violent tests. Here is a prayer we can say:\n\nO Lord! Make this youth radiant, and confer Thy bounty upon this poor creature. Bestow upon him knowledge, grant him added strength at the break of every morn and guard him within the shelter of Thy protection so that he may be freed from error, may devote himself to the service of Thy Cause, may guide the wayward, lead the hapless, free the captives and awaken the heedless, that all may be blessed with Thy remembrance and praise. Thou art the Mighty and the Powerful. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Baha’i Prayers, p. 37-38)\n\nAnd then we have to be patient! This is a time in our lives when we develop patience and long-suffering! Reading books about the Greatest Holy Leaf might be helpful, since she was a real role model for a life of long-suffering!\n\nThe vesture that best befits us in this world is the vesture of patience and submission, and the most meritorious of all deeds is to commit our affairs into His hands and to surrender ourselves to His Will. Therefore, it behoves that leaf to take fast hold on the handle of resignation and radiant acquiescence and to strictly adhere to the cord of patience and long-suffering. (Bahiyyih Khanum, p. 97) We must struggle with such promptings from within, setting our sights on the lofty example set by the Greatest Holy Leaf who, throughout a life replete with severe tests, chose not to take offence at the actions or lack of actions of other souls and, with full and radiant heart, continued to bestow on them love and encouragement. (From a letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer, 25 October, 1994)\n\nEverything happens in its own proper time.\n\nThere is one season to harrow the ground, another season to scatter the seeds, still another season to irrigate the fields and still an­other to harvest the crop. We must attend to these various kinds of activities in their proper seasons in order to become successful. (Abdu’l-Bahá, Consultation, p. 7.)\n\nI met a second-generation Bahá’í man at a conference one time. He was in his late 60’s. He told me that when he left home, he broke all the Bahá’í laws. He became an alcoholic, drug dealer, gambler and sex-addict. He spent over 40 years breaking his mother’s heart before he finally “hit bottom”. But he had his Bahá’í background to come back to. When he finally got clean and sober, he turned back to Baha’u’llah, and of course, was forgiven his sins, and he became an active Bahá’í from that point forward.\n\nThis isn’t an uncommon phenomenon. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá tells us:\n\nA father and mother endure the greatest troubles and hardships for their children; and often when the children have reached the age of maturity, the parents pass on to the other world. Rarely does it happen that a father and mother in this world see the reward of the care and trouble they have undergone for their children. (Abdu’l-Bahá, Baha’i World Faith, p. 329)\n\nThe problem is compounded when children grow up in a culture different from their parents (due to immigration or pioneering). These children assimilate the values of the new culture and in fact become “a new race”. In these cases, parents must have a hundred times more consideration of the needs of their children, as Shoghi Effendi tells us:\n\nIt is difficult for the friends always to remember that in matter[s] where race enters, a hundred times more consideration and wisdom in handling situations is necessary than when an issue is not complicated by this factor. (Shoghi Effendi, Pupil of the Eye, p. 87).\n\nAs the following quote suggests, the age of maturity is highly significant:\n\nThe significance of the age of maturity, however, goes far beyond the fulfilment of responsibilities. The following extract from a Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá links the attainment of maturity with the deepening of one’s understanding and comprehension of the realities of life, and the enhancement of one’s very capacity for understanding: Know thou that before maturity man liveth from day to day and comprehendeth only such matters as are superficial and outwardly obvious. However, when he cometh of age he understandeth the realities of things and the inner truths. Indeed, in his comprehension, his feelings, his deductions and his discoveries, every day of his life after maturity is equal to a year before it. (Universal House of Justice, Messages of the Universal House of Justice, 426.3-3a)\n\nWouldn’t it be wonderful if we could have a “rite of passage” for our children at age 15? When we formally pass off the baton of responsibility?\n\nI wanted to create a “baton passing” activity for my son when he turned 15. During his childhood, whenever he questioned the laws, or the way I interpreted them in my parenting, I told him that it was my job to make the decisions till he reached 15 and after that it was his job. He took that comment seriously, and at age 15 he not only rejected my idea of doing something formal, he also refused to sign his card. I knew that he hadn’t connected to Baha’u’llah on his own, no matter how erudite and convincing his consultations were, so I couldn’t have accepted his card even if he had signed it. His reason was that he wasn’t ready to obey the laws. He didn’t necessarily intend to break them, but he knew he wasn’t ready to be bound by them either. And over time, he did go astray, further from the Faith than this mother would have wanted for him. And of course, I blamed myself (it’s always the mother’s fault, right?!) In accepting the membership card, the youth affirms his belief in Bahá’u’lláh. It is important to emphasize that a Bahá’í child is not compelled to become a Bahá’í and is free to leave the Faith at any time. “If any Bahá’í finds that he does not believe in the Faith,” the Universal House of Justice has stated, “he is free to leave it . . . , and no stigma at all attaches to such an action.” (Universal House of Justice, NSA USA – Developing Distinctive Baha’i Communities)\n\nI had to accept that the choices our children make, are not a reflection of bad parenting. Remember that most of Baha’u’llah’s and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s children became Covenant Breakers!\n\nBaha’u’llah had 14 children: at least 7 of whom became Covenant Breakers. (See God Passes By, chapter 15.) Of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s 9 children, only 4 daughters survived to adulthood and three of them became covenant breakers. (Moojan Momen, Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit: Chapter 31 of Some Answered Questions, p. 285)\n\nAnd even they were assured that God would forgive them if they repented.\n\nIt is important to note that should a Covenant-breaker recognize his mistakes, become conscious of his transgressions against the Cause of God and find the urge to repent, the Centre of the Cause, when satisfied he is sincerely repentant, will forgive his past deeds and restore his credibility and status as a Bahá’í in good standing in the community. (Adib Taherzadeh, The Child of the Covenant, p. 240)\n\nAnother thing I told this mother was that her job was to detach from her daughter’s life and focus all of her energy on her own spiritual development.\n\nEach of us is responsible for one life only, and that is our own. Each of us is immeasurably far from being ‘perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect’ and the task of perfecting our own life and character is one that requires all our attention, our will- power and energy. (Shoghi Effendi, Lights of Guidance, p. 92)\n\nI told her about the importance of turning her attention away from what her daughter was doing wrong, and concentrating all of her energy on “plowing her own field”:\n\nIf we allow our attention and energy to be taken up in efforts to keep others right and remedy their faults, we are wasting precious time. We are like ploughmen each of whom has his team to manage and his plough to direct, and in order to keep his furrow straight he must keep his eye on his goal and concentrate on his own task. If he looks to this side and that to see how Tom and Harry are getting on and to criticize their ploughing, then his own furrow will assuredly become crooked. (Shoghi Effendi, Lights of Guidance, p. 92)\n\nFinally I reminded her that her daughter would eventually marry and go through all the worlds of God with their husbands, so she should likewise focus her energy on her relationship with her husband, so that he too will be with her, through all the worlds of God.\n\nIn a true Bahá’í marriage the two parties must become fully united both spiritually and physically, so that they may attain eternal union throughout all the worlds of God, and improve the spiritual life of each other. (Abdu’l-Bahá, Baha’i World Faith, p. 372)\n\nI ended the session with walking her through the 5 Steps of Prayer for Solving Problems, which focused on the question: What can I do to focus on my own problems instead of my daughter’s? You can find the 5 Steps of Prayer at: https://susangammage.com/thebahaiprayers/quotepage.php?Prayers%2F5+Steps+for+Solving+Problems\n\nWhile she was meditating on this question, I recited a prayer revealed by Baha’u’llah in Arabic for Jinab-i-Samandar (Shaykh Kazim Samandar), the father of the Hand of the Cause of God Tarazu’llah Samandari, to assist him in making a difficult decision. If you find yourself in need of this prayer, you might want to use it too.\n\nIn regard to his affairs, let him repeat nineteen times: O my God! Thou seest me detached from everything save Thee, clinging to Thee, to guide me in my doings in that which benefits me for the Glory of Thy Cause and the Loftiness of the state of Thy servants. Let him then reflect upon the matter and undertake whatever cometh to mind. This vehement opposition … will indeed give way to supreme prosperity. (source unknown)\n\nIt isn’t easy to let our children go. Certainly nothing in my life prepared me for the wrenching away of my son, but the rewards of detachment are great:\n\nCould ye apprehend with what wonders of My munificence and bounty I have willed to entrust your souls, ye would, of a truth, rid yourselves of attachment to all created things, and would gain a true knowledge of your own selves — a knowledge which is the same as the comprehension of Mine own Being. Ye would find yourselves independent of all else but Me, and would perceive, with your inner and outer eye, and as manifest as the revelation of My effulgent Name, the seas of My loving-kindness and bounty moving within you. (Baha’u’llah, Gleanings from the Writings of Baha’u’llah, p. 326-327) I ask God that it may become realized, and day by day, thou mayest walk more and more in the path of the Kingdom, in order that thou mayest be freed from the strangers and friends, be disengaged from attachment to the material world and be attached wholly to the divine Kingdom. At that time thou wilt behold the lights of the most great gift. (Abdu’l-Bahá, Tablets of Abdu’l-Bahá v3, p. 545)\n\nI’d like to end with a prayer to help detach from your children:\n\nO my God, my Lord and my Master! I have detached myself from my kindred and have sought through Thee to become independent of all that dwell on earth and ever ready to receive that which is praiseworthy in Thy sight. Bestow on me such good as will make me independent of aught else but Thee, and grant me an ampler share of Thy boundless favors. Verily, Thou art the Lord of grace abounding.

  "latent_2614": "White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer must not have particularly enjoyed himself this weekend, given that his Sunday show appearances have been defensive at best and contentious at worst. CBS’ Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer accounted for the latter as he grilled Pfeiffer on the White House response to the issues — and why the administration pleads ignorance when things go wrong.\n\nCutting to the chase, Schieffer questioned whether the White House is approaching the issues in earnest (“Does that mean you don’t take any of this seriously?”), which Pfeiffer quickly denied. The chief of staff, he explained, was arguing that: “This is the Republican playbook here which is try, when they don’t have a positive agenda, try to drag Washington into a swamp of partisan fishing expeditions, trumped up hearings and false allegations.”\n\n“You know, I don’t want to compare this in any way to Watergate,” Schieffer responded. “I do not think this is Watergate by any stretch. But you weren’t born then I would guess, but I have to tell you that is exactly the approach that the Nixon administration took. They said, ‘These are all second-rate things. We don’t have time for this. We have to devote our time to the people’s business.’ You’re taking exactly the same line that they did.”\n\nPfeiffer clarified that the IRS actions were “inexcusable” and demand action — citing to generic points about top-down reviews, et cetera. It’s “very difficult,” Schieffer argued, to understand how the White House would have been ignorant to the goings-on within the agency. Pfeiffer claimed it was so, as Schieffer continued to express skepticism.\n\n“Is this president out of touch?” the CBS host asked, addressing the talk about Obama often appearing to be a bystander. The “actual, real scandal” would have been if the president had interfered with an investigation, Pfeiffer countered.\n\nSchieffer pressed on though: Later in the interview, he denied any desire to be “argumentative,” but pointed out that when the executive branch does something right (e.g. killing Osama bin Laden), the White House has no “hesitancy” in taking credit.\n\n“But with all of these things, when these things happen, you seem to send out officials many times who don’t even seem to know what has happened,” he added, as contrast.\n\n“And I use as an example of that Susan Rice who had no connection whatsoever to the events that took place in Benghazi, and yet she was sent out, appeared on this broadcast, and other Sunday broadcasts, five days after it happens. And I’m not here to get in an argument with you about who changed which word in the talking points and all that. The bottom line is what she told the American people that day bore no resemblance to what had happened on the ground in an incident where four Americans were killed.”\n\nNot quite responding to the point Schieffer was making, Pfeiffer reverted to the much-repeated argument about how the administration put forth information as they received it.\n\nSchieffer reiterated that he was speaking about the “PR plan.”\n\n“Why did you do that?” he asked. “Why didn’t the secretary of state come and tell us what they knew and if you knew nothing say, ‘We don’t know yet’? Why didn’t the White House chief of staff come out? I mean I would, and I mean this as no disrespect to you — why are you here today? Why isn’t the White House chief of staff here to tell us what happened?”\n\nUnsurprisingly, Pfeiffer didn’t broach those questions, rhetorical or not.\n\nTake a look, via CBS:\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com",

And since his Montlake arrival in 2008, he has hinted he might leave early.\n\nAfter each season, he would answer questions about whether he would return, and each year the answer had been yes.\n\nWhen asked about his future following Washington's 86-83 defeat to North Carolina in the NCAA tournament round of 16, Thomas hemmed and hawed. Hours after the game, he tweeted he would come back for his senior season.\n\nBut after deliberating with his family, coach Lorenzo Romar and a slew of NBA mentors including former UW standout Brandon Roy and Sonics legend Gary Payton, Thomas changed his mind.\n\nHe won't hire an agent, which would allow him to return to Washington before May 8, the deadline for underclassmen to remove their names from the draft.\n\nHowever, Thomas insisted his days at Washington are over.\n\n\"It is a goodbye,\" he said. \"It's hard to say, but I feel like this is the right time for me to make this decision.\"\n\nThe word \"timing\" came up repeatedly during a 20-minute interview Thursday, and it was clear several factors influenced his decision.\n\nThomas said NBA people told him he could be drafted somewhere between the middle of the first round to early in the second.\n\n\"I feel like with the guards coming out this year I have a really good chance of going high in this draft,\" he said. \"I feel like I can showcase my playing. I don't feel like it's a real strong draft class with the point guards this year.\"\n\nThomas, a two-time All-Pac-10 choice, also had concerns about his role next season.\n\nWhen Abdul Gaddy suffered a season-ending knee injury, Thomas moved to point guard and thrived at the position. He led the Pac-10 with 6.1 assists per game, while his 16.8-point scoring average was fourth in the conference.\n\nThe Huskies are loaded with guards next season, and Thomas would have had to return to shooting guard with the return of Gaddy and the arrival of freshman Tony Wroten Jr.\n\n\"I feel like my talents are best at the one position (point guard),\" Thomas said.\n\nWithout Thomas, the Huskies lose a co-captain and outspoken leader. They also must replace departed seniors Justin Holiday, Matthew Bryan-Amaning and Venoy Overton.\n\n\"As a senior he could come back and do some great things individually and he could help us win a lot of games,\" Romar said. \"But in terms of that perception of him, I think they (the NBA) got a pretty good look this year.\"\n\nThomas, 22, hopes to join Spencer Hawes, Nate Robinson and Mark Sanford, the only UW players who have left school early and been selected in the NBA draft.\n\nLike Robinson, one of his mentors, Thomas knows he'll need to overcome perceptions that his height is a disadvantage.\n\n\"Before I got to high school they said I was too short to play high school,\" he said. \"Before I got to college, they said I would never do the things I did in college that I've done the past three years.\n\n\"So that's not the issue with me. I feel like the NBA is going back to smaller guards.\"\n\nThomas is the fourth Pac-10 underclassman to announce plans to leave school and enter the draft. UCLA sophomore forward Tyler Honeycutt and junior guard Malcolm Lee declared this week. Junior forward Nikola Vucevic left USC last week.\n\nArizona sophomore forward Derrick Williams and Washington State junior Klay Thompson are expected to make decisions soon. The Cougars could also lose junior forward DeAngelo Casto.\n\nIf Thomas doesn't return to school, he'll leave behind a rich legacy at Washington.\n\nHe is the reigning two-time Pac-10 tournament Most Outstanding Player. He is sixth on Washington's all-time scoring list, third in assists and three-pointers and eighth in steals.\n\nThe Huskies finished 26-9, 26-10 and 24-11 the past three seasons. They won their first outright Pac-10 regular-season title and two conference tournament championships.\n\n\"The only thing I want to be known as is a winner,\" Thomas said. \"You can hate on my basketball game, you can say what you want about anything in my life or anything on the basketball court, but I came here and won basketball games with my teammates and coaching staff.\"\n\nPercy Allen: 206-464-2278 or pallen@seattletimes.com\n\nEarly departures\n\nIsaiah Thomas is the fifth Washington player to leave early for the NBA draft.

Fans jammed Toyota Field Saturday Aug. 5, 2017, to watch San Antonio FC take on Orange County SC. Alamo City soccer fans are coming to grips with the news that the MLS may ditch San Antonio for Austin. Photo: Kody Melton For MySA Photo: Kody Melton For MySA Image 1 of / 94 Caption Close No criminal case on MLS, but still unethical 1 / 94 Back to Gallery\n\nMajor League Soccer’s expansion process has been “unfair, unethical and duplicitous,” but it probably was not criminal.\n\nThat is the key finding in a letter from prominent attorney Mikal C. Watts to Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff, who had requested the District Attorney’s office investigate whether MLS misled local officials about San Antonio’s prospects to land an expansion team. At issue is the prospect of the Columbus Crew SC moving to Austin. Wolff and others have said they were told a team could be in only San Antonio or Austin, not both.\n\nThe letter also criticizes Spurs Sports & Entertainment, the county’s partner in the MLS bid, for deferring its application for an expansion team. That’s a potential problem because there may not be another wave of expansion. As New York-based attorney Bradley I. Ruskin, writing for the league in a Nov. 17 letter to Wolff, “At this time, MLS expects to select new expansion clubs in the next few months, and may select two additional expansion clubs at some future date thereafter.”\n\nThe key word there is, may. As in, it may happen, or it may not. Major League Soccer has named four markets — Cincinnati, Detroit, Sacramento and Nashville — as finalists.\n\nOK, this process may not be criminal but it was not entirely above board either. And we lay that on Major League Soccer.\n\nAt several points in his letter to Wolff, Watts says the Spurs’ decision to defer has cost the city a chance to compete: “Regardless of whether the MLS expansion process was fraudulent, Bexar County’s application partner’s request that the application not be considered in the initial two-team expansion decision — which MLS very recently disclosed may be the only expansion decision — acts as a de facto denial of the application.”\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, MLS spokesman Dan Courtemanche said the league and the Spurs will continue to talk about a possible expansion team here.\n\nIn a previous statement, the Spurs said it will continue working with the league on this.\n\nMuch of Wolff’s frustration is tied to the assertion that MLS President Mark Abbott had told officials a team could not be placed in Austin and San Antonio. But MLS officials didn’t reveal that Columbus Crew owner Anthony Precourt had a contractual right to move his team to Austin. If county officials had known that, Wolff has said they would not have purchased Toyota Field or pursued an MLS bid.\n\nEven worse, Precourt was also named to the league’s expansion committee — an obvious conflict of interest. He is no longer part of that committee.\n\nIn his response to Wolff, Ruskin makes clear MLS never made any promises to city, county or Spurs officials — and even implies the league was doing the city a favor by meeting in the first place.\n\n“The meeting between Mr. Abbott and the County’s representatives took place at your request as an accommodation to you,” Ruskin writes.\n\nBut interestingly, Ruskin also says it’s entirely possible teams could be in Austin and San Antonio, writing, “(i) at no time has MLS agreed not to place an MLS team in San Antonio (even if there is also an MLS team in Austin). (ii) from MLS’ perspective, there is nothing that would contractually prevent MLS from awarding an expansion club to San Antonio should MLS determine that such a course of action is desirable, and (iii) at this time Mr. Precourt has not formally notified MLS of an intention to relocate his club to Austin nor have the conditions that would need to be satisfied for any such relocation been met.”\n\nWe would just note that San Antonio is a wonderful, thriving city with deep ties to Mexico and would prove to be a dynamic market for MLS — better, in our estimation, than Austin. The Spurs organization is incredibly well-run and a major selling point in our potential bid for expansion. For example, an excerpt of Ruskin’s letter says, “MLS has great respect for the Spurs organization and believes that the Spurs have acted in a first class professional manner.”\n\nWolff’s frustrations are in many ways justified, and his passion for San Antonio is evident. Major League Soccer should have been forthright about the potential for a team to move to the Austin market. That said, the odds have always been long, and we can’t help but wonder how this back-and-forth with the league is helping.\n\nWe remain skeptical that the league would allow teams in both cities, San Antonio and Austin. We would welcome testing that.\n\nBut the fact remains that the county and the Spurs made a decision on purchasing Toyota Field absent crucial information. Should local officials have been more skeptical? Perhaps, but that crucial information was arguably withheld — by MLS.",

  "latent_3329": "(AoftheANews) JACKSONVILLE – Fr Charl d’Nay, pastor of Our Lady of Wholesome Goodness, had witnessed countless weddings throughout his years as a priest, but none had been anything like the one he had officiated last Saturday.\n\nDescribing it as “miraculous”, d’Nay told AoftheA News that for the first time since becoming a parish priest, a bride agreed to every wedding guideline set forth in the parish’s handbook without arguing, complaining, or demanding she have her way with everything.\n\n“It was miraculous,” he said, while holding open a door for workmen carrying a replacement stained glass window, to replace a section broken by an irate bride several weeks ago when she threw a candlestick through it because the offertory hymn wasn’t to her liking. “This girl came in with her fiance six months ago, picked the date, and stuck to the guidelines. It was beautiful.”\n\nAs a team of carpenters installed a new pew that had been drop-kicked two weeks ago by an angry bride because her bridesmaids weren’t allowed to read personal letters of love and support in place of the second reading, Fr d’Nay thanked God for the good upbringing last week’s bride had received.\n\n“It goes to the parents,” he said, as three custodians scrubbed at blood stains on the gathering space carpet, left there from when a bride punched her photographer in the nose after her wedding last month, because he didn’t shoot photos from atop the altar as she had demanded. “They raised her right – that the wedding day really isn’t about her, but that she and her husband are entering marriage – a lifelong commitment – in the sight of God, and their families and friends. She was ever so humble.”\n\nWhile a landscape company replaced sod and flowers that had been torn up by a bride’s limousine because she hadn’t been permitted to process into the Church to Katy Perry’s “Roar”, Fr d’Nay accepted the fact that this recent experience was an anomaly, and that the wedding scheduled for this Saturday would be back to normal. “I am so grateful God granted me this consolation, and I’ll recall it fondly next week while phoning a contractor to fix whatever it is the next bridezilla destroys.”\n\nImage via Pixabay\n\nDon’t miss anything from Acts of the Apostasy – like AoftheA’s Facebook page!",

John Kasich and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz released matching statements promising to work together to stop Donald Trump from clinching the Republican nomination before the convention. The agreement they struck was that Kasich would stop campaigning in his neighboring state of Indiana, to give Cruz a chance to catch Trump there, and Cruz would stop campaigning in his neighboring state of New Mexico, as well as Oregon, in the hopes of boosting Kasich there. Anti-Trump voices had been calling for candidates to work together for months (Cruz trampled over Marco Rubio’s frantic appeal for help in Florida); the alliance was a sign that reality had set in.\n\nBut one thing missing from the agreement was any indication that Kasich and Cruz would actually tell their voters in Indiana, New Mexico, or Oregon, to support the other guy. And sure enough, while eating at a diner in Philadelphia on Monday morning, Kasich decided to pour water on the whole plan. Would the governor, a reporter asked, tell his supporters in Indiana to vote for Cruz? No, Kasich said. “I’ve never told them not to vote for me; they ought to vote for me.” He explained that the deal had nothing to do with strategic voting—it was only about whether to campaign or not campaign. Sounds like a strong alliance!\n\nThis is the most passive-aggressive thing Kasich has done since the last time someone tried to make a deal with him:",

I was lucky enough to sit in on the Enterplay presentation tonight, and let me assure you they have devised insidious new ways to part you from your discretionary income. I'm not joking: a Deadpool in the panel all but threw his wallet at the panelists at one point.Prepare yourselves. When you haveandof the company, coming in to pitch merch, awesomeness is simply inevitable. First, some story. If you just wanna get to the merch, keep scrolling. You'll know when to stop.Back in January 2012, Enterplay entered licensing talks with Hasbro to produce trading cards for their IPs. My Little Pony proved to be worth investigating, and after seeing all the Youtube videos the fandom had made up until then, they realized MLP was the right property for another trading card set. So a couple weeks before Toy Fair, they mocked up a few cards and put out a banner as a way to gauge the market's response.People came by to take photos and started asking for interviews. The cards exploded! \"We've got to do this,\" they said.They immediately set to work recruiting people with knowledge of the show and the fandom in order to ensure proper respect was paid to the integrity of the MLP franchise. This included, who you might know as the organizer of the Humble Brony Bundle and former Equestria Daily pre-reader. See, career advancement opportunities from the fandom do exist!It's quite obvious how these investments worked out. Apparently, there are a bunch of easter eggs for the fans that \"no one has noticed yet\"... buuuuuut knowing the size of this fandom, I'm pretty sure we've got it all covered!So, long story short, product was air freighted to BronyCon 2012. In order to gauge its circulation, Enterplay watched Ebay for copies of the Rarity promo card given out to attendees here last year. One attendee who was there but forgot to grab one -- well, Dean gave him got one. Good for him. They didn't show up on Ebay at all at first. People didn't want to part with them. When they did, they went for $300-400 each. Then Rainbow Dash got sent out to SDCC -- and HER price, just like her, soared ever higher. Two of her went out to attendees at the panel, too. What? No. I'm only grinding my teeth 'cause I'm happy for them. Come on.Those Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy boxes that popped up in stores later? That was Enterplay's attempt to make amends and increase accessibility to these cards. Facebook flash sales? Same idea. They want you to have those cards, guys, and they're always looking for other ways to distribute.They want you to have those cards so badly, in fact, that they actually showed off four of the TBA foils in the Series 2 collection.Do I have your attention? Good, 'cause here's what else they've got coming up:Companies are quite fond of giving their projects code names, and Ol' Blue Eyes stepped up. \"How's Frank coming along?\" Emails like that flew back and forth with Hasbro. As it turned out, \"Frank\" was the code name for some upcoming collectible card game or other with horses in it....Sorry. I know we've announced it twice by this point, but I still had to pause for a moment and listen to your cries of jubilation over the horizon. Here's how it works, with a disclaimer thatThis isn't Battling is Magic. It's Friendship is Magic. So you gotta use your cards to solve problems, and to do so beforethe rube across the table from you can get his own problems sorted out. You bring to the table a \"main character\" (spelling uncertain), a 50-card \"draw\" deck, and a 10-card \"problem\" deck, andUnfortunately, we do not have photos of the latest card designs because Hasbro has not OK'ed their publication, but we think it's safe to post this older version of \"Lyra Heartstrings/Bon Bon\":With a release date set for November, we're not going to see any big Season 4 content in the initial release, which will number between 225-350 cards. Wehowever, look forward to bits of minor flavor from Season 4, since Enterplay has early access to scripts from the show. We have also been assured thatcharacter with at least one frame's worth of screen time qualifies for inclusion in the game.I asked Dean and Gail about what excited them most about releasing the set, and they said that they come from an extensive trading card heritage. Dean used to produce Star Wars and Star Trek with Decipher, and Gail used to be with Nintendo working on Pokemon. They've wanted to do this with MLP for the longest time, and theywait for this game to hit the streets. If you are lucky enough to attend GenCon this year, you will spot door signs for the game everywhere. Enterplay will also host playtest tourneys so that attendees can play the game themselves and offer feedback. A pre-release event is planned sometime after the convention, and once the game goes live you can purchase it in $10.99 60-card theme decks, $18.99 two-player theme sets, and $3.49 12-card boosters.Still not excited enough? What about this? In about 48 hours or so, http://www.enter-play.com/volunteer will go live. Certain games like one that rhymes with \"Tragic: the Blathering\" host tournaments and world championships. Wouldn't it be neat if the My Little Pony CCG could foster that same kind of competitive community? If you are interested in volunteering, presumably as judges, event organizers, or what have you, stop by the Packbreakers booth at Bronycon on Sunday with your questions, or simply visit that website once it goes live.The panel then handed out free T-shirts and initiated Q&A.After the panel, Dean and Gail disappeared beneath a human tide until con staff were able to clear the room. What an incredible panel.",
  "latent_3796": "Most racing games that take a realistic approach are notorious for tough controls, a steep learning curve, and general inaccessibility with issues ranging from poor menu design, to no explanations of crucial features. That's why many of us prefer arcade-style games like Need for Speed over racing simulators like Gran Turismo.\n\nForza Motorsport 6 tries its hardest to make you a fan even if you don't like racing simulators. It has a well thought out tutorial that explains all the important facets of gameplay. The user interface is a fun to use and easy to understand. But most of all, Forza Motorsport 6 is a joy to play.\n\nIt's here that Forza Motorsport 6 saved its best efforts. A slew of gameplay options smartly arranged for maximum visibility mean that you can tweak and toggle almost every aspect of the game. From choosing the difficulty level and car damage, to how aggressive the AI should be, it does everything in its power to keep you playing. Combined with responsive, fine-tuned controls, the result is that if Forza Motorsport 6 doesn't appeal to you immediately, it will with a few tweaks.\n\nA welcome addition is the ability to limit how hostile computer-controlled opponents are. This effectively prevents them from try to bump you you off the road whenever possible. While some of these options have existed since the inception of the genre, they rarely come together as well as they do here.\n\n(Also see: Halo 5, Forza 6, Rise of the Tomb Raider Are the Most Expensive Xbox One Games on Pre-Order)\n\nNewbies can turn on assists and make the game easier, while veterans can turn off all the aids for a pure, unadulterated experience. Regardless of your level of expertise, Forza Motorsport 6 has more than enough to keep you in the driver's seat. All of this comes together to give you a genuine sense of speed that keeps each race fresh and challenging.\n\nThere's a lengthy single-player mode that promises over 70 hours of gameplay. It spans across various kinds of races, ranging from basic street races featuring regular cars, to exotic rides tearing up tracks in locations like Rio de Janeiro. You'll need to be in the top three of every race you play to progress, making it a seemingly straightforward affair. But with a host of varied tracks and weather conditions, you'll find it anything but. From racing at night at the Yas Marina in Abu Dhabi to tackling Florida's Sebring in the rain, progressing through the many races of Forza Motorsport 6 is far from boring.\n\nIn order to help you progress, the game also sports mods. These range from mods like permanent stat enhancers that let you increase the grip your car has on a track, to the likes of single-use speed boosts. You can equip the mods before the race to even the odds. There are other interesting features as well; for example, if you keep playing using cars from a specific manufacturer, then you get in-game credits to start with. When you reach maximum affinity with that manufacturer, you receive rare mods as rewards. Mods are an interesting addition to the game, adding a sense of strategy and forcing you to pay attention to the nuances of the many tracks and environments.\n\nAlso, developer Turn 10 appears to have taken criticism from the Xbox One launch title Forza Motorsport 5 to heart as Forza Motorsport 6 not only sports 460 cars (each of which you can drive in Freeplay mode) and 26 tracks, but there's a buffet of events as well. From driving cars through bowling pins to taking part in moments of motorsport history, Forza Motorsport 6 is chock-full of content to keep you busy outside the robust career mode. These include overtaking challenges, to gruelling, long distance endurance races as well.\n\n(Also see: Microsoft Unveils Limited Edition Forza 6 Xbox One Console)\n\nAlong the way you'll hear Top Gear's Richard Hammond and James May wax eloquent about what motivates us to drive, which adds some gravitas to the whole affair. That isn't all. Motorsport professionals like V8 Supercar Champion Mark Skaife lend their voices to the game, ensuring you're not playing an episode of Top Gear minus Jeremy Clarkson.\n\nIf there is one area where Forza Motorsport 6 falls short it is presentation. For most part it appears sterile, whether tracks or the cars themselves all look extremely clean and plain. It doesn't look as compelling as last year's Forza Horizon 2. Of course, that's an open-world arcade racer for a more casual audience while Forza Motorsport 6 is aimed at core fans, but the jagged edges and peculiar, unnatural car deformation stand out for the wrong reasons, tragic considering how good the game looks when racing through the rains. Coupled with surprisingly long load times that will make you reconsider many a quick race, and you have technical failings that we hope get rectified with a patch.\n\nThe multiplayer mode which promises 24-car racing online also worked as it should have. We'll be keeping a close watch post-release to see if it remains the same.\n\n(Also see: Xbox One Will Not Be Exclusive to Amazon India From Next Month)\n\nBarring a few technical concerns, there's absolutely no reason Xbox One owners have to not purchase Forza Motorsport 6. It's brimming with content and gives you oodles of control to tailor the experience to your skill level and preference. You might not be a fan of racing games but Forza Motorsport 6 does an admirable job of trying to change that.\n\nPros\n\nGreat user interface\n\nSolid controls\n\nAccessible for newcomers\n\nWealth of content\n\nCons\n\nSterile graphics\n\nLong loading times before races\n\nRating (out of 10): 9\n\nWe played a review copy of Forza Motorsport 6 on the Xbox One.

  "latent_3832": "President Barack Obama’s signing of an executive order on Wednesday authorizing the use of economic sanctions against hackers that conduct cyber-attacks and online corporate espionage marks an escalation by the U.S. in the use of tools like asset freezes in attempting to deal with sticky problems that are global in nature.\n\nThe Treasury Department will now be able to essentially cut off from the financial system hackers and even companies that have been deemed to be engaged in cyber-enabled activities that threaten the security, economic health or financial stability of the U.S.\n\nFreezing assets of individuals and entities and preventing them from doing any business with U.S. individuals or companies—the weaponization of finance as Eurasia Group’s Ian Bremmer puts it—has become a popular and controversial U.S. tool in recent years. President Obama authorized sanctions against North Korea in January after the U.S. claimed that North Korea conducted a cyber attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. The current high-stakes nuclear negotiations taking place between the U.S. and Iran partly revolve around Iran’s desire to get rid of Western sanctions that have punished its economy. U.S. and EU sanctions have also hit Russia hard in recent months as Western countries attempt to change Russia’s behavior in Ukraine.\n\nCritics of U.S. sanctions argue that their increasing use will ultimately lead nations to abandon the U.S. dollar. The new U.S. sanctions policy against hackers did not come with any new designations and it’s not completely clear how they will be used. There have been major cyber attacks against companies like Target, Ebay and Home Depot, but that doesn’t mean that the U.S. would impose sanctions against the hackers in such situations even if they could be identified. Nevertheless, the executive order's definition of activity that could result in sanctions is broad in scope.\n\n“This tool is not meant to protect any one individual U.S. company,” said White House Cybersecurity Coordinator Michael Daniel on a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. “It is designed to where we have widespread theft of our intellectual property on a scale that actually effects the economic health of the United States as a whole.\"\n\nHacks that systematically target the banking system would appear to rise to the level of potentially provoking a sanctions response, but U.S. government officials would not speculate on whether any previous hacks could serve as a model. A cyber attack last year on JPMorgan Chase yielded the email address and phone numbers of 83 million households and businesses.\n\nWhat is clear is that companies that sponsor and benefit from cyber attacks on the U.S. economy could be targeted by U.S. sanctions. “There are companies that hire hackers to steal intellectual property and we don’t want to just deter those with their finger on the keyboard but also those groups that are funding those groups,” Daniel said.",

The story follows an orphan boy scout, Sam (Jared Gilman), who just wants to be accepted; but he is a bit too peculiar to be accepted so easily. He meets Suzy (Kara Hayward), who is the black sheep of her family, and she really wishes she didn’t have one.\n\nThis contrast of characters is poignant and interesting. Gilman and Hayward truly impress and have some fine chemistry. Their innocent sex scene is so awkward, yet very compelling and beautiful. I love their relationship.\n\nAnderson’s cinematography and style are also something to love. The story is essentially a search-and-rescue story, meets coming-of-age tale. The themes, drama and comedy have a great balance. The plot, characters and the performers are the strongest aspects of the film. Though, it’s all a little boring. That might be because I am not yet accustomed to Wes Anderson’s pace of storytelling. I’ve always heard that his films are an acquired taste; and now I truly know why. Since this is my first Wes Anderson viewing, I don’t love it very much just yet. I’d like to watch all of his other movies; and then revisit this one.\n\nHayward and Gilman are fantastic. It’s also amazing to see Bruce Willis, Bill Murray and Edward Norton, my favourite actor, share the screen together. It’s cinema magic. I liked it a fair deal, even if I did feel bored during. It’s a seemingly acquired taste; so I’d love to revisit this after making myself accustomed to Anderson’s style. This really is a well-made dramedy.\n\n78/100\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_3858": "This weekend, I received an email that made me pause, and Jake was kind enough to allow me to share his story. I'll begin lending a greater voice to the issue of marijuana, which I haven't yet done justice, beginning with this powerful personal narrative. Below is the note in its unaltered entirety.\n\nSubject: Marijuana Addict\n\nHi. My name is Jake and I am a recovering addict. I have been clean for about ten and a half months. Throughout that time I have spent many hours of spare time searching the web for articles about addiction. I have definitely hit a gold mine with your blog \"the white noise\". However, I was (selfishly) disappointed to find very little regarding my drug of choice, marijuana.\n\nBefore I ever used, I was aware of the potential consequences. I heard what they told me in school about the drugs like cocaine and meth and heroin, but I don't really remember anything about marijuana other than that I would be arrested if I was caught with it. I heard that some people who smoke marijuana get addicted to the \"hard\" drugs. The most ominous thing I heard about marijuana was that people who smoked it might get psychologically addicted. I was under the impression that one could defeat psychological addiction with a simple decision not to use.\n\nI was pretty straight edge until my junior year when I saw a lot of my class mates beginning to smoke weed. I got curious, did a little research online and through my \"peer experts\", and upon concluding that weed posed minimal if any risk, I got high. The high was nothing like I expected. It was intense. It seemed as though parts of my self had been blasted away and had been replaced by adrenaline, euphoria. It would take hours to describe the high thoroughly and accurately. The next time I got high was a few months later, in spring. I was alone and I found the same overwhelming adrenaline pumping, epiphany stimulating, euphoric high. I knew I had found the best toy I had ever had in my life. It beat cake, sex, tv, video games, etc. etc. etc.\n\nBy mid summer I was dumping out trash cans with ashes at the bottom so I could pick through and make a pile of charred green that I could smoke. For the next two years my life fluctuated between weeks of being high and weeks of being clean, trying to make up for late homework and ignored relationships. Over time, the proportion of high time to clean time became steadily more heavy on the high side. I went through several periods of suicidally. During my last six months of use the possible necessity to kill myself always seemed just a week or two away. My plan while I was at school was to jump off of a nearby parking garage. At home I would use my dad's shotgun to shoot myself in the head. I didn't want to feel what I felt when I wasn't high. Luckily, I always got high before I was ready to actually kill myself.\n\nAnyway, in the last three months of my use, I had been stealing whatever amount of money I thought I could get away with to buy my weed. Eventually my mom caught onto the fact that I was not only stealing from my family, but my girlfriend too (I stole from whoever gave me the opportunity). Fearing for my legal status she gave me an ultimatum, treatment or cops. I chose treatment and have been clean since (with the aid of AA).\n\nHad I known of the devastating effects weed would have on me I would have never taken that first hit. I had no idea of the destructive potential of weed. I don't know what effect just one site with legitimate information on marijuana would have but it might start to change the perception that marijuana is not really addictive. Throughout my experience, I had doubts as to whether or not I was addicted. The more valid information out there, the better an individual's chances are of coming to an understanding that they need help. An addict who stops using saves themselves and everyone around them pain.

Siewert testified, however, that there was no forensic evidence that Zimmerman had pressed the gun to Martin’s chest. In fact, the gunpowder residue and other material evidence showed that the gun was touched to Martin’s shirt, and that Martin’s shirt was not pressed to his chest, implying that Martin was on top of Zimmerman and that his shirt was hanging down when Zimmerman shot him.\n\nThe state also attempted to maximize the fact that Zimmerman’s gun was loaded, including a round in the chamber, before the fight.

  "latent_4417": "The Philadelphia Flyers have gone to lengths the past few seasons to address their defensive depth and now have five very solid blueliners among their top 10 prospects.\n\nThe 2014 Fall Top 20 features an influx of recently-drafted talent, as all of Philadelphia’s 2014 NHL Draft picks made the list. Three of those picks, Travis Sanheim, Nicolas Aube-Kubel, and Mark Friedman, made the top 10. Certain players, including Michael Parks and Jason Akeson, have been moved out of the top 10. Several other players have changed spots, but there were no significant jumps in ranking.\n\n1. (1) Scott Laughton, C, 7.5B\n\nDrafted 1st round, 20th overall, 2012\n\nLaughton retains his number one position in this set of rankings. He is a strong player and the best two-way forward in Philadelphia’s system. He was very productive offensively in the OHL, but his strength is in two-way play, meaning he probably will not be a top-line forward at the NHL level. He is a proven leader who will adapt to a team’s needs and play whatever role he is needed to play. Laughton also brings a good work ethic and is arguably the hardest working prospect in this group.\n\n2. (2) Samuel Morin, D, 7.5B\n\nDrafted 1st round, 11th overall, 2013\n\nMorin remains second on the list, but only by a little bit. Along with Laughton and Shayne Gostisbehere, he is one of Philadelphia’s top-tier prospects. He has the potential to become a good NHL defender, although he does not project to be a big offensive helper. Unlike Gostisbehere, another one of Philadelphia’s talented defensemen, Morin is more of a physical, defensive defenseman and his defensive play is stronger than Gostisbehere’s. Morin can score, and has scored in the QMJHL, but he might not be able to replicate that at the next level. While Morin has little offensive upside, he is a big, solid defender who can shut down opposing lines.\n\n3. (4) Shayne Gostisbehere, D, 7.5C\n\nDrafted 3rd round, 78th overall, 2012\n\nGostisbehere moves up one spot because of a breakout junior campaign with Union. While he has to work on several aspects of his game, especially defensively, the 21-year-old has the potential to become one of the organization’s top defensemen. His defense improved over last season, when he turned in a few good performances to help Union win the national championship. If he can tighten up his play in his own end, he could be a capable NHL defenseman who can quarterback a power play. Gostisbehere has tremendous offensive upside, and he is a fast defenseman who brings a lot of energy and can cut through opposing teams.\n\nGostisbehere will have a chance to work in his defensive play with the Phantoms this coming season.\n\n4. (NR) Travis Sanheim, D, 7.5C\n\nDrafted 1st round, 17th overall, 2014\n\nSanheim takes the fourth spot on this list because the first-round pick has the potential to be an elite defender. He still has a lot of developing left and more experience to add, but the future looks bright for Sanheim. In his first year with the Calgary Hitmen, Sanheim posted five goals and 24 assists in 67 WHL games. He is a two-way defenseman who can read the ice well and move the puck well, and he has the potential to be an offensive defenseman at the next level. He is still fairly raw at the Canadian major junior level and will need to add some weight to his tall frame.\n\n5. (3) Robert Hagg, D, 7.0C\n\nDrafted 2nd round, 41st overall, 2013\n\nHagg is another one of Philadelphia’s better defensive prospects, but his potential is not as high as Morin, Gostisbehere, or Sanheim. There is a big different in skill between that trio and Hagg, who does not have one particularly dominant aspect of his game. Though he was inconsistent for stretches, Hagg found a solid amount of playing time with MODO in 2013-14. He also played well in the World Junior Championship last year, helping Sweden to a silver medal. Hagg, who came over to the AHL after his season in Sweden finished, will start the 2014-15 season with the Phantoms.\n\n6. (7) Mark Alt, D, 7.0C\n\nTrade with Carolina Hurricanes, January 13th, 2013\n\nThe talent level from Philadelphia’s top-tier defensemen to the next level drops significantly. Alt played well last season, which was his first year in the AHL. Thanks to some other Phantom injuries, he took on a big role with the Philadelphia affiliate and even spent some time as a top-line defenseman. At 6’3, Alt is a big defenseman who skates well for his size. He did improve over his first professional season and he showed that he could score, but he still needs more time to develop if he wants to reach the next level.\n\n7. (NR) Nicolas Aube-Kubel, RW, 7.0C\n\nDrafted 2nd round, 48th overall, 2014\n\nAube-Kubel is a two-way forward who plays with a high amount of energy and grit. He is a fast skater, extremely versatile, and is able to play in a variety of different situations. He is also very solid on the back-check and in his own end. He still needs to improve his offensive game, but his speed and versatility should allow him to find a role at the professional level, even if his offensive game does not develop any more.\n\n8. (5) Nick Cousins, C, 7.0C\n\nDrafted 3rd round, 58th overall, 2011\n\nThe Flyers only have two center prospects, which leaves Cousins as the second center behind Laughton. He struggled at times in his AHL campaign last season, but despite the bumps still managed to appear in 70 games and was one of the team leaders in scoring. Cousins, who may not be able to replicate that scoring at an NHL level, is a sound playmaker. Like Laughton and most other Flyers prospects, Cousins is a strong two-way player. He is also willing to play a tough style of hockey, which should fit in well with the Flyers. Because of Cousins’ limited offensive upside, he would probably fill a third-line position.\n\n9. (NR) Mark Friedman, D, 7.0C\n\nDrafted 3rd round, 86th overall, 2014\n\nLike Sanheim and Aube-Kubel, Friedman has limited experience at the next level of hockey. He has only had experience at the junior level with the USHL, but Friedman might have more upside than some of his Flyer prospect counterparts. Similar to some other Philadelphia defensive prospects – such as Gostisbehere – Friedman is on the smaller side but can bring an offensive presence. An extra season in the USHL helped Friedman sharpen his skills on both sides of the puck, and he will have more time to develop during his time with Bowling Green University.\n\n10. (6) Anthony Stolarz, G, 7.0C\n\nDrafted 2nd round, 45th overall, 2012\n\nStolar is by far Philadelphia’s best goalkeeping prospect, and he might the best goalkeeper the organization has had in a while. But for a team like the Flyers, that does not mean much for Stolarz. He has the potential to be a good netminder, especially because of his size, but he is not as talented as some other goaltending prospects. He moves well, can take up space and can take space away – but he still has to work on some technical aspects of his game. Development has not gone as planned for Stolarz, who missed a significant portion of last season after being cut by a skate.\n\n11. (9) Michael Parks, RW, 6.5C\n\nDrafted 5th round, 149th overall, 2010\n\nParks’ position dropped because of the inclusion of several recent Flyers draft picks. Parks, one of Philadelphia’s fastest prospects, has used his speed to open up the ice and create opportunities for his teammates. He has improved over his three years at North Dakota, managing a strong junior year after missing most of his sophomore campaign because of injuries. Parks is a very small forward and that might hinder his ability to replicate his offense at the professional level. He will return to North Dakota for his senior season and another year of development, and could be a third or fourth-line talent at a professional level.\n\n12. (16) Taylor Leier, LW, 6.5C\n\nDrafted 4th round, 117th overall, 2012\n\nLeier is currently the team’s top left-wing prospect, just above Oskar Lindblom and Radel Fazleev. He set career highs in points with Portland last season, a team he also captained. Leier is a two-way forward who would not be able to contribute a lot offensively at the next level, but he plays well defensively. He is a smaller forward at 5’11, but he has excellent leadership qualities and a good work ethic. Last season, Leier attracted attention from Team Canada, and his World Junior appearance with Canada is a testament to just how much he has improved.\n\n13. (13) Reece Willcox, D, 6.5C\n\nDrafted 5th round, 141st overall, 2012\n\nWillcox, a fifth-round pick, has also turned into a surprise prospect for the Flyers. He is not the flashiest of players and does not contribute much offensively, but he is a good defensive defenseman who takes up a lot of space. He has improved over his time with Cornell. He started as a top-four defenseman as a freshman, and as a sophomore he took on more responsibility with the Big Red as a first-pair defenseman. He should continue developing and gaining responsibility, as he will return to Cornell for his junior year.\n\n14. (14) Valeri Vasiliev, D, 6.5C\n\nDrafted 7th round, 201st overall, 2012\n\nIn a prospect group so heavily stacked with defensemen, Vasiliev is in a peculiar situation. He has held his own in the KHL, despite spending last season with an out-of-luck Spartak Moscow. He is a very physical defenseman with little offensive upside, but he should easily be able to make the jump to the North American game. But instead of coming to the Phantoms, Vasiliev has opted to spend another season in Russia, where he will play for Avangard Omsk.\n\n15. (NR) Radel Fazleev, LW, 6.5C\n\nDrafted 6th round, 168th overall, 2014\n\nFazleev did not draw too much attention in his first season with the Calgary Hitmen of the WHL, but he missed part of the season with an injury. So he fell to the sixth round of the NHL draft and seems to be an underrated forward. He did not turn in an extremely productive regular season in the WHL, but he did produce when he returned for the playoffs. The left wing is a smart player who can play well without the puck, which bodes well for his defensive game.\n\n16. (NR) Oskar Lindblom, LW 6.5C\n\nDrafted 5th round, 138th overall, 2014\n\nLindblom is one of Philadephia’s most interesting prospects. He has some assets, as he can score if he is close to the net, and he can play defensively. He is not particularly good with the puck in open ice, however, nor does he possess a great deal of speed. He does play a physical game though and is good at competing for pucks in corners. He is also provides a solid net front presence.\n\nIf he can get stronger and faster, Lindblom could one day develop into a solid complementary winger for the Flyers.\n\n17. (9) Jason Akeson, RW, 6.0B\n\nSigned as a free agent, March 2nd, 2011\n\nAkeson recorded the biggest fall in the rankings. At the AHL level, he consistently showed he is a skilled playmaker who can score. Akeson finally caught up a break last season, when he was called up by the Philadelphia Flyers. He used his opportunity to play in the first round of the NHL playoffs to score some goals. But despite his call up last year, Akeson does not have a high upside and could turn out to be a career minor league player. He might get more chances with the Flyers, and if he does, he could end up being a lower-level forward at the NHL level. But for now, he appears to be minor-league player.\n\n18. (20) Brandon Alderson, RW 6.0C\n\nSigned as a free agent, March 1st, 2013\n\nUnlike Alderson’s right wing counterparts in Aube-Kubel and Parks, there really is not one thing that stands out about Alderson’s game. He also struggled a little bit last season with the Phantoms, but despite the difficulties still played in almost every game. Alderson is a physical forward and is not afraid to fight for the puck in gritty areas. He also spent time on the power play last season with the Phantoms.\n\n19. (18) Marcel Noebels, LW 6.0C\n\nSigned as a free agent, March 1st, 2013\n\nNoebels, who has dropped in the last few rankings, barely made the top 20. With Lindblom and Fazleev joining the Flyers system, the chances of Noebels making it with the big club are even slimmer. Noebels is a two-way forward with very little offensive upside. He is an asset defensively, and he can play on the penalty kill. But the left winger’s development progress has been limited due to injuries and concussion symptoms. If Noebels could keep the injuries at bay, he might be a lower-line, gritty forward.\n\n20. (NR) Jesper Pettersson, D, 6.0D\n\nDrafted 7th round, 198th overall, 2014\n\nWhile several other players were under consideration for this last spot, Pettersson earned it because of his potential. Despite being a seventh-round pick, he could end up being a steal for the Flyers. He is small at 5’9, but unlike Philadelphia’s other undersized defenseman, Pettersson is a defensively oriented blueliner. He is also an aggressive player, despite his small frame. While currently he has little offensive upside, there is potential for that aspect of his game to grow. He was signed by the Flyers to and entry-level contract a few weeks after the draft.",

Why does gender need to come into it? My name, address and student ID all match.”\n\nMultiple universities across Australia allow students to register their gender as “unspecified” or “other”, including the University of Melbourne, Australian National University, University of New South Wales, University of Queensland and University of Adelaide.\n\nAustralian government guidelines released in 2013 also suggest to departments that “where sex and/or gender information is collected … individuals should be given the option to select M (male), F (female) or X (Indeterminate/Intersex/Unspecified).”\n\n“I asked the person on the phone if she could update my gender on the Centrelink systems to match my enrolment and she said, ‘The current software means that isn’t possible,’” Alex said.\n\nCentrelink’s website tells applicants their personal records system only allows male or female gender markers: “If you identify as a non-binary gender, we can only add a note to your personal record.”\n\nTransgender and homeless: the young people who can't get the support they need Read more\n\nAlex said Centrelink staff had not informed them about adding a note, or any other way around the problem. “No one seems to know how to handle this sort of thing. Everyone has systems in place but no one knows how to use them or is trained in it. This stuff is super common, to be honest – it’s annoying and tiring but unsurprising.”\n\nMonash University’s student form advises that “making a change [in gender marker] at the university may have unexpected negative consequences. For example Centrelink payments of student support may be interrupted if university records no longer match your records with Centrelink.”\n\nEloise Brook of the Gender Centre said: “If a system can’t recognise a non-binary person, it’s not just about having someone’s feelings hurt – it’s about how they will access housing, services, how they will study if they can’t get into the system. It’s a good micro example of a macro situation. Gender marker changes are essential to ordinary life, to do all the things you do to participate in society.”\n\nThe executive director of Transgender Victoria, Sally Goldner, said: “If other government agencies have done it, I don’t understand why it would be that hard for Centrelink to do it.\n\n“The sex and gender guidelines were introduced for all government departments in mid-2013, so they’re clearly way overdue. It would also help data collection on all sorts of stuff, we could find out unemployment rates for non-binary people, which we have always suspected are much higher. There are a lot of benefits for society as a whole. It was trans day of visibility last Friday – let’s get done what needs to be done.”\n\nAnother non-binary applicant told Guardian Australia they found the process of registering their gender with Centrelink daunting. “I’m applying for the disability pension and I filled out their form with just male or female options, and I wrote next to it that I am non-binary,” they said. “Hopefully that doesn’t come back to bite me. People like me didn’t get a choice as to what they put on our birth certificate, but we’re still having to play by rules that define us.”\n\nThe University of Sydney said it had provided gender-neutral enrolment options for more than a year. “The University supports the use of the gender ’X’ as an important option for students who do not exclusively identify as either male or female,” it said. “It complies with Australian government requirements regarding the classification of sex and gender and matches the current recording systems used by the Universities Admissions Centre.”\n\nThe gender-fluid generation: young people on being male, female or non-binary | Sarah Marsh and Guardian readers Read more\n\nYouth allowance is available to full-time students or apprentices under 24, or those under 21 who are looking for full-time work.

  "latent_4490": "English singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist\n\nRoger Meddows Taylor (born 26 July 1949) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist, best known as the drummer for the rock band Queen.[1] As a drummer, Taylor was recognised early in his career for his unique sound.[2] He was voted by radio listeners as the eighth-greatest drummer in classic rock music history in a poll conducted by Planet Rock in 2005.[3]\n\nAs a songwriter, Taylor contributed songs to Queen's albums from the beginning, composing at least one track on every album, and often singing lead vocals on his own compositions. He wrote or co-wrote three UK number 1s (\"These Are the Days of Our Lives\",[4] \"Innuendo\" and \"Under Pressure\") and contributed a further five major hits (\"Radio Ga Ga\", \"A Kind of Magic\", \"Heaven for Everyone\", \"Breakthru\", and \"The Invisible Man\").[5] He is also the main writer on the international top-ten hit \"One Vision\", although the track is credited to the whole band. He has collaborated with such artists as Eric Clapton, Roger Waters, Roger Daltrey, Robert Plant, Phil Collins, Genesis, Jimmy Nail, Elton John, Gary Numan, Shakin' Stevens, Foo Fighters, Al Stewart, Steve Vai, Yoshiki, Cyndi Almouzni, and Bon Jovi. As a producer, he has produced albums by Virginia Wolf, Jimmy Nail and Magnum.\n\nIn addition to his drum work, Taylor sometimes played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as the Cross, in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show Pop Quiz, hosted by Mike Read.\n\nIn 2014, he appeared in The Life of Rock with Brian Pern as himself. Taylor is also well known for his falsetto vocal range.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nRoger Taylor was born on 26 July 1949 in the West Norfolk & Lynn Hospital, Exton's Road King's Lynn, Norfolk. The new maternity ward was opened by Princess Elizabeth (the future queen, Elizabeth II), where she was introduced to 16 new mothers including Winifred Taylor, his mother. Taylor first lived at 87 High Street in King's Lynn, and later moved to Beulah Street in the town. Taylor's first school was Rosebury Avenue school.[6] Taylor moved to Truro, Cornwall, south west England, with his mother Winifred, father Michael and younger sister Clare. When he was seven years old, he and some friends formed his first band, The Bubblingover Boys, in which he played the ukulele. He briefly attended Truro Cathedral School; at the age of 13, he joined Truro School as a day boy.[7] At the age of 15, Taylor became a member of The Reaction, a semi-professional rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School. Taylor had originally learned guitar, but became a drummer when he realised he had a more natural aptitude for it. Taylor taught himself to tune his drums, inspired by Keith Moon of The Who because of the \"great drums sounds\" on the early Who records.[8] Another key influence on Taylor was drummer Mitch Mitchell of The Jimi Hendrix Experience, who Taylor stated was his early role model.[9]\n\nIn 1967, Taylor went to London to study dentistry at the London Hospital Medical College,[10] but he became bored with dentistry. He changed to biology and obtained a BSc at East London Polytechnic.[11]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\n1968–1970: Smile [ edit ]\n\nTaylor met Brian May and Tim Staffell in 1968 after a friend saw an advert on a noticeboard at Imperial College for a drummer. Smile included May on lead guitar, Staffell on lead vocals and bass, and later Taylor on drums. The band lasted for two years before Staffell departed to join Humpy Bong, leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs.\n\nSmile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band the Cross were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play \"Earth\" and \"If I Were a Carpenter\".[12]\n\nJuly 18, 1970– November 6, 1995: Queen [ edit ]\n\nTaylor performing with Queen in 1979.\n\nIn 1969, Taylor was working with Freddie Mercury at the Kensington Market (they were sharing a flat at around the same time). Mercury, then known as Freddie Bulsara, was an avid fan of Smile. The band split up in 1970. In the same year, Taylor turned down the chance to become drummer for Genesis, which led to Phil Collins joining instead.[13] Bulsara convinced the remaining two members of Smile to continue and he eventually joined the band, which he renamed Queen. In 1971, they found bass guitarist John Deacon and brought him into the band, before going on to release their self-titled debut album in 1973. Taylor is the third most credited songwriter for the band, usually contributing one or two tracks per album, and he is considered a prominent songwriter.\n\n1977–present: Solo career [ edit ]\n\nTaylor has had a productive solo career, releasing five albums. His first single was his 1977 \"I Wanna Testify\". He recorded it during Queen's sessions for the News of the World album. The A-side, although a cover of the Parliaments song of the same name, was completely different from the original. The B-side was a self-penned song \"Turn on the TV\".\n\nTaylor's first solo album, Fun in Space, was released in 1981. Taylor performed all vocals and played all instruments aside of about half of the keyboards, which were done by engineer David Richards. With Queen still touring heavily and recording at the time of release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, so he appeared on some European TV shows to promote the single, \"Future Management\", including Top of the Pops. The only other single to come from the album was \"My Country\". The only US single released from the album was \"Let's Get Crazy\".\n\nTaylor's next venture, Strange Frontier, came in June 1984. The three singles from the album were the title track, \"Beautiful Dreams\" (in Portugal only) and \"Man on Fire\", the latter becoming a live favourite for him in later years. No attempts to promote the singles were made since Queen toured to promote The Works, and Taylor did not perform on any TV shows. Strange Frontier included guest appearances by bandmates Freddie Mercury, Brian May and John Deacon. Mercury sang backing vocals on \"Killing Time\", Deacon remixed the B-side \"I Cry For You\" and Rick Parfitt co-wrote and played on \"It's An Illusion\". David Richards, Queen's engineer and producer at the time, also co-wrote two of the tracks. The album includes covers of Bruce Springsteen's \"Racing in the Street\" and Bob Dylan's \"Masters of War\".\n\nIn 1986, Taylor co-produced Vigilante, the sixth studio album by rock band Magnum.[14]\n\nAfter Queen finished their 1986 Magic Tour, Taylor started a new band, The Cross, which released three albums over their six years of existence. In 1993, the band split up, after performing one final gig at the Gosport Festival.[15]\n\nIn 1994, Taylor worked with Yoshiki, drummer and pianist of X Japan and released the song \"Foreign Sand\" and a reworking of the Cross's \"Final Destination\". The album Happiness? was \"Dedicated to the tasmanian tiger – thylacinus cynocephalus, but most especially... for Freddie\". \"Nazis 1994\" from this album became Taylor's first hit single in England and was followed by two other top 40 UK hits, \"Happiness\" and \"Foreign Sand\".\n\nIn 1998, Taylor released his fourth solo album Electric Fire.[16] He supported it with a small tour in the spring of 1999, on which Brian May joined him at the gig in Wolverhampton. Taylor also performed one of the first Internet-gigs – for which he got a mention in the Guinness Book of World Records.[17]\n\nIn 2010, after nearly twelve years between solo albums, Taylor planned to release a new studio album titled The Unblinking Eye. The first single, of the same name, was released on 23 November 2009 as a digital download, but due to popular demand it was released as a limited edition single.[18] Originally leaked to the official Queen fan club's website for members only, it still managed to be on YouTube within hours of the early bird release. It was announced in late 2012 that fans would be able to vote on which songs appeared on the new album, with the album itself slated for release that year.\n\nThe album is called Fun on Earth,[19] and was released on 11 November 2013.[20]\n\nThe Cross [ edit ]\n\nThe Cross were a side project of Taylor's that existed from 1987 to 1993 and released three albums. While still the drummer for Queen, Taylor fronted the Cross as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist. On its debut release, The Cross incorporated dance influences which they dropped on their remaining two albums. The band never enjoyed much commercial success, except in Germany.\n\nShove It [ edit ]\n\nAfter Queen's 1986 Magic Tour, the band members went their separate ways to do various solo work. Taylor decided to form a new band with whom he could tour. He had already written and recorded the album himself before finding a band to play the songs with. He eventually placed an ad for band members in a national newspaper, hinting he was a famous rock musician. The position of keyboard player was duly offered to Spike Edney after two successful Queen tours in which Edney had played. When the auditions were over, the line-up was completed by Peter Noone on bass, Clayton Moss on guitar and Josh Macrae on drums. Taylor himself would take the responsibility on lead vocals and rhythm guitar.\n\nThe first album, Shove It, was released in 1988.[21][22] In Europe, 'Heaven for Everyone\" (later a Queen song) contained Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and Taylor on backing vocals. However, on the single version and American album version the roles were switched. The European CD contained an extra track (compared to cassette and LP) in the 2nd Shelf Mix, the US version having \"Feel The Force\" as its extra track. The band promoted hard (especially in Germany), with many TV performances of singles including an appearance at the Montreux Golden Rose festival in 1988. The tour took in dates in the UK and Germany. Three singles were released from the album: \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"Heaven for Everyone\" and \"Shove It\". Another single, \"Manipulator\", was released in 1988, but it was not included on any album. It was also the only song from the time that had joint writing credits, Taylor sharing them with Edney and Steve Strange.\n\nMad, Bad and Dangerous to Know [ edit ]\n\nTaylor performing with the Cross in 1990.\n\nAfter finishing Queen's 1989 album The Miracle, Taylor went into the studio with the rest of the Cross for the first time to record Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know. The band composed the opening track \"On Top of the World Ma\" with a riff bearing a resemblance to the Led Zeppelin track \"Whole Lotta Love\". The rest of the album consisted mainly of individually written songs, except for \"Power To Love\" which was the result of the combined effort of Macrae, Noone and Moss. Clayton Moss sang lead vocals on his own track \"Better Things\", and Spike Edney played mandolin on \"Final Destination\", which was written by Taylor. \"Final Destination\" was released as a single, as were \"Liar\" and \"Power To Love\", the latter being the last single to be released in the UK by the band. \"Final Destination\" came with a live rendition of Taylor's song \"Man on Fire\" as a B-side, and \"Liar\" (Noone) had a brand new track, \"In Charge of My Heart\", which was also penned by Taylor. The 12\" single and CD of \"Liar\" also included extended remixes of both \"Liar\" and \"In Charge of My Heart\". The instrumental section at the beginning of \"In Charge of My Heart\" was used as the opening to concerts on the accompanying tour. \"Closer To You\" (Edney) had been planned to be released in America, but never was. The group having seemingly given up on the UK market, the accompanying tour only included dates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Ibiza. Unusual for such tours, every song from the new album was played live.\n\nBlue Rock [ edit ]\n\nMade at a time when Taylor's efforts were concentrated on Queen and Mercury himself, Blue Rock gave the other members of the band a chance to take control of the upcoming album. It was in fact mostly written by Edney, who contributed three of his own tracks and contributed to four more. Once again the opening track was penned by the entire band, \"Bad Attitude\" was written (although not complete) by the Christmas fan club party of 1990. The album itself contained a lot of vocals not from Taylor, but mainly of Edney and Noone. Examples of this can be heard in \"Put It All Down To Love\" (Edney), \"Life Changes\" (Moss, Noone, Edney and Macrae) and \"Heartland\" (The B-side to Life Changes, penned by Noone). Blue Rock itself was only released in Germany (although promo copies were released in Italy and Japan), so copies are somewhat rare. \"New Dark Ages\" (Taylor) was released in Germany with another live version of \"Man on Fire\", whilst \"Life Changes\" was released with the B-side \"Heartland\". It was however immediately withdrawn due to Mercury's death. The tour was in support of Magnum, so the concert lengths were short (45 mins.) and very few bootlegs have survived. The tour pace was rapid, covering 20 dates in one month.\n\nBreak-up of the Cross [ edit ]\n\nThe band broke up in 1993 after performing a final show. Taylor continued working with Queen and produced solo albums. Drummer Macrae accompanied Taylor on his solo tours and also played percussion at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Both Taylor and keyboardist Edney participated in the Queen + Paul Rodgers tours, while Macrae worked behind the scenes as co-producer, sound engineer and Pro Tools engineer for them. In the late 1990s, Edney formed the SAS Band (\"Spike's All Stars\"), a group with an ever-changing line-up of popular '80s musicians.\n\n21st century [ edit ]\n\nTaylor has appeared along with May for various other events and promotions, including Queen's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001[23] and the \"Party at the Palace\" in 2002, celebrating the golden jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.[24] In 2004, Taylor, May, and Mike Dixon received the Helpmann Award for Best Music Direction for the musical We Will Rock You.[25] At Live Earth in 2007, Taylor opened the concert with Taylor Hawkins of Foo Fighters and Chad Smith of Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\nTaylor and May, performing as Queen, also appeared three times on the American singing contest television show American Idol. The first appearance was on 11 April 2006, during which that week's contestants were required to sing a Queen song. Songs performed included \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Fat Bottomed Girls\", \"The Show Must Go On\", \"Who Wants to Live Forever\", and \"Innuendo\". The second time Queen appeared was on the show's season 8 finale in May 2009, performing \"We Are the Champions\" with finalists Adam Lambert and Kris Allen. The third appearance was during the eleventh season on 25 and 26 April 2012, performing a Queen medley with the six finalists on the first show. The following day, they performed \"Somebody to Love\" with the Queen Extravaganza band.[26]\n\nIn November 2009, Taylor appeared on the reality TV show The X Factor with May as Queen mentoring the contestants, performing \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". Also in that month, Taylor confirmed he was planning to tour with Taylor Hawkins, which Taylor described as a \"quick tour\".[27] At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards on 6 November, Queen received the Global Icon Award, and Taylor and May closed the awards ceremony, with Adam Lambert on vocals, performing \"The Show Must Go On\", \"We Will Rock You\", and \"We Are the Champions\".[28] In 2011, Taylor, along with Steven Tyler and Roger Daltrey, joined the advisory board of Edge Music Network. Taylor performed in the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London on 12 August.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, Taylor served as an executive producer of the film Solitary, directed by Sasha Krane. In addition to those duties, he provided original music, including the song \"When We Were Young\" and three instrumental songs which serve as incidental/background music in the film and during the closing credits. Taylor also appeared as special guest for Welsh Rock artist Jayce Lewis and his project Protafield, with Taylor providing drums on the track \"Wrath\".[29][30][31] On 15 November 2014, Taylor joined the charity group Band Aid 30, playing drums alongside current British and Irish pop acts on the latest version of the track \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the 2014 Ebola crisis in Western Africa.[32]\n\nOn 5 and 6 September 2015, Taylor, along with Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones, joined Foo Fighters on stage in Milton Keynes to perform a cover of the Queen and David Bowie song \"Under Pressure\".\n\nInfluences and favourite drummers [ edit ]\n\nTaylor has stated that his early role model as a drummer was Mitch Mitchell of The Jimi Hendrix Experience. He said: \"I still think listening to Mitch Mitchell, especially the early stuff with Hendrix, is just fantastic. This fusion of jazz technique and wonderful riffs but with this rolling ferocious attack on the whole kit, it had lots of jazz influences I think. In fact for me he played the kit like a song, it was just wonderful. Total integration into the song. Not just marking time\".[9]\n\nTaylor has also expressed great admiration for John Bonham of Led Zeppelin. Speaking of Bonham, Taylor said, \"The greatest rock and roll drummer of all time was John Bonham, who did things that nobody had ever even thought possible before with the drum kit. And also the greatest sound out of his drums – they sounded enormous, and just one bass drum. So fast on it that he did more with one bass drum than most people could do with three, if they could manage them. And he had technique to burn and fantastic power and tremendous feel for rock and roll\".[9] However, for just sheer technique, Taylor described the jazz and big band drummer Buddy Rich as \"the best I've ever seen\".[9]\n\nSpeaking to Modern Drummer in 1984, Taylor also described Keith Moon, the drummer of The Who, as \"absolutely brilliant...he had a total unique style; he didn't owe anyone anything.\"[8]\n\nTributes [ edit ]\n\nA species of the genus Heteragrion (Odonata : Zygoptera) from Brazil was named Heteragrion rogertaylori in honour of Taylor in 2013, with the etymology: \"I name this species after Roger Taylor, drummer and songwriter, whose powerful sound, wonderful lyrics and raspy voice have enchanted the world for over four decades.\"[33]\n\nIn 1999, Taylor became the first living person, other than members of the British Royal Family, to appear on a Royal Mail stamp, being seen behind Freddie Mercury as part of a \"Great Britons\" issue. This caused controversy as it was an understood rule that the only living people allowed to appear on British stamps could be members of the Royal Family.[34][35]\n\nIn 2002, Taylor appeared on the \"Twelve Drummers Drumming\" Christmas card in the \"Twelve Days of Christmas\" set sold at Woolworths to raise money for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children – alongside Duran Duran's drummer of the same name.[36]\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nSolo albums [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]",

  "latent_4549": "This is the first in a two-part essay that discusses how 10 years after an invasion and occupation that killed hundreds of thousands of people, destroyed much of the country's infrastructure and unleashed an ongoing storm of brutal sectarian violence, Baghdad is in the midst of a year-long celebration of its return as a \"capital of Arab culture\". Part 2 will explore how artists, educators and (h)ac(k)tivists are moving Iraq slowly to the kind of socio-political space in which fundamental change can occur.\n\nImagine if New York, Paris or London had been closed off from world since 1968, subject to over three decades of dictatorial rule, three wars, two foreign invasions, a dozen years of crippling sanctions that claimed over 100,000 of its children, and almost a decade of occupation and deadly inter-communal conflict.\n\nThis is what Baghdad has gone through for most of the last half century.\n\nAnd yet, 10 years after an invasion and occupation that killed hundreds of thousands of people, destroyed much of the country's infrastructure and unleashed an ongoing storm of brutal sectarian violence, Baghdad is in the midst of a year-long celebration of its return as a \"capital of Arab culture\"; indeed, as a fledging voice in the global cultural ecumene.\n\nIraq remains a deeply troubled country. Almost two years after the official US withdrawal, the Maliki government continues to demonstrate a decided lack of interest in offering the country's once dominant Sunni majority a significant enough share of power to drain the most important cause of the ongoing sectarian conflict. Nor has it displayed the kind of managerial competence that would enable it productively to utilise the roughly $100bn the country earns from oil exports (that number will likely more than double in the next few years) to reconstruct - never mind further develop - the country at a pace commensurate with the resources at its disposal.\n\nInstead, the government has adopted an increasingly harsh hand against all opponents, who are more often labelled as terrorists than engaged as participants in a national political dialogue on the country's present and future course. The massacre in Hawija in late April and the ongoing harassment (and worse) of activists across the political spectrum - especially Sunnis - are the latest examples of such policies.\n\nLA Times correspondent Ned Parker well describes the tensions sweeping across Iraq today, including in Baghdad, in a May 10 article from the capital. He argues that the country is at a dangerous crossroads, at which civil war and break-up increasingly seem the two most likely paths before it.\n\nBut these troubling realities are not the whole story; far from it.\n\nThe Museum versus the Archive\n\nThe stark contrasts characterising life in Iraq today, and the promises and dangers they portend, are well captured by the conditions at two of Iraq's most important institutions -the National Archives and the National Museum. Both were nearly destroyed in the early days of the US invasion in 2003; the former by US bombs, the latter by looting. A decade later, their conditions are quite different. The Museum has recovered perhaps the majority of the pieces that were stolen. During a visit last week (tellingly, the Museum remains closed to most Iraqis, but it was opened specially for participants in an international conference I was attending) I saw the collection that was literally breathtaking.\n\nThousands of artifacts, from tiny cuneiform cylinders to 6 by 10 metre wall carvings, and every kind of vase, bowl, figurine and human-headed bull statue in between - are on display, providing a visual tapestry for understanding Iraq's ancient and early Islamic history. However much has been lost, and is no doubt irreplaceable, the overall image(s) of Iraq's famed ancient history, which in so many ways is at the core of human cultural history, is according to the museum officials with whom I spoke relatively intact.\n\nA very different situation portends at the National Archives, which along with much of the National Library were destroyed by US bombs during the 2003 invasion in an act that historian Juan Cole describes as \"Cliocide\" - the destruction of a country's historical legacy so intense it can be considered an act of cultural genocide (Clio is the ancient Greek muse of history). The loss is unfathomable.\n\nI did not have the chance to investigate the status of the ancient, early Islamic and medieval documents when I visited the Archive. However, when I asked officials about the Ottoman era documents I was told they were almost entirely destroyed. The same occurred with the Republican-era documentation of the 1950s and 60s, from the end of the monarchy till the Baath Party seized power in 1968.\n\nLet us return to occupied New York - or better, Washington, DC. Imagine that the vast majority of the documentary record of American history contained in the Library of Congress and National Archives between the 17th and 20th centuries was destroyed by Iraq during its invasion of the US. Imagine that almost none of the destroyed documents -the collective heritage, history and thus identity of the American people - had even been explored yet by scholars, so there have been few if any histories published that used these documents, and thus could at least partially preserve their contents for future generations. Imagine, then, that centuries of American history were simply deleted or erased, gone forever, never to be known by anyone - as if they never happened.\n\nImagine too that the presidencies of Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson were in good measure also lost to the historical record. The chance to study them gone with the wind like the millions of flecks of ash that floated away from the rubble of the Iraqi National Library after the US bombed it. Now imagine trying to understand the subsequent history of the US when so much of the past is forever gone from view. That is precisely what has happened in Iraq.\n\nHaving spent much time in the central Ottoman archives in Istanbul researching the 19th and early 20th century history of Iraq, I can say that few if any of the destroyed documents exist there in any form, or in the British, French. Austrian or German archives as well. They are simply gone. We do not even know what we will never know.\n\nDespite the horrific nature of the loss, what is available to scholars - and the staff of the archives is working to ensure that what remains is digitised and permanently preserved for future generations - is a treasure trove of documents about the British Mandate era and, a generation after it ended, Baathist rule as well. Thousands of boxes of documents are waiting to be studied by scholars; there is little doubt that academic careers will be made in the document room as a new generation of Iraqi scholars and their foreign counterparts begin to explore them. Just one file I randomly opened contained a host of documents from the first days of Baathist control in 1968; another discussed the changing nature of land tenure in British-ruled Mesopotamia.\n\nSteps forward and back\n\nThe state of the Museum and the Archives, the destruction and the hope they contain, exemplifies the contradictory dynamics of life in Iraq as it slowly, and hopefully surely, emerges out of a decade of war, occupation and violence, and two generations of dictatorial rule, war and sanctions before that. So much has been lost, and yet with what remains much can be done and a future, however tentatively, built.\n\nOn the one hand, if one remains pessimistic it would certainly be easy to travel across the largely Sunni Arab mid-section of Iraq and northern cities such as Mosul and sense impending doom, a feeling grounded in the ongoing reality of living among or near the communities that lost the most with the US invasion and occupation, and the emergence of a Shia-dominated Iraq in their wake.\n\nBut however deep and structural remain Iraq's divisions and the problems that attend them, there are important countervailing signs, and some realities, auguring for at least the possibility of a more positive future. For Kurds and Shia, who together make up well over 80 percent of the country's population, the ending of Saddam Hussein's Baathist regime created the chance for a political and communal life that would have remained impossible under the former system. Their success does not equal Iraq's; indeed, it has encouraged conflict with Sunnis on the butt end of the new system. (There is even talk today by Sunnis of following the Kurds' example and establishing an autonomous region, if not leaving the country all together in order to best protect their interests.)\n\nDespite the government's authoritarian streak and continued inter-communal and regional tensions, the present conflicts exhibit the potential for a transformation towards the kind of political struggles by citizens that could help heal rather than further tear apart the country. This is exemplified by attempts by local leaders in Fallujah, once the capital of the violent Sunni insurgency, to build a peaceful grassroots resistance movement against the government explicitly modelled on the present pro-democracy wave sweeping the region. The violence of the government crackdown can in fact be seen as confirming its potential to challenge Iraq's present balance of political power.\n\nIndeed, as many Iraqis like to tell it, the problem is not between individual members of the country's communities; it is at the political level, where incentives to ameliorate many conflicts that pit Iraqis against each other often lose out to the narrower but more immediate benefits that can accrue to those who would not but little incentive to work towards are various interests who benefit from ongoing conflict as long as it can lead to a bigger slice of Iraq's considerable and growing economic pie.\n\nHowever problematically, the Iraqi Parliament is functioning (particularly at the committee level, where the structures of the country's political future are slowly being created). As important, it is both open to pressure by various groups within society, and even shows some backbone against Maliki, with the Parliament Chief demanding the present cabinet resign after a report by the body blamed security forces for the bloodshed. The electoral process is relatively fair; indeed, Prime Minister Maliki's political woes are likely to cost him significantly in the upcoming elections. Even Moqtada' al-Sadr has become a powerful \"good governance\" advocate, taking on government abuses and corruption with the same political deftness and inter-communal spirit that characterised his resistance against the US during the occupation.\n\nMore broadly, despite numerous areas in which systematic abuses of political, civil and human rights remain common, Iraqis are becoming increasingly adept at defending and even advancing their rights, across the political and social spectrum. Almost all the news one reads, watches or hears about Iraq is negative, with a few culture-themed articles to keep the reporting interesting. And despite all the negativity that continues to exist, when you are in Iraq and meeting with Iraqis from the creative and rights communities, an entirely different sense of Iraq's present realities and future possibilities emerges. Iraq suddenly looks not like a laggard in a region moving, however haphazardly, towards a more democratic future. Instead, the country's complexities come into full view: Its political dynamics closer to the cutting edge of regional change and its cultural production equally on the regional avant-garde.\n\n'No one thinks about the car bombs anymore'\n\nSo explained one young Iraqi civil society activist when I queried about the wisdom of leisurely driving around the city, never mind with unmistakably foreign-looking passengers in the car. His answer may not reflect the sentiments of all Iraqis; but it is clear that despite the uptick in violence during April, Baghdad is, after so much bloodshed, once again becoming a livable city. For me, the most immediate indicator of progress is the fact that one can breathe the air without feeling sick, a major improvement over the height of the occupation, when electricity was so unreliable that the city hummed with the cacophonous polyphony of thousands of old and extremely polluting diesel generators.\n\nTo be sure, the city writ large remains highly militarised, as soldiers, security personnel and check points set up at as little as every 50 metres. Getting into and out of the International (formerly Green) Zone is almost as complicated and difficult as getting into - or worse, out of - Gaza. Getting into the airport when you have to leave is almost as bad, while the Museum remains as heavily guarded as most Treasuries. Roads are still dotted with checkpoints packed so close together that they paralyse traffic, making travelling on a hot weekday afternoon even more oppressive than Cairo.\n\nDespite all the obstacles, the fact is that Iraqis now routinely move across the city in relative safety, whether running to a meeting or heading out for a midnight falafel, is no longer novel; it is today the norm. While Baghdad can still have the feel of a post-apocalyptic city, the blast walls that cordon off so many neighbourhoods and most every significant building are slowly beginning to come down. One can even imagine a cityscape dotted with the kind of kitschy post-modernist skyscrapers that define the skylines of Abu Dhabi, Doha and Dubai if Baghdad can pass the next few years without a major explosion of violence. Whether this is desirable is another matter entirely. As a senior politician from one of the country's main religious parties put it as we drove around the city discussing possible futures, \"Let that happen to another city. Let Baghdad keep its old character.\"\n\nEven the hostility (and high potential for violence) towards foreigners - which defined Baghdad in the mid-to-late 2000s - has substantially faded. Seeing a clearly identifiable Westerner on the street or in a café still turns heads, but it is most likely to generate smiles and even request for a photo, perhaps to prove to friends that European or Americans are actually coming to Iraq again.\n\nA young Iraqi friend, who lost his father and older brother in a suicide car bombing at the height of the violence, best summarised the realities of the present and the possibilities for the future. He explained that he hoped his mother could leave Iraq and live with one of his surviving siblings in North America. And yet he remains determined to stay in Iraq in order to help build a different future.\n\nEmerging rights cultures\n\nFew who have not lived through the level of tragedy with which so many Iraqis live can fathom how someone who has lost so much has the ability to build their lives so constructively. One of the more positive but least reported aspects of Iraq's political development is the evolution of a human rights culture throughout the country at the grassroots level. As Hanaa Edwar and Jamal Jawahiri of the Iraqi al-Amal Association(one of the premier human rights groups in the country) told me, there are today hundreds of independent NGOs that work in increasingly close coordination and have achieved important victories in a number of areas, including gender, health, education and children's rights. Discarded as a \"Western\" threat to local/Islamic values only a few years ago, human rights discourse has now become a given across the political spectrum, thanks to the constant efforts by their and similar organisations.\n\n\"We're deliberately not political. But I guess all of our work is, in the end, political.\" A hacktivist\n\n\"The rest of the Arab world can learn a lot from our experiences. We are advising colleagues in Tunis, Libya and Egypt on issues related to proper constitutional language, parliamentary procedures and protecting women's rights or free speech,\" they went on.\n\nIn addition to the movements traditionally associated with political parties and various syndicates, there are hundreds of independent civil society organisations across Iraq building not just grassroots political cultures, but cultures of civic engagement more broadly as well. It is not merely within the human rights-related sector that advances are occurring. Organisations focusing on the rights of children, like the Noor Foundation for the Rights of the Child, have built up significant networks across the country that are strengthening (albeit slowly) awareness of the need to focus on protecting and advocating for the children across all levels of society.\n\nOther organisations are focusing on doing community art and education, even in seemingly inhospitable locations like the heart of Sadr City. And hackers are increasingly taking a role in Baghdad's and Iraq's post-occupation life. Not as a politically revolutionary force, as they had in Tunis and/or Egypt, but within the framework of the old hacker's credo in which young people both assume control and responsibility for their lives and use social media and computer technology more broadly as a tool of social freedom without being directly political.\n\nIndeed, if there is one dynamic that seems to be emerging in the present circumstances in Iraq, it is that even as direct political activism can be fraught with peril for those operating outside official networks, social activism and creating new communities is laying the groundwork for a more robust level of political engagement by Iraq's emerging generation, repeating a process that profoundly shaped Tunis' and Egypt's futures beginning about a decade ago. \"We're deliberately not political,\" one hacktivist declared to me, \"But I guess all of our work is, in the end, political.\"\n\nIn Part 2 of this story, I explore how artists, educators and (h)ac(k)tivists are moving Iraq slowly to the kind of socio-political space in which fundamental change can occur. In the process they have managed to move beyond the anger and resentment towards the US and its allies, and all the destruction the last 10 years have wrought, and achieve a level of forgiveness and pragmatism - and through them, internal reconciliation - that forces those still viscerally angered about the war and committed to seeking retribution against its main perpetrators to consider how best to help Iraq move towards a democratic and sustainable future while also ensuring the process which enabled the 2003 invasion all it has produced cannot be repeated.\n\nMark LeVine is professor of Middle Eastern history at UC Irvine and distinguished visiting professor at the Centre for Middle Eastern Studies at Lund University in Sweden and the author of the forthcoming book about the revolutions in the Arab world, The Five Year Old Who Toppled a Pharaoh.

  "latent_4558": "In some ways the Syrian civil war resembles a proxy chess match between supporters of the Bashar al-Assad regime—Iran, Iraq, Russia and China—and its opponents—Turkey, the oil monarchies, the U.S., Britain and France. But the current conflict only resembles chess if the game is played with multiple sides, backstabbing allies, and conflicting agendas.\n\nTake the past few weeks of rollercoaster politics.\n\nThe blockbuster was the U.S.-engineered rapprochement between Israel and Turkey, two Washington allies that have been at loggerheads since Israeli commandos attacked a humanitarian flotilla bound for Gaza and killed eight Turks and one Turkish-American. When Tel Aviv refused to apologize for the 2010 assault, or pay compensation to families of the slain, Ankara froze relations and blocked efforts at any NATO-Israeli cooperation.\n\nUnder the prodding of President Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu phoned his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and buried the hatchet. The apology “was offered the way we wanted,” Erdogan said, and added “We are at the beginning of a process of elevating Turkey to a position so that it will again have a say, initiative and power, as it did in the past.”\n\nThe détente will align both countries with much of Washington’s agenda in the region, which includes overthrowing the Assad government and isolating Iran. Coupled with a Turkish push to resolve the long simmering war between Ankara and its Kurdish minority, it was a “Fantastic week for Erdogan,” remarked former European Union policy chief Javier Solana.\n\nIt was also a slam dunk moment for the Israelis, whose intransigence over the 2010 incident and continued occupation of Palestinian and Syrian lands has left the country more internationally isolated than it has been in its 65 year history.\n\nIsrael’s apology might lay the groundwork for direct intervention in Syria by NATO and Israel. In recent testimony before Congress, Admiral James Stavridis, the head of U.S. European Command and NATO’s top commander, said that a more aggressive posture by the Obama administration vis-à-vis Syria “would be helpful in breaking the deadlock and bringing down the regime.”\n\nAccording to the Guardian (UK), Netanyahu raised the possibility of joint U.S.-Israeli air strikes against Syria, which Israel accuses of shifting weapons to its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. There is no evidence that Syria has actually done that, and logic would suggest that the Assad regime is unlikely to export weapons when it is fighting for its life and struggling to overcome an arms embargo imposed on it by the EU and the UN. But Tel Aviv is spoiling for a re-match with Hezbollah, the organization that fought it to a standstill in 2006. “What I hear over and over again from Israeli generals is that another war with Hezbollah is inevitable,” a former U.S. diplomat told the Guardian.\n\nThere is some talk among Israelis about establishing a “buffer zone” inside Syria to prevent Islamic groups becoming a presence on the border. A similar buffer zone established after Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon turned into a strategic disaster for Tel Aviv.\n\nAdmiral Stavridis suggested that a more aggressive posture would almost certainly not include using U.S. ground troops. According to former Indian diplomat M. K. Bhadrakumar, a more likely scenario would be for NATO air power to smash Assad’s air force and armor—as it did Mummer Khadafy’s in Libya—and “if ground forces need to be deployed inside Syria at some stage, Turkey can undertake that mission, being a Muslim country belonging to NATO.”\n\nThe Gulf monarchies—specifically Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Jordan—have increased arms shipments to the anti-Assad insurgents, and France and Britain are considering breaking the embargo and arming the Free Syrian Army. If this were a normal chess game, it would look like checkmate for Assad, Hezbollah, and Iran. But this game is three-dimensional, with multiple players sometimes pursuing different goals.\n\nQatar and Saudi Arabia are pouring what one American official called “a cataract of weaponry” into Syria, but the former apparently double-crossed the latter in a recent leadership fight in the Syrian National Coalition (SNC), the umbrella organization for the various groups fighting against the Damascus government. Qatar derailed Saudi Arabia’s candidate for the SNC’s prime minister and slipped its own man into the post, causing the organization’s president, Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, to resign. While most the western media reported Khatib resigned because SNC was not getting enough outside help, according to As-Safir, the leading Arabic language newspaper in Lebanon, it was over the two big oil monarchies trying to impose their candidates on the Syrians.\n\nQatar ally Ghassan Hitto, a Syrian-American, was anointed prime minister, causing a dozen SNC members to resign. The Free Syrian Army, too, says it will not recognize Hitto.\n\nKhatib also objected to the Qatari move to form a Syrian government because it torpedoed last June’s Geneva agreement that would allow Assad to stay on until a transitional government is formed. The Qatari move was essentially a statement that the Gulf monarchy would accept nothing less than an outright military victory.\n\nQatar is close to the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, while Saudi Arabia favors the more extremist Islamic groups, some with close links to al-Qaida, that the U.S. and the European Union have designated as “terrorist.” Tension between extremist and more moderate insurgents broke into an open firefight Mar. 24 in the northern border city of Tal Abyad. The secular Farouq Battalions, which favor elections and a civil government, were attacked by the Jabhat al-Nusra, or Nusra Front, that wants to impose Sharia Law and establish an Islamic emirate. Four people were killed, and the leader of the Farouq Battalions was severely wounded.\n\nThe Nusra Front has also tangled with Kurdish groups in Syria’s northwest, and its militias currently control much of the southern border with Iraq, Jordan, and the Golan Heights that borders Israel. It was the Nusra Front that recently kidnapped UN peacekeepers for several days and attacked Iraqi soldiers escorting members of the Syrian military who had fled across the border. There have also been clashes between secular and Islamic forces in the Syrian cities of Shadadeh and Deir el Zour.\n\nThe Turkish government backing of the Syrian insurgency is not popular among most Turks, and that has to concern Erdogan, because he is trying to alter the Turkey’s constitution to make it more executive-centered and to himself become the next president. Although he is currently riding a wave of popularity over the Kurdish ceasefire, that could erode if the Syria war drags on.\n\nAnd without direct NATO-Israeli intervention there does not appear to be any quick end to the civil war in sight. Assad still has support from his minority ethnic group, the Alawites, as well as among Christian denominations and many business groups. All fear an Islamic takeover. “If the rebels come to this city,” one wealthy Damascus businessman told Der Spiegel, “they’ll eat us alive.”\n\nThe longer the war goes on, the more the region destabilizes.\n\nFighting has broken out between Shiites and Sunnis in northern Lebanon, a Sunni-extremist fueled bombing campaign is polarizing Iraq, and Jordan is rent by an internal opposition that poses a serious threat to the Hashemite monarchy. Even Saudi Arabia has problems. A low-level but persistent movement for democracy in the country’s eastern provinces is resisting a brutal crackdown by Saudi authorities. As National Public Radio and GlobalPost reporter Reese Erlich discovered, some of those regime opponents are being given a choice between prison and fighting the Assad government, a strategy that the Saudi government may come to regret. It was jihadists sent to oppose the Soviets in Afghanistan who eventually returned to destabilize countries in the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa, and who currently form the backbone of al-Qaida-associated groups like the Nusra Front.\n\nAaron Zelin, Middle East expert and Fellow at the Washington Institute told Erlich that fighters from Saudi Arabia, Libya, Tunisia, and Jordan are being funneled into Syria.\n\nChess with multiple players can get tricky.\n\nTurkey wants regional influence and Assad out, but it does not want a neighbor dominated by the Gulf monarchies. It may also find that talking about Turkish “power” doesn’t go down well in the Middle East. Arab countries had quite enough of that during the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe Gulf monarchies want to overthrow the secular Assad regime, isolate regional rival Iran, and insure Sunni supremacy over Shites in the region. But they don’t agree on what variety of Islam they want, nor are they the slightest bit interested in democracy and freedom, concepts that they have done their best to suppress at home.\n\nThe French and British want a replay of Libya, but Syria is not a marginal country on the periphery of the Middle East, but a dauntingly complex nation in the heart of the region that might well atomize into ethnic-religious enclaves run by warlords. That is not an outcome that sits well with other European nations and explains their hesitation about joining the jihad against Assad.\n\nEven the Israeli goal of breaking out of its isolation, destroying Hezbollah, and strangling Iran may be a pipe dream. Regardless of Turkish-Israeli detente, the barriers that keep Palestinians out of Israel also wall off Tel Aviv off from the rest of the Middle East, and that will not change until there is an Israeli government willing to remove most of the settlements and share Jerusalem.\n\nAs for Hezbollah, contrary to its portrayal in the Western media as a cat’s paw for Teheran, the Shite group is a grassroots organization based in Lebanon’s largest ethnic group. It is also being careful not to give the Israelis an excuse to attack it. In any case, any Israeli invasion of Lebanon would automatically rally international sentiment and Arab public opinion—Shite, Sunni, Alawite, etc.—against it.\n\nIf Assad falls, Iran would lose an ally, but Teheran’s closest friend in the Middle East is Baghdad, not Damascus. And despite strong American objections, Teheran recently scored a major coup by inking an agreement with Pakistan’s government to build a $7.5 billion gas pipeline to tap Iran’s South Pars field. The pact will not only blow a hole in western sanctions against Iran, it will play well in the May 11 Pakistani elections. “The Pakistani government wants to show it is willing to take foreign policy decisions that defy the U.S.,” says Anthony Skinner of the British-based Maplecroft risk consultants. “The pipeline not only caters to Pakistan’s energy needs but also logged brownie points with the many critics of the U.S. among the electorate.”\n\nIn the end, the effort to knock Syria off the board may succeed, although the butcher bill will be considerably higher than the current body count of 70,000. But establishing a pro-western government in Damascus and inflicting damage on Iran is mostly illusion. “Victory”—particularly a military one—is more likely to end in chaos and instability, and a whole lot more dead chess pieces.\n\nFor more of Conn Hallinan’s essays visit Dispatches From the Edge.

  "latent_4652": "In his Wall Street Journal article from March 11, 2009, former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan rejects the idea that the Fed’s low-interest-rate policy between December 2000 and June 2004 fueled the housing bubble, which in turn laid the foundation for the current economic crisis.\n\n(The federal funds rate was lowered from 6.5% in December 2000 to 1% by June 2003. It was kept at 1% until June 2004 when the rate was raised by 0.25%.)\n\nGreenspan holds that what matters for the housing market is long-term and not short-term interest rates. The Fed, however, doesn’t control long-term rates, argues the former Fed chairman.\n\nAccording to Greenspan, the decline in long-term rates and mortgage rates took place while the Fed had been tightening its interest-rate stance. The federal-funds-rate target was raised from 1% in June 2004 to 4.25% in December 2005.\n\nYet in June 2005 the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 3.92% from 4.58% in June 2004. The 30-year fixed-mortgage rate closed at 5.58% in June 2005 against 6.29% in June 2004.\n\nHow in the world, asks Greenspan, can the Fed be blamed for the housing bubble and the current economic crisis?\n\nWho, then, is to blame for this fall in long-term interest rates and for the present economic crisis?\n\nAccording to Greenspan, the culprit is the savings glut from emerging economies, such as China. This glut of savings was channeled to long-term US Treasuries and other US financial assets thereby depressing their yields, argues the former Fed chairman.\n\nBen Bernanke concurs. In his speech at the Council on Foreign Relations on March 10, 2009 he said,\n\nLike water seeking its level, saving flowed from where it was abundant to where it was deficient, with the result that the United States and some other advanced countries experienced large capital inflows…\n\nWhat Greenspan and Bernanke call “savings” is nothing more than the amount of US dollars that emerging economies accumulated.\n\nThe accumulation of these dollars by emerging economies cannot increase the pool of dollars. The accumulated dollars are part of the existing pool of US money.\n\nWhen a Chinese exporter sells goods to an American importer, he is paid with dollars. This means that the ownership of dollars is changed here, not their quantity.\n\nWith all other things being equal, a sustained decline in long-term yields requires an increase in the pool of dollars. The increase in the pool of dollars means that more American dollars will be employed as the medium of exchange. As a result, the prices of goods and assets move higher, while yields on assets are pushed lower.\n\nHowever, if the accumulated dollars of emerging economies are only invested in US Treasuries, then it is tempting to suggest that a sustained fall in long-term rates without an expansion in the pool of dollars is possible.\n\nWe suggest that this is highly unlikely. If the pool of dollars remains unchanged while the quantity of goods and assets continues to expand, then this will lead to the fall in the average price. (Remember, a price is the number of dollars per unit of a good or asset.)\n\nThis means that explicit and implicit yields will come under upward pressure. (As a result, investors from emerging markets are likely to shift their funds from less-yielding Treasuries to a higher-yielding asset if the pool of dollars remains fixed, thus pushing yields on Treasuries higher.)\n\nIt is only the monetary policy of the Fed  and not the accumulation of dollars by emerging economies  that can set in motion changes in the pool of dollars. Hence, the fall in long-term interest rates and mortgage rates has to be the result of the Fed’s loose monetary stance.\n\nIf what we are saying is valid, then how are we to reconcile the fact that in 2005 long-term rates had been falling while the Fed was tightening its stance?\n\nHistorically, the 30-year fixed-mortgage rate and the federal funds rate have had a tendency to display a very good visual correlation. This doesn’t mean that the correlation is perfect  a discrepancy in the movements between the federal funds rate and long-term rates can occur.\n\nThe emergence of a discrepancy doesn’t imply that suddenly the Fed’s policies have nothing to do with the housing bubble or boom-bust cycles.\n\n(Recall that, because of a discrepancy during June 2004 and June 2005 between the federal funds rate and long-term rates, Greenspan has concluded that his loose monetary policy between December 2000 and June 2004 had nothing to do with the housing bubble.)\n\nVarious discrepancies between the movement in the federal funds rate and the mortgage rate are the result of a variable time-lag effect from changes in monetary policy on various markets.\n\nBecause of the variable time lag, a situation can emerge where long-term rates may ease despite the central bank’s tighter interest-rate stance.\n\nDespite a tighter-interest-rate stance, the previous loose-interest-rate stance may still dominate economic activity. Consequently, in order to maintain a given interest-rate target in the midst of still strong economic activity, the Fed may be forced to push more money into the economy to prevent the federal funds rate from overshooting the target. (For instance, an increase in the federal funds rate from 1% to 2% is a tighter stance, yet the 2% rate can still be too low  strong economic activity pushes the federal funds rate above the target.)\n\nAs a result, more money becomes available for financial markets, which puts downward pressure on long-term rates, all other things being equal.\n\nIn November 2004, the yearly rate of growth of the Fed’s balance sheet jumped to 6.9% from 4.3% in June 2004. Note that this increase in the pace of monetary pumping took place while the federal-funds-rate target was lifted from 1% in June to 2% in November.\n\nAlso note that between December 2004 and June 2005 the average yearly rate of growth of Fed assets stood at a still-elevated 6%.\n\nContrary to Greenspan and other commentators, we suggest that what sets in motion a boom-bust cycle is not a boom in a particular market such as the housing market but the increase in money supply out of “thin air.”\n\nNow let us say that the dollars accumulated by emerging economies were to be invested solely in Treasuries. While this might push long-term interest rates temporarily lower, all other things being equal, it is not going to set in motion a boom-bust cycle as long as the pool of US dollars remains unchanged.\n\nIf, as a result of lower interest rates, too many dollars are invested in the housing market, it means that fewer dollars are invested in other goods. As a result, the housing market will become overvalued while other goods will become undervalued. This will set in motion an outflow of money from the housing market to other markets.\n\nIn our writings we have shown that the main source of boom-bust cycles is the Fed itself. Thus, by aggressively lowering interest rates between December 2000 and June 2004  and accompanying this with monetary pumping  the Fed set in motion an economic boom.\n\nThe boom gave rise to various nonproductive (bubble) activities that emerged on the back of the loose monetary stance of the Fed. The increase in money supply led to the diversion of real funding from wealth-generating activities toward various nonproductive activities.\n\n(Note that these activities cannot stand on their own  they cannot fund themselves. They are funded by diverting  by means of new money created “out of thin air”  real savings from wealth-generating activities.)\n\nFrom June 2004 through September 2007, the Fed adopted a tighter stance, which slowed the diversion of real funding to nonproductive activities.\n\nAs a result of this, various nonproductive activities came under pressure. (Without real funding, these activities are forced to go under.)\n\nNow, when money is injected, it doesn’t instantly affect all the activities in an economy. The money starts with the first recipients and then moves to other recipients. It moves from one market to another market  there is a time lag.\n\nThis means that various nonproductive (bubble) activities are spread across all the markets  the boom is everywhere. Once the Fed tightens its stance it starts a bust, and this weakens various nonproductive activities across all the markets. The severity of the bust is dictated by the size of the boom.\n\n(The percentage of nonproductive activities  the product of the boom  determines the severity of an economic bust in a particular sector of the economy.)\n\nIt follows, then, that a bubble in a particular market cannot emerge without the preceding increases in money supply. This in turn means that a bubble cannot emerge without a preceding loosening of monetary policy, which means it cannot occur without money pumping by the Fed. Hence, what matters for the economic boom, i.e., the emergence of bubbles, is the creation of money “out of thin air” and not the level of long-term interest rates.\n\nContrary to Greenspan, we can conclude that it is not long-term rates as such that fueled the bubble but the loose monetary policy of the Fed.\n\nWe can also conclude that the so-called savings glut in emerging economies had nothing to do with the last economic boom or the current economic crisis.\n\nThe only institution that can set in motion the expansion of money and a false boom is the Fed.\n\nThis article first appeared on Mises.org.\n\nMarch 20, 2009\n\nThe Best of Frank Shostak",

  "latent_4754": "A few weeks ago a postdoc in my lab logged on to Amazon to buy the lab an extra copy of Peter Lawrence’s The Making of a Fly – a classic work in developmental biology that we – and most other Drosophila developmental biologists – consult regularly. The book, published in 1992, is out of print. But Amazon listed 17 copies for sale: 15 used from $35.54, and 2 new from $1,730,045.91 (+$3.99 shipping).\n\nI sent a screen capture to the author – who was appropriate amused and intrigued. But I doubt even he would argue the book is worth THAT much.\n\nAt first I thought it was a joke – a graduate student with too much time on their hands. But there were TWO new copies for sale, each be offered for well over a million dollars. And the two sellers seemed not only legit, but fairly big time (over 8,000 and 125,000 ratings in the last year respectively). The prices looked random – suggesting they were set by a computer. But how did they get so out of whack?\n\nAmazingly, when I reloaded the page the next day, both priced had gone UP! Each was now nearly $2.8 million. And whereas previously the prices were $400,000 apart, they were now within $5,000 of each other. Now I was intrigued, and I started to follow the page incessantly. By the end of the day the higher priced copy had gone up again. This time to $3,536,675.57. And now a pattern was emerging.\n\nOn the day we discovered the million dollar prices, the copy offered by bordeebook was1.270589 times the price of the copy offered by profnath. And now the bordeebook copy was 1.270589 times profnath again. So clearly at least one of the sellers was setting their price algorithmically in response to changes in the other’s price. I continued to watch carefully and the full pattern emerged.\n\nOnce a day profnath set their price to be 0.9983 times bordeebook’s price. The prices would remain close for several hours, until bordeebook “noticed” profnath’s change and elevated their price to 1.270589 times profnath’s higher price. The pattern continued perfectly for the next week.\n\nBut two questions remained. Why were they doing this, and how long would it go on before they noticed? As I amusedly watched the price rise every day, I learned that Amazon retailers are increasingly using algorithmic pricing (something Amazon itself does on a large scale), with a number of companies offering pricing algorithms/services to retailers. Both profnath and bordeebook were clearly using automatic pricing – employing algorithms that didn’t have a built-in sanity check on the prices they produced. But the two retailers were clearly employing different strategies.\n\nThe behavior of profnath is easy to deconstruct. They presumably have a new copy of the book, and want to make sure theirs is the lowest priced – but only by a tiny bit ($9.98 compared to $10.00). Why though would bordeebook want to make sure theirs is always more expensive? Since the prices of all the sellers are posted, this would seem to guarantee they would get no sales. But maybe this isn’t right – they have a huge volume of positive feedback – far more than most others. And some buyers might choose to pay a few extra dollars for the level of confidence in the transaction this might impart. Nonetheless this seems like a fairly risky thing to rely on – most people probably don’t behave that way – and meanwhile you’ve got a book sitting on the shelf collecting dust. Unless, of course, you don’t actually have the book….\n\nMy preferred explanation for bordeebook’s pricing is that they do not actually possess the book. Rather, they noticed that someone else listed a copy for sale, and so they put it up as well – relying on their better feedback record to attract buyers. But, of course, if someone actually orders the book, they have to get it – so they have to set their price significantly higher – say 1.27059 times higher – than the price they’d have to pay to get the book elsewhere.\n\nWhat’s fascinating about all this is both the seemingly endless possibilities for both chaos and mischief. It seems impossible that we stumbled onto the only example of this kind of upward pricing spiral – all it took were two sellers adjusting their prices in response to each other by factors whose products were greater than 1. And while it might have been more difficult to deconstruct, one can easily see how even more bizarre things could happen when more than two sellers are in the game. And as soon as it was clear what was going on here, I and the people I talked to about this couldn’t help but start thinking about ways to exploit our ability to predict how others would price their books down to the 5th significant digit – especially when they were clearly not paying careful attention to what their algorithms were doing.\n\nBut, alas, somebody ultimately noticed. The price peaked on April 18th, but on April 19th profnath’s price dropped to $106.23, and bordeebook soon followed suit to the predictable $106.23 * 1.27059 = $134.97. But Peter Lawrence can now comfortably boast that one of the biggest and most respected companies on Earth valued his great book at $23,698,655.93 (plus $3.99 shipping).",
  "latent_4801": "Documents obtained by the Institute for Justice reveal that the U.S. Department of Justice and the Treasury Department are planning to disqualify all law enforcement agencies in California from participating in equitable sharing, a federal forfeiture program, if the state reforms its civil forfeiture laws. The move would eliminate tens of millions of dollars in federal forfeiture funds, bolstering law enforcement’s efforts to block reform.\n\nThis is no idle threat. Incredibly, after New Mexico outlawed civil forfeiture earlier this year, the federal government “decertified” all law enforcement agencies in the state from cooperating with federal agencies in forfeiture operations.\n\nThe action in New Mexico and the threat in California would not affect law enforcement agencies' ability to seize and forfeit property under either state’s law, only their participation in the more lucrative federal forfeiture procedure.\n\nEquitable sharing allows local and state law enforcement agencies to keep up to 80 percent of forfeiture proceeds if they merely collaborate with a federal agency. The program creates an appalling incentive both to police for profit and circumvent California’s relatively tougher laws on civil forfeiture.\n\nExploiting this loophole has been a boon for law enforcement. A report by the Drug Policy Alliance found widespread profiteering by police in small towns in Southern California. In Beverly Hills, which has just over 30,000 residents, police generated more than $7.3 million in forfeiture revenue from 2006 to 2013, an amount far higher than what the much larger cities of Sacramento, Oakland, Fresno and Long Beach took. Vernon, Calif., (population: 112) managed to take nearly $1 million, or over $8,800 in forfeiture revenue per resident.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, California agencies have seized over $430 million in cash from people never charged with a crime since 9/11. Police have funneled forfeiture proceeds towards salaries, overtime and even a $5 million helicopter.\n\nOutraged at this violation of due process and state sovereignty, California lawmakers are backing SB 443, a forfeiture reform bill. If enacted, the bill would ban state and local law enforcement agencies from receiving any equitable-sharing funding, unless the federal government first convicts the owner of the forfeited property in criminal court. SB 443 would also require a criminal conviction in all state forfeiture cases; existing law only mandates a conviction to forfeit property valued at $25,000 or less. The California Senate already voted 38 to 1 in favor, while the Assembly is expected to vote sometime this week.\n\nYet in July, Justice and the Treasury stated that the state’s reforms would render California agencies “ineligible” to participate in equitable sharing. “I highly doubt our federal agencies can figure out whether a conviction occurred in any timely manner,” wrote Melissa Nasrah, legal counsel for the Treasury Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture, citing a lack of “resources, desire or technical capability.” “It would be prudent to not share with CA agencies should this law be passed,” she added.\n\nIn a lobbying letter, the California District Attorneys Association called this potential loss of funding “devastating” and warned legislators that requiring criminal convictions for forfeiture “will cripple the ability of law enforcement to forfeit assets from drug dealers.” The Association also estimates that “if SB 443 passes, overall forfeiture activity in California would drop by 33%.” Tellingly, the Association’s letter does not mention how property could continue to be forfeited under state law or how using state law would result in all forfeiture proceeds being split between law enforcement and California’s general fund.\n\nIn other states, equitable sharing has stymied forfeiture reform. Take Missouri and North Carolina. Both states ban forfeiture proceeds from funding law enforcement. But their state laws do not apply to federal forfeiture programs, like equitable sharing. Undeterred, police and prosecutors in Missouri and North Carolina have spent over $75 million and $90 million respectively in equitable-sharing funds since 2008.\n\nFortunately, lawmakers are starting to take action to close this pernicious loophole. Earlier this year, New Mexico abolished civil forfeiture entirely. Crucially, the state also banned its law enforcement agencies from transferring seized property to a federal agency “if the transfer would circumvent the protections” of the new state law. But the law does allow transfers if the seized property is worth more than $50,000. Clearly, New Mexico lawmakers intended the state to continue participating in equitable sharing, albeit with strict limitations.\n\nBut according to documents obtained by the Institute for Justice, after the reform took effect, Justice and the Treasury determined that all state and local law enforcement agencies in New Mexico, save tribal agencies, were “ineligible” to participate in equitable sharing. Currently, only four agencies in New Mexico are listed as in compliance. By comparison, nearly two dozen agencies in the state collectively received $2.9 million in equitable sharing funds last year.\n\nThe use of such hardball tactics behind closed doors seem to belie the Justice Department’s public statements in support of reforming civil forfeiture. Most notably, in January, the Department of Justice announced it would be curtailing “adoption,” where federal agents “adopt” seizures made by local and state law enforcement agencies. “This new policy,” then Attorney General Eric Holder said, “will ensure that these authorities can continue to be used to take the profit out of crime and return assets to victims, while safeguarding civil liberties.”\n\nThe decision received widespread praise (and much media exaggeration). But the policy change does not affect joint task forces and joint investigations, which have constituted the bulk of federal forfeiture cases. Ultimately, research by the Institute for Justice found the effect would be quite modest, affecting less than one-tenth of the $6.8 billion seized under equitable sharing from 2008 to 2013.\n\nHopefully, California lawmakers will reject the federal government’s cynical ploy to undermine a desperately needed protection for private property rights and federalism. No one should ever lose his property unless he is first convicted of a crime. Californians should not have their criminal code outsourced to the federal government.\n\nIf you or anyone you know has been a victim of civil forfeiture, please contact the Institute for Justice.

  "latent_4931": "Well-known legal scholar Akil Reed Amar made waves recently, arguing that a single comment from James Madison proves that the Electoral College had an intrinsic pro-slavery bent and was designed to perpetuate the institution. In fact, the Electoral College had little to do with slavery and much to do with a desire to ensure small geographic regions and cities could not control the executive branch.\n\nIn the quote Amar references, Madison suggested that Virginia’s stature would be hindered by a national popular vote for president, an idea proposed in the Philadelphia Convention by nationalist delegate James Wilson of Pennsylvania. Madison said it would fail to account for the state’s non-voting slave population. Madison’s position on this matter is not disputed by anyone; a national popular vote surely would have weakened Virginia’s influence in the federal system.\n\nAmar’s argument, however, is a classic case of cherry-picking. If Amar is correct, then he has to reconcile the fact that some of the most vocal opposition to a national popular vote came from delegates from states that had already abolished slavery. These men made it clear that Wilson’s proposal was unpopular not because of slavery, but because it would have allowed small geographical regions and metropolitan areas to control presidential elections for a union of states with differing regions, penchants, and dispositions.\n\nFor instance, Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania, whose state eliminated slavery in 1780, opined that “the great evil of cabal and corruption” could not be avoided under a direct popular vote. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, a state which fully disposed of the institution even earlier, called a national referendum “radically vicious,” also failing to mention the slavery motive. Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, a state that passed its gradual emancipation act of 1784, also raised explicit objections against a presidential election through the people at large. On these grounds, would Amar suppose that these genuine apprehensions toward a national referendum were based on abolitionist tendencies?\n\nIn an apparent attempt to disparage the South, Amar also conveniently omits a multitude of actual reasons that delegates from slave states opposed Wilson’s proposal for a national popular vote. Fellow Virginian George Mason opined that a national popular vote was akin to letting “a blind man choose colors” because voters would not be well acquainted with the positions/doings of candidates from other states. Though not a concern in the contemporary, this was a real issue in 1787, where most people did not know what the candidates even looked like. Amar even cites the prevalence of this view in article, correctly noting that several founders believed Americans “would lack sufficient information to choose directly and intelligently among leading presidential candidates.” This, of course, had nothing to do with slavery, and effectively undermines Amar’s position.\n\nCharles Pinckney of South Carolina noted that his misgivings against such a popular vote system were “obvious & striking,” declaring that one several of the most populous states would be led by a “few active & Designing men,” combining in favor of the same individual despite the chagrin of the rest of the country. Fellow South Carolinian John Rutledge opposed a national vote because he favored selection of the executive by Congress, never mentioning Amar’s supposed slavery rationale. This alternative matched Edmund Randolph original proposal for presidential appointment under a set of resolutions known as the Virginia Plan.\n\nAdditionally, Amar selectively omits other reasons Madison cited in opposition to the popular vote system for presidential elections. On July 25, he said the electoral college would diminish the possibility of corruption and foreign influence. There was also the overarching fact that Madison did not believe the states should be unequal in the federal system – which influenced his views on a variety of subjects beyond the presidential election mechanism. For instance, Madison wished to preserve Virginia’s relative power in the union through a failed proposal for a bicameral legislature, both houses of which were to be apportioned by state population.\n\nAmar also comically suggests that the early presidential elections were demonstrative proof of the Electoral College’s supposed pro-slavery bias, citing the sectional division between northern and southern states in the 1796 election. On the contrary, the opposite case seems to have been made by the 1800 presidential election.\n\nThough it is true that Jefferson would not have won the election had there been no apportionment at all for slaves that year, as the northern delegates wished, under a national popular vote system Jefferson’s Republican faction would have defeated Adams and the Federalists by an even wider margin. This was because Jefferson and his party coadjutor Aaron Burr reaped 61.4% of the popular vote while Adams and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney gained only 38.6%.\n\nIn contrast, the Republican candidates obtained 146 electoral votes to while the Federalists received 130, demonstrating that the Electoral College actually made the contest much closer than it otherwise would have been. Besides this, in 1800 Jefferson and Burr won several northern states that had passed emancipation acts, such as New York and Pennsylvania. Again, would Amar admit that these factors are evidence that a national popular vote would have helped the Jeffersonian Republicans achieve an even greater victory in 1800?\n\nAlso appearing to weaken Amar’s argument is his incorrect assumption that the Electoral College inherently benefited candidates from slave holding states. This was certainly not true for candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina, a slaveholder from a slave state, who along with Adams failed to win the 1800 election for the Federalists.\n\nThe supposed pro-slavery orientation of the Electoral College certainly did nothing to assist slaveholder Andrew Jackson, who in 1824 won a plurality of the popular vote but lost the election on account of the House of Representatives choosing an alternative under a deadlocked Electoral College. Instead, non-slaveholder John Quincy Adams was selected. Would Amar therefore admit that this election inversely proved the Electoral College was actually anti-slavery?\n\nJames Wilson’s proposal in Philadelphia was plainly perceived as radical and objectionable because of the potential to perpetuate executive oppression over a large, federally-oriented country. Despite Amar’s sweeping conclusion, it remains clear instead that all varieties of delegates, whether they came from slave states or states that had already abolished slavery, saw Wilson’s initial plan as undesirable for other obvious reasons, even convincing him to abandon it.\n\nSitting on a committee of eleven delegates that developed the Electoral College system, Wilson agreed to scrap his own popular vote proposal in favor of the more popular alternative.\n\nThe most unfortunate facet of Amar’s position is the selectivity of his argument. Cherry-picking one Madison quote in an attempt to prove his position is a tragic mistake that undermines honest scholarship and thorough constitutional study. Sadly, Amar is not the first to reach such a drastic, fallacious conclusion on constitutional features based on faulty premises and selective reasoning. In the contemporary it has been a common tactic among many reactionaries to link any aspect of the Constitution they don’t like to deplorable causes.\n\nTo come to Amar’s deductions on the Electoral College, one must actively ignore the entire breadth of the Philadelphia Convention debates, everything that was said about such a system in the state ratification campaigns, an array of important context beyond a single Madison quote, and a battery of contradictory evidence suggesting that slavery had nothing to do with the reasons such a mechanism came to be favored for presidential elections.",
  "latent_4940": "PARIS –Pathe’s “Daddy or Mommy,” Wild Bunch’s “Do Not Disturb” and The Other Angle’s “Discount” will compete next week for one of Europe’s most valuable non-official crowns: the UniFrance Paris Rendez-vous Most Popular New Comedy.\n\nAlso in the running: Gaumont’s “I Kissed a Girl,” Kinology’s “Caprices,” EuropaCorp’s “Bis” and “Buddy Guards,” Studiocanal’s “Chic!”, Versatile’s “A trois, on y va,” “Valentin, Valentin,” from SBS Productions, and TF1.’s Intl.’s “Boomerang.”\n\nHaving punched a robust first five-day $3.7 million through Jan. 4, Patrice Leconte’s “Do Not Disturb” opens Paris’ 17th UniFrance Rendez-vous with French Cinema, Europe’s biggest film mart after Cannes, Berlin, Venice, San Sebastian and Locarno.\n\nRunning Jan. 15-19, and screening an announced 86 French movies, 47 market premieres per UniFrance, the Rendez-vous will unveil a score-or-so of new comedies. With RDV buzz helping to galvanize boffo sales and even double –or sometimes triple – digit million-dollar box office abroad (see box below), that’s no idle fact.\n\nRelated Indie Sales Acquires Nordic Coming-Of-Age 'Psychobitch' (EXCLUSIVE) Baptiste Petit-Gats: ‘Editing Taught Me How to Write for Film’\n\n“Do Not Disturb” weighs in as a comedy of frustration, toplining Clavier, star of “Serial (Bad) Weddings” and a top Gallic marquee comedy draw, as a jazz buff who stumbles on a 1958 first edition vinyl LP of the legendary “Me, Myself and I.” The title is hardly coincidence: As Clavier’s resorts to desperately egotistic antics to listen to his record in peace, “Disturb” deepens into a satire of the engagingly monstrous self-preoccupation and capacity for disavowal of France’s well-heeled grand bourgeoisie.\n\nHigh-concept family fare, “Daddy or Mommy” stars Marina Fois (“Polisse”) and Laurent Lafitte (“On the Other Side of the Tracks”) as a couple getting a divorce, both with the career breaks of their lives, so battling not to have custody of their children. Pathé releases wide in France Feb. 4, in the same early Feb berth as Dany Boon’s “Nothing to Declare,” which grossed it around $62 million in France.\n\nAnother high-concept comedy, “I Kissed a Girl” stars Pio Marmai as a 34-year-old gay man about to marry his longtime partner who unexpectedly falls in love with a woman. Pic marks Maxime Govare and Noemie Saglio’s feature debut.\n\nSlated by Pyramide for an April 29 French release, the Kinology-sold love triangle romcom “Caprices,” features the acting talents of its director, Emmanuel Mouret, plus one of France’s fastest-rising young stars, Anais Demoustier (“Bird People,” “The New Girlfriend”) and Belgium’s Virginie Efira, a knock-out in two breakout laffers – “Second Chance,” and “It Boy.” The romcom is sparking good buzz as a smart comedy in an Eric Rohmer vein.\n\nFruit of a production alliance between vet comedian Dominique Farrugia and Luc Besson’s EuropaCorp, second chance comedy “Bis,” helmed by Farrugia (“The Perfect Date”), features “Sticks” star Kad Merad (“Welcome to the Sticks”) and Franck Dubosc (laffer hits “Barbecue,” “Fiston” “Boule & Bill” and “Les Seigneurs”) as two best buddies, marooned in mid-life crisis, one an inveterate womanizer, the other a stuck-in-the-mud family man, propelled back to 1986. Suddenly, they are 17, sexy and single, and can start over. “Buddy Guards” has Joey Starr (“Polisse”) and Manu Payet (“All That Glitters”) racing against the clock in an action comedy.\n\nA Studiocanal Jan. 7 release, “Chic!” stars Fanny Ardant (“8 Women”), Marina Hands (“The Diving Bell and the Butterfly”) and Eric Elmosino (“Gainsbourg”) in a haute couture romantic farce.\n\n“Comedies” must, however, be taken in the broadest of senses. A “Brassed Off”-style dramedy – the set up is comedic, the treatment dramatic – “Discount,” sold by The Other Angle, turns on five drab supermarket employees who, soon to be replaced by automatic cash-registers, swipe produce bound for the trash-cans, selling it off to the needy – read pretty all their local village – at massive markdowns. Wild Bunch distributes in France.\n\nAgain a comedic set-up – a guy and his girlfriend cheat on each other, with the same girl – but a dramatic treatment, Versatile’s “A trois on y va,” a light love story between three young adults, marks Jerome Bonnell’s follow-up to laurelled romcom “Just a Sigh.” It is produced by Edouard Weil at Rectangle Productions, which backed Benoit Jacquot’s “Three Hearts” and Guillaume Gallienne’s “Me, Myself and Mum.”\n\nBilled as a comedic suspenser with emotional impact, TF1’s “Boomerang” stars Lafitte and Melanie Laurent (“Inglourious Basterds”) in the story of man in mid-life crisis investigating the death of his mother when he was a child.\n\nWild Bunch will give market outings to crime caper “The Price of Fame,” from Xavier Beauvois (“Of Gods and Men”), a Venice competition hit sold to major territories such as Japan, Italy and Spain.\n\nA comedic murder mystery, “Valentin, Valentin,” from Said Ben Said’s SBS Productions, weighs in as a Paris-set makeover of Ruth Rendell’s psychologically astute crime novel “Tigerlily’s Orchids,” now set in a well-heeled but not-so-genteel-as it-seems Paris neighborhood. Geraldine Chaplin stars, along with a distinguished French ensemble cast.\n\nPathe will also unspool Thailand-set adventure laffer “Bangkok, We Have a Problem,” with Merad, as well as novelist-turned-filmmaker Sylvie Ohayon’s semi-autobiographical coming of age debut, “Papa Was not a Rolling Stone,” set in a tough multi-ethnic banlieue.\n\nNOT JUST A LAUGHING MATTER\n\nComedy won’t be the only game in town at the Rendez-vous, however. As over much of the world, filmmakers are grafting social issues with genre, often thriller formats, to broaden audiences for subjects that in the past might well have been made as straight-arrow art films.\n\nTwo key RDV titles, both structured as thrillers, attack events that rocked modern France. Maybe Films Distribution’s biggest play at the Rendez-vous, “The Clearstream Affair,” from Vincent Garenq (“Guilty,” “Baby Love”), has Gilles Lellouche (“Point Blank”) as a journalist obsessed at digging the dirt on one of France’s biggest banking scandals. The personal price of his obsession proves high.\n\nOn SND’s sales slate, Frederic Tellier’s “SK1,” co -written by David Oelhoffen (“Far From Men”), registers the impact of a serial killer’s horrifically violent murders – plus the non-cooperation of rival police departments investigating the crimes – on a rookie and soon haunted homicide squad inspector, played by Raphael Personnaz (“Anna Karenina,” “The French Minister”).\n\nIntroduced to buyers by Gaumont, first-timer Fred Grivois’ “Through the Air” toplines Reda Kateb (“Zero Dark Thirty”) as a 30-year-old marksman and shooting champion recruited to become a hitman. Pic is co-written by Grivois, Thomas Bidegain (“A Prophet”) and Neo Debre (“Smart Ass”).\n\nIndie Sales reps social thriller “The Night Watchman,” about a security guard stumbling on a crime – or so he thinks – helmed by Pierre Jolivet (“Zim & Co.”), and starring Cannes best actor winner Olivier Gourmet (“The Son”), from “Persepolis” producer 2.4.7 Films.\n\nWide will screen “Cruel,” crime novelist Eric Cherriere’s feature debut, about a loving son and serial killer, which drew positive reviews at its Busan Festival world premiere.\n\nFrom Reel Suspects, Antoine Barraud’s “Portrait of an Artist” follows a renowned filmmaker obsessed by images of monstrosity, as a red stain festers on his back.\n\nDRAMA PLAYS\n\nStaged strategically two-to-three weeks before the Berlin Festival, the Rendez-vous has traditionally been a showcase for more mainstream fare. France’s highest-profile art films were saved for the Berlinale.\n\nYet as France, like other international industries, moves more mainstream, many titles now mix arthouse and wider entertainment tropes; They scale up, and boast stars or at least name actors or star directors, amped-up tension, and narratives of betterment creating strong audience empathy. One crossover, Pathe’s “Beauty and the Beast,” was one of 2014’s top-three French performers outside France.\n\nIn one instance, already multi-prized at fests, and stretching over four decades, “The Man From Oran,” from Films Distribution and helmed by and starring French-Algerian Lyes Salem, weighs in at the 2015 Rendez-vous as a kind of “Once Upon a Time in Algeria,” taking its characters from the struggle for independence to the euphoria of freedom, then enrichment and disillusionment as Algeria degenerates into a corrupt, one-party state which invents its own official history.\n\nWild Bunch will also screen “The Smell of Us,” Larry Clark’s portrait of self-destructive Paris youth, which world preemed in Venice Days.\n\nThe SND-repped “A Perfect Man,” from Yann Gozlan (“Caged”), reteams “Yves Saint Laurent’s” producer, WY Productions, with its star, Pierre Niney, in a performance-driven drama turning on an aspiring writer who passes off a dead soldier’s diary as his own work.\n\nFrom MK2, Elodie Namer’s “The Tournament” packs the tension of a genius smackdown as a 22-year-old French chess master, the natural favorite for a Budapest event, first confronts a new adversary: an 11-year-old prodigy.\n\nSold by Films Distribution, first-time director Cyprien Vial’s “Young Tiger” is an immigration drama, not about new arrivals’ penuries but rather the struggle of a young Punjabi, just arrived in Paris, to live up to the multiple and contradictory expectations vested in him.\n\nPicked up by Le Pacte, Ada Louih’s directorial debut “So Long Africa” turns on a man, played by Niels Arestrup (“War Horse,” “A Prophet”), who, after spending his life in Africa, is repatriated to France, amid the Abidjan uprising of 2011, with a daughter he hardly knows in tow.\n\nSet in 1995, Shirel Amitay’s “Atlit,” sold by Indie Sales, toplines Geraldine Nakache, Yael Abecassis and Judith Chemla as three sisters with issues who inherit a property in Israel, where Yitzhak Rabin’s sudden assassination has just turned the country upside down. Introduced by The Bureau Sales, Alain Choquart’s ensemble drama “Ladygrey” is also set in South Africa.\n\nDespite the eyecatching box office for breakout comedies and the popularity of select thrillers, drama remains the most-sold of French film types: 13 titles opened in 20 or more territories in 2013, per UniFrance.\n\nPyramide Intl. market preems “Eva and Leon,” first-time helmer Emilie Cherpitel’s tale of a game-changing friendship between an immature 35-year-old woman and an over-adult 10-year-old boy. Co-starring, Clotilde Hesme, one of the most admired actresses of her generation.\n\nTwo more Other Angle titles world premiere in Paris: “The Art Dealer,” from Francois Margolin (“Flight of the Red Balloon”) about a Jewish woman recovering family paintings stolen by the Nazis; and Stefano Consiglio’s impossible love tale “L’Amore non perdona,” with Ariane Ascaride (“Les Heritiers”).\n\nAn adaptation of Doris Lessing’s “Victoria and The Staveneys,” “My Friend Victoria,” directed by Jean-Paul Civeyrac and sold by Les Films du Losange, tells the tale of a young black woman from a modest background who raises alone a little girl she had with a man from an upper-class family. The movie opened in France on Dec. 31. A second title from Les Films du Losange, and directed by Romain Goupil, “The Days Come” weaves fiction and documentary-style reality, featuring cameos from Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, Marina Hands, Noemie Lvovsky and Jackie Berroyer. It played at Tokyo.\n\nAlpha Violet will unveil Fred Nicolas’ “Max & Lenny,” a Marseille-set tale about two teen girls who bond through their love of rap.\n\nKG Productions presents romantic drama “Graziella,” from Mehdi Charef (“Summer of ‘62”), starring Denis Lavant (“Holy Motors”) and chica Almodóvar Rossy de Palma as two cons, both imprisoned for crimes de passion, who re-meet – she always carried a candle for him – at a boarding school closed for the summer. KG Productions’ Michel Ray Gavras produces.\n\nWide-sold, vet Jean-Francois Davy’s final cut of “Transgression” will also screen in Paris. It is a frank docu-drama record of Davy’s involvement with a young wannabe actress.\n\nANIMATION\n\nToon pic “Miniscule – Valley of the Lost Ants” sold 2.0 million tix outside France in 2014. Also underscoring the move from arthouse towards wider audience plays, Rendez-Vous screenings include market premieres of two toon pics: SND’s “Asterix: the Mansion of the Gods,” one of the widest sold titles at this year’s market and a box-office hit in France (see below), and Pascal Morelli’s EuropaCorp-handled “108 Demon Kings,” a tween adventure set in twelfth century China.\n\nLAUGHING THEIR WAY TO THE BANK: THE RISE OF INTERNATIONAL FRENCH COMEDIES\n\nOn average, French films’ annual sales revenues rose a sturdy 14%, 2008-13. Put that down largely to two trends. Ever more frequent English-language international blockbusters from Luc Besson’s EuropaCorp; and the rise of French comedies, dismissed until just six years ago as largely local affairs, as international box office phenoms, or at least tidy money-spinners.\n\nExact numbers for French movies box office abroad in 2014 will be announced at UniFrance’s traditional Rendez-vous press conference, on Friday. Jan. 17, with Luc Besson in attendance. Thanks to Besson’s “Lucy,” France’s biggest ever hit abroad, selling 53.5 million tix through November, it is already clear that France looks to have punched one of its best years’ ever in 2014 in terms of foreign box office grosses on Gallic films.\n\nBut the hundreds of buyers who gather at Paris’ Hotel Intercontinental next week for the 17th Rendez-Vous With French Cinema will be scouring for a very different kind of movie to Besson’s testosterone fare: Comedies.\n\nReasons abound. Led by racism farce “Serial (Bad) Weddings,” the No. 1 movie in Gaul last year with a $98.5 million gross, and Dany Boon’s No. 2-ranking “Superchondriac” ($42.5 million), comedies powered up domestic tix sales for French movies to 91.6 million, per France’s CNC film board, their best year since 1984. Tracking at a first 19- day €20.7 million ($24.8 million), “La Famille Belier,” a follow-your-dreams dramedy, has a sporting chance of overhauling “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies” as the biggest end of the year bow (see table).\n\nThat’s France. But ever since Dany Boon’s “Welcome to the Sticks” played to guffaws of laughter at a now milestone Paris Rendez-vous screening in 2008, the winners, large and small of its most popular comedy crown have gone on to sometimes-phenomenal figures, or at least useful over-performances, outside France as well.\n\n“Sticks” grossed $162 million in France, $54 million abroad, in 2008 currency terms. Released by Senator, “The Intouchables’” extraordinary first-day German gross broke during the 2011 event, firing up a foreign feeding fever for French comedy, especially from its sales company, Gaumont. Part of TF1 Intl.’s RDV show-reel in 2014, racism farce “Serial (Bad) Weddings” was France’s second-biggest hit abroad last year, punching $33.8 million in Germany, ranking No. 2 there, just bested by “Transformers: Age of Extinction.”\n\nDespite France’s grand arthouse traditions, and the $319.0 million B.O. outside France for the Besson-produced “Taken 2” in 2012, as well as $59.5 million for “Malavita,” which he helmed, in 2013, in both 2012 and 2013 comedies were France’s best performing film type outside France, repping 32% of total box office, vs. 28% for dramas and 25% for thriller/adventure fare, per UniFrance.\n\n“A new generation of French producers are thinking from script-stage that they shouldn’t neglect the international market, maybe because France’s financing system covers less of films’ budgets, but also due to their realization that if you have a broadly mainstream movie with a strong concept, you can really have potential abroad,” said Nicolas Brigaud-Robert, at Films Distribution.\n\nFRENCH FILMS’ AVERAGE ANNUAL SALES REVENUES\n\nEuro millions, 2004-2008, 2009-2013, % change\n\nWestern Europe, € 70.236, € 72.31, +3%\n\nNorth America, € 29.250, € 46.55, +59%\n\nCentral, East Europe, € 18.2, € 18.0 , -1%\n\nAsia, € 18.1, € 13.8, -24%\n\nLatin America, € 4.2, € 7.1, +66%\n\nAustralasia, € 2.0, € 3.3, +68%\n\nOthers, € 2.9, € 3.6, +26%\n\nMiddle East, € 1.8, € 3.3, +85%\n\nAfrica, € 850, € 620, -27%\n\nTotal: € 147. 5, € 168.6, +14%\n\nIn U.S. dollar millions, 2004-2008, 2009-2013, %\n\nWestern Europe, $84.3, $86.8, +3%\n\nNorth America, $35.1, $55.9, +59%\n\nCentral, East Europe, $21.8, $21.6, -1%\n\nAsia, $21.8,$16.6,-24%\n\nLatin America, $5.1, $8.4,+66%\n\nAustralasia, $2.4, $3.9, +68%\n\nOthers, $3.4, $4.3, +26%\n\nMiddle East, $2.1, $3.9,+85%\n\nAfrica,$1.0, $744, -27%\n\nTotal: $177.0, $202.3,+14%\n\n€1 = $1.2 million Source: CNC, Exportation de Films\n\nLA COMEDIE FRANÇAISE RULES O.K.: FRENCH BOX OFFICE, DEC. 31.- JAN.4, 2015\n\n2015 dawned with four Gallic comedies in the Top Ten in France, the second biggest movie market in Europe, over Dec. 31 to Jan. 4. Heavily pre-sold, “La Famille Belier” will be a 2015 Rendez-vous highlight, especially for those distributors who have bought it. “Do Not Disturb,” Patrice Leconte’s latest, with the marquee draw of “Bad (Serial) Weddings’” Cristian Clavier, debuted to a first five-day €3.1 million ($3.7 million), which puts Leconte on track for his biggest hit, bar “Les Bronzes 3,” since 1996’s “Ridicule.” Toon pic “Asterix- The Mansions of God” – like “La Famille Belier,” a SND-M6 Group co-production – has grossed €18.6 million ($22.3 million); Gaumont’s “La French,” with Academy Award winner Jean Dujardin (“The Artist”) and Gilles Lellouche (“Point Blank”), has cumed €9.3 million ($11.1 million).

  "latent_5164": "Jesse James Historical Site\n\nJesse James and his notorious gang of outlaws staged the world's first robbery of a moving train the evening of July 21, 1873, a mile and a half west of Adair, Iowa.\n\nEarly in July the gang had learned that $75,000 in gold from the Cheyenne region was to come through Adair on the recently build main line of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railroad.\n\nJesse sent his brother, Frank James, and Cole Younger to Omaha to learn when the gold shipment was to reach there. Jesse, Jim and Tom Younger, Clell Miller and Bill Chadwell remained camped in the hills in the Adair area.\n\nFinally, Frank James and Cole Younger got their tip that the gold shipment was on its way east and they brought the report to Jesse who had made plans for the train robbery. On the afternoon of the robbery, the bandits called at the section house and obtained some pies and other food from Mrs. Robert Grant, wife of the section foreman.\n\nIn the meantime, the bandits broke into the handcar house, stole a spike-bar and hammer with which they pried off a fish-plate connecting two rails and pulled out the spikes. This was on a curve of the railroad track west of Adair near the Turkey Creek bridge on old U.S. No. 6 Highway.\n\nA rope was tied on the west end of the disconnected north rail. The rope was passed under the south rail and led to a hole they had cut in the bank in which to hide.\n\nWhen the train came along, the rail was jerked out of place and the engine plunged into the ditch and toppled over on its side. Engineer John Rafferty of Des Moines was killed, the fireman, Dennis Foley, died of his injuries and several passengers were injured.\n\nTwo members of the gang, believed to have been Jesse and Frank James, climbed into the express car and forced John Burgess, the guard, to open the safe. In it they found only $2,000 in currency--the gold shipment had been delayed. They collected only about $3,000, including the currency and loot taken from the passengers, in the world's first robbery of a moving train.\n\nLevi Clay, employed by the railroad in Adair, which was then not quite a year old, walked to Casey where the alarm was sent by a telegrapher to Des Moines and Omaha, and soon the news was spread all over the nation. A train loaded with armed men left Council Bluffs for Adair and dropped small detachments of men along the route where saddled horses were waiting.\n\nThe trail of the outlaws was traced into Missouri where they split up and were sheltered by friends. Later the governor of Missouri offered a $10,000 reward for the capture of Jesse James, dead or alive.\n\nOn April 3, 1882, the reward reportedly proved too tempting for Bob Ford, a new member of the James gang, and he shot and killed Jesse in the James home in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nLocation 1156 Anita-Adair Road, Adair, Iowa .

  "latent_5229": "VANCOUVER, BC – After a tough first half against Arizona United SC (8W-10L-6D), rookie striker Thomas Sanner led Whitecaps FC 2 (11W-6L-7D) to a 3-1 win with his first professional hat-trick in the last 10 minutes of the match.\n\nComing off a lengthy break, the ‘Caps opted to make four changes to their starting lineup in comparison to the starting 11 from their last match against Orange County Blues FC: Spencer Richey slotted back in net for WFC2, while Deklan Wynne and Kadin Chung moved into the fullback positions. In the midfield, Matthew Baldisimo made his seventh start of the season.\n\nWFC2 also debuted their newest signing in the match, giving Chilean right back Christopher Diaz 25 minutes of play to settle in with the side.\n\nThe ‘Caps got the shot count started early, with Winnipeg native Marco Bustos chipping the ball into the box for Daniel Haber in the third minute. Haber put the ball into the net, but the play was called offside.\n\n13 minutes later, it was the visitors who got on the scoreboard first. Arizona striker Tyler Blackwood took advantage of a misplay and giveaway by WFC2 central defender Sem de Wit, sprinting into the ‘Caps box and sending the ball past Spencer Richey to put the side up 1-0.\n\nKyle Greig would lead the ‘Caps counter in the 20th minute, moving into the box and passing off to unmarked Marco Bustos. The central midfielder took a quick shot, but was robbed by Arizona goalkeeper Carl Woszczynski. Bustos ran onto his own rebound, sending a header back towards the net, but an unconventional save off the face by Woszczynsi once again kept the ‘Caps at bay.\n\nEarly in the second, it was Arizona who put the pressure on with striker Long Tan heading a cross down in the ‘Caps six-yard box. Fellow striker Chris Cortez put his foot through the ball at point blank range, but Richey made a reaction save right on his line to keep Arizona from doubling their lead.\n\nIn the 59th minute, the ‘Caps found themselves with a bit of an advantage as United midfielder Blair Gavin took his second yellow card of the match and made the long walk to the dressing room, putting his side down a man with 30 minutes to go.\n\nWFC2 capitalized on that advantage late in the game, notching three goals in ten minutes to see the game out to a 3-1 win.\n\nIn the 84th, Thomas Gardner picked out Sanner in Arizona’s six-yard box. Getting on the end of the touch line pass, Sanner placed the ball in the back of Arizona’s net, bringing the match back even with just minutes left to go.\n\nSanner would put the ‘Caps ahead in the 87th, following up on his own header deep in United’s box and chipping the ball over Woszczynski for WFC2’s second goal to make it 2-1.\n\nSome icing on the cake? A third goal for Sanner and thus his first professional hat-trick. Into added time, the ‘Caps found themselves with a two-on-one attack. Captain Kyle Greig played the ball behind Arizona’s defender into the path of Sanner, who played the ball into the bottom right corner of the net.\n\nWith the win, Whitecaps FC 2 move back to the top of the table, sitting tied for first in the Western Conference with their next opponent: Sacramento Republic FC. The ‘Caps head down to California to face their top-of-table rivals on Saturday, August 27. So far this season, the ‘Caps haven’t lost to Sacramento. Can they keep the point streak going?

  "latent_5250": "Oscar-nominated Mexican actor Demian Bichir appeared on last night's episode of The Bridge (FX) with a familiar homie by his side — his offscreen brother Bruno Bichir, who joins the Peabody Award-winning cast as a guest star.\n\nIn America, the 50-year-old Demian Bichir is well-known for his recurring role in Weeds as Esteban Reyes — politician, narco-trafficker, and baby-daddy to Mary Louise Parker. His skill as a dramatic actor was first showcased broadly to American audiences in the movie A Better Life, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. It's a heart-tugging piece about a luckless undocumented Mexican gardener trying to raise his teenage son in Los Angeles.\n\nIn Mexico, Demian is well-known as the eldest son of that country's first family of entertainment. His father, Alejandro Bichir, is a respected actor/director; his mother is the movie and telenovela actress Maricruz Nájera. Demian began his acting career at 14. His brothers, Bruno (younger) and Odiseo (older), are also actors. So prolific is the family that the Mexican edition of the MTV Movie Awards created a special category: Mejor Bichir en una Película (Best Bichir in a Movie). Demian earned his Best Bichir for the 2003 film Bendito Infierno, in which he co-starred with Penélope Cruz and Gael García Bernal. (He got his start in American films in 2001, playing opposite Salma Hayek in In the Time of the Butterflies. Later he'd gain 30 pounds to play Fidel Castro in Steven Soderbergh's Che.)\n\nFor the uninitiated, The Bridge is a crime procedural set on the U.S.-Mexico border. It begins with the discovery of the body of an American judge on the bridge connecting El Paso, Texas, and Juárez, Mexico. As it happens, the body is gruesomely cut in half and left straddling the exact line of transition between the countries, a challenge to both nations by the evil perp, who is believed to be a serial killer of women, most of them workers in maquiladoras south of the border. To investigate, an El Paso police detective (Diane Kruger) is paired with a Mexican counterpart from the Chihuahua state police, played by Demian Bichir.\n\nKruger's character takes a bit of getting used to — following the plot point of the Danish show from which The Bridge is adapted, the former model and muse of designer Karl Lagerfeld, who has since become a credible actress, plays a cop who suffers with Asperger's syndrome. It is a tribute that the former Helen of Troyhas managed to construct a credible character under such constraints.But the show features good writing, a unique and picaresque setting, and documentary-rich cinematography. All in all, though, it is Demian's fresh portrayal of Detective Marco Ruiz (in Spanish it's pronounced de-tek-tee-veh) that anchors the show.\n\nGoing back to Dragnet's Joe Friday, the TV detective has become standard fare, an overcrowded field of memorable and unmemorable portrayals. Hardened. Alcoholic. Emotionally shut-down. Womanizing. Quippingly macho. Laughably terse. Even True Detective's highly lauded pair, Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey, are rather two-dimentional.\n\nIn The Bridge, Bichir's cop is distinctly human and nuanced — a good man at heart who is willing to veer into the dark if he feels a higher justice is being served. He's that guy who knows which rules are meaningful and which ones need to be broken. (Of course, as with all handsome detectives, one of his problems is keeping his dick in his pants.) The season-one episode featuring (spoiler alert) the demise of his college-age son still haunts me.\n\nOver drinks at the bar at L'Ermitage in Beverly Hills, California, Demian is charming with the waiters and flirtatious with the waitresses, maybe like a younger version of Dos Equis's Most Interesting Man in the World. He arrives first, wearing a warm-up jacket, with his phone to his ear, making plans for later with \"a very hot lady.\" Ordering something non-alcoholic, he cites as influences cops played by Al Pacino, by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman in Seven, and by Gene Hackman in The French Connection.\n\n\"What I liked about this guy [Ruiz] is that he's like any other human being. What really got me from the pilot is that we saw his personal life. After all, he shows up in the first episode having just had a vasectomy, with swollen balls. And then you see this guy who is transiting not only between two cities and two countries, but he's also transiting constantly between heaven and hell.\"\n\nRight about here, Bruno arrives. With his rounded glasses and moustache/beard, he looks more the studious type than his leading-man brother, who is four years his senior. Bruno is respected at home for his work in Mexican film, telenovelas, and theater. For an extended stint, he appeared as the Joel Grey character in a Mexican stage version of Cabaret. Bruno's English is not quite as proficient as that of his brother, whose early jobs in America included employment at the Rosa Mexicano restaurant in New York City. As with most actors taking a role in television, Bruno has no idea where his character on The Bridge is going. All he knows for now is that he's playing a wealthy Mexican business leader who becomes involved with Demian's detective.\n\n\"We work together many times in the past in films and theater, but this is the first time we do TV together,\" Bruno says. \"It's always a joy to work with your own blood. When we work together, when my father works with us, that's such joy, it's so beautiful, you know?\"\n\n\"Growing up in Mexico, playing soccer in our little neighborhood, without speaking a word of English, we never thought things like this were gonna happen,\" Demian says. He cocks his head and shrugs, not displeased.\n\n\"America's a great place,\" Bruno says, ordering an artisian ale.",
  "latent_5372": "Here's a number that terrifies front-runners and encourages also-rans at this stage of the Republican presidential race: Seventy-eight percent of Iowa caucus-goers say they haven't yet made up their minds. Even if they tell pollsters they support a candidate now, they freely admit they might switch to someone else later.\n\nPollsters have found similar results in New Hampshire, South Carolina and the states that follow in the GOP primary race.\n\nCampaign strategists also know that November, December and January were times of extreme volatility in the 2008 and 2012 Republican primary contests. Both times, the leader going into November was not the leader who emerged in January. And that means almost everyone in the crowded GOP field is still alive, for now, at least. As long as a candidate has enough money for gas, a room at Motel 6 and a loyal aide or two, he can keep at it and hope for a breakthrough.\n\nStill, some have a steeper path than others. At this point in the race, it looks like the \"undercard\" candidates, named for their exclusion from the prime-time GOP debates, are probably on a path to nowhere. George Pataki, Lindsey Graham, Rick Santorum and Bobby Jindal are very able men, but none has the prospect of getting much traction.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of Iowa caucus-goers say they haven't yet made up their minds. Pollsters have found similar results in New Hampshire, South Carolina and the states that follow in the GOP primary race. (AP photo)\n\nIn addition, there are a few of the prime-time candidates, Rand Paul and John Kasich in particular, who don't seem to be getting traction either. So to be generous, say there are eight contenders left: Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie.\n\nWith 90 days to go until the Iowa caucuses and one year to go until the general election, here's a look at how each of the top eight GOP candidates might get ahead, starting from the bottom:\n\nNo. 8: Christie. It's amazing Christie is even alive after the world's longest near-death experience called Bridgegate. But Christie has persevered, putting all his bets on New Hampshire. He has spent all or part of 48 days there in the 2016 cycle, more than any other GOP candidate. And after a strong debate performance in Boulder on Wednesday, Christie definitely has a pulse. Aides say he will use his boost to keep pushing entitlement reform. \"It's the courage to take on the politically toxic issues that are part of the reason why people are so frustrated with Washington,\" one of them said.\n\nNo. 7: Huckabee. In August, Huckabee was in fourth place in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. Now, he's in seventh. But Huckabee is setting himself apart from the field, taking the opposite approach from Christie and much of the rest of the GOP by pledging not to touch entitlements. He's also shown some creativity in advocating a disease-based approach to saving Medicare: Find cures or reduce the incidence of diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's that takes a huge bite out of care costs.\n\nPlus, Huckabee, who won the 2008 Iowa caucuses, believes he can do well there again, and then in South Carolina and the so-called SEC primaries. \"He's a southerner,\" notes an aide. \"He's got broad appeal in the South, and that's where the calendar starts after the first states.\"\n\nAn unexpected problem is facing Fiorina. A polished performer, she shot up in the polls after the first GOP debate in August. Then she began to slide. She needs to show the world she has a plan to get from here to the nomination. (AP Photo)\n\nNo. 6: Fiorina. An unexpected problem is facing Fiorina. A polished performer, she shot up in the polls after the first GOP debate in August. Then she began to slide. Then she shot up in the polls after the second debate in September. Then she began to slide. Now, she's in sixth place nationally without the momentum many expected her to have after those two breakout performances. And then she gave at best a middling performance in the Boulder debate, leading more than a few insiders to wonder how she can regain the upward path. She needs to show the world she has a plan to get from here to the nomination.\n\nNo. 5: Cruz. Cruz is a happy candidate. Eighth in the field back in July, he has slowly climbed to fifth, and sometimes fourth. He thrilled conservatives with a perfectly-wrought attack on media bias at the debate in Boulder. He raised $12.2 million in the third quarter, from a healthy mix of small and large donors. And he is making inroads with not just religious conservatives, but national security conservatives and libertarians.\n\n\"We're doing everything that we said we were going to do at the beginning of this campaign,\" a Cruz aide said. \"We said we were going to put together a well-structured organization that didn't grow too big and stayed within its budget. We said we would run a message campaign that said what to expect from a Cruz presidency. We said we would aggressively raise money and turn some heads with the type of folks we could bring to the table. We've done that and we're going to continue.\"\n\nNo. 4: Bush. Where to start with Bush? Things are just getting worse and worse for the one-time front-runner. He has stumbled on his family's legacy. He has struggled to declare himself his own man. He has proved a lackluster campaigner. He has fumed as Trump, and then others, overtook him. He has bet the bank on a late-primary strategy that will be irrelevant if he loses the early contests. And finally, he has performed poorly in high-profile debates.\n\nAfter his disastrous turn in Boulder, campaign manager Danny Diaz worked diligently to claim Bush is still in the game. \"He needs to continue to talk about the best record of accomplishment,\" Diaz said. \"This hasn't been decided. Forty-six percent of New Hampshire voters decide in the last week. Stay with us, brother.\"\n\nSeventh in the polls over the summer, Rubio has now climbed to third, which is a nice spot for a strategy team that didn't want to replicate the experience of past candidates who rocketed to the top only to fall just as quickly. (AP Photo)\n\nNo. 3: Rubio. One person who benefits from each Bush stumble is Rubio. If there is a race to win the establishment \"lane\" in the primary process, Rubio has now clearly overtaken Bush as the favorite. He had an anemic fundraising quarter, $5.7 million, less than half of Bush's, but insiders say Rubio's money haul has picked up considerably in recent days.\n\nWith Cruz, he is the best onstage performer in the field. Seventh in the polls over the summer, he has now climbed to third, which is a nice spot for a strategy team that didn't want to replicate the experience of past candidates who rocketed to the top only to fall just as quickly. \"We want to be first in February,\" said a Rubio aide, reflecting the campaign's don't-peak-too-soon strategy. \"We have a long way to go.\"\n\nNo. 2: Carson. Now virtually the co-leader of the national race, Carson's rise has left virtually every other competitor mystified. How does he do it? The retired brain surgeon's mix of affability, sincerity, soft-spokenness and plain speaking has captivated a large part of the Republican base, and brought in a field-leading $20.8 million in donations in the third quarter. And all for a man with the simplest and most disarming plan in politics.\n\nBefore the Boulder debate, Carson was asked his strategy for the night. \"My strategy will be to be me,\" he said. Asked how he plans to maintain his position in the polls, he answered, \"All I have to do is be myself and tell the truth.\" Rival campaigns believe Carson will fade when voters see that, for all his achievements, he is quite thin on policy knowledge. But Carson keeps surprising them.\n\nNo. 1: Trump. Almost as soon as Donald Trump hit the top of the polls this summer, he realized that the start of voting in February was so far away that he could not just keep doing the same thing over and over again and expect to stay on top. His advisers planned a schedule of newsmaking events to take him through the next few months, such as a big rally in an unexpected place, a policy rollout that sets off controversy, an eye-catching event like appearing on \"Saturday Night Live,\" all to keep the public's interest as the weeks passed.\n\nThe main question is whether Trump will finally open his checkbook and spend big dollars, his own money, for political ads. (AP Photo)\n\nBehind the scenes, Trump continues to build a solid political operation in the early states. While the boss makes news, his team is laying the foundation for what could become a formidable ground game. Like Carson, Trump's rivals expect him to fade; many believe they see the beginning of that in Carson's eclipse of Trump in Iowa. Whatever is happening, the main question many strategists have is whether Trump will finally open his checkbook and spend big dollars, his own money, for political ads. He promises that he will, but so far hasn't. If he does start spending, everyone will know that Trump is all in for the whole distance.\n\nEight candidates, eight strategies. Some insiders will tell you that there are really only two, or perhaps three, real contenders. That will be true soon enough. For the moment, though, the GOP race is a multi-dimensional game that no one has been able to master.",
  "latent_5613": "When Spamhaus requested aid from CloudFlare, the attackers began to focus their digital ire on the companies that provide data connections for both Spamhaus and CloudFlare.\n\nQuestioned about the attacks, Sven Olaf Kamphuis, an Internet activist who said he was a spokesman for the attackers, said in an online message that, “We are aware that this is one of the largest DDoS attacks the world had publicly seen.” Mr. Kamphuis said Cyberbunker was retaliating against Spamhaus for “abusing their influence.”\n\n“Nobody ever deputized Spamhaus to determine what goes and does not go on the Internet,” Mr. Kamphuis said. “They worked themselves into that position by pretending to fight spam.”\n\nA typical denial-of-service attack tends to affect only a small number of networks. But in the case of a Domain Name System flood attack, data packets are aimed at the victim from servers all over the world. Such attacks cannot easily be stopped, experts say, because those servers cannot be shut off without halting the Internet.\n\n“The No. 1 rule of the Internet is that it has to work,” said Dan Kaminsky, a security researcher who years ago pointed out the inherent vulnerabilities of the Domain Name System. “You can’t stop a DNS flood by shutting down those servers because those machines have to be open and public by default. The only way to deal with this problem is to find the people doing it and arrest them.”\n\nThe heart of the problem, according to several Internet engineers, is that many large Internet service providers have not set up their networks to make sure that traffic leaving their networks is actually coming from their own users. The potential security flaw has long been known by Internet security specialists, but it has only recently been exploited in a way that threatens the Internet infrastructure.\n\nAn engineer at one of the largest Internet communications firms said the attacks in recent days have been as many as five times larger than what was seen recently in attacks against major American banks. He said the attacks were not large enough to saturate the company’s largest routers, but they had overwhelmed important equipment.",

  "latent_5957": "Interim Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile talks with crowd members before the vice-presidential debate at Longwood University in Farmville, Va., on Oct. 4. (Joe Raedle/Reuters)\n\nEarlier today, the Erik Wemple Blog spoke with someone wishing to bat down the implications of an email that then-CNN contributor Donna Brazile sent to the Clinton campaign back in March. “From time to time I get the questions in advance,” read the subject line of the email, which was sent on March 12. In the email was a question about the death penalty.\n\nThe next evening, Clinton faced a question about the death penalty at a CNN-TVOne town hall event at Ohio State University. TVOne host Roland Martin introduced Ricky Jackson, who had been wrongly convicted of murder back in the 1970s, when he was a teenager. He asked Clinton about the death penalty.\n\nDid Brazile — who left her contributorship at CNN over the summer to take over as interim Democratic National Committee chair — help the Clinton campaign to anticipate a topic in the heat of the primary battle against Bernie Sanders? No, says Brazile, in a statement released today: “As a longtime political activist with deep ties to our party, I supported all of our candidates for president. I often shared my thoughts with each and every campaign, and any suggestions that indicate otherwise are simply untrue. As it pertains to the CNN Debates, I never had access to questions and would never have shared them with the candidates if I did.”\n\nEarlier today, a Democratic official who refused to go on the record told the Erik Wemple Blog that Brazile was sending the question to the Clinton campaign in preparation for an upcoming panel on CNN that would address the death penalty. That’s possible — as this blog noted in a previous post, Brazile appears interested in getting the Clinton camp to explain the candidate’s position on the death penalty. The relevant text:\n\nHere’s one that worries me about HRC. DEATH PENALTY 19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. That’s 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but later exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?\n\nBased on input from an anonymous Democratic official, Business Insider roared earlier today with this headline: “FACT CHECK: DNC chair Donna Brazile did not leak questions to Hillary Clinton before debate.”\n\nFACT CHECK: DNC chair Donna Brazile did not leak questions to Hillary Clinton before debate https://t.co/2YqVHx6n2V pic.twitter.com/HG9CjRCKTa — Business Insider (@businessinsider) October 11, 2016\n\nThat was more like a “Spin Check.” The site later removed this betrayal of the fact-checking ethos in favor of a much more appropriate headline: “Democratic official throws cold water on reports DNC chair leaked town-hall questions to Hillary Clinton.” An earlier version of the article even alleged that any suggestion that Brazile shared a town-hall question was a “false” report.\n\nWhen officials refuse to go on record, there’s generally a very good reason. In this case, that reason may well relate to the flimsiness of supporting evidence. If Brazile was indeed seeking guidance from the Clinton campaign for an upcoming panel discussion, where’s the transcript of that panel discussion? We have spent a moment or two checking Nexis and the CNN transcripts module for this panel discussion and haven’t found it. We’ve asked CNN and the DNC to identify this panel discussion, and we’re awaiting a response.\n\nAs the search for the discussion continues into the evening hours, it’s worth noting that Brazile herself has issued a statement that doesn’t mention anything related to a panel:\n\n“As a longtime political activist with deep ties to our party, I supported all of our candidates for president. I often shared my thoughts with each and every campaign, and any suggestions that indicate otherwise are simply untrue. As it pertains to the CNN Debates, I never had access to questions and would never have shared them with the candidates if I did. “But let’s get one thing straight. Our Intelligence Community has made it clear that the Russian government is responsible for the cyberattacks aimed at interfering with our election, and that WikiLeaks is part of that effort. This revelation should deeply trouble all Americans in both parties. And yet, Donald Trump continues to deny that Russia is behind these attempts to meddle with our electoral process and cheer on these efforts to undermine our democracy. “This is the same man who called for more Russian cyber-espionage against us, who has extensive business ties to Russia, and who regularly coddles Vladimir Putin by praising his leadership and refusing to call him out. I am deeply disappointed that the Republican leaders of the party of Reagan are publicly using information illegally obtained by the Russians, because the national security of our country should not be a partisan issue. “We are in the process of verifying the authenticity of these documents because it is common for Russia to spread misinformation and forge documents, but we cannot bow down to Putin’s wishes and allow foreign actors to try and divide our country with the hope of affecting the outcome on Election Day. There is too much at stake.” – DNC Interim Chair Donna Brazile\n\nThe record states, then, that in March, Brazile sent an email to the Clinton campaign saying, “From time to time I get the questions in advance.” In October, she says, “As it pertains to the CNN Debates, I never had access to questions and would never have shared them with the candidates if I did.” Could it be that Brazile is just lawyering everyone to death? After all, the forwarded question in this case doesn’t pertain to any “debate”; it was a “town hall” event. There is a difference. And: Whereas a “Democratic official” says that Brazile was sharing a question for panel discussion, Brazile herself makes no mention of any panel in her on-the-record statement.\n\nThere’s even more of this statement to pick apart. Observe the expertise with which Brazile attempts to raise questions about the “authenticity of these documents” without specifically declaring the email to be bogus.\n\n@ErikWemple If she wants to say an email is doctored or fake, she should point to them and say it. She won't, for obvious reasons. — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) October 11, 2016\n\nCNN needs to address this credibility crisis. From where did Brazile get this text? From someone at CNN? Are there really other instances in which she got advance questions, or was she just exaggerating her worth as an insider to her friends in the Clinton campaign? What does TVOne, CNN’s partner in the debate, have to say? (We’ve asked).",
  "latent_6048": "The blogosphere has been buzzing about revelations that CNET’s Download.com site has been embedding adware into the install process for all kinds of software, including open source software like NMAP. For the unwary, some of the ads could have been read to suggest accepting the advertised service (e.g., the Babylon translation tool bar) was part of the installation process. Users who weren’t paying attention may also have clicked “accept” simply by accident. In either event, after their next restart, they would have been surprised to find their settings had been changed, new tool bars installed, etc. Gordon Lyon, the developer who first called public attention to Download.com's practices, found a particularly egregious example last night: a bundled ad for “Drop Down Deals,” an app that, once installed, spies on your web traffic and pops up ads when you visit some sites. It’s hard to imagine that many users would choose that app on purpose.\n\nThis practice is not only deceptive, it directly contradicts Download.com’s stated policy, which promises users that it has “zero tolerance” for bundled adware and that “when it comes to fighting unwanted adware . . . Download.com has always been in your corner.” Indeed, that promise was one reason users and developers had come to trust Download.com as a reliable source.\n\nIn response to widespread criticism, CNET took some initial steps to address the problem. First, it issued a statement declaring that “as a rule” Download.com doesn’t bundle adware with open source software but that it had gone through its open source files and wasn’t doing so any more. It also revised its process to make it a little easier for users to choose not to use the adware-laden install process. In a post to developers, it also (sort of) apologized. That same post announced that Download.com was launching, in alpha, a new installer program that would only bundle adware if the developer opted-into the program.\n\nBut the company still has a long way to go. First, as several developers immediately pointed out, that “re-check” apparently wasn’t too thorough. There is still adware in some open-source installs. Second, the re-check only applied to open-source software – too bad if you are a commercial developer (even one offering free software), at least until the “opt-in” alternative gets put in place. Third, none of these steps did much to help users who are (or were) confused by the installer process and, as a result, find themselves stuck with software they didn’t want.\n\nSo, CNET, here's what you need to do to really make it right:\n\nStop bundling adware into your installer. Failing that,\n\nRewrite your adware policy to admit that Download.com no longer has a “zero tolerance” policy for bundled adware, and make the change public, so users and developers know about it. If you are going to allow ads, make sure they are not deceptive. This means it should be very clear that the ad is entirely separate from the install process (and no “accept” buttons where “next step” should be), and that the developer of the software the user actually wants has nothing to do with the advertised app. Clean up the mess: prominently offer, on the front page of the Download.com site and as part of the ads themselves, to assist users with uninstalling any advertised software they may have unknowingly installed. Right now, many users won’t know they can download the software without the adware. Direct download should be the default process, and users who choose to use the Download.com installer should know, before they do, that the process will include advertising or other software they might not want. Until the “opt-in” procedure is well-established, cease bundling adware for commercial as well as open source applications.\n\nIt’s going to take more than half-hearted rollbacks and an apology to earn back the trust of users and developers. We hope that CNET is willing to do what it takes to make this right. If it does, we’ll be the first to say so.",
  "latent_6078": "The American trial, as a method of resolving disputes, determining guilt, and rendering justice, is one of our most sacred institutions. Certain rules, such as the one that prohibits witnesses from stating opinions, are designed to screen out unreliable evidence. The opinion rule, however, had this exception: qualified experts in certain scientific fields are allowed to present their informed opinions to the jury. Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, physicians were allowed to state their medical opinions in court. Since then, the courts have been slow to accept the opinions of other experts, and to recognize other sciences. The courts will not allow, for example, the testimony of polygraph examiners, hypnotists, and graphologists. During the first two decades of the twentieth century, the courts began to recognize a group of disciplines related directly to criminal investigation. Now called criminalistics, these sciences include fingerprints, questioned documents, and firearms identification. During this crucial period, the future of criminalistics was threatened by phony experts. Perhaps the most serious threat involved one of the era's most famous personalities, the star witness in the Sacco-Vanzetti defense, and a key player in dozens of celebrated cases. This man was Albert Hamilton, and, as it turned out, he was the biggest phony of them all. He was America's greatest courtroom charlatan. In 1908, Hamilton published a brochure about himself called, “That Man From Auburn.” In this piece of self-advertisement, the druggist from Auburn, New York described himself as an expert in chemistry, microscopy, handwriting, ink analysis, typewriting identification, photography, fingerprints, and forensic toxicology. He also claimed expertise in the fields of gunshot wounds, bullet identification, guns, nitroglycerine, gun powder, blood stains, causes of death, anatomy, and embalming. To match his impressive qualifications, he awarded himself a medical degree, and from then on he was known as Doctor Hamilton. Albert Hamilton came into prominence in 1915 when he testified for the prosecution as a firearms expert in a rural New York murder case. The defendant was Charlie Stielow, a slightly retarded farm hand who was accused of shooting to death the couple who owned the farm where he worked and lived. Stielow was convicted of first-degree murder on the strength of a coerced confession and the ballistic findings of Hamilton who testified that a scratch inside the barrel of Stielow’s 22 caliber revolver had made a mark on one of the murder bullets. Having earned fifty dollars a day for his work on the case, Hamilton impressed the jury by showing them enlarged photographs of the fatal bullet. Hamilton's testimony was pure hokum. The science of firearms identification as it is practiced today, did not exist in 1915. The comparison microscope, an instrument essential to the comparison and analysis of firearms evidence, was not invented until 1926. Nevertheless, Hamilton assured the jury that the fatal bullet had been fired from the defendant's gun. His findings went unchallenged, and no one seemed to notice that he hadn't even test-fired the so-called murder weapon. Charlie Stielow was found guilty, and sentenced to death. Two years later, a pair of tramps confessed to the murder, and the Governor of New York formed a commission to review the case. Charles Waite, an investigator in the New York Attorney General's Office, was appointed by the commission to look into the matter. Waite took Stielow's revolver to a New York City police detective who knew firearms. A thorough examination of the gun convinced the officer that Stielow's revolver hadn't been fired in four years. Moreover, a naked eye examination of the test-bullets showed vastly different barrel marks than those found on the murder bullets. As a result of these findings, Charlie Stielow was pardoned, and Charles Waite went on to become a well-known firearms expert. In 1922, Waite formed the Bureau of Forensic Ballistics in New York City. The bureau, the first of its kind, was taken over in 1926 by Dr. Calvin Goddard an Army surgeon and ordnance officer from Baltimore who became the most prominent firearms identification expert in the world. In 1923, two Italian-American anarchists, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, were convicted of shooting a factory paymaster and his bodyguard to death in South Braintree, Massachusetts. The defendants' attorneys were seeking grounds for a new trial and called upon the services of Albert Hamilton. Since the Sacco-Vanzetti case had been grabbing headline for months, Hamilton eagerly got involved in the case. Sacco's conviction has been based chiefly on the testimony of three firearms witnesses who said the bullet that killed the guard had been fired from his 32 caliber handgun. The experts also believed that the gun the police found on Vanzetti when they arrested him had belonged to the slain guard. After examining the firearms evidence, Hamilton reported that the fatal bullet had not been fired from Sacco's gun, and the weapon in Vanzetti's possession was not the gun that belonged to the bodyguard. Relying on Hamilton's findings, the Sacco-Vanzetti defense made a motion for a new trial. To counter this motion, the prosecution acquired the services of two new experts. In November, 1933, during the hearing for the new trial, Hamilton conducted an in-court demonstration involving two Colts and Sacco's gun. The new 32 caliber handguns belonged to Hamilton. In front of the judge and the lawyers for both sides, Hamilton disassembled all three pistols and placed their parts in three piles on the table. He then explained the functions of each part and demonstrated how they were interchangeable. After reassembling the handguns, Hamilton placed the two new weapons back into his pocket and handed Sacco's Colt to the court clerk. Before he left the courtroom, the judge asked Hamilton to leave the new guns behind. Several months later, when the judge asked one of the prosecution firearms experts to reinspect Sacco's gun, the expert discovered that the barrel to Sacco's gun was brand new. Following an inquiry, Hamilton admitted that the new barrel on Sacco's Colt had come from one of his pistols. Although it was obvious to everyone that Hamilton had made the switch, presumably with a mistrial in mind, he denied it. Hamilton continued his association with the Sacco-Vanzetti defense, but he no longer played an important role in the case. He had destroyed his credibility as a firearms expert witness. The Sacco-Vanzetti motion for a new trial was denied, and in 1927 the two men were executed. Prior to their death, Dr. Calvin Goddard, the most qualified firearms examiner in the world, stated that Sacco's gun had been the murder weapon. (Several modern firearms experts have examined the ballistics evidence in the case and agree with Goddard's findings.)",

Jackson said Trump is running on a platform of hate, but noted that his GOP running mates are no better.\n\nHis presidential picks are Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, but he thinks Clinton has a better shot at the White House. \"I'm forever a Democrat, you know, and I'm gonna vote for Hillary,\" Jackson said. \"I mean, I love Bernie — Bernie's a man of the people — but he can't win. So I gotta cast my vote for a person that can keep those other people from winning, OK?\"\n\nJackson added that he was confident Clinton could \"hit the ground running\" and start holding Congress members accountable for inaction. \"And hopefully she can open up the skeletal files of those do-nothing assholes that go to work, like, four times a year and not vote on things and threaten them with whatever she and Bill [Clinton] uncovered on them years ago and make 'em do something and we can get something done,\" he said. The Reporter counted this comment as a pointed slam against Sen.

In 2013, he chided President Barack Obama for speaking in a register he thought was contrived.

  "latent_6181": "How to climb the Kilimanjaro like an alpinist Edouard Klein, edou -at- rdklein.fr\n\nReleased under Creative Commons CC-by-SA licence.\n\nLatest version of this document available at : http://rdklein.fr/essays/kilimanjaro.html.\n\nPDF version available at http://rdklein.fr/essays/kilimanjaro.pdf.\n\nAbstract Climbing Mount Kilimanjaro is a heartbreaking experience, as one has to witness and participate in the absurd masquerade organized by the locals. It is a pity that such a beautiful mountain can not be enjoyed freely, in the alpine spirit. We give advice on how to climb Kilimanjaro without porter, with one’s own equipment and food, and on how to minimize the price. We hope this advice will lead to alpinists claiming back the roof of Africa by climbing it in the sanest possible way.\n\n1 Intro\n\nMount Kilimanjaro is a volcano that stands higher than any other mountain above the ground around it. Its summit is the highest point in Africa, and it thus earned its place in the Messner list.\n\nIt is also the saddest mountain I have ever climbed, and I have climbed multiple mountains and hills all over Europe, in the Pamirs and in Borneo.\n\nClimbing mount Kilimanjaro is not primarily a challenge of your skill, stamina and grit against a truly beautiful but dangerous and reasonably difficult mountain, as it could and should be. It is mainly a test of your patience and wallet against a corrupt bureaucracy, tightly applied nonsensical regulations, and exploitative tour companies.\n\nAlpinists, and I use the word in its loosest meaning of people that love mountains, will be disheartened by this climb if they do it the usual way. I drew from my experience climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in August of 2014 and from what I learned before (while preparing the attempt) and after (when talking to porters, guides or other people involved in tourism in Tanzania) to put together a HOW-TO for climbing the roof of Africa. Following this advice, the climber can:\n\nbudget according to the lowest prices one can possibly pay (subsection 4.1);\n\ncompletely avoid porter labor and thus the ethical and financial costs associated with it (subsection 4.2);\n\nminimize time spent in Kilimanjaro National Park and thus the outrageous financial costs associated with each day near the mountain (subsection 5.1);\n\nminimize the risk of altitude sickness, using actual scientific advice (subsection 5.2);\n\ntake only and all of what is necessary for the hike (section 6);\n\nmake sure that the guide(s) will at worst only minimally hinder progression (subsection 4.3).\n\nAlthough this method allows one to take only minimal part in the sad circus that circles around the mountain, one still has to witness it. Therefore the short answer to “How to climb Mount Kilimanjaro like an alpinist” is : Don’t.\n\nNo, seriously, don’t.\n\n2 The highest scam in Africa\n\nThe typical Mount Kilimanjaro experience has the climber choose one of many similar agencies which will handle the red tape, lie about the porters’ and the guides’ salaries, add various random fees (such as transport fees from the hotel to the gate or food for whomever) and show a bill of at least 900 USD per person.\n\nOnce on the mountain the hiker will walk from camp to camp with only a light pack on his back. While he enjoys breakfast sitting on a chair or a stool around a camping table, the army of porters he was more or less coerced in hiring packs everything and races to the next camp, so his tent can be set up before his arrival for a dinner cooked from fresh ingredients.\n\nThe last two days are the most difficult. After African water, despite the water purification pills, has had between 3 and 5 days to possibly destroy his digestive system, the climber must ascend the last two kilometers in 48 hours. The last 1200m are climbed sometimes at night in well below freezing temperatures, with unwanted pauses in the unpreventable bottlenecks that forms in the long line of tired and disoriented people attempting the summit.\n\nThe descent is no easy feat either. After a short time at the top spent exhausted taking pictures and wishing he was elsewhere, the now successful climber goes back down to enjoy some food and hot beverage at the stupidly named ”base camp” he left a few hours ago. Depending on how he budgeted his attempt, he either must go all the way down to the gate or can stop at one of the intermediary camp for one more night.\n\nOur climber has paid a lot of money to be baby-sat up the mountain, in a way that runs contrary to what is known about acclimatization while an army of wage slaves carried unnecessary gear for him. All that makes climbing a mountain a unique experience is gone, and Tanzania is not in any significant measure a better place despite all the money spent. To avoid this heart-crushing experience to those who love mountains, whatever their level or experience, I propose a technique that most closely match what can be done almost anywhere else.\n\n3 The as least nonsense as possible technique\n\nMount Kilimanjaro is administered completely backwards. It is impossible, short of breaking local law, to climb it without taking part in this absurd and damaging masquerade. The game is then to minimize the damage.\n\n3.1 Dura lex, sed lex\n\nIn a perfect world, climbing Mount Kilimanjaro would be a matter settled between you and Mount Kilimanjaro. Sadly, regulations will add multiple parties to the mix. Here is what you can avoid and what you must deal with.\n\nAmong the unavoidable madness is the red tape. Every day on the mountain will cost you 120 USD that go with very little accountability to the Tanzanian government. A wise choice of route (subsection 5.1) will minimize the number of days spent on the mountain. Each day should be spent either climbing or acclimatizing. No“scenic route” nonsense. At 120 USD per day, you want minimize the distance between you and Uhuru point as fast as altitude sickness will let you. The fastest route is truly beautiful, and the few glimpses of the volcano you may catch between two clouds on the longer routes are just not worth the money.\n\nAlso unavoidable are the guides. The guide is hit-or-miss. A seasoned alpinist with a thorough local knowledge can be invaluable if he is fully on board with your unusual way of climbing. On the other hand, you may find a racist, aggressive guide that refuses to understand why you don’t want to promote local employment by hiring porters, or how climbing experience anywhere else than on mount Kilimanjaro can possibly be relevant here. He knows the regulations better than you do and can seriously jeopardize the attempt. Talk at length to your guide before even agreeing to anything, much less paying and setting foot in the park.\n\nCompletely avoidable are the porters. It will be difficult to make the agency admit that you want to try to climb without porters (because they make a nice profit from their supposed salary) but as of yet, no regulation forces you to hire one. Don’t fall for the ”but it provides employment” trap. This is just an excuse used to justify what clearly is wage slavery. Porter is a dangerous, widely underpaid even by Tanzanian standards, difficult job. You will see them, ill-equipped, sweating or freezing under heavier weight than regulation supposedly permits to carry unnecessary stuff higher than the top of Mont Blanc or Elbruz for people that have no business being here.\n\n3.2 Off the beaten track\n\nWhat is considered so usual in mountaineering that it is not even worth mentioning will seem strange to some on the Kilimanjaro. Agencies and guide will assume you want to do as everybody else unless you explicitly state otherwise. Here is what you should make clear from the beginning.\n\nAltitude sickness should be avoided the simple, reliable and backed with scientific evidence way : ascend ; if you feel bad, stop ; if you feel really bad, go down ; repeat (subsection 5.2). Explain this to your guide and make sure he agrees. Refuse any ”walk high sleep low” nonsense and take the most direct route (subsection 5.1).\n\nBook for the minimum number of days, and pay any extra day when exiting the park. Be confident in your abilities, Mount Kilimanjaro is a high altitude hike. The only thing between a well-equipped and reasonably fit alpinist and the summit is sickness either from altitude or dirty water. Altitude sickness is cured with patience and money (150 USD per day in the park), stomach problems are bad luck, not a sign of your capabilities as an alpinist.\n\nFully acclimatize at the last camp at 4600m before attempting to reach the top. You will be better shape for the final push, and you will be able to rest as long as you like at the ”base camp” during your descent. Non-acclimatized climbers must continue going down and can not stop for long at 4600m.\n\nSeeing you carrying your own stuff, setting up your own tent and cooking your own meals is likely to get reactions from other tourists or guides and porters. Some react by encouraging you and talking, in an open minded way, about your motivation. Some react with more or less overt hostility. Be prepared.\n\n4 Agency choice\n\n4.1 On-line or on-site ?\n\nThe cheapest way to book is definitely on site. Asking for unusual conditions will also be easier on site, negotiations will be quicker. Go to Moshi (Arusha is bigger, dirtier, further away from the gates and feels less secure) and talk to a few agencies. Whatever accommodation you have will probably have a company they usually work with. Work with them, then go to town a ask two or three other agencies. Most will give the prices listed in table 1.\n\nGuide salary 20 - 25 USD/day Porter salary 10 - 15 USD/day Office profit 100 - 150 USD Random bullshit fees 150 USD Camping fees 50 USD/day/person Park entrance 70 USD/day/person Rescue fee 20 USD\n\nAgencies will not voluntary speak in depth about tipping. Plan on at least 10 USD/day/person for both guides and porters, adjust according to your feelings. Porters do a physically harder job than guides, and you probably will not need your guide’s ”expertise”, so tip your guides more than your porters only if there exist a good reason to do so.\n\nDo not let yourself be bullied into hiring one or more porter if you don’t want to. Be sure to bring the people you are talking to on board with your project. If they don’t seem willing to help you, get out and find somebody else. Agencies have strong incentives to make you fall in rank. They want easy money doing the usual thing. The proposed method deprives them of the money they make by paying porters less than they say they do, furthermore you will spend fewer days in the park than most other tourists so there is less money to be made off the guide’s work.\n\nIf they invoke park regulations to make you pay for something you don’t need (such as extra guides or porters, or some equipment) play dumb with the next agency. If all invoke the same regulation without you prompting them, there is a chance it is real. Regulations applying to tourists are blindly followed by anyone on the mountain, and you may get denounced if somebody sees you. As stupid and arbitrary as they may seem, follow the rules unless you are prepared to jeopardize your attempt and loose a lot of money just to make a point.\n\nDo not accept to bring any “security” equipment. If you follow the correct acclimatization guidelines, you will need neither oxygen nor a portable hyperbaric chamber.\n\nPlan on a total bill of at least 1000 USD per person, including tips. If you manage well you will have some of it left, but you may or may not have the patience to find somebody willing to scam you less than others and if you give up early you will save your sanity at the cost of around 100 USD.\n\nDo not get friendly with the agencies. They are scamming you, exploiting the guides and porters and there is not much you can do about it. Pay the park fees yourself at the gate. Ask for a receipt.\n\n4.2 Porter and guide labor\n\nPorters on Mount Kilimanjaro are forced to do one of the stupidest job on the planet. If some of them were made to dig holes on the ground that others had to fill back, it would at least be less dangerous and less damaging to the ecosystem. They form an almost uninterrupted flow around the mountain. Those who left at sunrise arrive at the next camp when the last to depart from it are still packing. If you stay 24 hours at a camp, you will see it disappear and reappear during the day. Tents from large agencies are being replaced by the exact same model brought up by the porters of the following day as if the tent had actually stayed there, only it didn’t and somebody will break his back circling one heavy tent all the way from gate to gate.\n\nUnnecessarily luxurious equipment and food, such as tables, chairs, portables toilets, bread and fresh vegetables are also carried up on man’s back. The best way to avoid this madness is to handle your food and your tent yourself.\n\nIf your agency plays the friends game, tell them you only give them the office profit, and will give the salary directly to the porters and guides, the transport fee directly to the driver etc. ; watch the smile wash away from their face as they find excuses as to why this is not possible. If they let you do it, rest assured they will take that money back behind your back. A porter or guide that claims his announced salary would never find work again, have I been explained by an ex-porter and a current guide.\n\nIf you do need to hire porters, request to manage their loads yourself. Regulations theoretically forbid porters from carrying more than 25 kg, but on the higher camps they may or may not be followed, particularly because water need to be brought up from a lower altitude. If you let your porter carry a humane weight of 20 kg or less, be careful, your guides may unload their packs on the porter’s back.\n\n4.3 Guide choice\n\nImagine how a last minute addition to a climbing party can derail an attempt if characters don’t match, and add to the mix a commercial relationship based on a lie about the salary. Now realize that the new comer is at home while you will be tired, ill foreigners and you will have a good idea of how much the choice of your guide matters.\n\nTalk at length with your guide before making any commitment. If he doesn’t speak well any language you are proficient in, ask for somebody else. If he seems reluctant to climb without porter and you are not absolutely positive your explanation as to why you do it that way has convinced him, ask for somebody else. If he does not acknowledge your previous climbing experience or refuses to adapt his acclimatization strategy, choose somebody else. If you have any uneasy feeling, ask for somebody else. The best is to find a guide with climbing experience outside of Kilimanjaro, possibly somewhere in Western Europe. Some are even real mountain guides by alpine standards, try to get one of those.\n\nThere may be a financial incentive for the guide to hire porters : sometimes guides are tasked with sharing the tip with their teams, and they do not share as instructed. If you suspect you may be talking to one such individual, ask for somebody else. In any cases, give tips individually. Don’t expect a thank you (although you may get one), your tip makes up most of their actual salary, they think you owe it to them. Give the tip at the latest opportunity, as some guides or porter will stop caring about you once they get their money.\n\nDon’t be deterred by this appalling list of warnings, there are helpful, competent, interesting guides on Mount Kilimanjaro, but you must at all costs avoid a rotten apple.\n\n5 Route choice\n\n5.1 Itinerary\n\nMost routes begin by a few days of dicking around and maybe seeing the mountain between two clouds. With 120 USD/day/person of park fees, plus the tip and salary, these are not the routes you want to take.\n\nThe most direct route, the Mweka route, seem to be forbidden for ascent. This is a shame as it would be the best choice. The next best is the Umbwe route. Two of its camp (Barranco and Karranga) are at the same altitude (around 4000m), therefore one of them may be skipped. The time gained should be spent acclimatizing at Barafu (4600m). Most tourists hike for only half of the day as the camps are quite close to one another. A long day could allow you to skip one camp, depending on your fitness level. If you intend to do so, get you guide on board and get up early, you will have more time to walk and you will avoid the bottlenecks that overwrowding forms on the way.\n\nOne can skip any of the first three camps of the Umbwe route. This means that instead of the usual 4-days path: Gate (1700m) - Forest Cave (2850m) - Barranco (3950m) - Karranga (4000m) - Barafu (4600m), one can go :\n\nfrom the gate to Barranco, and then to Barafu (2 days),\n\nor from the gate to Forest Cave, then Karranga and Barafu (3 days),\n\nor from the gate to Forest Cave, then Barranco and finally Barafu (3 days).\n\nThe time thus gained can be used resting at higher camps to make the average altitude gain per day come down to 500m as recommended (subsection 5.2).\n\nThe way from Barranco to Karranga includes a steep ascent and may require the use of hands, but if you manage to avoid traffic you can actually progress quickly there. I suggest not spending one full day between Barranco and Karranga, either start from Forest Cave, or stop at Barafu. An exception to this rule is if you feel the need to sleep one more night at Barranco to acclimatize, then maybe go sleep at Karranga instead if your body can bring you there.\n\nWarning : the last water point is Karranga valley, a 5 minute speed walk from Karranga camp. Plan accordingly.\n\nThink hard about whether seeing the sunrise from the top is worth climbing at night in the bitter cold behind slow moving large groups. It is indeed a breathtaking sight. It is difficult to enjoy cold, tired and sick, though. If you are fully acclimatized, you can start after sunrise, get on top before clouds come, and be back down to sleep where you started. Other tourists have to start early because they can not rest at 4600m and must use the rest of the day to continue going down.\n\nUsually, the porters keep an eye on your tent while you go for the final push. If you elect to go without porter, you must find a way to secure your belongings. Split your party, hire a porter just for that task, go with one more guide than is necessary... Theft is not unheard of at Barafu (or on other camps as well).\n\n5.2 Altitude sickness\n\nThe current medical consensus Luks et al. [2010] on how to avoid altitude sickness is, above 3000m, to climb less than 500m/day on average. Diamox is an effective drug to prevent altitude sickness, with only minimal side effects.\n\nThe “walk high, sleep low” motto is unproven in general. The altitude reached during the day seem to have little effect on acclimatization, the altitude at which one sleeps is more important. In consequence, don’t tire yourself walking up and down : ascend gradually, then rest. The particular implementation of “walk high, sleep low” that most guides adhere to runs contrary to all acclimatization guidelines as you would spend most of your time around 4000m and then climb the last two kilometers in less than 48 hours.\n\nTo help you assess the severity of altitude sickness and take appropriate action, the Alpine research association ARPE publishedRichalet et al. [2009] a scoreboard (table 2).\n\nHeadache 1 Loss of appetite, nausea 1 Vertigo 1 Medication-resistant headache 2 Vomiting 2 Panting while at rest 3 Abnormal or important tiredness 3 Decrease in urine quantity 3\n\nWith a score from 1 to 3, take a painkiller. From 4 to 6, take a painkiller and stop climbing. Above 6, go down until symptoms stop (they will disappear suddenly).\n\nThe proposed route allow you to stop at various points during your ascent to rest and acclimatize according to the recommended ascent rate (500m/day on average). As previously said, fully acclimatize at the last camp (the ”base camp”) before attempting. The higher camps don’t always have a water source, you may fall short ; one member of the party may have to go down to Karranga to get some more water.\n\n6 Equipment\n\nYou may rent or buy some equipment in Moshi, but the price or quality may not be satisfying. The surest way is to bring everything from home, including dehydrated food which may be hard to come by in Tanzania. Gas canisters can not fly, but 450g Butagaz propane/butane cartridges can be bought in Moshi. Bring a compatible burner or a liquid fuel stove.\n\nPlan on having 20 kg, give or take 2 kg, on your back at the beginning, the pack becoming lighter as you consume food. Take the usual equipment for both a jungle trek (it starts with a few kilometers in a rain-forest) and a high altitude hike. Temperature on the summit can reach -15C. If you are not sure what to bring, buy and read Freedom of the Hills (Eng [2010]).\n\nPlastic water bottles are forbidden on the mountain . This is infuriatingly inconvenient. Bring alternative means to carry water and water purification pills. Boiling for at least ten minutes is impractical short of bringing a lot of gas, and pills take time before you can drink therefore you will have to be careful with water management. Bring containers whose volume can be purified with a integer number of pills, including at least one large container to use during water runs at higher camps. Double check for leaks.\n\nGarbage is weighted at every camp. Bring multiple strong garbage bags. If you pack only dehydrated food, you will not meet the quota, as your garbage will be too light by day 3 or 4. You can try to gather any garbage you find on your way to gather more weight or hide a stone in a dirty Kleenex (they may look into the garbage back, be stealthy). If you wish to argue about the stupidity of the quotas, be prepared to stay there all morning and then gather some more garbage anyway.\n\nBiological waste is a problem on the mountain. Please be responsible if you have to go outside of a designated place. Ideally, one should put the used toilet paper in a plastic bag and empty it in the next toilet. Be also careful not to pollute the streams, they may irrigate a lower camp. Finally, despite the dreadful state of decrepitude they are in, please use the toilets. At Barafu, either the stench is truly unbearable and one has to be quick not to suffocate or there is no door, but this is still better than finding an improvised toilet on the way. Bring more toilet paper than you think you need, the one you can buy in Moshi is flimsy and there is not much paper per roll.\n\nThe hike starts high enough so that mosquitoes are not a problem. Malaria prevention medication must be taken one week after exposure has stopped, this means that if you take some before you will have to continue treatment during your attempt. This may not be a good idea. If you go directly to the mountain you can reasonably spend without protection the one or two days it takes to prepare everything and begin treatment after you come down if you plan to stay in an infected area.\n\nPlan your equipment as if you were climbing with no addition to your party. If your agency or guide ask to check your equipment, show them. Ask in return to check the guide’s equipment. Some of them don’t have gloves and spend the final push hands in their crotch to avoid losing a finger. If your guide don’t have the correct equipment, there is a very slight chance he is too poor to buy it, but most probably he does not see the point and spends his money elsewhere. Therefore do not feel sorry and keep your good gear for yourself. A guide with good equipment is an encouraging sign that he may have actual climbing experience.\n\nIf the agency suggests you rent or buy more equipment, be very critical of the suggestions. Do not be bullied in bringing oxygen. If you have a medical condition that may require oxygen breathing, don’t climb Mount Kilimanjaro. If you fear severe altitude sickness, follow the scoreboard and you will never get to the point where you need oxygen. Kilimanjaro is not a 8-thousander and oxygen is expansive and heavy.\n\n7 Who can climb\n\nIf you are unsure about your physical and technical ability to climb Mount Kilimanjaro, head to the nearest mountain range for a two-days camping trip. On the first day, climb 700m with a 20kg backpack, on the second climb 1200m with only food and water. If you managed that without too much difficulty, you probably will be able to climb the roof of Africa. Difficulties will pile up : disease, bureaucracy, overcrowding, cold, water scarcity and altitude, but with grit you can overcome them and maybe enjoy this mountain as if it were free.\n\nIf 20 kg is too much for you (and it is indeed damaging to your body to haul heavy weights), you may hire help. Hiring a porter is not a deathly sin. Make sure he is paid fairly and that he carries more or less 20 kg of useful stuff. Just don’t kid yourself in believing they are all happy with their job.\n\nAlmost anybody can attempt and succeed. Even a 70 years old that couldn’t climb a moderately difficult hill alone. But maybe he should refrain. I believe there is nothing wrong with using alternate means of reaching the top of a mountain, be it with a chopper, a cable car, a 4x4, a donkey... But when those alternate means rely on the exploitation of other human beings, I think a red line is crossed. My position on whether or not to climb Kili would then be : don’t climb if you refuse to take responsibility for the well-being of those that will work for you. The method I propose uses self-reliance to ensure almost nobody works for you, but craploads of money and a little bit of common sense and decency could work as well. A rich retired slow walking 70 years old can enjoy the summit without selling his soul to the devil.\n\n8 Related work\n\nWhile researching in preparation for my attempt of August 2014, I was unable to find most of the information presented here. Everything is distorted by the implicit acceptance of the park’s silly rules and customs. I have written this HOW-TO to help tear the veil of madness that floats over this mountain. Information online describe Kilimanjaro as how it works, with all the tour agencies, porters, guides etc. not as how it is as a mountain : the water points, the difficult parts etc. All the bullshit that surrounds the mountain has actually shaped it and now almost completely defines it.\n\nThis HOW-TO is, to the best of my knowledge, the only work that describes how to experience Mount Kilimanjaro in a sane way.\n\nBissell [2007] describes the usual experience and while it does not denounce it, it describes the madness.\n\nThe IMEC used to maintain a list of agencies that treat porters decently. Sadly, they are not allowed in the park anymore by the authorities, so they are unable to control employment conditions on the mountain and withdrew their list from their website. On Reddit, /u/dJe781 reports that one can mail them to get their last partner list, though.\n\nMost other resources are, links to, or source from info-advertisement put online by tour agencies. They may even not be up to date.\n\nI was unable to find an english version of the park’s regulations (such as the garbage weighting system or the forbidding of water bottles). Maybe they’re oral tradition.\n\n9 Conclusion\n\nThe proposed method is, I believe, the least frustrating way of climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. It is still very frustrating. The climb is difficult as it is (it is only a hike, but a difficult one), but you will have to pay for services and live with people that most probably won’t actually help you that much.\n\nYou also will have to look as nobody seems to notice the sheer absurdity of having hundreds of local workers setting and breaking camp every day, Sisyphus-style, for a handful of tourist.\n\nFinally, you will always be surrounded by other tourists, guides and porters. Some climb with more than twenty workers for a party of 3 tourists.\n\nIf this HOW-TO helped you in your ascent, and you saved a couple hundred USD following this advice, then please consider spending some of it to help an NGO involved in Africa. If you want to take direct action, allow me to suggest contacting Integrity School in Arusha (integrityschooltz -at- gmail.com). They provide cheap education to low-income families and will probably accept money or material help (such as school supplies) with great relief.\n\nThis article was submitted on reddit : http://www.reddit.com/r/alpinism/comments/2f6aai/how_to_climb_the_kilimanjaro_like_an_alpinist/.\n\nReferences",

The Chinese side will absolutely not accept it,\" spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.\n\nRimsky Yuen Kwok-keung, Hong Kong's justice secretary, likewise denied that authorities there intentionally let Snowden leave before acting on U.S. requests.\n\n\"All along, we acted fully in accordance with the law and any suggestion that we have been deliberately letting Mr. Snowden go away or to do any other thing to obstruct the normal operation is totally untrue,\" Yuen said Tuesday.\n\nAuthorities in Hong Kong were seeking answers from U.S. authorities around when Snowden left, the justice secretary added. Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-Ying said Monday that authorities acted independently from Beijing \"to follow procedural fairness and procedural justice.\"\n\nIn Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the U.S. complaints \"absolutely groundless and unacceptable.\"\n\n\"I want to say, right away, that we have nothing to do with Mr. Snowden or his movements around the world,\" Lavrov said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Did the U.S. drop the ball on Snowden?

Washington has described that move as a \"serious setback\" to building trust between the United States and China.\n\nBut the Obama administration doesn't have much leverage with Moscow, said Matthew Rojansky, an expert on U.S. and Russian national security at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"We really need Russian cooperation, I think, much more in most areas than the Russians need us,\" he said.\n\nU.S. diplomatic headache\n\nWashington is also telling other countries where Snowden might end up -- notably Ecuador, which says it's analyzing an asylum request from Snowden -- that they should hand him over if he lands on their soil. They note that his U.S. passport has been revoked.\n\n\"The U.S. is advising these governments that Mr. Snowden is wanted on felony charges and as such should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than is necessary to return him here to the United States,\" Carney said.\n\nOne rumored destination is Venezuela, whose leaders have been frequently at odds with Washington in recent years.\n\nAccording to the AVN state news agency, President Nicolas Maduro said Tuesday his country has not received a formal request for political asylum from Snowden. But if it did, the government would consider it on humanitarian grounds, the agency reports.\n\nIn its quest to get Snowden, the United States has limited options. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the issue now \"is much more of a political and diplomatic matter than it is a legal matter.\"\n\n\"In an ordinary case, sure, you need a passport to get around,\" Toobin said. \"But here, where this case is causing increasing embarrassment for the United States, governments that want the United States to be embarrassed are only too happy to waive some of the technical legal rules.\"\n\nThe leak controversy\n\nSnowden has acknowledged he leaked classified documents about the NSA's surveillance programs to the Guardian newspaper in Britain and The Washington Post.\n\nThe documents revealed the existence of programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and monitor the Internet activity of people overseas residents.\n\nThe disclosures shook the U.S. intelligence community and raised questions about whether the NSA is eroding American civil liberties.\n\nSnowden worked as a Hawaii-based computer network administrator for Booz Allen Hamilton, an NSA contractor, before he fled to Hong Kong last month with laptops full of confidential information.\n\nThe South China Morning Post newspaper published a story Monday quoting Snowden as saying he took the job to gather evidence on U.S. surveillance programs.\n\nHe told the Guardian that he exposed the surveillance programs because they pose a threat to democracy, but administration officials said the programs are vital to preventing terrorist attacks and are overseen by all three branches of government.\n\nCarney questioned Snowden's assertion that he acted in defense of democratic transparency, saying his argument \"is belied by the protectors he has potentially chosen -- China, Russia, Ecuador.\"\n\n\"His failures to criticize these regimes suggests that his true motive throughout has been to injure the national security of the United States, not to advance Internet freedom and free speech,\" Carney told reporters.\n\nSnowden's search\n\nSnowden is seeking asylum from Ecuador, Iceland and other, unspecified countries, a WikiLeaks attorney said Monday.\n\nEcuador has already given WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange freedom if he can find a way out of the country's embassy in London.\n\nIn his aslyum request read by Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo, Snowden compared himself to Pvt. Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier accused of leaking classified information through WikiLeaks.\n\nHe said U.S. officials have treated Manning inhumanely by holding him in solitary confinement, and he predicted a similar \"cruel and unusual\" fate for himself if he falls into U.S. hands.\n\nSnowden has come under some criticism for seeking out help from nations with questionable histories on free speech and press freedom.\n\nFor instance, The Committee to Protect Journalists has criticized Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa's government for pushing legislation that would roll back press freedoms, calling its policies increasingly repressive.\n\nSnowden isn't looking for \"political nirvana,\" said Glenn Greenwald, the columnist for the Guardian who broke his revelations.\n\n\"He's searching for a place where he can be safe and remain free and participate in the debate, and Ecuador seems to be the place he has chosen,\" Greenwald told CNN's \"The Lead.\"\n\nSome have speculated Snowden has \"doomsday insurance\" in the form of even more top-secret U.S. documents that will go public if he's ever detained by U.S. authorities.\n\nHrafnsson, the WikiLeaks spokesman, said he didn't know about Snowden's specific plans, but did suggest more secrets may be revealed.\n\n\"This is simply information that should be out in the public,\" he said. \"There is more to come.\"",

  "latent_6552": "The federal government is teaming up with an LGBT organization in coming months to launch an unprecedented outreach to LGBT people outside of the nation's urban centers — even as it works on finalizing a rule to ban anti-transgender discrimination in its programs.\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture, in conjunction with the National Center for Lesbian Rights, is launching the new campaign targeting LGBT Americans living in rural areas Wednesday.\n\n\"You never know what could come out of this,\" Joe Leonard Jr., assistant secretary for civil rights at the USDA, told BuzzFeed. \"In addition to getting out information on our programs, there could be things in the next farm bill that comes out of these listening sessions because heretofore we just didn't know.\"\n\nThe campaign, or Rural Pride, will center around daylong summits hosted by the USDA, NCLR, and local LGBT advocacy partners based in rural communities across the country — the first of which will be held June 6 in Greensboro, N.C., in partnership with the LGBTQ Law Center at North Carolina A&T State University. Advocates and the USDA aim to \"elevate\" the needs of rural area LGBT people, who face numerous obstacles due to a lack of visibility, and to make them aware of USDA programs, according to Maya Rupert, policy director at NCLR.\n\nUSDA programs — such as rural housing loans, community facility grants, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, youth programs, and community partnerships — can \"strengthen the daily lives of LGBT rural community members,\" the USDA's description of the upcoming summit notes.\n\n\"In the long run, it's a win-win for the country,\" Leonard said. \"What we're endeavoring to pursue is courting the LGBT community and letting them know about all the different things that USDA does. We're building on the program side, but what I know is that we're going to end up getting better employees, we're going to end up having better farmers, provide better homes to people who heretofore had to go through a bank and didn't know they could go to USDA.\"\n\nRural LGBT communities are often victimized based on the combination of their LGBT identities and other factors like socioeconomic status, race, and lack of rights under the law like marriage equality and nondiscrimination protections, according to Rupert. Members of the transgender community — particularly transgender people of color — are particularly vulnerable and experience higher rates of poverty, homelessness, and unemployment than cisgender, or non-transgender, people, she said. On top of that, findings from the 2010 U.S. census show that same-sex couples raising children are more common in the South than anywhere else.\n\n\"What we want to do is dismantle some of these myths that the LGBT community doesn't live in rural areas, that they are wealthy, and then also talk about the policies that would impact these peoples' lives,\" Rupert said. \"As we experience an unprecedented number of LGBT equality victories across the country, many people living in rural communities have not seen the full impact of these victories simply because of where they live. We wanted to give people the opportunity to talk to the USDA officials and advocates and say, 'These are the things we need.'\"\n\nAdditionally, the USDA has worked with NCLR to craft a nondiscrimination rule that would prohibit discrimination based on gender identity in programs facilitated by the USDA, such as its homeownership loan program, which assists low or moderate income rural people in purchasing or building a home. The rule would also apply to its Community Facility Program when it is approved. USDA officials say they are in the final phases of the plan with the White House. USDA already prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\n\"Housing has always been an issue in communities of color and the LGBT community, so this is important,\" Leonard said. \"This rule guarantees that if someone comes there who is transgender, you cannot discriminate against them in regard to that. Our single-family housing is a vertical elevator up. It's our safety net. This is the person who is trying to build equity, this is the person who is trying to move from multifamily housing to their own home.\"\n\nThe timing on the rule, however, is less than clear, Ashlee Davis, the special assistant for civil rights at USDA, told BuzzFeed: \"We don't know anything about timeline. We're hopeful, though, that it will happen soon. The first round of comments from the White House Office of Management and Budget were incredibly positive, so we feel very confident.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced in 2012 it would ban discrimination in its housing programs based on sexual orientation or gender identity. \"HUD has the authority over [housing in] urban areas, we cover rural areas,\" Leonard said. \"So, if anything, instead of a blanket on a bed covering 25% of the bed, it covers the entire bed.\"\n\nThe summits, for their part, will mark the first time the USDA has conducted outreach specifically for the LGBT community. Throughout the campaign, USDA and NCLR will take feedback from rural LGBT Americans across the country, which Rupert hopes will translate into new policies and programs or even a working group within the USDA that will specifically oversee LGBT rural issues. \"We need somebody who knows about health, lending, housing, transportation, and faith communities to all come together and say this is what we need to do and where we need to go from here,\" she said.\n\nBoth Rupert and Leonard anticipate the needs of LGBT Americans in some rural areas will be different from others, as marriage rights and nondiscrimination protections vary from state to state.

Sources have confirmed that Mackay will sign a multi-year deal, debut at The Open Championship and work the FedEx Cup Playoffs and the Presidents Cup in August and September.\n\n“When Phil and I split up, several people got in touch,” Mackay said Tuesday in explaining how this career change happened in 16 days. “People have been nice enough over the years to say something to me about how they thought [broadcasting] was something maybe I could do at some point in my life. It was always something I’d say thank you to, and personally thought about. When Phil and I split, I got several phone calls, and it became a bigger opportunity, really seriously, the last few weeks.”\n\nIn Mackay’s account of his mutual split with Mickelson, announced on June 20 , being a broadcaster was not a subject they discussed. Mackay also confirmed he received calls from several golfers about continuing his career as a caddie that in his words were “very intriguing.”\n\nIntriguing also would be a word to describe the decision Tommy Roy, NBC’s lead producer for its golf coverage, made to put Mackay on air. From Roy’s perspective, Mackay brings more than just the caddie perspective to the job. “First of all, he’s a great communicator,” Roy said Wednesday. “That’s the No. 1 attribute you have to have to be in this business as an announcer.” Roy picked that up in years of eavesdropping on conversations between Mickelson and Mackay during NBC broadcasts.\n\nNo. 2 is that Bones has been in the arena, as Roy said, “Under the most pressure packed circumstances, and to get through those with the highest highs and some of the lowest lows is an incredible wealth of experience to call on.”\n\nNo. 3 is something Roy experienced making Mackay and fellow caddie John Wood part of the Golf Channel and NBC coverage of the 2015 RSM Classic. Coming through that week on Sea Island, and in dinners Roy has shared with Mackay over the years, was Mackay’s understanding of the story lines beyond what he and Mickelson were doing, seeing the bigger picture at tournaments.\n\n“To have that before getting into the TV business is astounding quite honestly,” Roy said. “So he’s got all these attributes that he can put to use and we can put them to use.”\n\nFinally, there is the element of Mackay being a recognizable and well-respected personality in the golf world. “He’s as well known and maybe more known than some of the players and he’s very likeable, too,” Roy said. “There’s a ton of potential here.”\n\nThese words are flattering to Mackay.\n\n“The first thing I’ll say is, I obviously have a ton to learn,” Mackay said. “Early on, my only goal is to get comfortable and get better. But for what I could bring is a caddie perspective, I may have something more to say about the dynamic of player and caddie going on out there. But again I have a lot to learn. Right now, it’s just a question of jumping in with both feet and learning as much as I possibly can, as quickly as I can.”\n\nInterestingly, too, with his schedule, there remains the potential for Mackay to do some caddieing while also broadcasting. “I don’t think it rules anything out,” Mackay said. “I’m going to be working 20-odd weeks a year. I think being a caddie is always going to be in my blood, but right now it’s one thing at a time.”\n\nRELATED: Phil Mickelson and Jim (Bones) Mackay part ways after 25 years\n\nWATCH: GOLF DIGEST VIDEOS",
  "latent_6698": "Futurama is leaving Netflix slowly in 2017 and 2018 with seasons expiring on different dates. The reason as to why they’re leaving is because the series is owned by FOX who cut ties with Netflix in 2017 in favor of adding their titles to Hulu.\n\nThe animated sitcom series aired, given sporadically, between 1999 and 2013 and saw 140 episodes across 7 full seasons and many specials. It won countless awards and has been widely considered one of the smartest shows on television. It comes from the mind of Matt Groening who is most known for his other creation, The Simpsons. The Simpsons aren’t currently on Netflix as we explain here.\n\nAlthough we don’t know the specifics, we do know that Netflix and FOX entered into negotiations but both came away unable to make a new agreement for FOX shows. FX shows are also included.\n\nWe’ve already seen the majority of Futurama seasons leave Netflix in July and the remaining will be pulled over the next 6 months. Seasons 1 to 6 was removed on July 1st, 2017 and was the first of the FOX titles to be removed.\n\nHere’s when the remaining seasons are scheduled to leave Netflix:\n\nSeason 7 is scheduled to leave on February 19th, 2018\n\nSeason 8 is scheduled to leave on February 18th, 2018\n\nSeason 9 is scheduled to leave on February 9th, 2018\n\nSeason 10 is scheduled to leave on December 10th, 2018\n\nAs we stated above, the only place you’ll soon be able to stream these titles is on Hulu which makes sense for the series given that FOX owns part of Hulu. It’s ultimately a shame that Netflix is losing these titles but have made significant stride at creating its own animated sitcoms including Bojack Horseman, F is for Family and Pacific Heat.\n\nFor a full list of FOX titles leaving Netflix and their removal dates check out our FOX guide. This includes other Fox animated titles such as Family Guy, The Cleveland Show, Bob’s Burgers and American Dad! are all subject to removal.\n\nAre you disappointed that Netflix isn’t keeping Futurama?

Mandatory Credit: Stan Szeto-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Stan Szeto-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIt wasn’t just another road win the CSU men’s basketball team picked up Wednesday night at San Jose State.\n\nThe 76-71 victory was the 499th career victory for fifth-year coach Larry Eustachy, who hopes to pick up his 500th win at home Saturday against Air Force and dedicate the game ball to senior forward Emmanuel Omogbo.\n\nOmogbo, who scored 13 points and pulled down 11 rebounds for his seventh double-double of the season, lost both of his parents and his sister’s twins in a fire at the family’s home in suburban Washington, D.C., last Jan. 19. Omogbo stayed with his team through a road game the following day at Air Force before returning home.\n\nHe’s playing this season, he said, in honor of his parents.\n\n“No game since I’ve been here have we shown more heart than this group of guys tonight,” Eustachy said afterward. “And we had a goal; we wanted to win this game.\n\n“I’m not into 500 wins, but I want to win that game (Saturday). It’s Air Force. We talked about it with the team; it’s the anniversary of when Emmanuel, basically his innocence was taken from him.\n\n“We have to win Saturday, and I want to give him that ball for 500 wins, and that’s was the plan going into this game; We had to win this one so we can do that for him, the dedication, and I thought the team played for that.”\n\nSophomore guards Prentiss Nixon and J.D. Paige led the Rams (10-6, 2-1 Mountain West) with 18 points apiece, and senior guard Gian Clavell added 15.\n\nSophomore forward Branden Clarke scored 24 points and sophomore guard E.J. Boyce 12 for San Jose State (7-6, 0-2), which had won six of its previous eight games, including four straight on its home court.\n\nColorado State University, which had dropped its previous two road games by one point apiece on shots made in the final seconds, raced out to an early 13-0 lead in this one.\n\nSan Jose State answered with a 20-2 run for a 20-15 lead but couldn’t stay on top.\n\nThe Rams were up 34-31 by halftime and led by a half-dozen or so points for most of the second half.\n\nStill, the Spartans were able to close within three in the final minute and had a chance to tie in the final seconds, but Ryan Welage’s 3-pointer with seven seconds left missed its mark. Omogbo grabbed the rebound, was fouled, and hit two free throws with 3.5 seconds remaining to seal the victory.\n\nEustachy’s record at CSU 97-54, and his career record is 499-312.\n\nCSU, which needed overtime to win last season at San Jose State, improved to 14-0 all-time against the Spartans.\n\nCSU announced Tuesday night that juniors Che Bob, Devocio Butler and Kimani Jackson have all been ruled academically ineligible for the spring semester, which begins Jan. 17. All three saw limited action against the Spartans, with Butler scoring four points in nine minutes and Bob and Jackson both scoreless in five minutes apiece.\n\nWithout them, the Rams will be down to just seven players for the final 13 games of the regular season and the Mountain West tournament.\n\n“How resilient is this group of guys?” Eustachy said. “What’s recently been announced, we’ve been playing with for a month.\n\n“… We can rally around this group and who knows what can happen?”\n\nFollow reporter Kelly Lyell at twitter.com/KellyLyell and facebook.com/KellyLyell.news\n\nNext up\n\nAir Force at CSU, noon Saturday, Moby Arena\n\nWatch/listen: Root/KARS (FM 102.9) and KDCO (AM 1340 and FM 104.7)\n\nTwitter updates: @KellyLyell, @MattStephens\n\nCSU 76, SAN JOSE STATE 71\n\nAt The Event Center, San Jose, California\n\nColorado State 34-42—76\n\nSan Jose State 31-40—71\n\nColorado State (10-6, 2-1 MW) – Paige 7-9 2-2 18, Nixon 5-10 8-8 18, Clavell 6-12 1-2 15, Omogbo 5-13 3-4 13, Butler 2-2 0-0 4, Koelliker 1-6\n\n2-3 4, Carvacho 1-2 0-2 2, Bonner 0-1 2-2 2, Bob 0-0 0-0 0, Jackson 0-3 0-1 0.

  "latent_6973": "The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, said on Thursday that the poor performance of the British economy had left her with no alternative but to call on George Osborne to rethink his austerity strategy.\n\nIncreasing the pressure on the chancellor to change course, Lagarde – who has previously given consistent and public support to the UK's deficit reduction strategy – said the fund had changed its stance as a result of weak economic figures.\n\nShe also signalled that an IMF team would conduct a thorough investigation into the health of the UK when it arrives in London to carry out its annual review under the Washington organisation's article IV programme. Lagarde said she \"vividly remembered\" the chancellor coming to a meeting of European finance ministers and confessing that he was not proud of \"carrying the biggest deficit in the room\".\n\nThe IMF had supported the government's attempt to tackle Britain's record peacetime budget deficit, but the backing had never been unconditional, Lagarde insisted. Despite suggestions from the Treasury that there was a split at the fund between pro- and anti-austerity factions, she gave full support to her chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, who warned Osborne this week that he would be \"playing with fire\" if he continued on his present course.\n\nLagarde said: \"We have said that should growth abate, should growth be particularly low, then there should be consideration to adjusting by way of slowing the pace. This is nothing new. And this is still the position and one that has been very clearly articulated within the various departments.\n\n\"So we very much stand by that. Consideration should be given if growth weakens, and looking at the numbers, without having dwelled and looked under the skin of the British economy, as we will do in a few weeks' time under the article IV, the growth numbers are certainly not particularly good.\"\n\nBy the time IMF officials arrive in Britain next month, the Office for National Statistics will have released growth figures for the first quarter of 2013. These will show whether the UK has slipped into an unprecedented triple-dip recession.\n\nThe consensus among City economists is that the UK will next week narrowly avoid a third leg to the recession that began in 2008, but figures this week showing rising unemployment and lower high street spending have underlined the fragility of the economy.\n\nBritain's growth performance has consistently undershot both government and IMF forecasts. This week, the fund's half-yearly World Economic Outlook cut its prediction for UK growth to 0.7% in 2013 and 1.5% in 2014 – a 0.3 percentage point reduction in both years. Osborne said in the budget last month that he expected growth of 0.6% this year, rising to 1.8% in 2014. Output is still around 3% lower than it was when the recession began in the first quarter of 2008.\n\n\"What has changed is clearly the quality of the numbers. But I would not, and I don't think anybody in this institution would want to prejudge ahead of the article IV, because that is when we spend three, four weeks discussing, debating, exploring, understanding, trying to go really under the skin of the economy, and we will do that,\" Lagarde said.\n\nOsborne, who has already eased the pace of deficit reduction, is certain to resist any pressure from the IMF for a politically damaging U-turn.\n\nLagarde said the past year had seen the emergence of a three-speed global economy – those countries doing well, those on the mend and those that still had quite a distance to travel.\n\n\"Now, with strong interconnections, and uneven recovery, that three-speed recovery is not enough and what we need is a full-speed global economy.\" Lagarde said growth needed to be \"solid, sustainable, balanced but also inclusive and very much rooted in green developments.\"\n\nThe IMF managing director said central banks were travelling in \"uncharted territories\" and would be more comfortable if they could return monetary policy to more normal settings.\n\nUnconventional policies were required, Lagarde added, because interest rates were already low and there was \"not much else at the moment to try to kickstart growth in economies, to lower long-term interest rates, and to actually provide that breathing space which the authorities have to use to actually deliver on their fiscal policies as well as their structural reforms\".\n\nLagarde was also forced to answer questions about her own future. Next month she will appear before a French magistrate investigating an arbitration payment made to a former supporter of ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy when she was finance minister in Paris.\n\nLagarde said there was \"nothing new under the sun\" and she was ready to be heard in the case, involving businessman Bernard Tapie.\n\n\"A date has been set. It will be at the end of May and I'll be very happy to travel for a couple of days to Paris, but it's not going to change my focus, my attention and my enthusiasm for doing the work that I do,\" she said at a news conference in Washington.\n\nThe Treasury was not commenting on Thursday night but is understood to believe the IMF stance, far from being critical, is consistent with its previous support for deficit reduction.\n\nOsborne's deficit strategy leaves him vulnerable\n\nNot since the dark days of 1976 has the arrival in London of the International Monetary Fund been so eagerly awaited. As Christine Lagarde made clear, her officials will pull no punches when they conduct next month's annual health check of the UK.\n\nThere are, of course, key differences between 2013 and 1976. For a start, the IMF will not be telling the government to adopt austerity but rather to ease up on the pace of deficit reduction.\n\nSecondly, Britain is not going cap in hand to the IMF for a loan. That means, finally, that George Osborne can politely tell Lagarde to take a running jump, which is what he almost certainly will do.\n\nThat said, a duffing up by the IMF would still damage Osborne, who has relied on Lagarde to give him cover for his deficit-reduction strategy. The IMF wants countries to reduce their debt levels but believes spending cuts and tax rises cuts in spending and increases in taxes are more than usually potent when interest rates are low, banks weak and many countries are seeking to push through austerity programmes at the same time. Britain provides a textbook example of what happens: growth weakens and deficit reduction falters. Larry Elliott",
  "latent_7014": "CHICAGO -- Chris Osgood had waited nearly 10 months for a win, so waiting an extra 20 minutes for Saturday’s game to start, following the Chicago Blackhawks’ Stanley Cup banner-raising ceremony, was no sweat for the Detroit Red Wings goaltender.\n\n“We just took our (equipment) off and relaxed (in the locker room), watched a little baseball,’’ Osgood said. “We’re one of the oldest teams in the league, we don’t get excited about too much.’’\n\nAfter all the pomp and circumstance, the Red Wings, behind 26 saves from Osgood and two goals from Valtteri Filppula, spoiled Chicago’s party, edging the Blackhawks 3-2 at the United Center.\n\nThe Red Wings are 2-0, after starting last season 0-2, when they dropped a pair of games to the St. Louis Blues in Sweden.\n\n“It’s an emotional night for them, raising the banner, and the Cup was in the building, so we wanted to play real well on the road,’’ Detroit captain Nicklas Lidstrom said. “I thought we had our legs going real well, controlling the play and having the puck a lot in their zone.’’\n\nIt was Osgood’s 397th career win, his first since Dec. 12 of last season (3-2 at Nashville in overtime). He started only four more games the rest of the season, losing all four, as Jimmy Howard established himself as the go-to guy.\n\n\"It feels good,’’ Osgood said. “It was a horrible second half last year. (But) every year is separate. I was really looking forward to coming back this year.\n\n“It’s important to get off to a good start. I got play well, I got to earn my starts, I got to push. That’s essentially what my job is.’’\n\nCoach Mike Babcock said it was great that Osgood would be leaving the building feeling good about himself. His teammates also felt good for him.\n\n“I was jacked for him,’’ Todd Bertuzzi said. “If anyone deserves a win it was him. He’s been working hard and looking really good. He was absolutely sharp tonight, especially on the PK. The PK did a really good job, but I think he was the catalyst behind it.’’\n\nHe got all the offensive support he needed from the second line of Filppula, Bertuzzi and Johan Franzen. The unit that was under fire from Babcock for much of the preseason for failing to “engage’’ has started strong.\n\nBertuzzi also scored for the Red Wings and Franzen had an assist.\n\n“I thought Mule, Bert and Fil were fantastic tonight,’’ Babcock said. “They were strong, they skated good.’’\n\nFilppula snapped a 2-2 tie with his second goal of the game, on the power play, at 6:01 of the third period. Streaking down the left wing, he took a pass from Jiri Hudler and slipped by defenseman John Scott, who stumbled. Filppula then got a break, as the puck slid off his stick and past Blackhawks goalie Marty Turco.\n\n“The ice was a bit soft there, I think (Scott) just hit a rut and fell down,’’ Filppula said. “It was a good pass. I had a lot of speed there.\n\n“I was trying to move it to my forehand and I just totally lost it. It went five-hole. Definitely a lot of luck.’’\n\nThe Red Wings needed to kill three penalties following the tie-breaking goal to preserve the win.\n\n“Our special teams won the game,’’ Osgood said. “Our penalty-kill was real good in the third period. We were getting in lanes, blocking a lot of their cross-ice passes.’’\n\nThe Red Wings dominated Turco when he played for the Dallas Stars. He signed with the Blackhawks in the off-season after the Stars opted not to bring him back. He still is having trouble beating Detroit, against whom is he 6-13-5 lifetime.\n\nThe Blackhawks have a different look at the bottom end of their roster after they forced to shed salary in the offseason to get under the cap. They lost a lot of their big, gritty third-and fourth-line forwards, but maintain a strong nucleus of stars up front and on defense.\n\nBertuzzi put the Red Wings ahead 2-1 at 1:15 of the second period, corralling a rebound off the back boards and quickly slipping it past Turco from the side of the net.\n\nThe Blackhawks tied it just 34 seconds later when Bryan Bickell’s shot from the slot deflected off Detroit defenseman Ruslan Salei and past Osgood.\n\nThe Red Wings ended the first period in frustrating fashion, as Brent Seabrook scored a power-play goal with one-half second remaining to tie it at 1-1.\n\nSeabrook was wide open in front of the net when he took a pass from Marian Hossa and roofed a shot over Osgood.\n\nThe Red Wings started strong, outshooting the Blackhawks 7-1 at one point. The opened the scoring at 12:59 when Franzen, from the high slot, made a nice pass to Filppula, who was parked at the side of the net and redirected the puck past Turco.\n\n“I thought we started the game good,’’ Babcock said. “We didn’t have much energy, it was pretty apparent. (Playing) back-to-back, we knew coming in this was going to be a tough game just because of the energy level. I thought our guys competed in the third period. With the three penalties we took we made it real hard on ourselves.’’",

Of the 28 who died, 18 were either passengers in the suspect vehicle or other road users.\n\nDoes the rise simply reflect an upsurge in criminal activity? Is it because suspects have become increasingly reckless? Or have police standards on the roads slipped?\n\nThe IPCC and the National Police Chiefs' Council will have to get to the bottom of it quickly.\n\nDame Anne said the six fatal shootings had occurred across six forces and that the shooting of Khalid Masood was the only one related to terrorism.\n\nThe watchdog said the investigation into that case and two others had been completed and all three had found no evidence of any misconduct by firearms officers.\n\nIn addition, another inquiry, which is still ongoing, is also yet to find any evidence of wrongdoing by police.\n\nInvestigations into two other shootings are still to conclude.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The IPCC chair says the watchdog wants to talk to the police about whether changes in training are needed\n\nThe IPPC data also showed there were 14 deaths in police custody - the second lowest figure it has recorded.\n\nEight of the 14 people who died were reported to have mental health problems.\n\nDame Anne said that many of those who died in custody, or shortly after their release, were \"vulnerable\" but that police needed support to help individuals.\n\nDeborah Coles, director of Inquest, the charity concerned with deaths in custody, said the figures were a \"depressing picture\" of the treatment of detained people.\n\nShe said: \"While the police cannot and should not be the default service responsible for those with mental and physical health concerns, where they are called to act they must do so with care and dignity.\"\n\nA recent independent report, also using IPCC data, said there were 400 \"apparent suicides\" of people who had been detained at police stations during the seven years to March 2016.\n\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission, which produced the report, blamed many of these suicides on \"serious gaps\" in the care of detained people.",

In 2013, NASA started looking into ways to use 3D printers for manufacturing items in space like tools and repair parts, and even experimenting with moon rocks as a material.\n\nNow, Northwestern University has demonstrated that extraterrestrial materials are suitable for tool making and much more. A team of researchers was able to print structural objects like tools and building blocks using synthetic lunar and Martian dust. They did this by using a special 3D printing technique developed by engineer Ramille Shah, called 3D painting which uses ink-like materials in the additive manufacturing process.\n\n“For places like other planets and moons, where resources are limited, people would need to use what is available on that planet in order to live,” said Shah , assistant professor of materials science and engineering at Northwestern’s McCormick School of Engineering and of surgery in the Feinberg School of Medicine. “Our 3D paints really open up the ability to print different functional or structural objects to make habitats beyond Earth.”\n\nThe dusts are NASA-approved simulants of lunar and Martian dust that are similar to the real thing in composition and particle shape and size. The team used the dusts to make the 3D paints by combining them with some simple solvents and polymers. The resulting ink is still 90 percent dust by weight and can be extruded by a 3D printer.\n\nThe printed material, unlike moon or Martian rock, is flexible, elastic and tough – making it an even more durable material. The material can be bent, rolled and cut if needed. The team is now working on firing objects printed with this material in a furnace, which transforms them into hard, ceramic-like pieces.",

On the other hand, a Pew Research study in 2014 found that people who are lower-income, black or Hispanic, immigrants, or under 50 are more likely to regularly ride transit.\n\nDevelopments like Othello Plaza help walk that difficult balance: How do we make sure that transit serves people who need it without driving them out?\n\n“Mercy Othello Plaza shows how we can leverage the opportunity of affordable, high-capacity transit by building affordable housing near Link light rail stations,” said King County Executive Dow Constantine at Othello Plaza’s dedication.\n\nSound Transit 3, approved by voters in November, created the Regional Equitable Development Initiative (REDI), which commits $21 million to low-interest loans for affordable developments sited within one-half mile of a light rail station or one-quarter mile of a frequent-service bus stop.\n\nThe first round of REDI financing is expected to build 500 to 700 affordable units—not even half of the 2,100 lottery entries for a spot at Othello Plaza. Still, it’s a dent.\n\nREDI isn’t the only way Sound Transit is building affordable housing; Othello Plaza is the third TOD on land acquired by Sound Transit for affordable housing. Their first is a development for seniors near the Federal Way Transit Center in 2010; the second, Artspace’s Mt. Baker Lofts near the Mt.

  "latent_7310": "Click here to view the complete list of archived articles\n\nThis article was originally published in the Fall 2009 issue of Methods & Tools\n\nThe Spring Framework\n\nNico Mommaerts, Pieter Degreauwe\n\nIntroduction\n\nBefore the Spring revolution, enterprise applications were generally written using the J2EE standards (specified by a group of vendors via the JCP process). The premise of J2EE was multiplatform/multivendor, if you would code against the J2EE standards you could deploy your application on any J2EE application server, on any platform. In theory at least. Running your application on an application server has several benefits, the application server offers you services, such as transaction management, messaging, mailing, a directory interface etc. Any J2EE compliant code can make use of these services, as long as the code is written against the interfaces defined in the J2EE specifications.\n\nUnfortunately, there were a few problems with these standards. First of all, the usage of these standards was too complex. Writing a component (EJB: Enterprise Java Bean) required you to write a set of xml files (deployment descriptors), home interfaces, remote/local interfaces, etc. Even worse, 50% of the deployment descriptors were vendor specific, so 'transparently migrating an application from vendor A to B' was suddenly not so transparent anymore...\n\nSecondly, there was the 'look-up' problem. When a component requires another component, the components itself was responsible for looking up the components it depends upon. Unfortunately, this look-up happens by name, so the name of the dependency was hardcoded in your component (code or deployment descriptor). On top of that, letting components communicate with each other from J2EE application servers of different vendors was almost always problematic.\n\nLast but not least, in a lot of cases, some components did not need all the services the application server provided, but since there was no other API to build components, all your components became heavy weight, bloating your application.\n\nWith 'heavy weight' components we mean that they supported all features (clustering, remoting, etc.) even when we didn't need them. You could say 'but we get it for free, what's the problem?' The problem with this is that 'get it for free' means we do not need to write this functionality, but we need to configure them. And this is why most developers longed for writing plain old Java objects, without the need to write ton's of xml configuration for stuff they didn't need...\n\nThe POJO Revolution\n\nAs said before, one of the goals of these J2EE standards was to give the developer some services for free so he could focus on writing the business logic. This is still a very interesting goal, but it turned out that the programming model was not so flexible as one would like. Coding against the J2EE standards was very cumbersome, you needed to comply to several seemingly arbitrary rules, and it forced you to write code that was not so Object Oriented as one would want to. If you wanted to take advantage of the J2EE services you had to implement your classes in a very specific way, which coupled your business logic to the J2EE classes. It made your code less extensible, and not very test friendly. Since your code used specific J2EE classes and interfaces, you couldn't run that code in a unit test, since it presumes all kinds of services present, normally provided by the J2EE application server. This is what we mean with code that is not testable outside of the container (the application server is the container). Deploying a J2EE application in a container and starting it up can be a very time-consuming task, so not very ideal if you want to run your unit tests regularly.\n\nMore and more developers wanted to write just Plain Old Java Objects (we'll call them POJO's from now on), without the J2EE standards overhead. And to be honest, they were right. Writing business logic in POJO's is way easier. You don't have to implement any interfaces or extend from other classes, you are free to cleanly implement and design your domain with regular Java classes and you don't have to jump through hoops to test your code. The only problem with POJO's is that with J2EE (as it existed then) you cannot benefit from the services provided by the container, such as transaction management, remoting, etc.\n\nThis is where the Spring Framework comes in. This framework brings a lightweight container. This is a container where your POJO's live in. The difference with a heavyweight container is that the components now are as light as possible. You don't have to support services you don't need, this also means no unneeded configuration. You don't have to adhere to some programming model, you can just use POJO's and declaratively specify what services you want to use.\n\nDue to the openness of this container and the use of AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming), it is possible to enhance POJO's in such a way that it doesn't affect the code of your POJO. So, your POJO stays as clean as possible and you can add features as you need them.\n\nThe Spring framework, what is it?\n\nIt is not a web framework, or a persistence framework, it's a framework that integrates all kinds of Java technologies/API's en makes it possible to use them with simple POJO's.\n\nWhat is important to know is that Spring does not reinvent the wheel. It provides a nice and elegant way to use existing technologies (such as EJB, Hibernate, JDO, Toplink, JMS, etc). This is accomplished by several support classes and 'templates'.\n\nWhy and how is Spring more elegant? Let's look at an example.\n\nWe want to query the number of users that are older than a specified age. Using the conventional methods using the standard JDBC API, we would write something like this:\n\n... Connection conn = ..; PreparedStatement stm; ResultSet resultSet; try { stm = conn.prepareStatement(\"select count(0) from user u where u.age > ?\"); stm.setInt(1,age); resultSet = stm.executeQuery(); resultSet.next(); return resultSet.getIn(1); } finally { resultSet.close(); stm.close(); conn.close(); }\n\nThis is already simplified code, since you actually should check for NullPointerExceptions in the finally clause and you should catch SQLExceptions.\n\nHowever, you can see that this is a very verbose way of writing code. Making use of Spring's JdbcTemplate gives more elegant code:\n\nSimpleJdbcTemplate template = new SimpleJdbcTemplate(datasource); //this jdbcTemplate supports varArgs. int userCount = template.queryForInt(\"select count(0) from user u where u.age > ?\",age);\n\nOf course this is a very simple example, but it should give you an idea how it makes coding Java applications much easier by removing boilerplate code from your application code.\n\nThis example illustrates the JdbcTemplate, however, Spring provides lots of templates: TransactionTemplate, HibernateTemplate, ToplinkTemplate, JDOTemplate, JMSTemplate, etc.\n\nFor each supported technology there is a module which consists of helper classes to help you implement a certain layer or aspect of your application. The core of Spring, upon which all other modules depend, is the Inversion of Control and Aspect-Oriented programming module.\n\nIt is these two programming models which are the driving force behind Spring. They act like glue, pulling your application together, but in a not-invasive way. Meaning the code you write doesn't need to have Spring references all over the place. In places where you need to use specific frameworks or standards (Hibernate, JMS, etc) Spring lets you integrate easily using these techniques.\n\nWhat is Inversion of Control?\n\nWhen developing an application, you always have dependencies between and on components, services, classes etc. Without Inversion of Control you would 'wire' these together on the spot where you would need the dependency. The disadvantage of this is that when you would like to use a different implementation of your dependency, you are forced to change your code. This may not seem that big a disadvantage, but what if you want to change your implementation in context of the environment you are running your code in? For example you might want to use a different authentication service during development as in production. It is not really convenient to change your code every time you need to make a production artifact, or each time you want to run your unit-tests. That's why the wiring of these dependencies is taken out of the code, and an external party manages the wiring, namely the container. Hence the name inversion of control, you let something from the outside control how your dependencies are wired together. We speak of dependency injection because the container 'injects' the necessary dependencies instead of letting the developer manage them.\n\nFor example, we have a class PrinterService, which is responsible for sending some document to a Printer. We can have different Printer implementations, laser, inkjet etc.\n\nclass PrinterService { private Printer printer = new InkjetPrinter(); public PrinterService() { } public void printDocument(Document doc) { printer.print(doc); } }\n\nThis way, everybody who uses the PrinterService has no choice but to use the InkjetPrinter. Not really what we want, we want to be able to use other printers. If we write a unit test for the PrinterService, we don't want the implementation of the Printer tested, and we certainly don't want a page coming from our printer every time we run the unit test! So we want to be able to change the implementation of the Printer used in the PrinterService.\n\nLet's try the following:\n\nclass PrinterService { private Printer printer; public PrinterService() { } public void setPrinter(Printer printer) { this.printer = printer; } public void printDocument(Document doc) { printer.print(doc); } }\n\nNow if someone wants to use the PrinterService he can do something like this:\n\nPrinterService printerService = new PrinterService(); printerService.setPrinter(new LaserPrinter()); printerService.printDocument(someDocument);\n\nAs you can see the usage of the PrinterService isn't limited anymore to the InkjetPrinter we defined in the first example. However, we still have to wire the Printer implementation to the PrinterService ourselves. If we want to run this code in a different context, with a different printer implementation, one for testing purposes for example, we still have to branch somewhere in our code to make a distinction between the different contexts/implementations.\n\nNow this is where Spring as a container comes into the picture. We want to let Spring handle the wiring of the dependencies of our PrinterService. To do this we let the PrinterService and the Printer 'live' inside the Spring container, as such they are called beans. We give each bean a unique name, an id, so we can reference them later on. We can declare this in a Spring xml configuration file (xml schema declaration omitted for brevity):\n\n<beans> <bean id=\"laserPrinter\"class=\"com.methodsandtools.LaserPrinter\"/> <bean id=\"inkjetPrinter\"class=\"com.methodsandtools.InkjetPrinter\"/> <bean id=\"printerService\"class=\"com.methodsandtools.PrinterService\"> <property name=\"printer\" ref=\"laserPrinter\"/> </bean> </beans>\n\nIn this example we defined two Printer beans, 'laserPrinter' and 'inkjetPrinter'. We used the property 'printer' on the 'printerService' to wire the 'laserPrinter' to the 'printerService' bean. What actually happens is that the 'setPrinter' method on the 'printerService' bean is called with the 'laserPrinter' bean as argument. These beans and their lifecycle are now managed by the Spring container, we could configure if we want a new instance of the laserPrinter bean be created every time we inject it somewhere, or if we only want one instance of the laserPrinter bean to live in the container and that one be used all the time. Managing this lifecycle is beyond the scope of this article, but is nevertheless a very interesting and necessary capability of the Spring container. Now, if we want to use the PrinterService, we have to ask the Spring container the bean we declared in the configuration file. The Spring container is accessed through a bean factory:\n\nXmlBeanFactory beanFactory = new XmlBeanFactory(new ClassPathResource(\"configuration.xml\", getClass())); PrinterService printerService = (PrinterService) beanFactory .getBean(\"printerService\");\n\nWe now have a PrinterService instance which we can use without worrying what Printer implementation is wired to it. In a different context we can use a different configuration file, no code needs to be changed in order to use a different Printer implementation. You can also split the declaration of the beans over multiple xml files, so you can pick and mix to your needs.\n\nNote that the above code doesn't need to run in a J2EE container, meaning you don't need to start an application server and deploy it, it can be run as a regular Java program.\n\nAlthough we declared the bean factory ourselves in this example, usually in a J2EE application there will be a bean factory associated with a context defined by the J2EE server and you won't see any Spring code in the business logic. So you are not tied to using an API or implement some interfaces as with standard J2EE to use the Inversion of Control container.\n\nOnce you start working this way, you'll soon start thinking in terms of declaring beans and wiring them together. There are more possibilities as demonstrated, like using inheritance between beans, controlling the lifecycle, autowiring dependencies based upon type, etc, but the above example should give you a basic understanding of the power of Dependency Injection in Spring.\n\nWhat is Aspect-Oriented programming?\n\nIn most applications there are concerns that 'cut' across different abstraction layers, the typical example is logging. You might want to log in every method of your service layer that you are entering and exiting that specific method. This litters log statements all over your service layer, while logging is actually one concern and as such should be separated from the business logic into a different entity. This is what Aspect-Oriented Programming frameworks (we'll cal it AOP from now) aim to do. In AOP terminology a concern is written as an advice, which is an entity like a class. Then this advice can be applied to certain pointcuts in your code. A pointcut is a place or several places in your code where you want the crosscutting concern, the advice, to be applied. For example when entering or exiting a certain method. An advice together with a pointcut is called an aspect, hence the name Aspect-Oriented Programming. There are many AOP frameworks out there, Spring uses its own based upon dynamic proxies and/or CGLIB byte code generation, but can integrate with others like AspectJ if desired.\n\nA simple example of an advice, straight from the Spring javadocs:\n\nclass TracingInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor { Object invoke(MethodInvocation i) throws Throwable { System.out.println(\"method \" + i.getMethod() + \" is called on \" + i.getThis() + \" with args \" +i.getArguments()); Object ret = i.proceed(); System.out.println(\"method \" + i.getMethod() + \" returns\" + ret); return ret; } }\n\nThe above advice is invoked when a method is intercepted, which methods will be intercepted is defined in the pointcut, more on this later. The 'invoke' method receives a MethodInvocation instance which contains all the needed information about the method being intercepted. This can be seen in the System.out statement where we print all this information. The next line is also very interesting, we tell the method being intercepted to proceed, so this means that if we would like to, we could prevent the invocation of the intercepted method!\n\nNow that we have defined what to do with the intercepted method, we have to define which methods will be intercepted. These two concepts are separated, which is a powerful principle. Saying which methods to advice is done in a pointcut, which is also an interface to be implemented, the Pointcut interface, which looks like this:\n\npublic interface Pointcut { ClassFilter getClassFilter(); MethodMatcher getMethodMatcher(); }\n\nFor the most common cases there are a lot of standard implementations of this interface in the Spring framework.\n\nOne of the most (in)famous of the J2EE standards is the EJB standard, Enterprise Java Beans. Among other things, it provides declarative transaction management for your database access code. Managing your transactions in your database access code is something you have to do each time you make a call to the database, so being able to do this declaratively in an xml file was a real advantage. However, to benefit from this you had to code against an API, which sometimes meant having up to 7 files for one EJB, having to implement arbitrary methods, and your EJB would only work if deployed in a J2EE application server. This is just one example of the services that J2EE provides, but is a real pain to use because of the API you have to program against. What Spring aims to do is to give you the same services as provided by J2EE, e.g. transaction management, but in such a way that you can still code using POJO's. Spring accomplishes this by using AOP.\n\nTestability\n\nAs said before, writing tests for EJB's were quite problematic, since your components (EJB's) had to run in a running container.\n\nWriting your components in the POJO model solves this completely. But that is not all, Spring brings some nice features for writing integration tests. Especially useful are the transactional tests, which you can configure to rollback all inserted data, so your test database stays clean and won't interfere with other tests or the same test if it should fail. You are not required to manually clean up your test data after each test.\n\nLet's look at an example:\n\n@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @ContextConfiguration(locations = { \"/applicationContext.xml\",\"/database-test.xml\" }) @Transactional public class FictitiousTransactionalTest { @Autowired //inject by type private PetClinicService petClinicService; @Resource(name=\"hibernateTemplate\") //inject by name private HibernateTemplate hibernateTemplate; @Before public void setUpTestDataWithinTransaction() { // set up test data within the transaction } @Test public void modifyDatabaseWithinTransaction() { // logic which uses the test data and modifies database state hibernateTemplate.save(VetTestObjectMother.createDummyVet()); hibernateTemplate.save(VetTestObjectMother.createDummyVet()); assertEquals(2, petClinicService.countVet()); } @Test @NotTransactional public void performNonDatabaseRelatedAction() { // logic which does not modify database state } }\n\nFirst of all, we can define the Spring context files (the files where we wire all POJO's together), that should be loaded by the integration test. (@ContextConfiguration)\n\nSecondly, we can inject some components into our test, so, we can start testing them. (@Resource and @Autowired)\n\nFor integration tests, it is especially useful that we can perform our tests in one transaction, and rollback that transaction after the test has run. (@Transactional, @NotTransactional, @BeforeTransaction, @AfterTransaction, @TransactionConfiguration)\n\nConclusion: To Spring or not To Spring?\n\nAs you might have already understood, we really think that most applications (if not all) should use a lightweight Dependency Injection container.\n\nInversion of Control promotes loose coupling and testability of your code, the POJO programming model is how it should have always been. (IoC really enables testabillity of the code, the POJO programming model, etc). Spring is the most popular and widely accepted DI container there is for Java. It's entirely up to you how much you use it. You can choose to just use some of the supporting classes or templates, or you can go full out and make your entire application use Spring beans. Besides the core Spring functionality which we covered here, over the years a lot of extra modules appeared which do replace existing technologies. For example Spring Web Flow is a very nice framework built upon the Spring framework for building Web applications.\n\nWith Spring it's your choice which API's you use, and how you build your application.\n\nReference\n\nThe Spring Framework:\n\nhttp://www.springsource.org/about\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework\n\nhttp://www.theserverside.com/tt/articles/article.tss?l=SpringFramework\n\nSpring Web Flow:\n\nhttp://www.springsource.org/webflow\n\nhttp://www.ervacon.com/products/swf/intro/index.html\n\nJ2EE:\n\nhttp://www.j2ee.me/javaee/\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J2ee\n\nEJB:\n\nhttp://java.sun.com/products/ejb/docs.html\n\nAOP:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming\n\nhttp://onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2004/07/14/springaop.html\n\nIOC:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_Control\n\nhttp://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html\n\nDependency Injection:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection\n\nhttp://www.theserverside.com/tt/articles/article.tss?l=IOCBeginners\n\nRelated Articles\n\nRefactoring Java Code\n\nResponsibility Driven Design with Mock Objects\n\nRelated Resources\n\nJava TV\n\nJava Voices\n\nBack to the archive list",

  "latent_7507": "Pull-apart stuffing-flavored rolls are the best part of Thanksgiving mashed up with garlic knots.\n\nGet the Recipe Pull-Apart Stuffing Rolls\n\nIt's no question that stuffing is the best thing on the Thanksgiving table. It's also no question that these Easy Pull-Apart Pepperoni Garlic Knots are the most stupidly delicious easy recipe I've come up with so far this year.\n\nSo what happens when you take the idea of a pull-apart garlic knot and mix it up with the flavors of stuffing?\n\nA little bit of Thanksgiving magic. Tender, buttery, stuffing-flavor-packed magic. That's what.\n\nStep 1: Make the Flavor Base\n\nStart by melting butter in a heavy skillet. Got an aversion to butter? This is not the recipe for you.\n\nNext, add your sausage. If you're in a market that sells sage sausages (they come out around this time of year on the East Coast), go with that. Otherwise, bulk breakfast sausage is the way to go, though you can easily get away with diced bacon, salami, or even no meat at all if you'd prefer.\n\nI like to use the potato masher to break up my sausage. It makes short work of creating an even-textured crumble.\n\nThen add your basic aromatics. I use the same flavors that I do in my Classic Sage and Sausage Stuffing: celery, onions, and plenty of chopped sage and garlic.\n\nCook those down until the vegetables are softened but not browned, then finish with some fresh parsley. Remove the mixture and let it cool completely.\n\nStep 2: Prepare Your Dough\n\nThis recipe is based on my pepperoni garlic knot recipe, and if good knotted pizza dough worked there, why not here?\n\nI use a basic, lightly enriched dough, like my own New York–Style Pizza Dough, though store-bought pizza dough actually works quite well. (I tested this with dough from Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and Safeway.) While store-bought dough is generally under-seasoned and a little bland, in this case, the other flavorings are so damn strong that it really doesn't matter.\n\nAfter letting a pound of dough proof for the first time, divide it in half, then roll it out on a lightly floured surface into a roughly four-inch-wide strip.\n\nCut it into narrow strips with a bench scraper, then repeat with the other half of the dough.\n\nTie each strip into a simple knot.\n\nI tried incorporating the other ingredients directly into the dough, but it disrupts the dough's gluten network too much, causing it to collapse. Your rolls will end up dense and gummy that way. The knotting method creates plenty of nooks and crannies for the flavorings to fall into and cling to, while maintaining a nice, light texture.\n\nStep 3: Toss and Proof\n\nTransfer the knots to a large bowl, and add your cooled flavor base. Using your whole hand, toss and flip the knots until they're evenly coated on all surfaces. You want to be gentle here, letting the knots cascade over your palms so that you don't end up sticking them together.\n\nNext, butter up a 9- by 13-inch baking dish (I told you we're not butter-shy here, right?) to help the bottoms and sides brown.\n\nLay the knots inside the dish, keeping them evenly spaced. It's okay if they don't sit against each other snugly right now; that'll come with time.\n\nCover up the dish tightly with plastic wrap, then set it aside and let the rolls rest until they've roughly doubled in volume. At room temperature, this should take three to four hours. In the fridge, it should take about 12 to 16 hours, which makes this a great make-ahead option.\n\nAlternatively, you can freeze the casserole as is, with a layer of aluminum foil wrapped over it, for up to a week. Let it thaw completely in the fridge overnight, and allow it to rise at room temperature for an hour before baking.\n\nWhen the rolls are ready to bake, they should look something like this:\n\nStep 4: Grease and Bake\n\nWhat's that? Too much butter, you say? Well, okay then. This time, I'll drizzle them with a little olive oil and brush it on nicely before throwing them placing them gently, so as not to deflate them, into a hot, hot oven to bake.\n\nAfter 25 to 30 minutes, they should emerge, ready for one final brushing of butter to give them the glossy sheen of a Parker House roll.\n\nYou'll notice that the sausage and other flavorings on the top will have browned quite a bit, delivering some really intense, concentrated flavor when you bite in. On the other hand, the sausage on the bottom will remain nice and juicy, giving you that pleasantly meaty texture.\n\nSoft, tender, buttery, packed with real Thanksgiving-stuffing flavor, and oh-so-fun to pull apart, these rolls make the ideal vehicle for dipping into all that extra gravy you've made (you do make extra gravy, right?), perhaps with a little spoonful of cranberry sauce to tie it all together.\n\nIf you wanna get really creative, just split one open at the table and make yourself a little Thanksgiving sandwich on the spot. Your mouth, and whomever you pay handsomely to wash your silk napkins, will thank you.\n\nNext task: Use these pull-apart stuffing rolls to make stuffing.

Mr. Spieth has been a product endorser for Under Armour since early 2013.\n\nMr. Spieth set the 36-hole and 54-hole scoring marks at fabled Augusta National, and with a 69 or better on Sunday could surpass the 72-hole mark set by Tiger Woods when Mr. Woods won his first Masters in 1997 at the same tender age.\n\nAs comparisons between the golfers begin to evolve, one other comparison worthy of consideration is whether Mr. Spieth can have the same impact on Under Armour's golf division as Tiger did for Nike's.\n\nIn this article by my FORBES colleague from 2013, Mr. Spieth noted that he joined Under Armour because he felt the company's core characteristics (aggressive, slick, classic but athletic) aligned with his own.\n\nWhether Mr. Spieth wins his first major at the 2015 Masters will be answered in a few short hours, but a question which will take longer to assess is whether he'll create a long-term buzz around Under Armour golf as Tiger has for Nike.\n\nThis article takes a look back at Tiger's relationship with Nike, which started in 1996 when Nike signed the 19-year old Woods to a 5-year $40 million contract. As Woods began accumulating majors, his deal was extended in 2001 (5 years, $100 million), and then again in 2006 (7-year deal) and 2013. Of course, Nike was one of the few companies to stand by Mr. Woods during his highly publicized infidelity. Given what he has done for the Nike Golf brand over 20 years, you can see why they cut him some major slack.\n\nMr. Spieth will never have the social impact on the sport Mr. Woods did for a variety of reasons, but he may very well (along with young guns including Rory McIlroy and Rickie Fowler) help minimize the sport's loss in popularity which is bound to trigger once Mr. Woods and long-time rival Phil Mickelson eventually see the end of their competitive days.\n\nAnd I don't expect Under Armour golf will soon catch Nike golf in terms of market share. Nike's been a real player on that course for nearly 20 years because of Mr. Woods, with the hopes of continuing on into the future due to the likes of Rory McIlroy.\n\nBut if he wins the 2015 Masters, Mr. Spieth will help Under Armour further their share of the golf apparel market.\n\nAnd if he becomes one of golf's top stars, Under Armour will reap significant benefits.\n\n===========================\n\nDr. Rishe is the Founder and President of Sportsimpacts, and has been an Economics Professor at Webster University since 1999.

  "latent_7578": "Dear Dallas: No one ever proved West Nile disease exists!\n\nBy Jon Rappoport\n\nAugust 17, 2012\n\nwww.nomorefakenews.com\n\nNow that Dallas officials have decided West Nile Disease has killed 14 people in the area and infected 557 more, the aerial spraying of a pesticide called Duet will begin (has begun). The objective? Wipe out mosquitoes that carry the virus.\n\nBut here’s the bombshell: there is no evidence that the supposed virus causing West Nile exists. This means there is no proof West Nile disease exists.\n\nAnd this fact has been known for years. Scientists don’t like to talk about it. It’s extremely embarrassing.\n\nThe West Nile virus has never been isolated. “Isolated” means discovered. This is a simple notion. Just as you can ask whether an explorer on a ship, journeying to the tip of South America, ever arrived, you can ask whether researchers ever found the West Nile virus.\n\nThe answer is no.\n\nResearchers state the virus in question is 0.04 micrometers. At the same time, they admit that the original fishing expedition for the virus employed filters that were 0.22 micrometers. The obvious conclusion? You cannot assume that whatever was trapped in the filter was West Nile virus. The filter was too porous. It was nearly six times larger than the virus.\n\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=117258&page=4\n\nIn fact, Robert McLean, director of the National Wildlife Center of the US Geological Survey, told ABC’s Nick Regush, “We don’t have a purified form of the [West Nile] virus.”\n\nA stunning admission.\n\nThe late ABC reporter, Regush, one of the few bright and independent minds in mainstream medical reporting, followed up on McLean’s pronouncement with this: “I find no evidence anywhere in the scientific literature that the rules of virus purification and isolation were thoroughly followed [in the case of the West Nile virus].”\n\nThe bottom line? In your search for a new virus, if you don’t purify the material in which you suspect the virus is contained and filter out everything except the virus, and if you don’t finally isolate it, you cannot claim to have located it at all. This is not a mere academic distinction.\n\nTwo questions immediately pop up. How are people being diagnosed with West Nile if the virus has never been proved to exist; and what is making people sick if not West Nile?\n\nThe answer to the first question is: antibody tests. These extremely unreliable diagnostic tests are indirect. They supposedly show that elements of the patient’s immune system have encountered, in this case, the West Nile virus, in the patient’s body.\n\nBut antibody tests can and do register positive for irrelevant reasons. It’s called cross-reaction. The test is pinging positive because other germs or debris in the patient’s blood have caused the sensitive material in the test to respond.\n\nIt’s a notorious fact in the case of HIV, for example. In the early 1990s, independent journalist Christine Johnson published a report showing that the HIV test could read falsely positive for 60 reasons—none of them having anything to do with HIV. Other researchers followed suit.\n\nhttp://www.healtoronto.com/hivtest.html\n\nA patient “testing positive” for West Nile proves absolutely nothing.\n\nAs to the second question, there are some good reasons people in the Dallas area are getting sick. These reasons have nothing to do with “West Nile.”\n\nA decade ago, another independent journalist, Jim West, launched an original investigation into the so-called “West Nile epidemic” in New York City.\n\nWest Nile Virus: Horse Puckey?\n\nhttp://www.naturalhorse.com/archive/volume4/Issue6/article_8.php\n\nWest correlated clusters of human and bird “West Nile” cases with several factors; among them, nearby polluting oil refineries, other air pollution (certainly exacerbated by hot summer weather), and the presence of toxic MTBE, an additive that makes gasoline in cars burn cleaner.\n\nCitizens of Dallas should take a clue from Jim West’s work and examine their own environment for these factors.\n\nThere are listings for at least eight refineries in the Dallas area. There are also reports of increased air pollution coming from natural gas production in the Barnett Shale. The 2012 summer has been hot. As of of the year 2000, Texas refineries were producing 75% of all the MTBE in the United States.\n\nNow that 20 states have banned or reduced use of MTBE, the domestic market has declined. However, there are new horizons for the chemical: China wants it. The Huntsman Corporation, which owns one of the largest MTBE-producing plants in the US, in Texas, has signed a licensing and production agreement with the Chinese chemical company, Yantai Wanhua.\n\nhttp://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/huntsman-and-yantai-wanhua-polyurethanes-sign-pomtbe-license-agreement-122577543.html\n\nHow embarrassing would it be for Huntsman’s burgeoning business if, in its own Texas backyard, MTBE was found to be contributing to illness and death?\n\nMuch easier to blame it on a virus that has never been found. And much easier if other Texas sources of air pollution are also let off the hook.\n\nJon Rappoport\n\nThe author of an explosive collection, THE MATRIX REVEALED, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.

But he draws the line there, preferring instead to use technology. He said he has encouraged his officials to do the same with federal-provincial meetings.\n\n\"It's not our money,\" he said.\n\nEvery federal government, he said, approaches federal-provincial relations differently. Prime Minister Harper has decided not to hold first ministers' meetings; instead, he deals with the premiers on an individual basis.\n\nAnd for Mr. Wall, that's okay. The Harper brand of federalism is working for him.\n\n\"We have found it to be useful,\" he says, noting that he has never been denied access to the Prime Minister when he wants it.\n\nMr. Harper has had about 250 phone calls and meetings with provincial leaders since he took office in 2006, according to Finance Minister Jim Flaherty. The Prime Minister has not held a first ministers' meeting since 2009.\n\n\"I think Canadians like to see … more action than process,\" the Saskatchewan Premier said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOn Thursday, Alberta Premier Alison Redford and Quebec Premier Pauline Marois met for the first time, forging a deal to set up a working group to explore energy possibilities, such as bringing Alberta oil to Quebec refineries.\n\nMs. Marois was clear that the deal was strictly between her province and Alberta – it was not part of a national energy strategy.\n\n\"For me, it's between Alberta and Quebec,\" she said.\n\nThere has been some talk about a pipeline linking Alberta's oil sands to Quebec. But the two premiers would not go as far as talking about the pipeline, saying that economic, technical and environmental issues had to be evaluated first.\n\nIn addition, the two announced that Ms. Marois is planning a trip to Alberta, likely in the new year.\n\nThe Prime Minister, meanwhile, has been taking heat from the opposition parties for his refusal to sit down with the premiers on the economy. He defended his position in Question Period on Thursday, arguing that his \"philosophy is different\" from the opposition's when it comes to federal-provincial relations.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"We respect jurisdictions in Canada's constitution … we respect the jurisdiction of provinces … we act on our responsibilities,\" he said.\n\nLike Mr. Wall, the Prime Minister noted that Canadians wanted action, \"not more meetings.\"\n\nNew Brunswick's Premier, David Alward, said he appreciates the Prime Minister's individual approach but still believes in the importance of the premiers' gatherings and being able to discuss issues on a national level.\n\nAt the same time, he acknowledged that the premiers are increasingly taking the lead, rather than waiting for Ottawa. As an example, Mr. Alward mentioned that most premiers went on a recent trade mission to China.\n\nMr. Wall cites another example: Last year, after the Harper government presented the provinces with a take-it-or-leave-it health accord, he and Prince Edward Island Premier Robert Ghiz forged a new health-care plan, which they presented at the annual premiers' meeting last summer. It called for bulk purchasing of generic drugs, which should save provinces millions of dollars on prescription drugs.",

  "latent_8180": "When mainstream media paints a picture of black fatherhood, the image is usually marred by racialized prejudices and stereotypes about black manhood in general.\n\nCase in point: Remember the little boy who fell into the gorilla habitat at the Cincinnati Zoo, resulting in the death of the endangered silverback gorilla, Harambe? (Of course you do.)\n\nThe boy’s father was not even at the zoo with the mother, but that didn’t matter to the Daily Mail. First the site manages to bring his criminal record into play; then, buried in the story beneath the salacious headline, the reader finds out that he seems to have “turned his life around” and dotes on his four children.\n\nSo why bring it up at all?\n\nBlack dads are often portrayed as cold and uncaring deadbeats. Rarely are they portrayed as being involved. Rarely are they portrayed as loving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd young black men? The mainstream media will call them “thugs” before they call them good fathers.\n\nThis is a problem, because nothing could be further from the truth.\n\n“Television focuses so much more on [black] masculinity in terms of how they front themselves, more than what they do in terms of being a parent, companions, lovers, fathers. We don’t see the whole package; we see less than one-fourth,” Janice Kelly, with the Atlanta-based Fathers Incorporated, told The Root. “They’re changing diapers, they’re doing hair, they’re doing all of the things that are required … but when it comes to television, it becomes the one-dimensional character.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, black dads, even young black dads, are doing all of that and more. They want to be involved. But a lot of the time the conversation about dad involvement revolves around monetary support. And while child support is important, it’s not the be-all and end-all.\n\n“We see more conversation around the who guy doesn’t pay child support rather than the images of young guys that are stepping up and doing all they can do for their family,” Raheem Brooks, who works with young fathers between the ages of 18 and 24 at the CUNY Fatherhood Academy, said. “For years it’s been more based on money, and I guess that’s tradition … but there’s so much more—guys being more engaged, having conversations, laughing with their children—and that’s what we see when we have our family days.”\n\nThese are guys, he says, who are looking for the resources, looking for a way to take the initiative, regardless of the type of model for fatherhood that they have growing up, regardless of their relationship with their child’s mother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent years, the media space has gotten a bit better about its imagery. There was that adorable ad that showed hulking NFL players carefully grooming their little girls’ hair. NBA MVP Stephen Curry was beautifully featured in Parents magazine, with his wife, Ayesha, doting on and laughing with his two little girls.\n\nHowever, the biggest player responsible for shifting the narratives around young black fathers is social media.\n\nWhy? Because the news comes straight from the source itself: young black fathers boasting about their babies, posting videos of themselves playing with their babies, chronicling their lives with their babies in daily vlogs like the amazing ones done by La Guardia Cross.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe times are a-changing, and the truth is coming out.\n\n“Blogging, Twitter and everything else, there’s multiple voices out there that are not going to let themselves become silent to the media, and that’s very important,” Kelly said. “They need to tell their stories. What is written in journals or on television does not necessarily replicate what is being experienced in our society.”\n\n“[Young black fathers are] the biggest billboards and messages. The messaging is within them. To hear from them specifically is great. Education is not the only thing, but it does tend to be an equalizer,” Brooks said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd volume is also key. The more young black fathers step up on social media, unabashedly being their amazing, dadlike selves, the harder they are to ignore.\n\n“I think that is writing more books, I think that is producing more films, doing more research on our people … beginning to tell the stories that have never been told before about black men and black boys and black women and black families. I think we need to highlight each other more,” said Kenneth Braswell, founder and executive director of Fathers Incorporated, which does a lot of work around responsible fatherhood and black male achievement across the country. “These kinds of images that we’re seeing now on social media, with fathers being more open to sharing who they are, [are] just huge, a benefit to raising the level of compassion in our families around this country.”\n\nIndividualized platforms are powerful, especially when they show things that are different from what people normally read or hear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The end point of having those platforms around, I feel, continues to break those barriers down and get people to look at it differently. When we have the opportunity to have media come in the room and listen to some of the stories of young men … it’s always exciting for us because we tell our young men, ‘You all are myth busters … knocking those barriers down,’” said Sheldon Smith, the founder of the Dovetail Project, a Chicago-based organization that teaches young dads parenting skills and gives them other resources to better provide for their families.\n\n“Those stories are not being told, and that’s because there’s a part of the world that don’t want to hear stories like that,” Smith added. “They want to keep the negative parts going, so long as we have platforms like YouTube and Facebook and Instagram [that] show people the truth … that’s one thing you can’t battle against, the truth.”",
  "latent_8241": "Mass protests in Tunisia, January 2011.\n\nBy the Communist Workers' Party of Tunisia/Parti communiste des ouvriers de Tunisie (PCOT)\n\nحزب العمّال الشّيوعي التونسي\n\nTranslated by John Catalinotto for Tlaxcala\n\nTwo and a half months have passed since the glorious revolution of January 14. During this period, the people have made significant progress through their struggle and sacrifice.\n\nMarch 31, 2011 -- Having brought down the dictator and the two consecutive governments led by Mohammad al-Ghannouchi, the Tunisian people have managed to win their demands for a constituent assembly and for the dissolution of the formerly ruling RCD party and the political police. It also widened the space for freedom of expression, organisation, assembly and demonstration. Despite all these achievements, the revolution has gone only half-way, with great perils that grow every day lurking and threatening it.\n\nPower is not in the hands of the people who rose up against tyranny, exploitation and corruption; it is still held by reactionary forces. These forces are attempting, by using the provisional president and the interim transitional government, to seize control of the revolution to reduce it into a mere facelift of the old regime. [President] Mbazaâ and [Prime Minister] Beji Kaïd Sebssi have placed themselves outside any popular control; they refused to recognise \"the National Council for the Defense of the Revolution\", hoping to escape all control. As a counterweight they set up a consultative body, to which they have appointed members.\n\nAlthough Mbazaâ and Beji Kaïd Sebssi accepted the plan to elect a constituent assembly, they also set an election date without taking into account the interests of the people.\n\nOn the other hand, the formerly ruling RCD’s dissolution failed to prevent its return to the political scene in the cover of new parties. Also, organisations related to it still exist (such as the National Union of Tunisian Women and others). It turned out that the dissolution of the political police is little more than a formality. It still exists, practices repression, torture, surveillance and wiretapping and internet stoppages. Some of its leading figures occupy high positions in the Ministry of Interior, without being held accountable for killings and torture.\n\nThe same threatening language used during the final stages of the old regime -- \"resistance to violence and chaos\" -- has reappeared in recent days when the political police and military brutally repressed popular occupations of the Kasbah and Mahdia. Speeches attempting to manipulate the desire of the population for security have multiplied at the expense of social and political issues in order to divert the revolution.\n\nDespite the suspension of the constitution, draconian laws are still in force: the press code and the laws governing associations, parties, meetings, demonstrations. These laws should have been repealed and replaced by decrees guaranteeing freedoms in order to avoid placing a knife to the neck of the people.\n\nThe administration is still in the grip of Destourian* tyranny and corruption, which have returned by force, to their positions of power in the various governorates. They resumed their former practices oppressing the population, marginalising the local committees to protect the revolution with a perspective of destroying them.\n\nThis situation is mirrored in the economic and financial institutions such as banks, where those involved in the looting of the people and country, working hand-in-hand with the \"criminal gang\", hold onto their power as if nothing had happened.\n\nThe state of the judicial system, undermined by corruption, has not changed, a situation confirmed by the magistrates' association. The media are still under the yoke of the censors of the Ben Ali regime and always work according to orders. There has been no progress in terms of prosecution and conviction of those responsible for tyranny and corruption, including the murderers of the revolution’s martyrs in Sidi Bouzid, Menzel Bouzayane, Regueb, Thala, Kasserine, Tunis and other regions. Members of Ben Ali’s inner circle have re-emerged to continue their provocative activities.\n\nOn the socioeconomic front, the transitional government shows no willingness to take urgent measures needed in this critical period to assist the labouring classes. The vast majority of the population, especially in marginalised regions, feels that no change has occurred in their desperate situation. Unemployment and high cost of living persist, public services continue to deteriorate and the government shows no sign of determination to address these problems.\n\nThe government has not yet set its clocks to revolution time; it has not challenged the minority that has practiced looting based on despotism.\n\nThe government still is functioning under the budget determined by the dictator Ben Ali last December, where priority is given to the repayment of foreign debt owed by the former regime and to finance its huge security apparatus. Despite its temporary nature, this government has not hesitated to take on new foreign debts, while it has taken no action to lower prices, even for goods and services that were under the monopoly of members of the ruling gang. The families of the martyrs have not been compensated and no emergency assistance has been provided to impoverished regions...\n\nThe government justifies its behaviour by claiming to be provisional and claiming not to have a \"magic wand\" to solve all the problems...\n\nYet it is the government itself that impedes the prosecution and trial of the gang that looted public money, as well as the seizure of their property. Moreover, what prevents it from suspending debt repayments temporarily and taking the opportunity to address the problems of our people, as has been done in other countries? Why can’t prices of basic foodstuffs, water and electricity decrease? Why can’t the TV license fee be eliminated? Why does it provide no help to the people of Sidi Bouzid for the electrification of their wells? Why does not listen to the teachers' proposals to allow the hiring of unemployed senior graduates?\n\nIf the Communist Workers' Party of Tunisian emphasises the dangers that threaten the revolution it is because we assume responsibilities that are our own.\n\nThe people have the right to use all legal means to defend its revolution and its achievements, and to confront the dangers which threaten it. It is also entitled to struggle against the government that infringes on the freedoms and wants to confine any decisions to a minimal of closed discussions that involve only \"the highest authority\".\n\nThis period requires deepening the revolutionary process in order to achieve the following objectives.",

How / if Apple tackles this is going to be crucial to the iPhone 6's overall usability.\n\nSource of Leaks Revealed\n\nThere is a final gem in the video. It explains that both models are dummy units and the implication is again that the source of the leaks is case makers.\n\nFrom my industry contacts I know previously Apple has only supplied its most important case partners with dimensions of its new phones ahead of launch. But this time - presumably due to the extensive nature of the changes - the company has given out dummy units and they are popping up everywhere.\n\nWhether this is clever research (expect leaks and gauge the consumer reaction to different iPhone sizes) or pure accident we will likely never know, but based on responses to iPhone leak posts I have written the response to the new sizes (particularly the 5.5-inch model) has been mixed at best.\n\nQuestions Still To Be Answered\n\nThat said with dummy units dominating the leaks some mystery about the new iPhones does still remain. Namely:\n\nScreen resolution - though 1704 x 960 pixels is hotly tipped for both\n\nFront and rear camera resolution - 8 megapixels and 13 megapixels have been mooted for the rear\n\nVideo recording - will 4k 'ultra HD' join the ranks?\n\nBattery Life - vital for these big screens\n\nRetail price - a $100 premium has been touted for the 5.5-inch model\n\nThere are also plenty of surprises still left for the expected August/September launch event. Most notable is the potential appearance of the long awaited iWatch and having seen Samsung tie its Note 3 to the Galaxy Gear 2 as ideal companions we could see a similar marketing strategy from Apple.\n\nWe should also see significantly more of Apple's CarPlay in-car system - again something Google is expected to counter with 'Auto Link' (currently a codename) at I/O 2014 which takes place next week.\n\nThat said all these leaks undoubtedly take away a lot of the mystery once associated with Apple and Google events and it begs the question of whether these 'spoilers' damage the occasion. I can relate to this, but for pure practicality I'd rather know a new device is coming and its key features in advance so I can plan purchases. How about you?\n\nMore on Forbes",

She told her friends on Facebook that she had not visited West Africa since leaving Senegal in 1999. Back then, she was a Peace Corps volunteer. Now she was a 41-year-old global health policy expert for an international development firm.\n\n“Love that I’m in Mali!” she later said in an e-mail to a friend, Amy Kay, in the District. “So happy.”\n\nHer joyful message came just two days before gunmen stormed the Radisson Blu Hotel in Bamako, where she was staying with two co-workers. Her colleagues made it out unharmed. She did not, becoming the only American killed in a siege Friday that left at least 21 people dead.\n\nThat day, Leanne Dougherty left work early after hearing about the attack and huddled with ­Datar’s parents, who were caring for her 7-year-old son at her home in Takoma Park, Md. Dougherty found Datar talented, exuberant and effortlessly glamorous, even in the most trying circumstances.\n\n“I was waiting for her to walk out of the hotel with big glasses, and her hair done and heels,” said Dougherty, who had hired Datar at Palladium, the international development company she worked for in Washington.\n\nAnita Datar of Takoma Park, Md., was the only American killed when gunmen seized the Radisson Blu Hotel in Bamako, Mali. At least 21 people where killed in the attack. (WUSA9)\n\nInstead, she and Datar’s parents waited hours for word. At 2:30 p.m. they learned that Datar was listed as missing. “It was excruciating,” Dougherty said.\n\nTwo hours later, the U.S. ambassador to Mali called Datar’s parents to confirm her death.\n\nAs word spread among friends and colleagues, Datar’s death touched off a wave of mourning that on Saturday reached from colleagues in Washington and neighbors in Maryland to the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n“The world is a darker place without your light,” one stunned friend wrote on Datar’s Facebook page Saturday. “I am praying for your little boy.”\n\n[At least 20 hostages dead in siege of hotel in Mali, official says]\n\nHer family issued a statement Friday voicing similar devastation.\n\n“It’s unbelievable to us that she has been killed in this senseless act of violence and terrorism,” her brother Sanjeev Datar said in the statement. “Anita was one of the kindest and most generous people we know.

(Kevin Sieff and Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\n\nHer brother said that while the family is saddened and angry about Datar’s death, “we know that she would want to promote education and health care to prevent violence and poverty at home and abroad, not intolerance.”\n\nThe divorced mother of a ­second-grader, Datar was Palladium’s senior director for field programs for Health Policy Plus, a project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development aimed at improving reproductive health in developing countries. Datar had devoted much of the past 10 years of her career pursuing global public health, particularly family planning and HIV prevention and response.\n\nEdward Abel, president of Palladium’s U.S. business unit, said that he did not have details about what unfolded inside the hotel or how Datar was killed while her colleagues escaped. “From what I understand, they were on the lower floors of the hotel, and Anita was not,” he said.\n\nAbel said the company has a “very, very rigorous” security policy and does safety assessments of hotels where its employees stay; the company trains employees to handle emergencies. The Radisson Blu, he said, “was considered a safe hotel.”\n\nHe described Datar as “brilliant” and “a true inspiration” to younger associates. “Her work had real impact and touched many people’s lives in the countries in which she worked,” he said.\n\nFormer secretary of state Hillary Clinton also praised Datar’s work. Datar’s ex-husband, David Garten, was one of Clinton’s policy advisers when she served in the Senate.\n\n“Anita Datar was a bright light who gave help and hope to people in need around the world, especially women and families. . . . She represented the best of America’s generous spirit,” Clinton said in a statement.\n\n“My prayers are with the Datar and Garten families, especially Anita and David’s son,” Clinton said. “My heart breaks thinking of the burden he will now bear on his small shoulders and the courage he will have to show in the days ahead.”\n\nPeople who knew Datar spoke about her passion for her son, Rohan, a student at Takoma Park Elementary School. His photos are prominent on her Facebook page, where he is shown smiling on his bike and mugging for the camera with his arm around his mom. On Sundays, she cooked organic meals for him for the week.\n\nAs friends gathered Saturday to grieve at Dougherty’s home in ­Takoma Park, they described a beautiful woman inside and out.\n\nAnupa Deshpande, another colleague, said Datar approached everyone as a friend. “Her first thought about someone was their goodness,” Deshpande said. “She was a very open person that way.”\n\nTwo days before she was killed, Datar wrote on Facebook about the terrorism and violence that had gripped Paris and the world. “This is an everyday reality for so many worldwide, including folks in Mali,” she said. “Doesn’t diminish the horrors of the Paris bombing; just wish more people realized that many parts of the world live in real fear, and it isn’t just ‘something terrible that happened.’ ”\n\nAlthough she was devoted to improving the lives of others, ­Datar also knew how to have fun, hosting many girls’ nights out at her home, her friends said. She had a pink hot tub at her house and a memorable laugh.\n\n“Waking up this morning,” mourned one friend on Facebook, “and learning that I won’t ever hear Anita’s laugh again is devastating.”\n\nMatt Zapotosky, Joe Heim, Perry Stein, Jennifer Jenkins and Alice Crites contributed to this report.",

If anchors, interviewers and White House correspondents did their job — to hold elected officials accountable, by their lapels if necessary — politicians of all stripes could not get away with distorting and outright lying, as they do now.\n\nRove-ian veneers would simply be scraped away by the eight words 'that is not true, please answer my question'. Repeated enough on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and MSNBC they'd mean no birthers. No myths about healthcare or rumors of death panels. No paranoid lies about creeping socialism. No George W. Bush. No Sarah Palin.\n\nTake, for example, Palin's 2008 claim to ABC's Charlie Gibson that because she could \"actually see Russia from land here in Alaska,\" she had foreign policy experience. Imagine if he'd thrown it directly back to her with follow-up questions. What bearing does this have on your ability to make policy? Are you seriously telling us that your qualifications are based on proximity? I put it to you, Governor Palin, that if you have to rely on such a shabby justification, you are woefully lacking.

Often, they will take on roles between producer and consumer, such as trading and moneylending.

  "latent_8680": "For the video game character and its namesake, see Sonic the Hedgehog (character)\n\nSHH gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 7 at position 36.\n\nSonic hedgehog is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SHH (\" s onic h edge h og\") gene.[5] Both the gene and the protein may also be found notated alternatively as \"Shh\".\n\nSonic hedgehog is one of three proteins in the mammalian signaling pathway family called hedgehog, the others being desert hedgehog (DHH) and Indian hedgehog (IHH). SHH is the best studied ligand of the hedgehog signaling pathway. It plays a key role in regulating vertebrate organogenesis, such as in the growth of digits on limbs and organization of the brain. Sonic hedgehog is the best established example of a morphogen as defined by Lewis Wolpert's French flag model—a molecule that diffuses to form a concentration gradient and has different effects on the cells of the developing embryo depending on its concentration. SHH remains important in the adult. It controls cell division of adult stem cells and has been implicated in the development of some cancers.\n\nDiscovery and name [ edit ]\n\nThe hedgehog gene (hh) was first identified in the fruit-fly Drosophila melanogaster in the classic Heidelberg screens of Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus, as published in 1980.[6] These screens, which led to them winning the Nobel Prize in 1995 along with developmental geneticist Edward B. Lewis, identified genes that control the segmentation pattern of the Drosophila embryos. The hh loss of function mutant phenotype causes the embryos to be covered with denticles, small pointy projections resembling the spines of a hedgehog.\n\nInvestigations aimed at finding a hedgehog equivalent in vertebrates by Philip Ingham, Andrew P. McMahon, and Clifford Tabin, revealed three homologous genes.[7][8][9][10] Two of these, desert hedgehog and Indian hedgehog, were named for species of hedgehogs, while sonic hedgehog was named after Sonic the Hedgehog, the protagonist of the eponymous video game franchise.[11][12] The name was devised by Robert Riddle, who was a postdoctoral fellow at the Tabin Lab, after he saw a Sonic comic book his daughter owned.[13][14] In the zebrafish, two of the three vertebrate hh genes are duplicated: SHH a,[15] SHH b[16] (formerly described as tiggywinkle hedgehog, named for Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, a character from Beatrix Potter's books for children), ihha and ihhb[17] (formerly described as echidna hedgehog, named for the spiny anteater and not for the echidna character Knuckles in the Sonic franchise).\n\nFunction [ edit ]\n\nOf the hh homologues, SHH has been found to have the most critical roles in development, acting as a morphogen involved in patterning many systems, including the limb[9] and midline structures in the brain,[18][19] spinal cord,[20] the thalamus by the zona limitans intrathalamica[21][22] the lungs,[23] and the teeth.[24] Mutations in the human sonic hedgehog gene, SHH, cause holoprosencephaly type 3 HPE3 as a result of the loss of the ventral midline. Sonic hedgehog is secreted at the zone of polarizing activity, which is located on the posterior side of a limb bud in an embryo. The sonic hedgehog transcription pathway has also been linked to the formation of specific kinds of cancerous tumors, including the embryonic cerebellar tumor,[25] and medulloblastoma,[26] as well as the progression of prostate cancer tumours.[27] For SHH to be expressed in the developing embryo limbs, a morphogen called fibroblast growth factors must be secreted from the apical ectodermal ridge.[28]\n\nSonic hedgehog has also been shown to act as an axonal guidance cue. It has been demonstrated that SHH attracts commissural axons at the ventral midline of the developing spinal cord.[29] Specifically, SHH attracts retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons at low concentrations and repels them at higher concentrations.[30] The absence (non-expression) of SHH has been shown to control the growth of nascent hind limbs in cetaceans[31] (whales and dolphins).\n\nPatterning of the central nervous system [ edit ]\n\nThe sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling molecule assumes various roles in patterning the central nervous system (CNS) during vertebrate development. One of the most characterized functions of SHH is its role in the induction of the floor plate and diverse ventral cell types within the neural tube.[32] The notochord, a structure derived from the axial mesoderm, produces SHH, which travels extracellularly to the ventral region of the neural tube and instructs those cells to form the floor plate.[33] Another view for floor plate induction hypothesizes that some precursor cells located in the notochord are inserted into the neural plate before its formation, later giving rise to the floor plate.[34]\n\nThe neural tube itself is the initial groundwork of the vertebrate CNS, and the floor plate is a specialized structure and is located at the ventral midpoint of the neural tube. Evidence supporting the notochord as the signaling center comes from studies in which a second notochord is implanted near a neural tube in vivo, leading to the formation of an ectopic floor plate within the neural tube.[35]\n\nSHH and BMP gradients in the vertebrate neural tube\n\nEctopic floor plate formation\n\nVentral neural domains in neural tube\n\nSonic hedgehog is the secreted protein which mediates signaling activities of the notochord and floor plate.[36] Studies involving ectopic expression of SHH in vitro[37] and in vivo[38] result in floor plate induction, and differentiation of motor neuron and ventral interneurons. On the other hand, mice mutant for SHH lack ventral spinal cord characteristics.[39]In vitro blocking of SHH signaling using antibodies against it shows similar phenotypes.[38] SHH exerts its effects in a concentration-dependent manner,[40] so that a high concentration of SHH results in a local inhibition of cellular proliferation.[41] This inhibition causes the floor plate to become thin compared to the lateral regions of the neural tube. Lower concentration of SHH results in cellular proliferation and induction of various ventral neural cell types.[38] Once the floor plate is established, cells residing in this region will subsequently express SHH themselves[41] generating a concentration gradient within the neural tube.\n\nAlthough there is no direct evidence of a SHH gradient, there is indirect evidence via the visualization of Patched (Ptc) gene expression, which encodes for the ligand binding domain of the SHH receptor[42] throughout the ventral neural tube.[43] In vitro studies show that incremental two- and threefold changes in SHH concentration give rise to motor neuron and different interneuronal subtypes as found in the ventral spinal cord.[44] These incremental changes in vitro correspond to the distance of domains from the signaling tissue (notochord and floor plate) which subsequently differentiates into different neuronal subtypes as it occurs in vitro.[45] Graded SHH signaling is suggested to be mediated through the Gli family of proteins which are vertebrate homologues of the Drosophila zinc-finger-containing transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci) . Ci is a crucial mediator of hedgehog (Hh) signaling in Drosophila.[46] In vertebrates three different Gli proteins are present, viz. Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3, which are expressed in the neural tube.[47] Mice mutant for Gli1 show normal spinal cord development, suggesting that it is dispensable for mediating SHH activity.[48] However Gli2 mutant mice show abnormalities in the ventral spinal cord with severe defects in the floor plate and ventral-most interneurons (V3).[49] Gli3 antagonizes SHH function in a dose dependent manner, promoting dorsal neuronal subtypes. SHH mutant phenotype can be rescued in SHH/Gli3 double mutant.[50] Gli proteins have a C-terminal activation domain and an N-terminal repressive domain.[47][51]\n\nSHH is suggested to promote the activation function of Gli2 and inhibit repressive activity of Gli3. SHH also seems to promote the activation function of Gli3 but this activity is not strong enough.[50] The graded concentration of SHH gives rise to graded activity of Gli 2 and Gli3, which promote ventral and dorsal neuronal subtypes in the ventral spinal cord. Evidence from Gli3 and SHH/Gli3 mutants show that SHH primarily regulates the spatial restriction of progenitor domains rather than being inductive, as SHH/Gli3 mutants show intermixing of cell types.[50][52]\n\nSHH also induces other proteins with which it interacts, and these interactions can influence the sensitivity of a cell towards SHH. Hedgehog-interacting protein (HHIP) is induced by SHH which in turn attenuates its signaling activity.[53] Vitronectin is another protein that is induced by SHH; it acts as an obligate co-factor for SHH signaling in the neural tube.[54]\n\nThere are five distinct progenitor domains in the ventral neural tube, viz. V3 interneuron, motor neurons (MN), V2, V1, and V0 interneurons (in ventral to dorsal order).[44] These different progenitor domains are established by \"communication\" between different classes of homeobox transcription factors. (See Trigeminal nerve.) These transcription factors respond to SHH gradient concentration. Depending upon the nature of their interaction with SHH, they are classified into two groups, class I and class II, and are composed of members from the Pax, Nkx, Dbx, and Irx families.[41] Class I proteins are repressed at different thresholds of SHH, delineating ventral boundaries of progenitor domains; while class II proteins are activated at different thresholds of SHH, delineating the dorsal limit of domains. Selective cross-repressive interactions between class I and class II proteins give rise to five cardinal ventral neuronal subtypes.[55]\n\nIt is important to note that SHH is not the only signaling molecule exerting an effect on the developing neural tube. Many other molecules, pathways, and mechanisms are active (e.g. RA, FGF, BMP), and complex interactions between SHH and other molecules are possible. BMPs are suggested to play a critical role in determining the sensitivity of neural cell to SHH signaling. Evidence supporting this comes from studies using BMP inhibitors which ventralize the fate of the neural plate cell for a given SHH concentration.[56] On the other hand, mutation in BMP antagonists (such as noggin) produces severe defects in ventral-most characteristics of the spinal cord followed by ectopic expression of BMP in the ventral neural tube.[57] Interactions of SHH with Fgf and RA have yet not been studied in molecular detail.\n\nMorphogenetic activity [ edit ]\n\nThe concentration and time-dependent, cell-fate-determining activity of SHH in the ventral neural tube makes it a prime example of a morphogen. In vertebrates, SHH signaling in the ventral portion of the neural tube is most notably responsible for the induction of floor plate cells and motor neurons.[58] SHH emanates from the notochord and ventral floor plate of the developing neural tube to create a concentration gradient that spans the dorso-ventral axis.[59] Higher concentrations of the SHH ligand are found in the most ventral aspects of the neural tube and notochord, while lower concentrations are found in the more dorsal regions of the neural tube.[59] The SHH concentration gradient has been visualized in the neural tube of mice engineered to express a SHH::GFP fusion protein to show this graded distribution of SHH during the time of ventral neural tube patterning.[60]\n\nIt is thought that the SHH gradient works to elicit multiple different cell fates by a concentration and time-dependent mechanism that induces a variety of transcription factors in the ventral progenitor cells.[59][60] Each of the ventral progenitor domains expresses a highly individualized combination of transcription factors—Nkx2.2, Olig2, Nkx6.1, Nkx 6.2, Dbx1, Dbx2, Irx3, Pax6, and Pax7—that is regulated by the SHH gradient. These transcription factors are induced sequentially along the SHH concentration gradient with respect to the amount and time of exposure to SHH ligand.[59] As each population of progenitor cells responds to the different levels of SHH protein, they begin to express a unique combination of transcription factors that leads to neuronal cell fate differentiation. This SHH-induced differential gene expression creates sharp boundaries between the discrete domains of transcription factor expression, which ultimately patterns the ventral neural tube.[59]\n\nThe spatial and temporal aspect of the progressive induction of genes and cell fates in the ventral neural tube is illustrated by the expression domains of two of the most well characterized transcription factors, Olig2 and Nkx2.2.[59] Early in development the cells at the ventral midline have only been exposed to a low concentration of SHH for a relatively short time, and express the transcription factor Olig2.[59] The expression of Olig2 rapidly expands in a dorsal direction concomitantly with the continuous dorsal extension of the SHH gradient over time.[59] However, as the morphogenetic front of SHH ligand moves and begins to grow more concentrated, cells that are exposed to higher levels of the ligand respond by switching off Olig2 and turning on Nkx2.2.,[59] creating a sharp boundary between the cells expressing the transcription factor Nkx2.2 ventral to the cells expressing Olig2. It is in this way that each of the domains of the six progenitor cell populations are thought to be successively patterned throughout the neural tube by the SHH concentration gradient.[59] Mutual inhibition between pairs of transcription factors expressed in neighboring domains contributes to the development of sharp boundaries, however, in some cases, inhibitory relationship has been found even between pairs of transcription factors from more distant domains. Particularly, NKX2-2 expressed in the V3 domain is reported to inhibit IRX3 expressed in V2 and more dorsal domains, although V3 and V2 are separated by a further domain termed MN.[61]\n\nTooth development [ edit ]\n\nSonic hedgehog (SHH) is a signaling molecule that is encoded by the same gene sonic hedgehog. SHH plays very important role in organogenesis and most importantly craniofacial development. Being that SHH is a signaling molecule it primarily works by diffusion along a concentration gradient affecting cells in different manners. In early tooth development, SHH is released from the primary enamel knot, a signaling center, to provide positional information in both a lateral and planar signaling pattern in tooth development and regulation of tooth cusp growth.[62] SHH in particular is needed for growth of epithelial cervical loops, where the outer and inner epitheliums join and form a reservoir for dental stem cells. After the primary enamel knots are apoptosed, the secondary enamel knots are formed. The secondary enamel knots secrete SHH in combination with other signaling molecules to thicken the oral ectoderm and begin patterning the complex shapes of the crown of a tooth during differentiation and mineralization.[63] In a knockout gene model, absence of SHH is indicative of holoprosencephaly. However SHH activates downstream molecules of Gli2 & Gli3. Mutant Gli2 and Gli3 embryos have abnormal development of incisors that are arrested at early in tooth development as well as small molars.[64]\n\nLung development [ edit ]\n\nAlthough SHH is most commonly associated with brain and limb digit development, it is also important in lung development.[65][66][67][68] Studies using qPCR and knockouts have demonstrated that SHH contributes to embryonic lung development. The mammalian lung branching occurs in the epithelium of the developing bronchi and lungs.[69][70] SHH expressed throughout the foregut endoderm (innermost of three germ layers) in the distal epithelium where the embryonic lungs are developing.[67][70] This suggests that SHH is partially responsible for the branching of the lungs. Further evidence of SHH’s role in lung branching has been seen with qPCR. SHH expression occurs in the developing lungs around embryonic day 11 and is strongly expressed in the buds of the fetal lungs but low in the developing bronchi.[67][70] Mice who are deficient in SHH can develop tracheoesophageal fistula (abnormal connection of the esophagus and trachea).[71][67] Additionally, it a double (SHH-/- ) knockout mouse model exhibited poor lung development. The lungs of the SHH double knockout failed to undergo lobation and branching (the abnormal lungs only developed one branch compared to an extensively branched phenotype of the wildtype).[67]\n\nPotential regenerative function [ edit ]\n\nSonic hedgehog may play a role in mammalian hair cell regeneration. By modulating retinoblastoma protein activity in rat cochlea, sonic hedgehog allows mature hair cells that normally cannot return to a proliferative state to divide and differentiate. Retinoblastoma proteins suppress cell growth by preventing cells from returning to the cell cycle, thereby preventing proliferation. Inhibiting the activity of Rb seems to allow cells to divide. Therefore, sonic hedgehog, identified as an important regulator of Rb, may also prove to be an important feature in regrowing hair cells after damage.[72]\n\nProcessing [ edit ]\n\nSHH undergoes a series of processing steps before it is secreted from the cell. Newly synthesised SHH weighs 45 kDa and is referred to as the preproprotein. As a secreted protein it contains a short signal sequence at its N-terminus, which is recognised by the signal recognition particle during the translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the first step in protein secretion. Once translocation is complete, the signal sequence is removed by signal peptidase in the ER. There SHH undergoes autoprocessing to generate a 20 kDa N-terminal signaling domain (SHH-N) and a 25 kDa C-terminal domain with no known signaling role.[73] The cleavage is catalysed by a protease within the C-terminal domain. During the reaction, a cholesterol molecule is added to the C-terminus of SHH-N.[74][75] Thus the C-terminal domain acts as an intein and a cholesterol transferase. Another hydrophobic moiety, a palmitate, is added to the alpha-amine of N-terminal cysteine of SHH-N. This modification is required for efficient signaling, resulting in a 30-fold increase in potency over the non-palmitylated form, and is carried out by a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase family, Protein-cysteine N-palmitoyltransferase, HHAT.[76]\n\nRobotnikinin [ edit ]\n\nA potential inhibitor of the Hedgehog signaling pathway has been found and dubbed \"Robotnikinin\", in honour of Sonic the Hedgehog's nemesis, Dr. Ivo \"Eggman\" Robotnik.[77]\n\nControversy surrounding name [ edit ]\n\nThe gene has been linked to a condition known as holoprosencephaly, which can result in severe brain, skull and facial defects, possibly causing clinicians and scientists to criticize the name on the grounds of it sounding too frivolous. It has been noted that mention of a mutation in a sonic hedgehog gene might not be well received in a discussion of a serious disorder with a patient or their family.

  "latent_8800": "From Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia.\n\nThis article is incomplete.\n\nPlease feel free to edit this article to add missing information and complete it.\n\nReason: Other languages for Zenith Marshadow.\n\nSome Pokémon have official major variations between individuals, known as forms (Japanese: すがた form). These variations all have differing sprites in the games and are recognized by the \"forms\" section of the Pokédex.\n\nStarting in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, every official different form has a name given by the Pokédex, but Arceus, Genesect, and Furfrou's alternate forms were not registered in the Pokédex prior to Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. From Generation II to IV, whichever sprite is seen first will be the one displayed in the Pokédex by default; e.g., if West Sea Shellos was encountered first its sprite will appear in the Pokédex by default, whereas if East Sea Shellos was encountered first its sprite will. In Pokémon Black and White, the sprite displayed in the Pokédex can be changed after interacting with Cedric Juniper in Mistralton City, even to a Shiny sprite, if it has been encountered. This option is automatically applied in Pokémon Black 2 and White 2. In Generation VI onwards, the sprite can be changed as long as the player has owned the Pokémon.\n\nAt times, these differences are purely cosmetic and have no bearing on the difference in the Pokémon's stats from another; however, several Pokémon differ in stats (other than HP), type, and Ability depending on their form. Among these are several Legendary and Mythical Pokémon, whose unique forms can be changed between at will and are usually spelled as Formes (Japanese: フォルム Forme).\n\nIn Pokémon Sun and Moon, regional variant Pokémon were introduced. The species of Pokémon that adapted to the environment of Alola are called Alola Forms, and have different appearances, types and abilities to Pokémon of the same species found elsewhere.\n\nPokémon with multiple forms\n\nPikachu\n\nCosplay Pikachu\n\nMain article: Cosplay Pikachu\n\nCosplay Pikachu is a unique female Pikachu who has a black heart-shaped mark near the end of its tail. This unique Pikachu is able to be dressed up into different costumes corresponding to each of the five conditions (Coolness, Beauty, Cuteness, Cleverness, and Toughness) and learn an exclusive move associated with that condition. Cosplay Pikachu can switch costumes anytime at any Contest Hall. It will lose the move it had with the last costume (if it still knows it), and gain the move from the new costume. If Cosplay Pikachu removes its costume while the only move it knows is the move tied to its costume, it learns Thunder Shock.\n\nUnlike other Pikachu, it cannot evolve or breed. Additionally, Cosplay Pikachu cannot be deposited into Pokémon Bank; instead, it can only be traded between copies of Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. Cosplay Pikachu is not present in any other games and does not register as seperate form in the Pokémon Bank Pokédex despite it registering seperately in the Pokédex of Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.\n\nIn Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire (the only games it appears in), after the player takes part in their first Pokémon Contest Spectacular, a Pokémon Breeder will give the player Cosplay Pikachu.\n\nPikachu in a cap\n\nThese cap-wearing Pikachu are event-exclusive Pokémon that debuted in Pokémon Sun and Moon, and are being distributed in celebration of the Pokémon anime's 20th movie, and by extension, the anime's 20th anniversary. Like Ash's Pikachu, these Pikachu are always male and cannot evolve or breed. They also have access to the exclusive Z-Crystal, Pikashunium Z, and its Z-Move, 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt.\n\nSix variants exist in Sun and Moon, one for each of Ash's hats between the anime's original series and its Sun & Moon series. A seventh variant debuts in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, wearing the Partner Cap, Ash's hat from the 20th movie.\n\nPichu\n\nSpiky-eared Pichu is a unique female Pichu who has a tuft of hair on the end of its left ear. Spiky-eared Pichu's Pokéathlon performance stats are different than a normal Pichu's. She cannot evolve or be traded, and she cannot be transferred to the Generation V games.\n\nIn Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver (the only games it appears in), if the player takes a Pikachu-colored Pichu to the Ilex Forest, Spiky-eared Pichu will join the player.\n\nThe Form also appears in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate as an alternate costume for Pichu, marking it's first appearance since HeartGold or SoulSilver\n\nUnown\n\nUnown has many forms, each corresponding to a typographical character. It was the first Pokémon to have multiple forms in the games. From its debut in Generation II, there are 26 forms of Unown, each corresponding to each of the twenty-six letters of the Latin alphabet. Starting in the Generation III games, Unown has two additional forms, corresponding to the question mark and exclamation mark. These forms are not interchangeable.\n\nIn Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, there is a special Unown Mode, an upgrade to the Pokédex that was developed by the researchers at the Ruins of Alph to record the different forms of Unown, which is available after the player has caught several Unown. In Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, there is the Unown Report, which is obtainable after the player completes the first tile puzzle in the Ruins of Alph.\n\nIn the Generation II games, Unown's form is determined by its IVs, which results in some strange phenomena; for example, in Generation II, only Unown I and V can be Shiny due to Shininess also being determined by IVs in these games. In the Generation III games, Unown's form is determined by its personality value. From the Generation IV games onward, an independent value determines the Pokémon form.\n\nThough the form has no bearing on base stats, punctuation Unown have different performance stats to alphabetical Unown.\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nK\n\nL\n\nM\n\nN\n\nO\n\nP\n\nQ\n\nR\n\nS\n\nT\n\nU\n\nV\n\nW\n\nX\n\nY\n\nZ\n\n!\n\n?\n\nCastform\n\nCastform has four different forms, which its Ability Forecast causes it to change between in different types of weather. It is the first Pokémon to have interchangeable forms in battle in the games.\n\nNormally, Castform is Normal-type and has a plain appearance with a gray body. It takes on this form in clear weather, in any weather without a specific form, and if the weather has its effects negated by Cloud Nine or Air Lock.\n\nIn harsh sunlight, Forecast changes Castform to its Sunny Form, which is Fire-type and resembles the sun. In rain, Forecast changes Castform to its Rainy Form, which is Water-type and resembles a raindrop. In hail, Forecast changes Castform to its Snowy Form, which is Ice-type and resembles a snowy cloud. Castform reverts to its normal form when withdrawn from battle.\n\nIn Generation III and IV, if Castform's Ability Forecast is suppressed or replaced, Castform will remain in its current form (regardless of the weather). In Generation V onward, if Castform's Ability Forecast is suppressed or replaced, Castform will revert to its normal form (regardless of the weather).\n\nCastform's stats do not change between any of these forms.\n\nNormal\n\nNormal Sunny Form\n\nFire Rainy Form\n\nWater Snowy Form\n\nIce\n\nDeoxys\n\nDeoxys has four different forms which it can switch between. It was the first Pokémon whose base stats and move compatibility differed depending on its form.\n\nIn the Generation III games, Deoxys's forms are game-specific, such that it will always be in one particular form while in the player's possession (although it will be in Normal Forme in the wild).\n\nFrom Generation IV onward, the player can switch between its forms using meteorites found in the game.\n\nDeoxys's Normal Forme is the default form it takes, as well as the form it appears in in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire. In this form, its stats are more balanced, though it is notably far more offensive than it is defensive.\n\nDeoxys's Attack Forme has higher Attack and Special Attack than its other forms (being the non-Mega Evolved Pokémon with the highest Attack and Special Attack) and learns more offensive moves. Its Defense and Special Defense are abysmal, much lower than its Normal Form. Its Speed remains the same as its Normal Forme.\n\nDeoxys's Defense Forme has much higher Defense and Special Defense than its other forms and learns more defensive moves. Its Attack and Special Attack are much lower than its Normal Forme, and its Speed is also significantly lower than its Normal Forme.\n\nDeoxys's Speed Forme has much higher Speed than its other forms (being the Pokémon with the highest Speed) and learns many increased priority moves.\n\nDeoxys has the same HP stat in all of its forms.\n\nBurmy and Wormadam\n\nBoth Burmy and its female evolution, Wormadam, have three separate forms. Burmy can change form freely, changing its cloak depending on the environment in which it last participated in a battle (so Exp. Share alone will not change its form). Wormadam cannot change form; when a Burmy evolves into Wormadam, it retains its cloak.\n\nApart from breeding and evolution, Burmy's cloak is purely cosmetic; conversely, different cloaks of Wormadam have different types, stats and learnsets. Bred Burmy will have the same cloak as the mother, will be in the same cloak as a Burmy or Wormadam bred with Ditto, or will be in Plant Cloak if bred from a Mothim and a Ditto.\n\nIf a Burmy last battled in a grassy area or water, it changes into its Plant Cloak. If female, Plant Cloak Burmy will evolve into Plant Cloak Wormadam, which is a Bug/Grass Pokémon. This cloak is composed of leaves and twigs.\n\nIf a Burmy last battled in a sandy or rocky area, it changes into its Sandy Cloak. If female, Sandy Cloak Burmy will evolve into Sandy Cloak Wormadam, which is a Bug/Ground Pokémon. This cloak is composed of sand and rocks.\n\nIf a Burmy last battled in a building or urban area, it changes into its Trash Cloak. If female, Trash Cloak Burmy will evolve into Trash Cloak Wormadam, which is a Bug/Steel Pokémon. This cloak is composed of pink insulation.\n\nPlant Cloak\n\nBug Sandy Cloak\n\nBug Trash Cloak\n\nBug\n\nWormadam\n\nPlant Cloak Bug Grass Anticipation\n\nHidden : Overcoat Evolve after battle\n\non grassy terrain HP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 60 59 85 79 105 36 Wormadam\n\nSandy Cloak Bug Ground Anticipation\n\nHidden : Overcoat Evolve after battle\n\non rocky terrain HP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 60 79 105 59 85 36 Wormadam\n\nTrash Cloak Bug Steel Anticipation\n\nHidden : Overcoat Evolve after battle\n\ninside a building HP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 60 69 95 69 95 36\n\nCherrim\n\nCherrim changes form depending on the weather. During harsh sunlight, it changes into Sunshine Form; otherwise, it is in its Overcast Form. Due to its Ability Flower Gift, its Attack and Special Defense will also increase in its Sunshine Form.\n\nIn Generation IV, Cherrim changes form independently of its Ability. Starting in Generation V, it is Cherrim's Ability that changes its form.\n\nIn Japanese, the names of Cherrim's forms use 「フォルム」 form, the term otherwise only used in the names of forms localized as Forme in English.\n\nOvercast Form\n\nGrass Sunshine Form\n\nGrass\n\nShellos and Gastrodon\n\nShellos and Gastrodon differ in appearance depending on where they were caught. This is purely a cosmetic difference, and these Pokémon cannot change between forms.\n\nIn Sinnoh, West Sea Shellos and Gastrodon are encountered west of Mt. Coronet, and are pink in color; East Sea Shellos and Gastrodon are encountered east of Mt. Coronet, and are blue in color. There is also a slight difference in bodily appearance depending on the form.\n\nIn other regions, only one form appears in the wild per game. In Generation VI Hoenn, Shellos appears as a hidden Pokémon, with West Sea appearing in Omega Ruby and East Sea appearing in Alpha Sapphire. Gastrodon only appears in its West Sea form in Kalos's Friend Safari. In Alola, only East Sea Shellos and Gastrodon appear in the wild.\n\nBred Shellos are the same form as their mother, or the same form as the Shellos or Gastrodon parent if bred with Ditto.\n\nRotom\n\nHeat redirects here. For the Badge given by Flannery, see Badge → Heat Badge.\n\nRotom and the appliances\n\nRotom has five alternate forms it can change between, in addition to its normal form. To take on these alternate forms, Rotom possesses a different household appliance, and each has its own special move. These alternate forms were introduced in Pokémon Platinum.\n\nIn Generation IV, all forms of Rotom are Electric/Ghost-type; from Generation V onward, the appliance forms replace the Ghost type with the type of their associated move. All appliance forms have the same base stats, with a higher total than that of Rotom's regular form; the only base stat of normal Rotom that is higher than its appliance forms is its Speed.\n\nUsing these locations, Rotom can also return the appliance to change back to normal form.\n\nUpon changing from an appliance form, it will forget the special move associated with that appliance form. Upon changing into an appliance form, it will learn the special move associated with the form. When changing form, if Rotom knows four moves but not the special move of its previous form, the player will be prompted to replace a move with the new exclusive move (Rotom cannot change to an appliance form unless it does). If Rotom's only known move is its special move and it changes to its normal form, then the Rotom will learn Thunder Shock. In Generation IV and V, if Rotom forgets the move that is tied to its appliance form, it changes back into its normal form; in Generation VI, Rotom can remain in an appliance form even if it forgets the associated special move.\n\nHatched Rotom are always in normal form.\n\nIn Generation IV, Rotom changes back to its normal form when taken into the Union Room or Wi-Fi Club, or when deposited in the Day Care.\n\nRotom's appliance forms first appeared as silhouettes in August 2008, shortly before the Japanese release of Pokémon Platinum, with a statement that indicated that these Pokémon would be in the game. Days before the game's release, it was revealed that these Pokémon were the alternate forms of Rotom. These new forms made their debut in Pokémon Platinum, and have been included in every core series game since.\n\nRotom\n\nRotom Electric Ghost Levitate\n\nHP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 50 50 77 95 77 91 Rotom\n\nHeat Rotom Electric Fire Levitate\n\nHP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 50 65 107 105 107 86 Rotom\n\nWash Rotom Electric Water Levitate\n\nHP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 50 65 107 105 107 86\n\nRotom\n\nFrost Rotom Electric Ice Levitate\n\nHP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 50 65 107 105 107 86 Rotom\n\nFan Rotom Electric Flying Levitate\n\nHP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 50 65 107 105 107 86 Rotom\n\nMow Rotom Electric Grass Levitate\n\nHP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 50 65 107 105 107 86\n\nGiratina\n\nGiratina has two forms it can change between. The Origin Forme was introduced in Pokémon Platinum.\n\nIn the Pokémon world, it is normally in its Altered Forme, which is a winged hexapod; in the Distortion World or while holding a Griseous Orb, it is in its Origin Forme, which is serpentine with six appendages.\n\nThe two forms have different stats and Abilities; the Origin Forme is more offense-oriented, while the Altered Forme is more defense-oriented.\n\nShaymin\n\nShaymin has two forms it can change between. The Sky Forme was introduced in Pokémon Platinum.\n\nNormally, Shaymin is in its Land Forme, which is Grass-type and resembles a hedgehog. When exposed to a Gracidea, Shaymin transforms into its Sky Forme, which is Grass/Flying-type and white in color.\n\nSky Forme Shaymin will change back into its Land Forme at night or if it is frozen (and cannot change into Sky Forme while either is the case); Shaymin also changes back to Land Forme when deposited in the PC (prior to Generation VII), when withdrawn from the PC (Generation VII), when deposited in Pokémon Bank, or when deposited in the Pokémon Day Care/Pokémon Nursery.\n\nThe two forms have different stats, Abilities, types, learnsets, and cries.\n\nArceus\n\nArceus has eighteen different type form variations, which correspond to the eighteen different types.\n\nArceus's type depends on its held Plate or type-specific Z-Crystal, becoming the same type as the type that Plate enhances or the Z-Crystal corresponds to, remaining Normal-type when not holding a Plate or Z-Crystal.\n\nWhile its base stats remain constant despite its changing type, its Pokéathlon performance differs. Additionally, it can learn Draco Meteor only while holding the Draco Plate.\n\nIn the Generation IV games, there is unused data and a sprite programmed for a ???-type Arceus, but it cannot be obtained in the games as there is no ???-type Plate. This data no longer exists in Generation V due to the removal of the ??? type.\n\nPrior to Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Arceus's alternate forms are not registered in the Pokédex.\n\nBasculin\n\nBasculin has two different forms, the Red-Striped Form and the Blue-Striped Form. The Red-Striped Form has a red stripe with wide eyes and spiky fins; the Blue-Striped Form has a blue stripe with squinted eyes and smooth fins. These forms are non-interchangeable.\n\nBred Basculin are the same form as their mother, or the same form as the Basculin parent if bred with Ditto.\n\nWild red-striped Basculin have a 5% chance of holding a Deep Sea Tooth while wild blue-striped Basculin have a 5% chance of holding a Deep Sea Scale.\n\nIn Pokémon Black and White, blue-striped Basculin have the same two standard possible Abilities as red-striped Basculin—Reckless and Adaptability (and are listed as such in Pokédex 3D); however, the blue-striped Basculin that can be obtained via in-game trade in Pokémon White has the Ability Rock Head. In Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, wild blue-striped Basculin's two standard possible Abilities are Rock Head and Adaptability, while red-striped Basculin's stay the same (and are listed as such in Pokédex 3D Pro); however, blue-striped Basculin bred in Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 have Reckless and Adaptability as their two standard Abilities. When a blue-striped Basculin with Reckless is transferred from Generation V to Generation VI, its Ability is changed to Rock Head.\n\nDarmanitan\n\nIf Darmanitan has Zen Mode as its Ability, it changes from Standard Mode into Zen Mode when its HP drops to below half in battle. It can only remain in Zen Mode in battle.\n\nStandard Mode Darmanitan is Fire-type and red in color. Zen Mode Darmanitan is Fire/Psychic-type and blue in color.\n\nThe two forms have different stats, such that Zen Mode Darmanitan swaps the Attack and Special Attack of Standard Mode, and has higher defenses but lower Speed.\n\nDeerling and Sawsbuck\n\nDeerling and Sawsbuck have four different interchangeable forms, each corresponding to a season. These forms are purely cosmetic.\n\nIn the Generation V games, Deerling and Sawsbuck will only change their form to match the current season if they are in the player's party when: the player steps outside from a cave or building such that the season changes, the player receives an Egg from the Day-Care Man, or a saved game is loaded. All wild, bred, or NPC Trainer-owned Deerling and Sawsbuck will match the current season, with the exception of Trainers in the Battle Subway and the Pokémon World Tournament where these Pokémon are always in Spring Form.\n\nIn Generation VI, all wild and NPC Trainer-owned Deerling and Sawsbuck appear in Spring Form. Because seasons have been abandoned as a mechanic, Deerling and Sawsbuck do not change appearance, and their Summer, Autumn, and Winter forms must be transferred from a Generation V game. Bred Deerling are the same form as their mother, or the same form as the Deerling or Sawsbuck parent if bred with Ditto.\n\nForces of Nature\n\nThe Forces of Nature—Tornadus, Thundurus, and Landorus—have two interchangeable forms each.\n\nNormally, they are in their Incarnate Forme. When exposed to a Reveal Glass, they change into their Therian Forme. Their Therian Formes were introduced in Pokémon Black 2 and White 2.\n\nThe two forms have different stats, Abilities, and cries. Even if they have their Hidden Ability, in Therian Forme each Pokémon only has one possible Ability.\n\nIn the Generation V games, they cannot be traded while in their Therian Forme.\n\nKyurem\n\nKyurem, in addition to its normal form, has two other forms: White Kyurem and Black Kyurem. They are the game mascots of Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, which they were introduced in.\n\nIn the games, Kyurem changes its form through the use of the DNA Splicers, which fuses it with Reshiram or Zekrom. The combination retains Kyurem's Poké Ball and held item. This fusion is reversible, with Reshiram or Zekrom remaining unaltered from before being fused, including whatever item it may have been holding. The DNA Splicers can only fuse one Kyurem at a time. White Kyurem and Black Kyurem cannot be deposited into Pokémon Bank, nor can they be traded.\n\nWhite Kyurem has the Ability Turboblaze, learns the moves Fusion Flare and Ice Burn, and its cry is a combination of normal Kyurem and Reshiram's cries.\n\nBlack Kyurem has the Ability Teravolt, learns the moves Fusion Bolt and Freeze Shock, and its cry is a combination of normal Kyurem and Zekrom's cries.\n\nKyurem Dragon Ice Pressure\n\nHP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 125 130 90 130 90 95 Kyurem\n\nWhite Kyurem Dragon Ice Turboblaze\n\nHP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 125 120 90 170 100 95 Kyurem\n\nBlack Kyurem Dragon Ice Teravolt\n\nHP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 125 170 100 120 90 95\n\nKeldeo\n\nKeldeo has two interchangeable forms: Ordinary Form and Resolute Form. These forms are mostly cosmetic. The Resolute Form was introduced in Pokémon Black 2 and White 2.\n\nIf Keldeo is taught Secret Sword from Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 onward, it will change into Resolute Form. If it forgets Secret Sword, it returns to Ordinary Form. Keldeo taught Secret Sword in Pokémon Black and White remain in Ordinary Form in other games.\n\nOrdinary Form\n\nWater Fighting Resolute Form\n\nWater Fighting\n\nMeloetta\n\nMeloetta has two interchangeable forms: Aria Forme and Pirouette Forme. Aria Forme is Normal/Psychic. Pirouette Forme is Normal/Fighting.\n\nNormally, it is in Aria Forme, which is the only form it can take outside of battle. If Meloetta uses the move Relic Song in battle, it changes between the two forms. It reverts to Aria Forme if withdrawn.\n\nGenesect\n\nIn the games, Genesect changes forms when a Drive is attached to its back. These forms have no direct effect, although they do change the type of Genesect's signature move Techno Blast.\n\nIf no Drive is held, Techno Blast will be Normal-type and Genesect will appear to have a dark yellow Drive.\n\nIf a Shock Drive is held, Techno Blast will be Electric-type and Genesect will appear to have a light yellow Drive.\n\nIf a Burn Drive is held, Techno Blast will be Fire-type and Genesect will appear to have a red Drive.\n\nIf a Chill Drive is held, Techno Blast will be Ice-type and Genesect will appear to have an ice blue Drive.\n\nIf a Douse Drive is held, Techno Blast will be Water-type and Genesect will appear to have a blue Drive.\n\nPrior to Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Genesect's alternate appearances are not registered in the Pokédex.\n\nNormal Genesect\n\nBug Steel Shock Drive Genesect\n\nBug Steel Burn Drive Genesect\n\nBug Steel Chill Drive Genesect\n\nBug Steel Douse Drive Genesect\n\nBug Steel\n\nGreninja\n\nAsh-Greninja redirects here. For the Greninja that belonged to Ash Ketchum, see Ash's Greninja.\n\nIn the XY&Z arc of the anime's XY series, Ash's Greninja gained the ability to transform into a stronger form known as \"Ash-Greninja\" through an occurrence known as the Bond Phenomenon. In the games, a Greninja with the Ability Battle Bond will transform into Ash-Greninja after it causes an opponent to faint. In this form, the move Water Shuriken will become more powerful and always hit 3 times. Greninja will stay in this form until the end of battle or it faints. A Greninja with Battle Bond can be transferred to Pokémon Sun and Moon from the Special Demo Version.\n\nInternally, normal Greninja with Battle Bond are considered a separate form than that of Greninja with Torrent or Protean. These Greninja are always male and cannot breed.\n\nVivillon\n\nVivillon has 18 different distinct patterns depending on the set geographic location of the Nintendo 3DS system on which the Scatterbug was generated (for Eggs, this means the game in which the Egg was created). This form cannot be changed. The pattern of Vivillon encountered within a game is set when the save file is created.\n\nBred Scatterbug will evolve into Vivillon with the same pattern as that of the breeding player's game, regardless of its parents.\n\nArchipelago\n\nBug Flying Continental\n\nBug Flying Elegant\n\nBug Flying Garden\n\nBug Flying High Plains\n\nBug Flying Icy Snow\n\nBug Flying Jungle\n\nBug Flying Marine\n\nBug Flying Meadow\n\nBug Flying Modern\n\nBug Flying Monsoon\n\nBug Flying Ocean\n\nBug Flying Polar\n\nBug Flying River\n\nBug Flying Sandstorm\n\nBug Flying Savanna\n\nBug Flying Sun\n\nBug Flying Tundra\n\nBug Flying\n\nVivillon locations\n\nVivillon locations\n\nNote that Vivillon's pattern depends on the set geographic location of the Nintendo 3DS system when the save file was created. Locations within a country can have a different form than merely selecting a country without setting a specific location.\n\nArchipelago Pattern Vivillon can be found in Puerto Rico, Anguilla, the Dominican Republic and the Yucatán region of Mexico.\n\nContinental Pattern Vivillon can be found in Denmark, Germany and South Korea.\n\nElegant Pattern Vivillon is found in most areas of Japan.\n\nGarden Pattern Vivillon can be found in the United Kingdom and New Zealand.\n\nHigh Plains Pattern Vivillon is found in the Western United States, although some players in Colorado report finding the Continental Pattern instead. The High Plains Pattern also appears in the British Columbia province of Canada.\n\nIcy Snow Pattern Vivillon has been reported in far northern regions of Norway and Russia, as well as Canada's Northwest and Yukon Territories.\n\nJungle Pattern Vivillon has been reported in Malaysia, Colombia, and Singapore.\n\nMarine Pattern Vivillon has been reported in large areas of Spain, Portugal, and Italy.\n\nMeadow Pattern Vivillon is known to be found in large sections of France and in Catalonia (Spain).\n\nModern Pattern Vivillon has been found in central and southeastern United States.\n\nMonsoon Pattern Vivillon is known to come from India, Hong Kong, Okinawa, and Taiwan.\n\nOcean Pattern Vivillon comes from Hawaii and Réunion.\n\nPolar Pattern Vivillon is known to come from Alaska, the northeastern United States, and large sections of Canada. Swedish players report finding Polar Pattern Vivillon as well.\n\nRiver Pattern Vivillon has been found in most regions of Australia, the Canary Islands (Spain) and several African countries.\n\nSandstorm Pattern Vivillon is found throughout the Middle East.\n\nSavanna Pattern Vivillon is known to come from Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia.\n\nSun Pattern Vivillon has been reported throughout Latin America and the Northern Territory of Australia.\n\nTundra Pattern Vivillon has been found in Hokkaido, Norway, and Iceland.\n\nThere are also two event-exclusive patterns, the Poké Ball Pattern and the Fancy Pattern. The Poké Ball Pattern resembles a standard Poké Ball, and was first distributed in Paris, France to promote the temporary Pokémon Center store. The Fancy Pattern was distributed via the Nintendo Network from July 8 to 31, 2014 to celebrate the GTS's 100 millionth Pokémon trade.\n\nPoké Ball\n\nBug Flying Fancy\n\nBug Flying\n\nFlabébé, Floette, and Florges\n\nFlabébé, Floette, and Florges can hold five different-colored flowers: red, yellow, orange, blue, and white. The flower color is maintained through evolution and cannot be changed.\n\nIn Pokémon X and Y, Flabébé appear in the wild in flowers, with the colors of Flabébé's flower available depending on the flower patch (although each flower patch has multiple Flabébé flower colors). In Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, wild Flabébé appear in Alola's three meadows, with the color of wild Flabébé's flowers depending on the meadow's flowers' color (Yellow Flower in Melemele Meadow, Red Flower in Ula'ula Meadow, Blue Flower in Poni Meadow); Orange and White Flower Flabébé exclusively appear as allies called in an SOS Battle, and can be called by any Flabébé regardless of location.\n\nBred Flabébé have the same color flower as their mother, or the same form as the Flabébé, Floette, and Florges parent if bred with Ditto.\n\nIn Generation VI, since only Blue Flower, Red Flower, and Yellow Flower Floette can appear in the Friend Safari, only these forms of Flabébé, Floette and Florges can have their Hidden Ability Symbiosis. In Generation VII, all forms of the Flabébé evolutionary line can have their Hidden Ability.\n\nSpoiler warning: this article may contain major plot or ending details.\n\nAZ's unique Floette\n\nIn the storyline of Pokémon X and Y, there is also a unique Floette who AZ befriended 3,000 years ago. The flower it wields has a different design than normal, resembling the structure of the ancient ultimate weapon constructed by AZ; the flower also has a blue, red, and white color instead of green, yellow, and white, reflecting the colors of the French tricolor. The Generation VI and VII games include unused data for a trainable unique Floette. Unlike the other forms, it can learn the move Light of Ruin, and is the only Pokémon able to do so.\n\nSpoilers end here.\n\nFurfrou\n\nFurfrou can be groomed into one of ten different trims. These trims only last for five days after being groomed. Furfrou will also lose its trim when it is deposited in the PC (prior to Generation VII), withdrawn from the PC (Generation VII), deposited in Pokémon Bank, or deposited in the Pokémon Day Care/Pokémon Nursery.\n\nThe location at which Furfrou can be groomed differs between games.\n\nPrior to Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Furfrou's trims are not registered in the Pokédex.\n\nNatural Form\n\nNormal Heart Trim\n\nNormal Star Trim\n\nNormal Diamond Trim\n\nNormal Debutante Trim\n\nNormal Matron Trim\n\nNormal Dandy Trim\n\nNormal La Reine Trim\n\nNormal Kabuki Trim\n\nNormal Pharaoh Trim\n\nNormal\n\nAegislash\n\nAegislash, due to its Ability Stance Change, can change forms in battle depending on the move it uses. Initially in Shield Forme, using a damaging move will change it to Blade Forme, while using King's Shield will change it back into Shield Forme. Outside of battle it is always in Shield Forme.\n\nShield Forme Aegislash has high Defense and Special Defense, while Blade Forme Aegislash has high Attack and Special Attack.\n\nPumpkaboo and Gourgeist\n\nPumpkaboo and Gourgeist can be of Small, Average, Large and Super Size. Larger sizes of Pumpkaboo are rarer to encounter in the wild.\n\nDifferent sizes have different base stats. For Pumpkaboo, with each increase in size, its base HP stat increases by 5 points while its base Speed stat decreases by 5 points. For Gourgeist, with each increase in size, its base HP stat increases by 10 points and its base Attack stat increases by 5 points while its base Speed stat decreases by 15 points. Consequently, the base stat total of a Pumpkaboo or Gourgeist does not vary with size.\n\nBred Pumpkaboo are the same size as their mother, or the same form as the Pumpkaboo or Gourgeist parent if bred with Ditto.\n\nWild Super Size Pumpkaboo will always hold a Miracle Seed, whereas other sizes will never hold an item in the wild. Super Size variants have different, lower pitched cries than the other forms.\n\nOnly Average Size and Super Size Pumpkaboo and Gourgeist can have their Hidden Ability Insomnia. Average Size can be obtained with its Hidden Ability from the Friend Safari; Super Size could be obtained with its Hidden Ability from events.\n\nThe different sizes of Pumpkaboo and Gourgeist do not use different menu sprites.\n\nPumpkaboo\n\nSmall Size Ghost Grass Pickup or\n\nFrisk\n\nHidden : Insomnia HP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 44 66 70 44 55 56 Pumpkaboo\n\nAverage Size Ghost Grass Pickup or\n\nFrisk\n\nHidden : Insomnia HP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 49 66 70 44 55 51 Pumpkaboo\n\nLarge Size Ghost Grass Pickup or\n\nFrisk\n\nHidden : Insomnia HP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 54 66 70 44 55 46 Pumpkaboo\n\nSuper Size Ghost Grass Pickup or\n\nFrisk\n\nHidden : Insomnia HP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 59 66 70 44 55 41\n\nGourgeist\n\nSmall Size Ghost Grass Pickup or\n\nFrisk\n\nHidden : Insomnia HP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 55 85 122 58 75 99 Gourgeist\n\nAverage Size Ghost Grass Pickup or\n\nFrisk\n\nHidden : Insomnia HP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 65 90 122 58 75 84 Gourgeist\n\nLarge Size Ghost Grass Pickup or\n\nFrisk\n\nHidden : Insomnia HP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 75 95 122 58 75 69 Gourgeist\n\nSuper Size Ghost Grass Pickup or\n\nFrisk\n\nHidden : Insomnia HP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 85 100 122 58 75 54\n\nXerneas\n\nXerneas has two forms: Neutral Mode and Active Mode. There is no gameplay difference between them; Xerneas appears in Active Mode in battle, and appears in Neutral Mode in situations outside of battle, such as cutscenes, the Pokédex, the Pokémon screen, and Pokémon-Amie. According to the Pokédex, Xerneas shares everlasting life while it is in Active Mode.\n\nXerneas's horns and some highlights in its fur are light blue in Neutral Mode and light gold in Active Mode. In Active Mode, the protrusions on its horns as well as its back spots light up in several colors.\n\nNeutral Mode\n\nFairy Active Mode\n\nFairy\n\nZygarde\n\nZygarde has three different Formes, as well as two distinct constituent parts. The 50% Forme debuted in Pokémon X and Y. The other two Formes and both constituent parts debuted in the anime during the XY&Z arc of the XY series, and made their core series debut in Pokémon Sun and Moon.\n\nA Zygarde Cell is a single cell of Zygarde. They can be found scattered throughout the region. They do not have thoughts or will, and can communicate with Zygarde Cores via telepathy. They are incapable of performing moves.\n\nA Zygarde Core is a \"brain\" of Zygarde. They can communicate with Zygarde Cells and other Cores via telepathy. They take action when the region's ecosystem is threatened.\n\nZygarde 10% Forme is a Zygarde with 10% of its cells. It has razor-sharp teeth, and can reach speeds up to 60 mph (100 km/h). It can change into Complete Forme with its Ability Power Construct.\n\nZygarde 50% Forme is a Zygarde with 50% of its cells. It watches over and maintains the local ecosystem. It can change into Complete Forme with its Ability Power Construct.\n\nIn battle, a Zygarde with the Power Construct Ability will change into Complete Forme when its HP falls below half in a battle.\n\nZygarde Complete Forme is a Zygarde with 100% of its cells. Zygarde only takes on this form when the ecosystem is under threat and it believes Zygarde 50% Forme is unable to deal with it. Its power is said to exceed that of Xerneas and Yveltal.\n\nIn Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon, the Aether Base on Route 16 on Ula'ula Island contains a Reassembly Unit, which can be used to create Zygarde 10% Forme and Zygarde 50% Forme from Zygarde Cells and Cores in the player's Zygarde Cube, or disassemble Zygarde with Aura Break back into Cells and Cores (Zygarde with Power Construct cannot be separated).\n\nThe player can create any number of Zygarde using the Reassembly Unit as long they have enough Cores and Cells. A Zygarde 10% Forme with Aura Break can be assembled with 10 Cells and Cores, a Zygarde 50% Forme with Aura Break can be assembled with 50 Cells and Cores, and a Zygarde 50% Forme with Power Construct can be assembled with 100 Cells and Cores. The Zygarde Cube can be used to change a Zygarde with Power Construct between 10% Forme and 50% Forme; Zygarde with Aura Break cannot change forms.\n\nWhile only 100 Cells and Cores are normally available in one save file, the player can obtain more by separating Zygarde with Aura Break from other games. A Zygarde separated into Cells will be lost forever.\n\nIn Pokémon Sun and Moon, the player can collect Zygarde Cells and Cores in the overworld throughout the Alola region after obtaining the Zygarde Cube. There are a total of 5 Cores and 95 Cells throughout the region.\n\nIn Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, the player can catch a wild Zygarde 50% Forme in Resolution Cave on Poni Island; after the player catches this Zygarde, Dexio will battle the player on Route 16, and upon being defeated he will give the player the Zygarde Cube (containing 40 Zygarde Cells) and Zygarde 10% Forme.\n\nZygarde Cell\n\nZygarde Core\n\nHoopa\n\nHoopa has two Formes it can change between, using the Prison Bottle to temporarily change to its more powerful Forme.\n\nNormally, Hoopa Confined is the Forme taken by Hoopa, which is Psychic/Ghost. When exposed to a Prison Bottle, Hoopa transforms into Hoopa Unbound, which is Psychic/Dark. Hoopa Unbound was introduced in Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.\n\nHoopa Unbound will change back into Hoopa Confined after three days have passed since using the Prison Bottle; Hoopa also changes back to Hoopa Confined when deposited in the PC (prior to Generation VII), when withdrawn from the PC (Generation VII), when deposited in Pokémon Bank, or when deposited in the Pokémon Day Care/Pokémon Nursery.\n\nThe two forms have different stats, types, learnsets, and cries. Unlike other Pokémon with form differences, Hoopa has more than one category.\n\nOricorio\n\nOricorio has four distinct styles. Depending on which island the player is on, the form that is encountered will be different. Baile Style is only found on Ula'ula Island, Pom-Pom Style on Melemele Island, Pa'u Style on Akala Island, and Sensu Style on Poni Island. Oricorio can manually change forms by sipping the nectar of certain flowers. Each of Oricorio's four styles has a different primary type; Oricorio's signature move Revelation Dance changes type to match the user's primary type.\n\nThe forms have different types and cries.\n\nBaile Style\n\nFire Flying Pom-Pom Style\n\nElectric Flying Pa'u Style\n\nPsychic Flying Sensu Style\n\nGhost Flying\n\nLycanroc\n\nLycanroc has three forms: Midday Form, Midnight Form, and Dusk Form. In Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Ultra Sun, Rockruff will only evolve into Midday Form Lycanroc, while in Pokémon Moon and Pokémon Ultra Moon, Rockruff will only evolve into Midnight Form Lycanroc. Both Midday Form and Midnight Form can be caught in the wild in both Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon.\n\nDusk Form debuted in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon; only special event-exclusive Rockruff with the Ability Own Tempo can evolve into Dusk Form Lycanroc. Own Tempo Rockruff and Dusk Form Lycanroc can breed to produce more Own Tempo Rockruff.\n\nLycanroc's Forms have different stats, Abilities, learnsets, and cries.\n\nWishiwashi\n\nWishiwashi can change forms using its Schooling Ability if it is at least level 20. It will change from Solo Form to School Form at the start of a battle or at the end of a turn if its HP is above 25% of its maximum HP. In School Form, Wishiwashi's appearance changes from a small fish into a larger fish consisting of multiple smaller fish. It will change back to Solo Form if its HP is below 25% of its maximum HP at the end of a turn.\n\nThe two forms have different stats and cries.\n\nWishiwashi\n\nSolo Form Water Schooling\n\nHP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 45 20 20 25 25 40 Wishiwashi\n\nSchool Form Water Schooling\n\nHP Atk Def SpA SpD Spd 45 140 130 140 135 30\n\nSilvally\n\nSilvally has eighteen different forms, which correspond to the eighteen types. Silvally's type and appearance will change depending on its held memory.\n\nMinior\n\nMinior has two forms that it changes between with its Ability, Shields Down. It will change from Core Form to Meteor Form at the start of a battle or at the end of a turn if its HP is above 50% of its maximum HP. If its HP falls below 50% of its maximum HP, its shell breaks and it changes back to Core Form at the end of that turn. Outside of battle, Minior is always in Core Form. However, wild Minior are always encountered in Meteor Form.\n\nMeteor Form and Core Form have different stats. Due to its Ability Shields Down, Meteor Form Minior cannot be afflicted by status conditions.\n\nA Minior's Core Form can be one of seven different colors. Bred Minior will always have the same Core color as their parent.\n\nRed Core\n\nRock Flying Orange Core\n\nRock Flying Yellow Core\n\nRock Flying Green Core\n\nRock Flying Blue Core\n\nRock Flying Indigo Core\n\nRock Flying Violet Core\n\nRock Flying\n\nMimikyu\n\nMimikyu has two forms called Disguised Form and Busted Form. When a Mimikyu in Disguised Form that has the Disguise Ability is hit by a damaging attack, it does not take damage and instead transforms into Busted Form. In Busted Form, its disguise slumps to the side and it can be damaged by normal means. Mimikyu will stay in Busted Form until either it faints or the battle ends.\n\nDisguised Form\n\nGhost Fairy Busted Form\n\nGhost Fairy\n\nNecrozma\n\nNecrozma has three additional forms; Dusk Mane Necrozma, Dawn Wings Necrozma, and Ultra Necrozma. All three forms were introduced in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.\n\nDusk Mane Necrozma is the form it attains from absorbing Solgaleo. The player can induce this fusion with the N-Solarizer. After fusing, Necrozma will attempt to learn Sunsteel Strike, and can use Solgaleo's exclusive Z-Move, Searing Sunraze Smash. Its cry is a combination of normal Necrozma and Solgaleo's cries.\n\nDawn Wings Necrozma is the form it attains from absorbing Lunala. The player can induce this fusion with the N-Lunarizer. After fusing, Necrozma will attempt to learn Moongeist Beam, and can use Lunala's exclusive Z-Move, Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom. Its cry is a combination of normal Necrozma and Lunala's cries.\n\nUltra Necrozma is a third form Necrozma can only enter in battle as one of the previous two forms. While holding its exclusive Z-Crystal, Ultranecrozium Z, the player can use the Ultra Burst command from the move menu to transform into Ultra Necrozma. Once transformed, Ultra Necrozma can also use Ultranecrozium Z and Photon Geyser to use its exclusive Z-Move, Light That Burns the Sky.\n\nMagearna\n\nMagearna has an alternate form called Original Color Magearna. The only difference between Magearna's forms is aesthetic: the Original Color form is red and gold. The Original Color form cannot be legitimately obtained, and has only appeared in an official capacity in the anime movie, Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel.\n\nMagearna\n\nSteel Fairy Original Color Magearna\n\nSteel Fairy\n\nForm-like transformations\n\nSome Pokémon have transformations that may resemble forms and have official names, but they do not register as discrete forms in the Pokédex.\n\nReshiram, Zekrom, and Kyurem\n\nReshiram, Zekrom, White Kyurem, and Black Kyurem enter Overdrive mode when their emotions surge, lighting parts of their bodies in flames or electricity in the process. Reshiram and Zekrom enter Overdrive mode when using their signature moves (Fusion Flare and Blue Flare for Reshiram, Fusion Bolt and Bolt Strike for Zekrom) and are usually not in Overdrive mode otherwise. Black and White Kyurem, however, are always in Overdrive mode in battle.\n\nReshiram\n\nDragon Fire Zekrom\n\nDragon Electric White Kyurem\n\nDragon Ice Black Kyurem\n\nDragon Ice\n\nIn Overdrive\n\nDragon Fire In Overdrive\n\nDragon Electric In Overdrive\n\nDragon Ice In Overdrive\n\nDragon Ice\n\nSolgaleo and Lunala\n\nSolgaleo and Lunala enter special phases when using their powers, shining brighter than normal. Solgaleo's phase is called the Radiant Sun phase, while Lunala's is the Full Moon phase. They both enter this phase while in Ultra Space (although not while in battle) or when using their signature moves. For Solgaleo, these moves are Sunsteel Strike and Searing Sunraze Smash; for Lunala, these are Moongeist Beam and Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom.\n\nSolgaleo\n\nPsychic Steel Radiant Sun phase\n\nPsychic Steel\n\nLunala\n\nPsychic Ghost Full Moon phase\n\nPsychic Ghost\n\nMarshadow\n\nWhen Marshadow attacks or becomes worked up, the flames on its body flare green. This transformation is called Zenith Marshadow.[1]\n\nGloomdweller Marshadow\n\nFighting Ghost Zenith Marshadow\n\nFighting Ghost\n\nIn other games\n\nPokémon Shuffle\n\nMain article: List of Pokémon by Pokémon Shuffle list number\n\nIn Pokémon Shuffle, Pokémon with different forms have different Skills and can have different Attack Powers and max levels.\n\nMost Pokémon with forms in the core series games also have those forms in Pokémon Shuffle. Many Pokémon have a \"Winking\" form, notably including most of the starter Pokémon. There are also a few Pokémon with a \"Spooky\" or \"Holiday\" form. Pikachu has a large variety of forms, mostly unique to Pokémon Shuffle.\n\nPokémon GO\n\nThis section is incomplete.\n\nPlease feel free to edit this section to add missing information and complete it.\n\nReason: models missing.\n\nThe alternate forms of Squirtle and Pikachu are referred to as Event Pokémon.\n\nSquirtle\n\nFor the July 8th Pokémon GO Community Day, a special Squirtle Squad variation of Squirtle could be caught. This Squirtle can also evolve into Wartortle and Blastoise variations.\n\nSquirtle\n\nWater Squirtle Squad Squirtle\n\nWater\n\nWartortle\n\nWater Squirtle Squad Wartortle\n\nWater\n\nBlastoise\n\nWater Squirtle Squad Blastoise\n\nWater\n\nPikachu\n\nIn Pokémon GO, Pikachu has several different forms.

Brands colleagues over at Taco Bell are breathing down their grease-stained necks with the Naked Chicken Chalupa, the fried chicken alchemists at KFC have pushed forward their research in the field of bread-to-chicken replacement. Following in the footsteps of the KFC Double Down, the chain has expanded the availability of the KFC Chizza—which is a personal-sided pizza in which the crust has been replaced with a flattened piece of fried chicken, obviously—into Singapore, bringing it closer and closer to the mouths of the millions of Americans it will inevitably destroy.\n\nThe Chizza has been making its way through Asian fast food markets for a few years now, initially debuting in the Philippines back in 2015, before spreading to India later that year. Now it’s in Singapore, oozing like the “KFC Cheese Sauce” that rests atop its gooey throne. To celebrate this latest assimilation, KFC released a video via its Twitter, detailing the anatomy of a Chizza:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting with pizza sauce slathered on KFC fried chicken, there’s initially not much to distinguish the Chizza from a chicken Parmesan. (Even if we’re kind of amazed that the company didn’t just use mashed potatoes as the sauce.) Things get worse once the chicken ham arrives, though, pineapple chunks in tow. (Hawaiian seems to be the default Chizza flavor, although there are images available of pepperoni versions, as well.) Finally, the whole thing is slathered in mozzarella and, again, “KFC Cheese Sauce,” before being melted together by surly teens.\n\nKFC has declined to mention when the Chizza might wash over the American market on a wave of bad decisions; courtesy would dictate that the company install some kind of countdown clock, to allow the weird fast food junkie demographic time to get their affairs properly in order. Meanwhile, if you’re living in Singapore: Dig in!",

  "latent_9186": "An international team of entomologists led by Dr Niklas Wahlberg from the University of Turku in Finland has described an enigmatic new species of moth from Kangaroo Island off southern Australia and erected both a new genus (Aenigmatinea) and an entirely new family (Aenigmatineidae) for it.\n\nAccording to the scientists, the newly-discovered species – named Aenigmatinea glatzella – is a ‘living dinosaur.’\n\nIt lives on Southern Cypress-pine trees (Callitris gracilis), a very ancient element of flora going back to the supercontinent Gondwana.\n\nThe adult moths are less than 1 cm long. Their wings are covered in scales that appear gold and purple, and the edges of the wings have feathery fringes.\n\nThey are short-lived: in just one day they emerge from their cocoons, mate, females lay their eggs, and then die.\n\n“This new moth is small, about the size of a 5-cent piece. It has gold and purple wings with fringed edges. So far it has only been found in one place which is on Kangaroo Island off the south coast of South Australia,” said Dr Ted Edwards of CSIRO’s Australian National Insect Collection, a co-author of the paper published in the journal Systematic Entomology.\n\n“Our research shows that it is a living dinosaur and belongs to an entirely new family of primitive moths (Aenigmatineidae).”\n\n“This is the first time since the 1970s that a new family of primitive moths has been identified anywhere in the world,” he added.\n\nBy studying the appearance of Aenigmatinea glatzella and analyzing its DNA, Dr Edwards and his colleagues from New Zealand, Australia, and Denmark, have revealed that the evolution of moths and butterflies is even more complex than previously thought.\n\n“By studying the moth’s structure and analyzing its DNA, our team has shown that the evolution of moths and butterflies is even more complex than previously thought,” Dr Edwards said.\n\n“While the discovery of this new moth strengthens the evolutionary relationships between other primitive moth families, it also suggests that tongues evolved in moths and butterflies more than once.”\n\nHe added: “our fauna is so exciting we can still find new primitive species.”\n\n“Australia is so rich in moths that vast numbers still remain to be discovered.”\n\n_____\n\nNiels P.

  "latent_9705": "Microsoft hardware chief Panos Panay with the Microsoft Lumia 950 and 950XL phones. Getty Images/Andrew Burton We're hearing from sources that when Microsoft holds its next big event on May 2, neither the next-generation Surface Pro 5 tablet nor the long-rumored Surface Phone will be making appearances.\n\nJust to back up for a second, the still-unofficial Surface Phone is considered to be Microsoft's very last shot at making Windows a serious smartphone contender against Apple and Google, as Windows phones slip under 1% global market share. Microsoft hasn't shipped a flagship Windows phone since late 2015's Lumia 950.\n\nAnd while you can read pretty much anything into the Surface Phone's absence, the fact we're hearing it won't be shown at least indicates it's probably still in the works — something that was in doubt, after going over a year without any kind of substantial update.\n\nThat's exacerbated by years of reports indicating that it's been a bumpy road for Microsoft. Originally rumored to be unveiled in mid-2016, the Surface Phone slipped into late 2017 (or maybe early 2018, if you believe an anonymous Reddit user). And Intel cancelled the processor that Microsoft was supposedly eyeing to power the device.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has filled the gap in its own smartphone lineup by doubling down on iOS and Android. Notably, Microsoft partnered up with Samsung to offer a custom version of the new Samsung Galaxy S8 phone, making it the most premium Microsoft phone on the market.\n\nNow, with super-fans baying for the company to recommit to Windows on phones, but the rest of the world increasingly apathetic, Microsoft is damned if it does release a Surface Phone, and damned if it doesn't.\n\nDamned if you do\n\nThe rumor is that this hypothetical Surface Phone will be a powerful flagship Windows 10 Mobile phone with at least one absolutely killer feature: The ability to plug it into a keyboard, mouse, and monitor and use it like an honest-to-goodness, full-on Windows PC, letting you run desktop PC software on a device you can pocket.\n\nIt sounds great on paper. But it seems extremely unlikely that even if Microsoft releases the coolest, most innovative phone ever made, it could get anybody to care.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella Justin Sullivan/Getty\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella has made a big bet on Windows 10's Universal Windows Platform, where developers can write Windows 10 apps that run on PCs, tablets, and smartphones alike. But apart from a few high-profile apps from developers like Uber and Facebook, the Windows Store is still pretty dire, as most developers pass over Windows 10 for the way more popular iPhone and Android platforms.\n\nAnd given that Windows 10 Mobile currently doesn't have apps like Snapchat or \"Pokémon Go,\" and that companies like Spotify are pulling their Windows phone apps as market share vanishes, good luck getting an iPhone or Android user to switch.\n\nSo it almost doesn't matter what the Surface Phone turns out to be. Unless it's a massive, market-defining hit like the first iPhone, it's not going to draw enough developers back to the Windows Store to make a difference. Head-to-head with the iPhone or Google Pixel, this phone could maybe win a battle. But Windows 10 Mobile won't win any kind of war.\n\nDamned if you don't\n\nWhen Microsoft and Samsung announced their Galaxy S8 collaboration, Windows fans weren't happy. To them, the partnership was a signal that Microsoft cared a lot more about Android than it does about Windows 10 Mobile.\n\n\"Just put Windows mobile out of it's [sic] misery already and stop yanking us around,\" wrote one Reddit commenter, in part, following the news.\n\nIndeed, Samsung's own DeX, which lets you plug the Galaxy S8 into a monitor and use it like a PC, is a huge step towards fulfilling the Surface Phone dream, built on Android. With Microsoft giving the Galaxy S8 an explicit endorsement, it definitely looks like they've given up on their own phone platform.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8 Business Insider\n\nAnd yet, Microsoft can't throw in the towel. With PC sales shrinking, Microsoft needs to prove to itself and the world that Windows is still relevant. So while the company is working on nifty holographic technology that it thinks will render smartphones obsolete, that's probably a decade away from being released as a full product.\n\nIn the meantime, smartphones are here to stay. And so, whether or not it's a huge hit, Microsoft needs something like a Surface Phone just to keep Windows in the conversation. Windows 10 on PCs and tablets is pretty great, but without a smartphone, the platform appears a little backwards-looking.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you're a Star Trek fan, this is Microsoft's own Kobayashi Maru— a no-win scenario that tests your priorities under an impossible situation.\n\nIf Microsoft opts not to release a phone, it's a clear sign that it's taking the far more realistic approach of providing apps and services for Android and iOS phones, which is a lucrative business for the company. That comes at the very possible cost of Windows' future prospects as the world continues to move towards the smartphone, but the continued growth of its Office 365 subscription service.\n\nCollider\n\nBut if Microsoft does release a phone, it shows that the company is committed to Windows, one of the very major reasons it became a titan of technology in the first place. This has a potentially higher payoff, as it could be the breakthrough device that pushes Windows 10 Mobile into the mainstream, and ensure Windows' relevance for another several years. Or it could keep Microsoft shackled to a shrinking, legacy business.\n\nIn other words, Microsoft can't win with the Surface Phone. It can, however, choose the way that it loses.\n\nIf you know more about the Microsoft Surface Phone, you can contact the reporter via e-mail at mweinberger@businessinsider.com or via secure Telegram message at @gamoid.",
  "latent_9768": "The series of attacks is diminishing the status of the president, a Romney aide says. Mitt aide: Obama camp not credible\n\nIn the newest attempt to to connect with middle-class voters, Mitt Romney will launch a bus tour on Saturday through a series of towns that went blue in 2008. And he’s hoping his new running mate, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, can help.\n\nThe presumptive GOP nominee is headed to Virginia, North Carolina, Florida and Ohio and stopping overwhelmingly in places that voted for President Barack Obama the last go-round.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n“We’re going right into the lion’s den in terms of blue voters,” a senior adviser said on Friday morning, briefing reporters on the tour.\n\nThe barnstorming was scheduled as speculation over who Romney would pick as his vice presidential running mate reached a fever pitch. Romney is planning to announce his choice of Ryan Saturday morning in Norfolk. But many observers had doubted Romney would have his VP candidate in tow — since many of those who were at one time possible running mates will accompany him for various stops on the tour. Expected to join Romney are Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Ron Portman.\n\nRomney hopes to change the subject from the barrage of attacks being leveled at him by the Obama campaign and the super PACs that support his candidacy — the latest one a controversial spot that lays the blame on Romney for the death of a man’s wife who lost his job from a Bain-controlled company.\n\n“Mitt Romney is going to be talking about his plan to create a stronger middle class,” said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior Romney strategist. “We’re going to be highlighting the work for small-business owners. We’re going to talk about repealing ‘Obamacare,’ about getting tough on China.”\n\nIn the same breath, Fehrnstrom criticized Obama for not talking about substance. He argued that Romney’s tour will be built around policy discussions, which the campaign has been criticized for failing to elaborate on . He said Romney’s campaign will “respond forcefully to Obama’s ugly distortion and lies.”\n\n“We are betting that a substantive campaign conducted on the high ground and focused primarily on jobs and the economy will trump a campaign that is designed to appeal to our worst instincts,” Fehrnstrom said.\n\nReplied Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith: “The Romney campaign’s faux outrage over an ad run by an outside group separate from our campaign rings extremely hollow. … Mitt Romney won the Republican primary only by tearing down each of his opponents with ruthlessly negative campaigning, including ads funded by outside allies.”\n\n“When the Romney campaign finally reaches the high ground, we look forward to greeting them there,” the aide added.\n\nFehrnstrom blasted Priorities USA, the Obama-aligned super PAC that ties the GOP nominee to a sick woman, and again condemned the Obama campaign for alleging that Romney could be a felon for telling voters he wasn’t involved with Bain in a substantive way post-1999.\n\n“The Obama campaign has engaged in not only an outright falsehood, beyond that their campaign has deceived the public over what they knew about it,” Fehrnstrom said. “When you start running ads accusing your opponent of killing people, then you have lost credibility, and I think that’s where the Obama campaign finds itself.”\n\nFehrnstrom argued that the series of attacks coming out of Chicago and pro-Obama super PACs is diminishing the status of the president.\n\n“I don’t think a world champion limbo dancer could get any lower than the Obama campaign right now,” Fehrnstrom said. “In the process, Obama has squandered what has always been one of his key attributes, that he was a different kind of politician who would take us to a different place.”",
  "latent_10016": "News_release\n\n3D model of famous amnesiac's brain helps illuminate human memory\n\nDuring his lifetime, Henry G. Molaison (H.M.) was the best-known and possibly the most-studied patient of modern neuroscience. Now, thanks to the postmortem study of his brain, based on histological sectioning and digital three-dimensional construction led by Jacopo Annese, PhD, at the University of California, San Diego, scientists around the globe will finally have insight into the neurological basis of the case that defined modern studies of human memory.\n\nThe microscopic anatomical model of the whole brain and detailed 3D measurements of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) region are described in a paper to be published online in Nature Communications on January 28.\n\nH.M. was an epileptic patient whose severe and almost total amnesia was the unexpected result of a bilateral surgical ablation of the MTL, including the hippocampus, in 1953. Until his death in 2008, the purity and severity of H.M.’s memory impairment, along with his willingness to participate in continual testing, made his case uniquely influential.\n\nWhile his intellectual abilities, personality, language and perceptual skills remained intact, he was unable to store information in long-term memory. After his brain operation, H.M. was profoundly impaired in forming new declarative memories. This unfortunate outcome became the catalyst for over 50 years of scientific discoveries (and thousands of publications) that have radically changed scientists’ basic understanding of memory function. His case was significant because it provided the first conclusive evidence for the involvement of the hippocampus in forming new memories.\n\nIn December 2009, Annese and his team dissected H.M.'s brain into 2,401 thin tissue slices that were then preserved cryogenically in serial order. While the brain was being sliced, the researchers collected an unabridged series of digital images of the surface of the block, corresponding to each tissue section. These images were archived and used to create a three-dimensional microscopic model of the whole brain. The model of H.M.’s brain contains clues to help understand the surgery performed in 1953, and the level of sampling and image quality afforded by this study represents a significant advance over the MRI scans performed with H.M. when he was alive.\n\n“Our goal was to create this 3D model so we could revisit, by virtual dissection, the original surgical procedure and support retrospective studies by providing clear anatomical verification of the original brain lesion and the pathological state of the surround areas of H.M.’s brain,” Annese said. But the study reveals a small, circumscribed lesion in the left orbitofrontal cortex that had been previously undiscovered, showing the power of the technique. Based on the 3D geometry of the lesion and the type of the lobectomy that was performed in 1953, Annese thinks this lesion was very likely created by Scoville during the surgery.\n\nThe findings reported in Nature Communications constitute new evidence that may help scientists today understand more fully the consequences of H.M.’s operation in the context of modern knowledge on memory of the functional anatomy of the hippocampus.\n\nAnnese and his team at UCSD also created a web-based atlas of H.M.’s brain, meant to support collaboration and preserve an archive of anatomical images relative to the case. The atlas contains structural delineations and digitized versions of the stained histological slides that can be viewed at the cellular-level using Google maps, a level of detail not seen before.\n\nFor more information on the H.M. project and the Brain Observatory, visit: thebrainobservatory.org.\n\nFunding for the study was provided by grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF-SGER 0714660), the Dana Foundation Brain and Immuno-Imaging Award, and by private contributions from viewers of the web broadcast of the dissection.

  "latent_10144": "Interested in rooting for one of the NFL's 32 teams -- but don't know where to start? Adam Rank has you covered with this series, which will present a handy guide to becoming an instantly rabid fan of each organization in the league. Below, find out why you should root for the Oakland Raiders.\n\nWhat you need to know so you don't sound stupid\n\n\"Star Wars\" is the best movie franchise of all time. Nobody disputes this. But what makes it so good? What makes it so compelling? It's not necessarily Luke Skywalker. I mean, he's kind of a detriment at first, because he's so whiny in Episode IV. What makes the movie sing is wanting to see the Empire get its butt handed to it. Like, didn't you want to just slap that smug Admiral Motti?\n\nThat's the Raiders. The bad boys of the NFL. Replete with their own Imperial March:\n\nIf this doesn't give you the goose pimples, you might not be alive. Seriously, check your midi-chlorian count. The poem was written by Steve Sabol. Yes, the same Steve Sabol who didn't want to give credit for the Jets victory in Super Bowl III. It's pretty incredible. Here's my favorite part:\n\nThe autumn wind is a Raider,\n\nPillaging just for fun.\n\nHe'll knock you 'round and upside down,\n\nAnd laugh when he's conquered and won.\n\nPart of the reason the NFL is so popular today is because of the Raiders. NFL fans not only wanted to see their favorite team win, but they also wanted to see the Raiders lose. I mean, shoot, a young man could have cut his teeth in sports writing by operating an anti-Raiders blog back in the day. That's how powerful the Raiders are.\n\nThe franchise's best\n\nOn what would have been his 88th birthday, we honor and pay tribute to Al Davis. pic.twitter.com/VJY72UPumR â OAKLAND RAIDERS (@RAIDERS) July 4, 2017\n\nIt has to be Al Davis. Who, like Darth Vader, was the face of the Empire -- I mean Raider Nation -- for years. Let's be honest: He still is.\n\nThe Raiders have featured some great players over the years. Jim Otto, Gene Upshaw, Willie Brown, Fred Biletnikoff, Howie Long, Marcus Allen, Mike Haynes, Ray Guy ... Damn, I could be here all day. But it's Al Davis who forever will be synonymous with the Raiders.\n\nHe joined the club as head coach in 1963, took a downtrodden franchise and built it into one of the most feared and successful teams in the AFL (he was COY in 1963) and eventually NFL. Hell, the world. The Raiders aren't just a football team; they have become a part of popular culture.\n\nThe bad boys of the NFL were the only franchise to play in a Super Bowl in the 1960s, '70s and '80s. No team won with more swagger than the Raiders. And that still lives on to this day. Davis once said the greatness of the Raiders lies in their future. That's never been more true than at this moment right now.\n\nThe turnaround\n\nAfter a Super Bowl appearance in the 2002 campaign, the Raiders suffered through 13 straight non-winning seasons. But GM Reggie McKenzie nailed it in the 2014 NFL Draft. Let's not call it the Steelers' 1974 draft just yet, but the Raiders selected OLB/DE Khalil Mack, QB Derek Carr and OG Gabe Jackson with the first three picks. Fresh off a DPOY campaign, Mack is considered by some to be the very best defensive player in the game. The NFL players voted him as the fifth-best player in the NFL. That's fifth-best overall. As in one spot ahead of Aaron Rodgers. That's pretty dope.\n\nJackson just signed a $56 million extension and is considered one of the best road-grader guards in the league today. He's that good. But that quarterback. Oh man, that was a long time coming ...\n\nTook long enough\n\nDo you know who was the last quarterback to start for the Raiders prior to Carr in 2014? Yeah, it was current Redskins receiver Terrelle Pryor. The Raiders had searched for years to find a franchise quarterback. Pryor, Carson Palmer, Jason Campbell, JaMarcus Russell, Daunte Culpepper, Andrew Walter, Kerry Collins. Yuck. The list reads like one of those terrible Garry Marshall movies -- \"New Year's Eve\" or \"Valentine's Day\" -- where a bunch of big names are thrown into roles, but there isn't much direction given. I can envision the Netflix description now: A gaggle of random QBs band together to return the Raiders to respectability. But then things go from bad to worse. (TRAGEDY). Seriously, Carson Palmer is the over-the-hill actor. JaMarcus is the Hollywood tragedy guy. Andrew Walter is the anonymous white guy you see in an episode of \"Criminal Minds\" years later and are all, \"Where did I see that guy before?\"\n\nBut hey, the sequel starring Derek Carr is pretty good.\n\nDriving the Carr\n\nFormer Raiders legend (and finally Hall of Famer) Ken Stabler was a hard-drinking carouser who never met a dimly lit bar he didn't like. Derek Carr would not be described in those terms. But here's the common thread: getting it done on the field of play.\n\nCarr led the Raiders to 12 wins last year -- and became a bona fide MVP candidate -- before a broken fibula ended his season. Carr has 81 touchdown passes in his young NFL career. The only QBs in NFL history with more TD strikes over their first three pro seasons? Dan Marino (98), Andrew Luck (86) and Peyton Manning (85).\n\nAnd let's be honest, this practice jersey is pretty. All faded and such. He told his brother he's never getting a new one.\n\nBeast Mode\n\nOne of the coolest things in the league right now is the return of Marshawn Lynch. If you made me list my top three storylines entering this season, Marshawn would be one of 'em. Beast Mode is back to help get his hometown Raiders to the Super Bowl before the team heads to Las Vegas. I love everything about this. This strikes me as a move similar to the Charles Haley addition that helped the Cowboys get over the top in the early 1990s. And did you know Marshawn leads the NFL in rushing touchdowns since 2011 (51)? Yes, despite the fact that he didn't even play last season.\n\nHe is the King\n\nPunters have become some of the biggest stars in the NFL (OK, slight exaggeration, but still ...). Marquette King stands out above them all because of his eccentric personality, both on the field and on social media. Our own Ali Bhanpuri nailed this profile right here. If you read that and are not a fan, I can't help you.\n\nPunter fun fact\n\nFormer Raider Ray Guy is the only punter in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nViva Las Raiders\n\nThe brightest spot in the world just got brighter. #TheRaidersAreComing pic.twitter.com/dSFV1LrQx3 â OAKLAND RAIDERS (@RAIDERS) March 29, 2017\n\nI'll be honest: I never felt the Raiders in Oakland. They were always an L.A. team to me. TO ME. I am not besmirching Oakland. I grew up with the Raiders in Los Angeles. What you should know: They are still the most popular team in Southern California. By far. So Las Vegas really makes a lot of sense to me, since it's basically a suburb of L.A. anyway. I don't want to make light of anybody's pain for losing a team. But come on: You're going to Vegas. So instead of driving to the stadium, you're going to hop on a Southwest jet and go to a game. What an epic weekend. I'm telling you: This will make the Raiders more popular than ever before. Especially when you consider the Raiders are a global brand that really doesn't need a municipality in front of it. Though Vegas is pretty sick.\n\nAnd think of this for the fans of every visiting team playing the Raiders. They will move heaven and pigskin to get to that game. Every AFC West opponent's fans eyes will be glued to the schedule release to see when they play in Vegas. And if you're a fan of another team, you will plan your once-in-a-decade trip out there. I mean, the Bears play the Raiders in 2019. I pray -- PRAY -- that the Raiders are playing at Sam Boyd Stadium by that time. Because that would be the best.\n\nRaider Nation\n\nThere's only one \"nation\" in sports: Raider Nation. The rest of you are posers. Be a touch more creative and think of something else. You know who you are.\n\nThe Black Hole\n\nWord.\n\nGoing to a Raiders game can, at times, feel like you are searching for a pilot at the Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina. Only a bit more dangerous. I kid, I kid. Raider Nation can be pretty cool. The Black Hole is just a bunch of fun-loving men and women trying to have a good time and support the team. Now, do they dress up as gorillas (outkick the coverage much?), Road Warrior cosplay dorks and whatever the hell this is? Sure. That's part of the fun. (BTW, my favorite might be Pharaoh Raider.)\n\nAnd let me reiterate the point from above: The Raiders were miserable for most of this millennium. The Black Hole never wavered.\n\nMadden\n\nMillions of kids get hooked on the NFL because of EA Sports' \"Madden NFL.\" Hell, Derek Carr might not even be an NFL quarterback today were it not for the game. Seriously, just ask his brother.\n\n\"I don't know if Derek would have been so drawn towards [football] if it hadn't been for 'Madden,' \" David Carr told me. \"He is a good enough athlete that he could have played something else. But because of 'Madden,' it became our connection. We bonded. He got into football because of 'Madden.' \"\n\nNow, people of my generation remember John Madden as the best color analyst ever. If Pat Summerall and Madden were calling your game, you knew it was a big freaking deal.\n\nTurns out, Madden was a pretty great NFL coach, as well. Madden has the highest winning percentage (.759) of any coach with at least 10 years of service. Yep, better than Vince Lombardi (.738). His best season came in 1976, when the Raiders defeated the Vikings in Super Bowl XI to finish with a 16-1 record.\n\nTecmo Bo\n\nThat's right: John Madden isn't the only video game legend associated with the Raiders. \"Super Tecmo Bowl\" Bo Jackson was the best:\n\nNot enough credit\n\nAny time I see Marcus Allen, I always joke with him that his brother (and CFL legend) Damon Allen should be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Then Marcus gets super serious and says, \"But you know who should? Tom Flores.\" He's right. Flores was a true pioneer as the NFL's first Hispanic starting quarterback and first minority head coach to win a Super Bowl. But he was so much more. Flores has more Super Bowl titles than Madden, with Flores' 1980 Raiders becoming the first wild-card team to win a Lombardi Trophy. In fact, Flores is the only eligible NFL coach with two Super Bowl wins not in the Hall of Fame. This man deserves a bust in Canton -- no questions asked.\n\nPlunkett deserves the same consideration. I could make the case for him. But I'll cede the floor to Ron Rivera, who had this to say when recently asked if there is someone who immediately comes to mind as a deserving Hall of Famer:\n\n\"Jim Plunkett. Without a doubt in my mind, Jim Plunkett. I mean, two-time Super Bowl winner, No. 1 draft pick, Rookie of the Year (UPI's AFC ROY), NFL Comeback Player, Super Bowl MVP,\" Rivera said on the Talk of Fame Network. \"I'm a huge fan. I really am. I thought he was in the Hall of Fame for the longest time until I got into a discussion with someone who said, 'No, he's not in.' I said, 'What?!' So I looked it up and he's not in.\n\n\"If you go back and you look at Bob Griese's numbers ... Now remember, the undefeated season, Griese didn't play most of those games. And again, not to disparage Bob Griese, because he is a great quarterback. But I'm just looking at who I would compare. And to me, I know it's tough and I understand there are certain things about it, but this, to me, is a guy that just ... I mean, to me, he was a great role model.\"\n\nDon't ever bring up\n\nThe Tuck Rule. Just my typing of those words gave Amy Trask chills.\n\nWell lookie there @sportingnews - two hands on the ball - howzabout that - oh, I will add that when I tweeted my thoughts, I did so nicely. https://t.co/bzEAK15TmP â Amy Trask (@AmyTrask) July 14, 2017\n\nLet me quickly add: Amy is the best. Follow her on Twitter if you don't already.\n\nSide note: This is one thing Al never gets credit for. He hired Amy as CEO of the Raiders in 1997. Yes, 1997. (Wow, I wish I could all-caps 1997.) Al was so ahead of his time in so, so many ways.\n\nOne more note on The Tuck Rule\n\nOops. Sorry. Bringing it up again. But this is important, to help you millennials understand how revered (maybe reviled) the Raiders were. Folks (like me) were happy the Patriots won that game. Happy. For the Patriots.\n\nNowadays, it feels like the Patriots are the Evil Empire. And the Raiders could be the Rebel Alliance. Ah, man. Let's move on.\n\nWay overrated\n\nThe Tuck Rule loss. You wouldn't have beaten the Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI. So maybe it's time to let it go. Amy, I say this respectfully. And hi! Although the Post-Apocalyptic Zombie Los Angeles Super Bowl would have been a world of fun.\n\nHipster jersey\n\nI'm going with Cliff Branch's No. 21. The NFL was different in the 1970s, when speedsters were just starting to become all the rage. Branch was one of those pioneers. He was a big-time player who thrived in the spotlight, scoring three touchdowns over the Raiders' three Super Bowl wins. And he was a regular Mr. Monday Night, flourishing in an era when the Raiders were seemingly unbeatable on \"Monday Night Football.\"\n\nClosing fun fact\n\nAl Davis stepped down from the Raiders in 1966 to serve as commissioner of the AFL. Shortly thereafter, Davis felt a group of AFL owners sold him out by negotiating the AFL-NFL merger. And that is part of the reason why Davis was such a maverick of an NFL owner.\n\nFinal snap\n\nI never thought I would ever advocate being a Raiders fan, but here we are. I was on the wrong side of the Raiders/Rams rivalry in Southern California, and I'll be honest when I say I never really cared for the team. I guess we can say I've evolved.\n\nFor starters, there is so much to love on this current roster. Marshawn. DC. Mack. Dude, I've yet to even mention Amari Cooper. So if you're looking to jump on board with a good team that is ready to make the leap, there isn't a better option.\n\nAnd I'm sorry, Oakland fans, but I can't tell you how much I love the idea of the Las Vegas Raiders. This is going to be so great. There is going to be a great fan base in the 702 -- because there already is one. I hate to break this to you, but Las Vegas is like an actual city. They have grocery stores, big-box retailers, schools and everything. I mean, there is even a stoplight or two! It's crazy. And then, the SoCal fans are going to be there (especially from the 951 and 909). Fans from opposing teams are going to make the trip every year (particularly AFC West rivals). Honestly, the NFL is going to wonder why it didn't hit Vegas sooner.\n\nIf I'm going to real talk you right now, I'll admit that the Raiders would be on the short list if I were legit looking for a team to follow. Hell, my sister isn't even the black sheep of the family anymore for her Raiders fandom.\n\nFollow Adam Rank on Twitter @AdamRank.",

  "latent_10189": "The Lexus IS 250C has been with us for a long, long time and the convertible is due for a reboot soon along with the rest of the range, heralded by the new model unveiled at Detroit motor show this week.\n\nMeantime, to help keep sales bubbling, and capitalise on the success of the F-Sport trim level – which takes up 30 per cent of IS sales -- there is now an IS250C wearing the F badge on the front quarter panels.\n\nWith the F-Sport adding some visual and chassis changes it is a genuinely different car – not as distanced as, say, BMW's M Sport packages, but enough for us to have another look.\n\nVALUE\n\nThe IS250 F-Sport sits in the middle of a three-tiered convertible range. The IS 250C Prestige kicks off at $76,800 while the $94,800 Sports Luxury puts $13k of clear air between itself and the $81,800 F Sport.\n\nThe headline items on the F Sport include sat-nav, Bluetooth, reversing camera and front and rear park assist, LED daytime running lights, Xenon headlights, new grille and front bumper and graphite 18-inch alloys.\n\nAll are powered by the same 2.5 litre V6, good for 153kW and 252Nm of torque. Combining variable valve timing and direct injection, the powerplant is properly Lexus - revvy, but so, so smooth.\n\nThe interior also benefits on the F-Sport - silver stitching on the leather, sports pedals, a new roof lining and unique seat and dash trim. The seats themselves are electrically operated as is the steering wheel, which adjusts for reach and rake. The seats have three memory positions, which also store the steering wheel position. The front seats also score heating and cooling.\n\nOur test car also had the active cruise control and pre-collision safety system, which is standard on the Sports Luxury. The same enhancement pack brings the 12 speaker Mark Levinson stereo with bluetooth and USB connectivity, adding $4615 before luxury car tax.\n\nThe IS250 benefits from Lexus' 48-month/100,000km warranty and as a Lexus owner, you'll never need to darken a dealer's door again - as long as you own the car, the company will fetch it from you when it requires a service. Alternatively, if you so choose, Lexus will supply a loaner while your car is serviced. You won't get that as \"standard\" from the European marques.\n\nVolvo's folding hardtop C70 T5 is as close as you'll get for a genuine competitor. The T5S starts at $61,950 and packs Volvo's characterful (and thirsty) Ford-sourced 169kW turbo five cylinder. It's as slow as the Lexus, uses more fuel and is not a sharp drive.\n\nThe T5 (yes, the pricier version has a shorter name) adds full leather, different steering wheel and stereo and adds adaptive headlights and Volvo's renowned safety innovations. Both block and parry each other for specification items but the Volvo's newer design is more coherent.\n\nThe fabric-roofed BMW 3 Series Convertible range starts at $81,318 for the 320d. Developing 135kW and a muscular 380Nm of torque, the diesel will carry you to 100km/h in 8.4 seconds and a combined fuel figure of 5.1l/100km. You will need to tick a few boxes before achieving the same spec level as the Lexus but there's also a lot more stuff to choose from.\n\nAfter-sales service doesn't come close to matching Lexus' generous offering and, like the IS, the E93 is soon to be sent on its way. Audi's A5 Cabriolet is Audi's closest contender, which starts at $77,779 for a 125kW 1.8 TFSI litre petrol engine, and that's before the addition of the F-Sport equivalent, the S-Line. The A5 bests the Lexus' fuel figures, but struggles with rather less power.\n\nIt also has a fabric roof and substantially less equipment. Like the BMW, many boxes will require ticking to match the Lexus' specification. The range stretches to the $100,108 3.0 TFSI quattro. A slightly left-field alternative is the sober Volkswagen EOS which starts at a tick under $50,000 for the 103 TDI and just over that mark for the 155TSI.\n\nDESIGN\n\nThe IS 250C was introduced at the 2008 Paris Motor Show and…well, is showing its era. From front bumper to the A-pillar, the 250C is as elegant as its gracefully ageing sedan sibling (introduced in 2005), or would be were it not for the tacked on plastic pieces that form part of the F-Sport package.\n\nFrom top of the windscreen back -- and with the roof up -- it looks slabby and a bit of a mess. The roof's arc doesn't gel with the rest of the design or identify well with the sedan, and the result is ungainly. The wheels look too small and the accommodation for the folded roof called for a rising beltline that magnifies the boot's size and deck height. Lexus designers have tried to disguise the rump by increasing the size of the rear lights.\n\nOnce the roof is folded away, the proportions do improve, but it's impossible to hide that very high-set backside. Another sign of the IS250C's age is that the car must be stationary before you can fold or unfold the roof, while many rivals allow a gentle pace to be maintained during the roof's operation.\n\nBeing a Lexus, fit and finish is exceptional. Even on this older design, everything is tight and the paint is beautiful. The roof's folding operation barely makes a sound and what little you do hear are reassuring clicks, clunks and whirrs. Materials in the cabin are like any other Lexus, with soft-feel plastics and supple leather on the seats.\n\nIt's clear the dash wasn't really intended for a convertible as the central screen is angled the wrong way -- with the roof stowed, sunlight reflects into your eyes and obscures the screen. The main dials, though, are super-bright and set deep into the dash.\n\nThe 250C could kindly be called a 2+2. There is no centre seat in the rear and passengers would have to be of the short, tolerant variety, with cropped or no hair to suffer the strong buffeting from the wind at speed.\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nThe IS250C shares the 2.5 litre V6 with the sedan. Despite its advancing years, there are few engines that match it for smoothness and refinement. Direct injection and dual variable valve timing help the unit to 153kW at 6400rpm and 252Nm of torque at 4800rpm.\n\nThe car needs every last kW and Nm, however, as it weighs in at a portly 1700kg. Missing is stop-start for fuel saving, which would be handy given its true thirst of 11.5l/100km. The IS350's 3.5 litre V6 is not available in Australian-delivered convertibles.\n\nSAFETY\n\nSix airbags, including two kneebags (in lieu of curtain airbags) are fitted to the IS250C. Active safety features include ABS, brake force distribution, traction control and stability control. A rear-facing camera is essential and, thankfully, standard on the IS250C - you can't see a thing behind you and it's almost impossible to judge where the elephantine rear ends.\n\nDRIVING\n\nWith the roof up, the IS250C's on road dynamics are not far at all from the 250 sedan's. The overall road manners of the F-Sport are, if anything, an improvement despite firmer springs and dampers and bigger wheels. The F-Sport chassis tweaks reduce roll and introduce a little more discipline.\n\nThe 250C's rear-wheel drive dynamics are still apparent, but the extra weight of the 250C's bracing blunt the handling. Turn-in is a little woolly and it understeers a lot earlier than you might expect. With the roof folded away, things begin to deteriorate.\n\nWhile it's no Saab 900 convertible (which had all the structural integrity of Rolf Harris' wobbleboard) the steering column shakes in corners and over sharp bumps and ridges in the road. It's not encouraging, but nor does it ever lose composure.\n\nThe giveaway that the chassis isn't coping is the way the front tyres sound like they're struggling for grip even at low speeds, trying to keep everything on the straight and narrow. Then again, chucking an IS250C through corners is missing the point.\n\nIt's far more of a boulevardier, a car you buy to carry you between fun things while letting you have fun on the way. It's far more enjoyable if you ease off and let the car dictate your pace. Through it all, however, the ride is impeccable, even with the F-Sport's firmer disposition. It suits the character of the car perfectly without letting things get out of hand.\n\nThe engine struggles with the extra weight but, like a good butler, never lets you know it's under pressure. The transmission is sometimes a little jerky on the upshift, but only under a more-than-moderate throttle or after an abrupt lift-off. The six-speed transmission can be actuated with steering wheel mounted paddles that are actually nice to use.\n\nWhile the gearbox claims to be intelligent, it takes too long to drop a gear or two on steep descents. This is a problem while using cruise control as you can't depend on the car to stay near the speed you've chosen, requiring your intervention to slow the car.\n\nThe electric power steering system is well-suited to the car, but keen drivers will notice a lack of feedback. Our test car was fitted with Active Cruise Control, part of the Enhancement Pack. This option is a double-edged sword -- you won't have to monitor the car in front but it lulls you into a state of apathy -- you'll occasionally peer down and realise you're dawdling along much slower than the speed you've set because you're behind a slow-moving vehicle. It's far more useful in urban motorway traffic rather than outright freeway cruising.\n\nVERDICT\n\nThe IS range is not long for this world but for most buyers, it's hardly an issue. As a relaxed cruiser and almost-practical coupe, the IS250C is hard to beat as long as you aren't expecting class-leading anything.

  "latent_10338": "Some people are fans of the Buffalo Bills. But many, many more people are NOT fans of the Buffalo Bills. This 2016 Deadspin NFL team preview is for those in the latter group. Read all the previews so far here. And buy Drew’s new book here.\n\nYour team: Buffalo Bills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour 2015 record: 8-8, defending Stanley Cup Champions. Although your average Bills season is best measured not by wins and losses, but by parking lot fatalities.\n\nI don’t even pay attention to the Bills on the field anymore. All the action is in the stands and the concourse, amigo. While Tyrod Taylor is uncorking a whopping 12 passes per game and the kicker is nailing himself in the fucking face, these fans are getting busy in the bathtub lab, manufacturing their own homegrown brand of Siberian excitement. We got hand-to-ass action!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe got slap fights!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe got cocaine, aka WHITE SNOW!\n\nWe got condiment orgies!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe got barf!\n\nWe got backyard rasslin’!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, of course, we got straight-up fucking!\n\nShort of winning the Super Bowl while playing in the nude, there’s nothing this team can do to upstage its own fans. Even LeSean McCoy getting in nightclub fights can’t gin up as much attention. This is a sad and hopeless franchise. What better way for fans to deal with it than by ignoring them and living inside their own drunken hallucinations? I salute these pathetic losers for finding an alternative outlet for their grief: hurting themselves on camera so that strangers on the Internet can watch. Sammy Watkins has you guys nailed:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe truth hurts, unless you’re already 30 Labatts into the morning.\n\nYour coach: OW-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, that’s right. The boys are BACK. Rex and Rob Ryan have finally joined forces to create the ultimate shit-talkin’, penalty-flaggin’, clock mismanagin’ team in football. Yes, you’re going to lose 10 games, but you’re gonna be loud as hell when you do it. Last year alone, this team was called for 18 penalties against the Patriots (14 accepted for 140 yards), and another 15 against the Eagles (105 yards). Playing for Rex Ryan means you gotta work twice as hard to get half as much yardage.\n\nLike the fanbase that somewhat worships him, everything about Rex Ryan seems cool, but is not. It breaks my heart to tell you this, because I’ve loved Rex Ryan for a long time. But deep down, I know the truth: He’s a shitty coach, and he’s not THAT different from your average dipshit redneck football lifer. Here’s all the proof you require:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor every awesome thing Rex does, he does something else to negate it. He hires the first full-time female coach in league history, then gets in bed with Donald fucking Trump. He hands the offense over to Tyrod Taylor, then lets the front office lowball him all offseason. He gives the media great copy that they lap up like housecats, but then he forbids tweeting at practice. He supports his players, but then lets the team put out THIS ridiculous statement lighting into Marcell Dareus for his weed suspension. He trolls other teams by choosing gimmick captains, and then fucking loses to those same teams.\n\nRex’s only professional highlights come when he temporarily prevails over personal rivals: the Jets, the Patriots (although coming within 10 points of them counts as a moral victory to him), the refs, sensible timeout usage, etc. He’s that college coach telling you that your Rivalry Week game will redeem your 0-10 season. He’s a deluded retread, and I wish he were better than that. He can’t even beat New England when he gets a phantom whistle going his way. It’s sad shit.\n\nYour quarterback: Tyrod Taylor, who just got handed the Kaepernick Escape Clause deal by his own team. They have about as much faith in him as I have asking my son if he washed his hands. Also, you’re only one bad snap away from THIS…\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF\n\nYou know EJ will be back out there at some point. You’re destined to get a black QB like Tyrod hurt when you ask Richie Incognito to block for him.\n\nWhat’s new that sucks: I hope you have a fetish for injured rookies, because Shaq Lawson has already had shoulder surgery, and Reggie Ragland just had his ACL piledriven through a folding table. Elsewhere, Karlos Williams got handed the same four-game snack break that Dareus got, which means the coaching staff will have even more excuses to grind McCoy into sausage meat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou see how this works, right? The Ryan boys put up the illusion of good times while the team has already crumbled. They may as well be playing with one hand tied behind their backs.\n\nWhat has always sucked: Doug Whaley! He’s still here! Jesus. Yes, the man who secretly cut Fred Jackson and openly admitted that humans shouldn’t be playing football is the man in charge of this mess. I find it odd that the Bills have a new owner that is adored by locals—mostly because he hasn’t had a chance to fuck them over yet—and yet that owner has left intact pretty much everything awful about the Bills: same shitty stadium, same shitty Buddy Nix protégé running the ship, same procession of failed recycled coaches. It’s like they were never sold. Trump would have at least added fake brass toilets.\n\nOne more thing that always sucks: Rex, on his old lady’s feet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat might not suck: CARDALE! He’s here! Sure, he’s got the lumbering throwing motion of a Scottish caber tosser, but still! Tell me you don’t wanna see him out there. I’ll shit in my popcorn if he makes an appearance this season.\n\nLet’s remember some Bills:\n\nFred Smerlas\n\nNate Odomes\n\nPete Metzelaars\n\nJeff Tuel\n\nSam Cowart\n\nHear it from Bills fans!\n\nMatt:\n\nWe’ve had more people fall from the top deck at Ralph Wilson Stadium than wins in the playoffs over the last 16 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristopher:\n\nEven Cleveland has a championship now.\n\nTimothy:\n\nThe last time we had a home prime time game, two people died. Our home opener is a Thursday night game against the Jets. Shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJake:\n\nA couple years ago the Bills booked a private screening at a theater I was working at. They called ahead of time and ordered 100 bags of popcorn. We spent the hour before they arrived popping a shit ton of popcorn and bagging it, so that when they showed up we could hand it out and get them into the theater as quickly as possible. Keep in mind, popcorn stays fresh FOREVER and this stuff was still warm when the team arrived. Sure enough, the very first player through the door dumped his bag out and asked for new popcorn because his wasn’t ‘fresh enough’. This led to THE ENTIRE TEAM doing this. I’ve never seen so much food wasted in my life. They swarmed the concession stand wanting fresh popcorn and ordering everything under the sun (one guy ordered 5 hot dogs for himself). I got to argue with several multi-millionaires who tried to haggle over slushie prices, had a certain star player cut in line and demand that I drop what I was doing to help him, and saw a rookie give my 16 year-old co-worker his phone number. They left a huge mess in the theater, which I would’ve had to clean up on my own had Doug Marrone not stayed behind to help me clean. I don’t care what people say about him, that man is a saint and he was right to take the money and run. I have no idea why I’m still a Bills fan. It’s a sickness. Fuck this mediocre team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDan:\n\nBelichick is going to create a scheme that allows a struggling Jimmy Garoppolo to shred our defense a new asshole in week 4.\n\nNolan:\n\nWestern New York combines the brains of the South, the culture of the Midwest, the hospitality of New England and the climate of Hoth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIan:\n\nOur longest-tenured coach since Marv Levy is Dick Jauron. Our longest-tenured QB since Jim Kelly is Ryan Fitzpatrick.\n\nJosh:\n\nRelevant reminder: The 2014 Bills finished 9-7 with Doug Marrone - a head coach that was so in demand that, when he voluntarily quit with two years remaining on his contract, his next gig was coaching the O line for the Jags. Jim Schwartz led the defense to finish 1st in sacks, 4th in yards allowed, and 4th in points allowed. Rex Ryan, lauded as some sort of defensive genius, showed up in 2015 and in his first news conference promised to, “build a bully.” The defense, with 9 of 11 starters returning, dropped all the way to 31st in sacks, 19th in yards allowed, and 15th in points allowed. The team finished 8-8. What did we do to make sure 2016 would be different? Bills 2016 Draft (* indicates pre-draft knowledge) Round 1 – DE that needs surgery* and will likely start the season on the PUP list Round 2 – Give up picks to move up and select an ILB that has an enlarged aorta* Round 3 – DT that was arrested trying to pay an undercover cop $100 for a blowie* Round 4 – QB whose ENTIRE college career totals are 11 starts, 15 TD, and 7 INT* Round 5 – RB who got busted for DUI between mini camp and training camp Round 6 – With two picks in this round, we take a WR and a CB despite having Watkins and one of the best young corner duos in Gilmore and Darby. Post-draft, the right side of our O line remains a ham sandwich and a “look out” block. Oh, but the fucking cherry on top? The Wolfman/Fatter Twin is now here to make sure the defense continues to decline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraig:\n\nEvery year my wife and I have a Bills opener party with our friends and family (Around 30-40 people attend). In 2014 the Bills opened in Chicago and ended up winning in overtime to start the season 1-0. I kid you not once the FG went through and Bills won, the celebration in our backyard might as well have been the equivalent of the Super Bowl being won. Champagne was being sprayed, people were running down our street with Bills flags it was crazy. To this day I’m not sure I have any other memory of my family being happy like that with the Bills. They finished 9-7 and missed the playoffs. This was a good year by our standards.\n\nDaniel:\n\nSince the Bills last made the playoffs, I’ve finished elementary, middle, and high school. I started and finished college, was gainfully employed for four years after college, and am currently interning after my first year of graduate school. The other day I bragged that the Bills just had back-to-back non-losing season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDylan:\n\nThe Buffalo Bills fan-base is so stupid and drunk (myself included) that we think everyone is laughing WITH us about the table smashing and face planting tailgate antics. We are a caricature of all utterly ridiculous, pathetic fan bases. We have no hope, yet every year the Buffalo sports media convinces us that THIS is the year we turn the corner.\n\nDan:\n\nLast season, during a Patriots extra-point attempt, in other words, immediately following a Patriots touchdown, the Bills committed a taunting penalty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndrew:\n\nNever forget:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris:\n\nWhen Buffalo played in Washington last season, my group and I heard a rumor that Scott Norwood was in the parking lot, so we drunkenly spent 15 minutes searching for him. We didn’t find him (nor could I have picked him out of a lineup anyway) but that was the highlight of the game: not finding Scott Norwood two hours before kick-off.\n\nAdam:\n\nI can still remember watching the Music City Miracle happen before my eyes. I was a happy, somewhat unassuming 8-year old, watching the game at a friend’s house (the type of jerkoff who you feature on this very website for lighting himself on fire at a tailgate... he’s now in jail). As Derrick Mason crossed the goal line, my friend’s white-trash father finished his (probably fresh) beer, gently setting that empty can down, and walked out their front door without saying a word, his eyes staring vacantly into the abyss. A part of my innocence died that day.\n\nBabatunde:\n\nIf you were to substitute face paint for Zubaz pants you would not be able to tell the difference between a Bills tailgate and a Gathering of the Juggalos. Starting next season, Bills fans may have to specify which Clinton was President the last time they were in the playoffs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUZ:\n\nFuck Doug Marrone with a rusty, splinter-filled barrel. (And then send him over Niagara in it.)\n\nReid:\n\nI recently went into a Goodwill where I purchased a Doug Flutie jersey and “slightly imperfect” Hanes boxer briefs. I have a box of T.O.’s cereal with Josh Reed’s autograph on it.\n\nGern:\n\nI actually went out of my way to buy one of those fucking chicken-wing hats the other day. Fuck me. Hopefully someone RKOs me into oblivion before I can get inside the Ralph and puke on my Zubaz. Also, this:\n\nShawn:\n\nThey missed out on a golden opportunity to clear some serious acreage of dilapidated neglect and shame back when Ebenezer Wilson died. The mayor should have seized the team in the middle of the night and traded them to LA in return for their next devastating earthquake. With some sweet federal disaster relief cash and all kinds of One Buffalo love from the nation on Facebook, who knows what you could build? Maybe a grid-based infrastructure? Ever check out our streets on Google Maps? It’s Dark City, man. It looks like it was inspired by the web spun by a spider sucking Schnapps out of a bowling ball thumb hole and later given to Jackson Pollack to ink. There’s no hope for Buffalo in its current manifestation. It’s such a total loss that its only humane and fully reasonable to root for a localized apocalypse to act as a cosmic Atticus Finch to put the mangy dog out of its misery and hope the bison phoenix that rises from those ashes is the long awaited and becharmed Buffalo 3.0. (It burned down once already.) I say annex all the suburbs straight to and including Niagara Falls, condense it all into one municipality, build runways at the airport capable of landing something bigger than a damn jumpjet, and build a copy of Chicago’s CTA train system to unite it all. But what the hell do I know? I’m a Bills fan. My smoke detector is going off and I have a massive head wound. After all that, why the Bills suck in 2016 has first and foremost to do with the simple fact that it’s helmed by a man with his head so far up his ass he’s chewing on his own goddamn teeth with a first mate who is a pear shaped glob of nepotism and molecularly rearranged crawfish corpses, both coaching a bunch of perennial Bad News Bears and Mighty Ducks rejects who are all perfectly and uniquely unqualified for the game of football. That’s why the Bills suck this year. Next year it will be because they ran the coaching staff out of town tarred and feathered after the inevitable trainwreck this year, leading to another 16 years spent twirling in the minor convection currents that spin off the main boiling mass of NFL parity. That middle of the road 6-10 record year in year out that alone guarantees a roster of draft busts, flameouts and misfires to keep them comfortably mediocre and shamefully irrelevant in the national spotlight for years to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKyle:\n\nEvery time I think it cannot get worse, this team somehow finds a way.\n\nJustin:\n\nThere’s still a hole in the drywall at my dad’s house from the Music City Miracle. My preteen ears had never heard cursing like that before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas:\n\nOrchard Park is pressuring residents living around the Ralph to waive their 4th Amendment protections against search and seizure. The town is playing the terrorism card in the NFL’s fight against the residents living around the Ralph earning some money allowing fans to park in their yards. The one plus for living in the desolate neighborhood around the stadium is that eight days a year (seven during the years they were sleeping around with Toronto), you get to put a sign out front “Park Here $10\" or whatever and take in some Christmas money from the fans before they pile drive each other and urinate on your lawn. Now the town, totally because of terrorism and not because the team is clamping down on lost parking revenue, is creeping on those residents’ constitutional rights. This dovetails nicely with the town’s stiff disdain for Bills fans and “those people” And what about the terrorists? Based on Deadspin’s own reporting, Bills fans are the least likely group capable of terrorizing anything more than a folding table. Also, Rex hired Rob after finding no other takers, which I guess fits in with the tradition of nepotism in New York. Fuck Doug Marrone. OJ Simpson’s name is still up on the wall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike:\n\nHere is a comprehensive history of my memories as a Bills fan: 2002-2003: Bills miss playoffs. I’m really too doe-eyed and idealistic to remember much. They had a safety named Lawyer Milloy, which I thought was funny because his name was actually Lawyer. 2004: Need to beat the Steelers’ practice squad in a “win-and-you’re-in” scenario to make the playoffs. Still lose, and miss the playoffs. Think to myself that they will definitely get there someday, like within the next twelve seasons for sure. 2005: Kelly Holcomb might not be so bad! 2006: JP Losman actually might not be so bad! 2007: Trent Edwards might not be so bad! Later in 2007: the Bills lost another must-win game that could’ve gotten them into the playoffs. This time, they lost 8-0 to the Browns. I don’t know how many other teams can put “lost a must-win game to the Cleveland goddamn Browns where the Browns didn’t even score a touchdown” on their resume, but I’d venture to guess we’re the only ones. 2008: At least Kevin Everett can walk again. 2009: Ryan Fitzpatrick might not be so bad! 2010: Trade a promising young RB in Marshawn Lynch to Seattle partly due to a rap sheet. Watch him become Beast Mode, but hey at least we have CJ Spiller, right? No way we can mess that up. At least we’re done with dealing with an enigmatic running back’s legal troubles, and this definitely is not a thing we will be dealing with six years from now, I reassure myself while rocking back and forth in a corner. 2011: The Bills put up a huge comeback win over the Patriots in which Tom Brady throws four picks. This remains the single greatest moment I have experienced in my lifetime as a Bills fan, because the only thing that has ever brought me joy with this stupid team has been the three or so times the Patriots haven’t totally crushed the Bills into the ground while pummeling them in the groin with underinflated footballs. 2012: FUCK YOU CHAN GAILEY AOIDYHVOSHIFIVOUHVODU I FUCKIN HATE YOU FUCCCCCCCJKKK 2013: EJ Manuel might not be so bad! 2014: Kyle Orton might not be so bad! And hey, our defense is good! 2015: Rex Ryan completely fucked up what seemed to be an unfuckupable defense. Also, the realization has hit that our fanbase’s biggest rival is inanimate objects. Finally, here is a list of things I am looking forward to in 2016: -The Ryan Brothers installing a defensive system that somehow manages to incur 100 yards in penalties before the opening kickoff even happens. -Shady McCoy having a comeback year by leading NFL rushers in stats such as Cops Assaulted, Injuries Per Yard, and Orgies. -That feeling as August rolls around of talking myself into Tyrod Taylor like the drunk guy looking around a near-empty bar at 2 AM. -Knowing that once that fails, I’ll probably do the same thing for the QB that once boldly proclaimed about Ohio State that he “ain’t come to play school.” -That through all of this QB hubbub, Sammy Watkins will run a perfect route and practically stand there wide open yelling “HELLOOOOO! THROW IT TO ME AND LET ME DO SAMMY WATKINS THINGS!” while we watch the ball sail some 10 yards over his head. -Learning in Week 3 that Shaq Lawson’s knees are actually held together by a combination of popsicle sticks and lightly chewed bubble gum. -Running out of running backs by week 10 because they’re all injured, in jail, or both. -Knowing that there are only one of two outcomes to this season, as there has been every damn season I have followed this team: (1) the Bills start hot out of the gate and start looking like everyone’s dark horse postseason pick, capture the hearts and imagination of their entire fanbase, only to completely disintegrate by Week 9 and finish 7-9; or, (2) completely bumblefuck through September and early October, but then rattle off a ton of wins to be 7-6 and chomping at a playoff spot heading into Week 15. Then they lose 31-7 to the Browns and finish the season 7-9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrian:\n\nWe’re a year or two away from reenacting the Battle of Carthage in Orchard Park. It’s well known around here that the offseason is always a time of “THIS is the year!” positive thinking. Every draft pick is a star. Every contract signed won’t possibly backfire. That’s why the LeSean McCoy beating up cops thing was that much more hilarious. The story literally broke the morning after the Super Bowl, aka the first goddamned day of the offseason. It’s also appropriate that Rex Ryan is this team’s coach. He’s the perfect mouthpiece for a delusional fan base, and he’s a Trump supporter, which makes perfect sense. Both are underqualified for the jobs they seek or hold, never shut up, have head-scratching support, and will ultimately fail miserably, but they’re such a trainwreck that one can’t help but tune in along the way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeter:\n\nWhile I’m thankful the Pegulas bought the team and kept them in Buffalo, watching what they are currently doing to my Sabres makes me feel like I’m being rescued from the Titanic by the Hindenburg. We gave up a first round draft pick to draft Sammy Watkins without a real quarterback, which is sort of like a man with no arms splurging on a samurai sword.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdam:\n\nLots of teams could hire a coach, call him a “defensive mastermind,” then have the defense regress from 4th in the league to 19th or so. But it takes the Bills to then blame that entire slide on a single player who was being forced to play a style contrary to his own (Mario Williams, for those that don’t know) and follow that up with the hiring of another “defensive mastermind” who is, essentially, the 21st best defensive coordinator in football. Lots of teams can make some contract decisions that push them right up against the salary cap. But it takes the Bills to spend that much on “talent” and end up at 8-8, forcing a massive player sale. Lots of teams have shitty fans. But it takes the Bills to make a fan base so existentially nihilistic that they would rather give themselves alcohol poisoning in the parking lot than actually enter “The Ralph.” Speaking of which, after the game I would guess that 112% of all surfaces in Orchard Park will be covered in vomit. Pretty much the only part of the Bills that isn’t the worst is the owner. Of course, that’s more a damnation of the NFL in general, because the owner is a self-serving asshole who made his money fracking before it was outlawed in New York. But the fans here love him because he “kept the team here.” Like anywhere else would want this shitheap of a team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevin:\n\nFuck you to my parents for moving from Rochester to Buffalo three years before I was born. If I lived in Rochester I might have been spared and found a better use of my time than caring about professional sports in the Industrial Northeast. Fuck you to Jim Overdorf for being a fucking fraud and a tight ass who is afraid to spend any money. Fuck you to Ralph Wilson for being a cadaver with a football team for the last decade of his life and running Bill Polian out of town. Lastly, fuck you to me for buying season tickets this year. I can’t wait to see how the Bills turn this extremely talented roster into a 7-9 disaster. Black Tar Heroin is a wiser investment of my time and money.\n\nDan:\n\nIf someone asked me if I would consider taking anyone under the age of 16 to Ralph Wilson Stadium on game day I would kindly tell them no fucking way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdam:\n\nSubmissions for the Deadspin NFL previews are now closed.

  "latent_10463": "Chicago-based mega-law firm Kirkland & Ellis hired corporate lawyer Andrew Calder away from the competition two years ago to open the global firm’s Texas operation.\n\nArmed with a blank check and the charge to build a first-class outpost in Houston, Calder has enticed 65 attorneys to join him so far. Twenty more are scheduled to join this fall.\n\nPremium clients, including Dallas-based Energy Future Holdings and private equity giants Blackstone Energy Partners and KKR, quickly signed on. Revenue in Texas went from zero to $64 million during the last 26 months and will easily pass $100 million this year, according to legal analysts.\n\n“We have been so busy in Texas that we’ve had to bring in lawyers from other offices to meet the demand,” Calder said. “The key has been to put together a team of young, hungry lawyers who want to dominate the market in their practice areas. The firm’s goal is to be a major player in the Dallas and Houston markets.”\n\nKirkland, which has 1,700 lawyers and $2.3 billion in revenue in 17 offices worldwide, is Exhibit A in a seismic shift that is underway in the Texas legal market — a shift that is radically changing the practice of corporate law in the state forever.\n\nA new Texas Lawbook study of legal industry finances in Texas shows that elite, wealthy corporate law firms — most of them based outside the state — are achieving enormous financial success by stealing the best lawyers and the highest-paying business clients from large, full-service, legacy Texas law firms.\n\nAt the same time, dozens of national and regional law firms, including many that focus on upper middle market corporate clients in the health care, manufacturing, retail, technology and transportation sectors, have expanded into Texas and captured more than $1 billion in legal fees from longtime indigenous law firms in 2015 alone.\n\nAs a result, many old-line traditional Texas law firms that once dominated the state are fighting for survival as their market shares plummet. They are almost helpless as their best young talent flees to wealthier competition and longtime clients shift their allegiances to the elite firms.\n\n“A generational shift in the legal marketplace in Texas is taking place,” said Rob Walters, managing partner of the Dallas office of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, one of those elite national firms. “The legal market is separating the haves from the have-nots. Rich law firms in Texas are getting richer.”\n\nThe Texas operations of 11 law firms generated revenue of $1 million per lawyer, a statistic widely viewed by the legal industry as a symbol of elite success. By comparison, in 2008, there were only two law firms that reported $1 million of revenue per lawyer and only four Texas firms that recorded revenue of $800,000 per attorney.\n\nThree of the 11 law firms are based in Texas. Baker Botts and Vinson & Elkins are headquartered in Houston. Akin Gump claims Dallas and Washington, D.C., as its primary residences.\n\nThe 11 elite firms generated $1.7 billion in revenue in 2015, according to Texas Lawbook data.\n\n“The wealthy, elite law firms have the money to hire away the best lawyers,” Walters said. “The best lawyers have the best clients. The best clients pay the most money, which means the highest revenues. And then the cycle starts all over again.”\n\nConfirming the trend\n\nThe Texas Lawbook survey confirms the trend. Financial data examining 35 large business law firms shows that:\n\nThe 35 largest corporate law firms operating in Texas generated $4.32 billion in revenue from their Texas operations in 2015, up 2 percent from $4.22 billion in 2014.\n\nSixteen of the 35 highest revenue-generating law firms operating in the state in 2015 are headquartered outside Texas, up from 12 in 2014 and four in 2008.\n\nTexas-based law firms generated $3.314 billion in revenue in 2015, up from $3.309 billion in 2014, which is an increase of less than one-tenth of 1 percent.\n\nThe Texas operations of the national law firms generated $1.005 billion in revenue last year, a 10 percent jump from the $909 million in 2014 and five times the $190 million in 2008.\n\nAnemic demand\n\nThe market shift started in 2010 but intensified in 2015, when oil prices plunged and mergers and acquisitions in the energy sector went from hot to cold overnight.\n\nThe overall demand for legal work by Texas businesses was “anemic” or essentially flat in 2015, said Matt Anderson, senior vice president and regional analyst for the Private Banking Legal Specialty Group at Wells Fargo in Dallas.\n\n“The legal industry in Texas is essentially treading water,” Anderson said. “The Dallas and Austin firms are faring better than the Houston firms.”\n\nAnd because legal demand is flat, industry analysts say there are only two ways to increase revenue.\n\n“You either need to raise the rates you charge clients or you hire partners with strong books of business away from competitors,” Anderson said. “As a result, the fight for good talent in Texas is fierce.”\n\nLaw firm leaders and industry observers say lateral movement by partners from law firm to law firm hit a record high in 2015. National law firms seeking to enter the Texas market often make multimillion-dollar compensation guarantees to prominent lawyers who have books of business that they can bring with them to the new firm.\n\n“This shift happened in other parts of the country a couple decades ago but skipped over Texas because the state’s legal market was considered insulated from outside intruders,” said John Wilmouth, a senior adviser for Citi’s private banking law firm group.\n\nAs a result, national law firms found the Texas market closed because lawyers would not leave their hometown firms.\n\n“Texas firms were historically hesitant to steal partners from each other,” said Jerry Clements, managing partner at Dallas-based Locke Lord. “But the lateral hiring frenzy has certainly hit Houston and Dallas now.”\n\nWhat changed?\n\nMany legal insiders point to a decision by corporate general counsel to stop hiring one or two large, full-service legacy Texas law firms to do all their legal work.\n\nInstead, prominent general counsels such as AT&T’s Wayne Watts, Exxon Mobil’s Jack Balagia and American Airlines’ Gary Kennedy began preaching a new mantra: “We hire lawyers, not law firms.”\n\nThat seemingly innocuous decision unknowingly put into motion a series of actions that triggered the law firm invasion.\n\nIn 2010, Latham & Watkins put the general counsels to the test by hiring seven prominent partners from Akin Gump, Baker Botts and Vinson & Elkins. Latham gambled that the corporate clients would follow its outside lawyers to their new law firms.\n\nAs history shows, it worked.\n\nLatham’s office has been hugely successful. The firm now has 85 lawyers in Houston, reports revenue per lawyer of $1.2 million and surpassed $100 million in revenue last year.\n\nOther national law firms quickly followed, as Texas lawyers who were once loyal for life to the law firm that recruited them now readily jump from firm to firm for more money.\n\n“A law firm’s No. 1 asset is its lawyers,” said Richard Krumholz, a partner at Norton Rose Fulbright in Dallas. “Every day those lawyers walk out the door, and every day we have to work hard to make sure they come back to work in the morning.”\n\nFeeling the effect\n\nSix of the state’s oldest and largest law firms — including Haynes and Boone, Locke Lord and Strasburger & Price in Dallas — saw the revenue from their Texas offices decline in 2015 from one year earlier.\n\nThree Houston-based firm were hit the hardest. Bracewell’s revenue in Texas sank 16 percent in 2015. Andrews Kurth and Vinson & Elkins saw their revenue and lawyer head count drop last year.\n\nOne Houston energy law firm didn’t survive. Just 18 months ago, Burleson employed more than 110 lawyers and had revenue of nearly $100 million. It closed its doors in December.\n\nNot all Texas law firms suffered in 2015. Thompson & Knight increased its Texas revenue 4 percent, while Jackson Walker and Gardere each grew revenue 3 percent. All three firms are based in Dallas.\n\n“The volatility in the Texas legal market is something all firms have to confront,” Thompson & Knight managing partner Mark Sloan said earlier this year. “The economy is a challenge. Changing client demands is a challenge. Holding on to our talent is a huge challenge.”\n\nNo Texas-based law firm improved more than Houston-based Baker Botts. Total revenue for the firm’s Texas operations skyrocketed 15 percent — from $338.5 million in 2014 to $388 million in 2015.\n\nBaker Botts also increased its revenue per lawyer to $1 million, which is 7 percent more than the year before, and secured itself a spot as one of the elite law firms.\n\n“We are witnessing a time when the practice and business of law is being challenged like never before,” said Baker Botts managing partner Andy Baker, who offices in Dallas and Houston.\n\nAnalysts say that national law firms continue to open outposts in Dallas and Houston.\n\n“Despite the issues with oil and gas, many more national and global law firms still want to expand into Texas,” said Kent Zimmerman, a law firm analyst with Chicago-based Zeughauser Group. “Texas is much more than just energy. It is an extremely thriving economy.”\n\nFor a longer version of this article, visit TexasLawbook.net.\n\nTop law firms\n\nHere are the top 35 law firms operating in the state based on their Texas revenue (in millions):\n\nRank Firm 2014 Texas revenue 2015 Texas revenue 1 Vinson & Elkins $442 $432 2 Baker Botts $338.20 $388 3 Andrews Kurth $258.60 $250 4 Locke Lord $254.60 $244.80 5 Haynes and Boone $239.50 $236 6 Norton Rose Fulbright $224 $230 7 Jackson Walker $214.50 $221.50 8 Akin Gump $213 $218.60 9 Winstead $192.50 $193 10 Thompson & Knight $183.30 $191.10 11 Bracewell $213 $179.40 12 Gardere $140 $144 13 Jones Day* $131 $140 14 King & Spalding* $100 $115 15 Latham & Watkins* $99 $105.60 16 Sidley* $80 $100 17 Strasburger $95.50 $90 18 Morgan Lewis* $77 $88 19 Greenberg Traurig* $80.60 $87.60 20 Baker & McKenzie* $84.10 $82.80 21 Fish & Richardson* $67.50 $80.70 22 Gibson Dunn* $73.70 $80.50 23 Kelly Hart $73 $76 24 Porter Hedges $74 $69 25 Kirkland & Ellis* $47.80 $64.10 26 Weil* $58 $61.30 27 Munsch Hardt $58.50 $60.20 28 Gray Reed $46.50 $50.30 29 KRCL $45 $47.50 30 Chamberlain Hrdlicka $50 $47 31 Mayer Brown* $42.90 $45.90 32 Winston & Strawn* $48.50 $45.30 33 McDermott* $21.60 $35 34 Alston & Bird* $21 $29.30 35 Polsinelli* $13.50 $25\n\n*Out-of-state firms\n\nSOURCE: Texas Lawbook\n\nThe graphic is not appearing on your browser.",
  "latent_10484": "The interception of two Russian Bear bombers off the south coast of England is the latest “show of strength” that could have dangerous implications, senior military figures tell Channel 4 News.\n\nWhy were two Russian long-range bombers flying off the coast of Cornwall on Wednesday? Reconnaissance? A dress rehearsal for an invasion? Or a basic declaration of war?\n\nFirst impressions seem concerning. The Russian Tupolev TU-95 bombers, known as Bears, are capable of carrying nuclear weapons – although they are not thought to have been carrying any in this incident.\n\nBoth bombers, while close to British airspace, had not yet entered it. When detected and escorted by the RAF, they complied then turned around and flew off north.\n\nIt is safe to say that this probably was not a declaration of war.\n\nIf not war, what?\n\nMore likely then, this was the latest military grandstanding by a country eager to keep the international community on its toes. As the peace process in Ukraine remains hanging by a thread, these manouevres are a throwback to the cold war. Brinkmanship rather than bombs.\n\nFor despite Wednesday’s events, Britain is hardly a stranger to probing Russian planes. UK jets have intercepted more than 100 Russian aircraft in 2014 as tensions between President Putin and the west intensified in wake of the security situation in Ukraine and the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 last July.\n\nJust over a fortnight ago two similar Russian aircraft flew over the English Channel. It was suggested that those planes were flying without their transponders turned on, making them invisible to civilian aircraft. A number of flights arriving in Britain had to be diverted to avoid potential disaster. British authorities were furious and summoned the Russian ambassador to explain the reasons for the mission.\n\nAbove: footage filmed by a Russian military newspaper appearing to show Nato jets surrounding a missile carrier.\n\n‘Typical probing mission’\n\nConservative MP Colonel Bob Stewart, the former chief of policy at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, told Channel 4 News that this latest flight was a “typical probing mission by a Russian military that are expanding rapidly”.\n\nSimilar manoeuvres were practised by both Russian and Nato military aircraft during the cold war, he says, and it serves more as a method to cloud judgement and create suspicion in the minds of military strategists.\n\nDr Andrew Foxall, director of the Russia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society, told Channel 4 News that the events were “deeply unsettling and another example of Russia’s ceaseless belligerence towards the west.”.\n\n“Essentially these exercises are designed to showcase Russian strength and western weakness. But there are wider factors too. Each time these manoeuvres are carried out, the Kremlin is effectively testing UK defence capabilities that include reaction times, the chains of command, how well our pilots are trained and what they’re able to do.”\n\nThat will be viewed more cautiously, with the relationship between Britain and Russia in flux. Britain, which along with other western leaders has imposed crippling financial sanctions on Russia, is also where the trial of murdered KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko has so far seen explosive testimony condemning Russia and President Putin.\n\nRecognising the tensions the British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon today said Russia poses a “real and present danger” to European security and that tensions between Moscow and Nato are “warming up”.\n\nAs the temperature rises, expect Britain to be less tolerant of these probing missions taking place perilously close to its own airspace.",
  "latent_10587": "For those of you still uninitiated with Interstellar, the new shrouded-in-secrecy film by genius and innovator Christopher Nolan, stop reading here. It is the personification of discovery, an eyes-wide-open love song that dares to ask what if and to open doors to places both new and unexpected. As Christopher Nolan himself has said to the press, this film, perhaps more than any other of his, relishes in its untold story. There are the expected Nolan twists and turns, but so much of the meat and bones of the story has been lovingly withheld that spoiling seems rude. Interstellar is in a constant state of evolution and metamorphosis, with distinct phases that differ in look, structure, and theme. Although Nolan recycles core sci-fi tropes, the context and presentation deepens and expands them past familiarity, using them as thematic devices that uplift and still surprise. The more familiar you are with the genre, the more you might see things coming (though there are some nobody will), but Nolan’s stellar triumph is in how he synthesizes his film’s many moving parts into a clear, absorbing gospel of time, life, and love. It’s an unfortunate mark of timing that Boyhood, an amazing film that mourns the uncanny delicacy of time’s passing, came out only a few months prior, since Interstellar chases a similar ambition less effectively but still with resonance. Nolan uses time like a Death Star, and it is terrifying.\n\nInterstellar is a profound evolution for Nolan not just as a filmmaker but as an artist. He plays with new forms of cinematic expression, has never been more confident or as audacious, and asks big questions while he finds increasingly stunning ways to wow. No film in 2014 is as joyously cinematic: Interstellar is worth celebrating.\n\nWhat I can say -- or rather what I will -- is this: Interstellar is a science fiction film taking place in a not too distant future. It’s science fiction in the classical sense, taking existing speculative science and spinning it into narrative orbit. Earth has become a planet-wide dust bowl with crops failing and the population on the brink of ruin. It’s a fatalistic vision of Earth’s future that, in the hands of a filmmaker known for his over-seriousness, shockingly becomes a fable of optimism and hope. Using the last resources on Earth, an expedition is set to travel through a newly discovered wormhole, with detailed plans to ‘test out’ multiple planets that can possibly sustain life. Grounding Nolan’s voyage between galaxies is a gorgeous father-daughter story that’s a metaphor for all human connection and love -- a huge statement that might seem like folly if it wasn’t brought to life by two amazing performances by Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy. I expected McConaughey to wow, and he’s better here than his Oscar-winning turn in Dallas Buyers Club, but I was pleasantly surprised at the nuanced and heartfelt performance by Foy-a rarity amongst child actors. The cast is excellent, namely Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway along with many others. They are the human heart in a film that could have been intellectually paralyzing, and they pump blood into Interstellar’s icy veins.",
  "latent_10589": "\"SATAN\" redirects here. For other uses, see Satan (disambiguation)\n\nvulnerability scanner for networks\n\nSecurity Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks (SATAN) was a free software vulnerability scanner for analyzing networked computers. SATAN captured the attention of a broad technical audience, appearing in PC Magazine[1] and drawing threats from the United States Department of Justice.[1] It featured a web interface, complete with forms to enter targets, tables to display results, and context-sensitive tutorials that appeared when a vulnerability had been found.\n\nNaming [ edit ]\n\nFor those offended by the name SATAN, the software contained a special command called repent, which rearranged the letters in the program's acronym from \"SATAN\" to \"SANTA\".\n\nDescription [ edit ]\n\nThe tool was developed by Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema. Neil Gaiman drew the artwork for the SATAN documentation.\n\nSATAN was designed to help systems administrators automate the process of testing their systems for known vulnerabilities that can be exploited via the network. This was particularly useful for networked systems with multiple hosts. Like most security tools, it was useful for good or malicious purposes – it was also useful to would-be intruders looking for systems with security holes.\n\nSATAN was written mostly in Perl and utilized a web browser such as Netscape, Mosaic or Lynx to provide the user interface. This easy to use interface drove the scanning process and presents the results in summary format. As well as reporting the presence of vulnerabilities, SATAN also gathered large amounts of general network information, such as which hosts are connected to subnets, what types of machines they are and which services they offered.[2]\n\nStatus [ edit ]\n\nSATAN has fallen from popularity after the height of its popularity in the 1990s. SATAN was released in 1995 and development has ceased. In 2006, SecTools.Org conducted a security popularity poll and developed a list of 100 network security analysis tools in order of popularity based on the responses of 3,243 people. Results suggest[3] that SATAN has been replaced by nmap, Nessus and to a lesser degree SARA (Security Auditor's Research Assistant), and SAINT.\n\nReferences [ edit ]",

  "latent_10659": "The unemployment rate is a measure of the prevalence of unemployment and it is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals currently in the labor force. During periods of recession, an economy usually experiences a relatively high unemployment rate.[1] According to International Labour Organization report, more than 200 million people globally or 6% of the world's workforce were without a job in 2012.\n\nGross domestic product (at purchasing power parity) per capita , i.e., the purchasing power parity (PPP) value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year, divided by the average (or mid-year) population for the same year.\n\nThose values are taken directly from the corresponding MISC index.\n\nThe price/earnings ratio (often shortened to the P/E ratio or the PER) is the ratio of a company's stock price to the company's earnings per share. The ratio is used in valuing companies.\n\nThose values are taken directly from the corresponding MISC index.\n\nDividend yield or dividend-price ratio of a share is the dividend per share, divided by the price per share.[1] It is also a company's total annual dividend payments divided by its market capitalization, assuming the number of shares is constant. It is often expressed as a percentage.\n\nStock Dividends Tax\n\nTaxes can eat from 0%, when properly managed up to ~60% of your profit when missmanaged. For an individual investor there are three applicable taxes which we will discuss in detail later on:\n\nWitholding tax: in most jurisdictions the country in which the company is domiciled in, witholds a tax upon distribution of dividends of said company to it's shareholders. It's shareholders may be you as an individual investor or in a more complicated case: a managment company (In the case of ETF's and Index Funds. More on that later)\n\nis domiciled in, witholds a tax upon of said company to it's shareholders. It's shareholders may be you as an individual investor or in a more complicated case: a managment company (In the case of ETF's and Index Funds. More on that later) Payroll tax: In edge cases dividends and capital gains may be taxed as normal income\n\nCapital gains tax: this is the tax imposed upon the amount won when selling an equity with a profit\n\nInvestor Tax Residence\n\nIn order to understand who and how taxes work, we will look at who and how owns an ETF in a complicated scenario.\n\nMeet Max: Max used to live in slovakia his whole life and be a tax resident there:\n\nBut he started working in Germany and spends 7 months of the year there. According to German Tax Residence Law Max is considered a Tax Resident of Germany now:\n\nGermany defines the breakpoint at 6 months and because Max reaches it, he pays taxes (Income, Dividend and Capital gains) to the German Govornment:\n\nBecause he is resident in Slovakia for less then 183 calendar days, he is not layable to pay any taxes there, according to the Slovak tax law .\n\nIn theory he could fall in two Govornment jurisdictions, although for that to be possible both govornments should have a small enough breakpoint for Max to be defined as a tax resident in both\n\nBrokers\n\nMax doesn't like German and Slovak brokers. He uses a Belgian one:\n\nEvery time he recieves a dividend payment he has to pay the dividend tax rate of the country of his residence (25%) to the govornment of said country: . His brocker being in Belgium has no effect on his rate. It does have an effect on who is responsible for that collection. If he had used a German broker, the broker would automatically collect the tax and send it to the German authorities. Now he has to do that himself, by submiting country speficif formulars.\n\nCorporate Tax Residence:\n\nMeet Royal Dutch Shell , incorproated in the Netherlands (it's tax Residence is there):\n\nWhetever a company decides to pay out dividends, it collects a percentage of the dividends as a dividend tax. in accordance to the tax rate of the company's tax residence country and the beneficiary tax residence in behalf of the govornment the company is a tax resident in.\n\nLet's take an example. Let's say Shell decides to pay 1€ worth of dividends to Max. Because Max has registered as a German citizen when opening his Belgian account, his broker knows his tax residence and transmits that information to the dutch govornment. The Dutch govornment now witholds 15% tax. As an example, Shell pays 1€ in dividend to Max, through his broker which let's the dutch Govornment know Max is a resident of Germany: Because the Belgium brokerage has no authority to withold any taxes of non-Belgian tax residents(neither should it), it just passes the sum to Max:\n\nDouble taxation treaties\n\nNow Max has to pay the govornment his 25% share. But Germany has a signed treaty with the netherlands in order to avoid double taxation. Because of that the German govornment recognizes the 15% that Max paid, and demands only the 10% left to add to it's own tax rate of 25%. In fact Germany always recognizes 15%, and in theory has a treaty with many nations, where an agreement is riched that the foreign nation should tax dividends up to 15%, so that the rest of the tax is owed to the German govornment (25 - 15)%. So we end up with the following chain:\n\nExamples from across Europe\n\nMax invests in Nestle (incorporated in Switzerland): And while in theory it should work that way, the Swiss govornment automatically witholds its normal 35%. You can submit a form in a lenghty process to get the 0.20€ (35 - 15)% the Swiss owe you in a lenghty process.\n\nMax invests in a Bulgarian company. Bulgaria has 0% witholding tax for EU citizens:\n\nA Bulgarian investor invests in Germany. The Bulgarian dividend tax rate is 5% (different from the witholding tax rate for non-residents). Bulgaria has a tax treaty with Germany(and most countries) allowing German authorities to withold 15% tax. Bulgaria also recognizes all foreign witholded tax, which lowers the tax due to the govornment to 0%.\n\nA Luxembourgian (15% dividend) invests in Bulgaria (0% witholding for EU)\n\nBulgarian (5% dividend tax, substractable) invests in Luxembourg (15% witholding)\n\nInvestor from Switzerland (35% dividend tax) invests in Slovenia (15% witholding tax)\n\nETF Dividends Tax\n\nBy buying an ETF an investor buys a share of a legal entity (different then a share of a company in most cases) which itself owns shares in companies and recieves dividends by them. The ETF then distributes(or not. some on that later) the dividends to the investors.\n\nBy ETF's a new very important variable enters the game: The ETF domicile. This domicile has 2 effects on our examples. Fortunately almost all of the European ETFs are domiciled in either France, Luxembourg or Ireland which makes the picture somewhat easier.\n\nETF Domicile: company witholding tax\n\nFor the purpouses of the witholding tax, the Govornment of the company the ETF holds witholds tax as if it was witholding tax from a resident of the country the ETF is domiciled in.\n\nMeet SPDR, domiciled in Ireland: SPDR owns Nestle with a weight of 2,78%: and Royal Dutch Shell with 1,51%: . Examples of these companies distributing 1€ of dividends is discribed below:\n\nBy distribution of dividends, the Swiss govornment trheats the Irish ETF as an Irish citizen so the Irish-Swiss treaty for dividend witholding tax applies. (which put's the maximum witholding tax at 15% instead of the 35% without a treaty).\n\nThe same thing happens in the Netherlands, but the treaty there doesn't help the ETF case since, the non-treaty tax-rate is still 15%:\n\nETF Domicile: ETF witholding tax\n\nRemember when we said that the ETF is a misterious \"Legal Entity\"? Well that misterious entity has a special status in Ireland and Luxembourg, making the respective countries withold 0% tax rate. The only other popular option for Europe: France makes no such distinctions and treats it like a normal company. A few examples:\n\nNote that to the point of view of the French govornment, the fund is a normal company distributing dividends and therefore 25% is taxed on top of those dividends (0.85€) and not the original value.\n\nETF Domicile: investor dividend tax\n\nThe chain now continues as if the fund is a normal company as seen from the point of view of the govornment of the investors tax residence.\n\nThe caveat is that the govornment doesn't see the taxes paid from the companies to the fund, and swaps a full tax to the fund, as it would to a company:\n\nHere Max pays the full 25% dividend tax to the german govornment on his 0.85 dividend income. He can't reimburse the dutch tax:\n\nAn example of the french govornment treating funds as if they are normal companies, but taxing only 15 % because the investor is a tax resident in switzerland Switzerland and France have a treaty. Switzerland then takes the rest (35 - 15) = 20% of the 0.85 euro left. (Because Switzerland has a 35% dividend tax rate)\n\nNote that the situation isn't realy any better for the investor with Luxembourgish / Irish domiciled ETF's. The only different is who the tax goes to.\n\nAn unfortunate investor from Slovakia didn't notice that Luxembourg doesn't have a tax treaty with Australia (to reduce the tax to the widely used 15%), so Australia taxes the fund at the full amount of 30%. He decided to buy Lyxor Australia (S&P/ASX 200) Luckily for him Slovakia has no dividend tax.\n\nAn even unluckier australian decided to buy an australian ETF but used the Lyxor one domiciled in Luxembourg. Because the fund is treated from the outside as a normal luxembourgian company, and Australia has no treaty the Australian govornment, it taxes him the full 30% (on the 0.70 euro profit).\n\nIf he had used an australian broker, that would kindly be done for him automatically, so he wouldn't even notice where half of his profit went:\n\nDistributing versus Capitalizing / Accumulating dividends\n\nSo far all of the examples shown were those with distributing dividends. So how are accumulating dividends different? Funds accumulating dividends just don't distribute the dividends to the investor but reinvest it in the company:\n\nMeanwhile the investor doesn't get any dividends. He just sees his fund growing in value (by all of the dividends):\n\nIn theory he avoids the 25% German tax. In practice many govornments still make him pay the tax on the redistributed dividends, out of his pocket: So the investor is left with + = worth of profit.\n\nBut there is a caveat. Let's assume the ETF has no natural growth for this example. All the growth comes from reinvesting of dividends. The ETF grew by . At some point max will want to sell the ETF (since the ETF is not distributing the dividends, that's his only way of making a profit). A capital gains tax of 25% will be witheld from Max because he made a profit. So when he sells Max is left with: But remember he paid 0.21 already in dividend tax from his pocket: + =\n\nWhen capitalizing dividends makes sense\n\nCapitalizing the dividends would make sense if:\n\nThe tax payer country has no dividend tax on capitalized dividends (so Max wouldn't have to pay out of his pocket) The capital gains tax is smaller then the dividend tax (of the taxpayer country) The tax payer is in a no dividend tax on capitalized dividends country and plans to move to a country with lower capital gains tax.\n\nAn example: Max, a Bulgarian investor has an accumulating fund. In Bulgaria, you pay tax only on dividends passed down to you, so he pays 0% dividend tax for the time being: Were max to sell his shares, he would have to pay the 5% capital gains tax on his accumulation: But if first Max decided to move to Slovakia, wait the time needed to be a tax residend there, and not be a tax resident in Bulgaria anymore (usually around ~6 months), he would have to pay capital gains taxses to the Slovak govornment, which is 0%:",
  "latent_10708": "Here’s one thing that I really love to eat: nachos. I’ve even written about them, and where to find the best ones in Vancouver, before. The thing I like most about homemade nachos, however, is that you can basically throw anything together from your fridge and add cheese and tortilla chips and you’ve got yourself a highly satisfying meal. This version of nachos, which I like to call Green Nachos because they have lots of green stuff on them, came together for just this reason.\n\nThe basic recipe came together when I was poor and lonely, living in Montreal, and watching the third season of Dawson’s Creek (the DVDs were left behind by a former tenant!). Let’s be honest: I was feeling like a total failure at life in comparison to the fictional Joey Potter who was so put together and with it at age 16. I was 22 and working for minimum wage at a bookstore (which I loved! But, I hardly felt destined for greatness). Anyway, seeking fuel to further my marathon, I looked in the fridge, found a bunch of green things like olives and green peppers and spinach, and put them on nachos with bits of feta, the only cheese I could afford. The result was quite salty, but did the job of subduing my malaise. Now, I have become quite a fan of adding green things to my nachos, and since St. Patrick’s day is coming up, how could I resist the temptation to share the final, perfected results with you?\n\nA couple of weekends ago, Kelsey and I visited the new Whole Foods store in Burnaby. The store was hands down amazing, and in the midst of an organic-goods induced consumerist frenzy, a slice of pizza with brussels sprouts caught my eye at the deli. Even though it was before noon on a Saturday, I had to have it, and have it I did. I nommed down on it hard and that pizza was truly one of the most delicious pieces of pizza I have ever had it. #noregrets\n\nAs you might have noticed by now, I am fully into classically unhealthy dishes that have been revised to include a good green veggie and do a little somethin’ special for your health, especially ones that do this without sacrificing on flavour.\n\nThese Green Nachos are inspired by that brussels sprouts pizza. Ever since I finished the slice, I have been wondering what other foods I can top with shaved brussels sprouts, and nachos, dear friends, are definitely one of them. They add the perfect crunch to something that is already crunchy, and a hint of bitterness which is not totally covered up with cheese. It’s complex. I like it.\n\nBut what makes these Green Nachos truly next level delicious is the quick pickled spicy radishes. Because I don’t include a regular sour cream & salsa combo in this recipe (which, by all means, you are totally welcome to do yourselves), the radishes add the tang and spice that a salsa normally would, and they cut the salt of the chips and cheese. They’re also just so pretty! The creamy avocado sauce is also a bit tart, depending on how much lime you squeeze in.\n\nThe colours of these Green Nachos just happen to naturally scream “SUMMER!” don’t they? I didn’t plan it that way, but I’m not surprised. Spring is out in full force here and I’ve got warm, lazy days full of share plates and beer on the brain.\n\nGreen Nachos + Quick Pickled Radishes + Avocado Cream 2016-03-13 21:13:15 Serves 4 Write a review Save Recipe Print Prep Time 45 min Cook Time 5 min Total Time 50 min Prep Time 45 min Cook Time 5 min Total Time 50 min Quick Pickled Radishes 1 bunch radishes 1 tsp red pepper flakes 1 tsp mustard seeds 2 cloves garlic 3/4 cup water 3/4 cup white wine vinegar (or apple cider vinegar) 3 tbsp maple syrup or honey 2 tsp salt optional: 1 tbsp fennel seeds, peppercorns, coriander seeds Avocado cream 1 avocado 1 cup water 1 cup fresh cilantro 1 lime 1 tsp Mexican child powder salt + pepper to taste Green Nachos enough tortilla chips to cover 1 layer on a baking sheet (I like the organic Que Pasa brand because they are not too salty!) 1-2 cups shredded white cheddar cheese (I respect that the amount of cheese that tops a plate of nachos is always a personal preference anyway) 1 tbsp olive oil 1 small onion or shallot 1-2 cloves garlic 1 tsp ground cumin 1 can (540 ml) black beans 8-10 large brussel sprouts 6-8 leaves Tuscan kale 1 lime salt and pepper to taste Quick Pickled Radishes Slice the radishes very thinly and place them in a glass jar. Sprinkle red pepper flakes, mustard seeds, and other optional seasonings on top (including whole garlic cloves). Combine water, vinegar, sweetener and salt in a small pot on high heat. Bring to boil, stirring occasionally, and remove. Pour the mixture over the radishes. Cover and refrigerate. The pickles will last in your refrigerate, if properly covered, for a few weeks, but consume within 5 days for maximum freshness. For Avocado Cream Combine all ingredients in a high-speed blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Cover and refrigerate. For Green Nachos Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Prepare a large baking sheet by covering with aluminum foil or a non-stick mat. Spread one layer of tortilla chips on top. Begin sautéing veggie/bean mixture by adding olive oil, sliced shallots, and garlic to a fry pan on medium-low heat. Saute for 3-4 minutes, until shallots are translucent. Add ground cumin and salt and pepper to the pan, mixing around until the shallots are coated in spice. Chop brussel sprouts into fairly small pieces, removing the bitter ends. Add to fry pan and saute for about 5 minutes, until it looks like they're wilting and about to get crispy. Rinse the beans and add them the mixture in the pan. Saute for 5 more minutes. Chop the Tuscan kale thinly and add to the mixture in the pan. Saute for about 2 more minutes, just until wilted. Squeeze the juice of one lime over mixture in the pan. Mix well and if more salt and pepper is needed, add it now. Scoop veggie/bean mixture onto tortilla chips. Cover with shredded cheese. Bake for 5-10 minutes, until cheese is sufficiently melted.

In just seven days, more than 6,000 people contacted the Vegetarian Society. A petition against the move was also signed by 40 MPs.\n\nNow the firm has apologised to all its veggie customers, and reverted to its original recipes.\n\n\"We underestimated the impact this would have,\" said Fiona Dawson, MD of the Mars snack business in the UK.\n\n\"The consumer is our boss... and it became very clear, very quickly that we had made a mistake, for which I am sorry.\"\n\nVeggies might have won this battle with Mars, but there are many more to be fought before they win the war to publicise animal products in all foods.\n\nHere are some of the other products out there which still contain these ingredients...\n\nKELLOGG'S FROSTED WHEATS\n\nTHIS cereal contains beef gelatine to glue the sugar to the wheat. Gelatine is obtained from the collagen of animals' connective tissue.\n\nPESTO\n\nSACLA green pesto, Cirio pesto sauce and other brands are made with real parmesan, which like the now-scrapped Mars Bars contains rennet from calves' stomachs.\n\nGUINNESS\n\nTHE black stuff is clarified with isinglass - a form of gelatine made from the air bladders of fish. It's only a minute amount but technically it's still a fishy pint.\n\nA vegetarian-friendly alternative used in some beers is Irish moss.\n\nAll German beers are also safe for veggies because of a law from 1516 which states their beer must contain only four products - hops, water, sugar and yeast.\n\nMULLER LIGHT YOGHURT\n\nSOME low-fat yoghurts contain gelatine. Muller Light yoghurts and Muller Vitality are made with gelatine, while Muller Rice and Fruit Corners are not. Muller is now looking into using veggie alternatives. Weight Watchers' citrus fruit yoghurts also contain the animal product.\n\nWORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE\n\nMANY people aren't aware that they are splashing fish sauce over their cheese toastie when they use Lea & Perrins.\n\nMade with anchovies, the firm won't be changing the recipe any time soon as it dates back 170 years to 1837. Bovril went veggie for about a year a while back, but then reintroduced the beef extract. Veggies can eat Marmite, which is made from yeast extract.\n\nBASSETT'S LIQUORICE ALLSORTS\n\nTHE red colouring E120 cochineal used in these sweets is made by extracting the red body material from pregnant beetles. It's also found in M&Ms.\n\nTOILETRIES\n\nMOST brands of soap and some toothpastes and mouthwash contain glycerine, which may have been produced from animal fat. If in doubt, look out for special veggie soaps and toothpastes.\n\nMAYNARDS WINE GUMS\n\nTHESE chewy sweets have gelatine in them, as do Waitrose Jelly Babies and some Haribo sweets. Other sweets with animal additives are Princess Marshmallows and Trident Splash chewing gum which contain beef gelatine.\n\nALCOHOL\n\nSOME wines have been clarified using isinglass from the air bladders of fish.\n\nWine can also contain dried blood and gelatine. Some Russian and Eastern European vodkas aren't suitable for veggies because bone charcoal may have been used in their production. Some whiskies are aged in sherry barrels which of course is a fortified wine and so may contain animal products.\n\nCAMPARI\n\nTHE red colouring gives it away - this tipple clearly contains cochineal.\n\nBASSETT'S SOFT AND CHEWY RASPBERRY MULTI-VITAMINS\n\nTHE raspberry flavour contains gelatine and cochineal, while the blackcurrant flavour only has gelatine.\n\nThe chewy vitamin C tablets and ACD&E vitamin orange flavour pastilles also contain gelatine.\n\nST IVEL ADVANCE MILK\n\nIT'S important to get those brain-boosting Omega 3 nutrients, but make sure you look at where they come from.\n\nSt Ivel Advance, with added Omega 3, says it uses fish oil because it's the richest and most readily-available source.\n\nFLORA OMEGA 3 PLUS MARGARINE\n\nFLORA says it uses plant-based Omega 3 in its spreads, but adds Omega 3 fish oil to this particular margarine.\n\nTHE REST\n\nWATCH out for chips that may have been fried in animal fat.\n\nAnd while most large bread producers use vegetable-based emulsifiers like E471 and E472, some local bakers may grease their tins with animal fat.",
  "latent_10821": "The Canada Infrastructure Bank is beginning to take shape, with the federal Liberals naming former Royal Bank chief financial officer Janice Fukakusa as the first chair of the board.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Parliament approved the creation of the new $35-billion institution, which Ottawa wants up and running before the end of the year.\n\nMs. Fukakusa retired from RBC in January after a 31-year career in banking. She is on the boards of several corporate and non-profit organizations, including Cineplex and General Growth Properties and is chair of the board of governors of Ryerson University.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nRead more: Case for Canada Infrastructure Bank 'not compelling,' researchers warn\n\nIn a news release on Thursday, the government said the appointment followed a merit-based selection process.\n\n\"Janice Fukakusa is a highly qualified and well-respected professional who will be able to guide the bank in delivering the transformational infrastructure projects that Canadians need,\" Finance Minister Bill Morneau said in a statement.\n\nThe government is counting on the bank to provide expertise in structuring deals with major private investors, such as pension funds, to launch large revenue-generating projects. Potential projects include public transit, transportation networks and electricity-grid construction.\n\nRBC chief economist Craig Wright, who has worked with Ms. Fukakusa for more than 20 years, praised the appointment.\n\n\"Janice is an extremely competent and capable individual who is the perfect candidate for such an important role,\" he said in an e-mail. \"With Janice as chair, the infrastructure bank is in good hands.\"\n\nIn an interview this week with The Globe and Mail, Infrastructure Minister Amarjeet Sohi said his department has a list of projects it intends to forward to the bank for consideration once the institution is operational.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"And there will be a process where other proponents can directly submit projects to the bank,\" he said. \"It would be my hope that once the bank is in operation, they will seek interest from various stakeholders and partners to identify potential projects.\"\n\nThe competition has closed for board of director positions with the bank. However, Ottawa is accepting applications for president and for CEO until July 21.\n\nThe bank will be headquartered in Toronto.\n\nMr. Sohi sent letters to the provinces on Thursday outlining Ottawa's expectations as it seeks to negotiate bilateral deals on how to spend a separate $33-billion over 11 years through traditional infrastructure grants. This money constitutes what Ottawa calls its second phase of funding.\n\nMr. Sohi has invited his provincial and territorial counterparts to a two-day meeting in September in Ottawa and said he wants all bilateral agreements in place by March, 2018, at the latest. Provinces, territories and municipalities already have access to funding announced under the first phase, as well as previously existing programs and automatic transfers from the federal gas tax.\n\nIn his Thursday letter, Mr. Sohi said second-phase funding will focus on projects that meet specific criteria. He said the program will aim to increase the rate of economic growth \"in an inclusive and sustainable way,\" improve the environment, boost mobility, make communities more inclusive and accessible and manage infrastructure sustainably.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAlso on Thursday, the Senate national finance committee released a report that urged the government to be more transparent about where the billions in infrastructure spending are going.\n\nAccording to the committee's research, the government has approved 6,194 projects worth a combined $13-billion through new infrastructure programs. However, the committee report said gathering details continues to be a challenge given that more than 30 departments or organizations are involved.\n\n\"A number of gaps remain regarding access to information,\" the report said. \"For example, our committee was unable to obtain details on 2,632 projects worth nearly $1.7-billion, as the departments and organizations responsible for them consider this information confidential.\"",
  "latent_10899": "Introduction\n\nThe Android platform has millions of users and is growing each day. With this growth so do the number of people that want to explore the platform by creating their own Android app. While a lot of those people are professional software developers, there are many that have little to no experience in developing and publishing software. This led me to write this series on creating your own Android app: “Creating your own Android app, from vision to reality”\n\nIn this series I will be covering the development cycle from concept to deployment. I Will give my recommendations on what steps you should undertake to get your app to the public.\n\nKeep in mind this series is meant to be a helpful guide and not a set of instructions that should be followed exactly step by step. Try out what steps work best for you and in the I hope you will have a software development cycle that gives great results.\n\nIn this post I will be covering the design stage. If you have not yet read the previous chapters I advice to read them first:\n\nPart 1 – Concept\n\nPart 2 – Planning\n\nI Hope you will enjoy reading the series as much as I have writing it.\n\n– Martin\n\nDesign\n\nIn the design stage you will finally get to see how your app is going to look like. You will sketch out your user interface and create mockups of the end product. If you have no designing experience this step might be a lot harder than it looks. Decide if you have the ability to create a nice looking user interface, do you have the creative skills or will it be better to outsource the work? A Good design will lift a fair app to good and a good app to excellent. The common mistake for companies that outsource the design is to try to get the job done for the least amount of money. I Cannot stress enough that you should not try to cut corners here, go with a good designer, ask for a portfolio and references.\n\nIf you do decide on tackling the design stage yourself and you are new to world of designing I can recommend the book “The Non-Designer’s Design and Type Books, Deluxe Edition”. The book is easy to read and shows simple design concepts with good examples. Even if you are not going to design your own app you might give this book a try since it is also very helpful when creating nice looking documents, business cards etc.\n\nJuhani Lehtimaki also wrote an excellent book on Android user interface patterns called “Smashing Android UI”. It’s a great book specifically targeted to Android user interface.\n\nMood board\n\nA Mood board will help you get the feel for your app. Just think about a good app you have installed on your phone or tablet, what is the feeling it gives you? It may be luxury or fresh and fun or maybe a business feel. A Bad app will not have a consistence feel, it will be a mess and a chaotic appearance. By making a mood board you can help narrow down the feel for your app. But before you start creating your mood board go back to the concept stage and think about your target audience. Your mood board should reflect and appeal to your users.\n\nCreating a mood board is easy. Get a big piece of paper, or a pin board, you can even make a digital mood board with any paint program. The goal is to get as many pictures or items on there that you want your app to reflect. To start I suggest to go out to your local book store and get some magazines. Think about your target audience, what magazines would they buy? After your trip to the local book store go and get some wallpaper samples, these usually are free and can help you find the right colors or textures for your user interface. When you are back with a bag full of stuff, get out some scissors and start cutting out images or texts you like and put them on your mood board. Don’t be afraid to replace images as you go through the process, this will create a better result in the end.\n\nSketches\n\nWhen designing user interfaces there is no replacement for quick sketches. They allow you to quickly scrabble down ideas and give a rough idea of how your app will look like. There are several way’s to make sketches, for example you can use print out templates. Juhani has published some templates on his blog:\n\nUI Sketching on Paper – Templates\n\nAn alternative to using pen and paper is to use a sketching application, there is a free online tool available here:\n\nAndroid mockup\n\nI Prefer to use pen and paper because it does not limit you in the available components, an other benefit of using pen and paper is that there is no need to learn new software, so anyone can join the process.\n\nCreating sketches of your interface is a quick way of deciding what works best for your app work flow.\n\nColor scheme\n\nEveryone who is going to design a user interface should be aware of color schemes. By using color schemes you can create a uniform look throughout your app and can also be used for creating a website or banners. The color scheme will also helps the feel of your app, it can be warm, cold or energetic. A Good way to start creating your color scheme is to go back to your mood board, find the essential base color and start from there.\n\nA Simple color scheme is usually created with five colors. You need a light color, a dark color, two accent colors and a highlight color. All colors should compliment each other, the two accent colors normally are close matches of the light or dark color. The highlight color is most likely to have a big contrast on the other four colors and should pop out from the rest. By sticking to your color scheme you will find that your can drastically improve your designs.\n\nMockup\n\nMockups are used to be an accurate representation of the final product. There is more skills involved in creating mockups that simple sketches. Some of the things you should consider when creating mockups are: Fonts, Colors (use the color scheme you created), positions, margin’s and icons. Use the sketches you made to start with a rough layout and work from there. You can try looking at apps you like and see what makes the user interface work well. Stick to your color scheme to create a nice uniform look while also use the Android design guidelines to make sure the app fits the overall look for the Android platform. The Android design guidelines can be found here:\n\nAndroid developers design guide\n\nHere is an example of a mockup I have created with the color scheme from the section “color scheme”.\n\nYou can use all kinds of software to create mockups. Some would like to use Adobe software like Photoshop or Illustrator, but you can use any other painting or vector tool. Taylor Ling has a great set made for Photoshop which you can download from his blog:\n\nAndroid ICS/JB Photoshop GUI design kit\n\nMockups of your app should be as accurate as possible, when working in teams or for a client the final app should be nearly identical to your mockups.\n\nResources summary\n\nThis is a list of resources mentioned in this post.\n\nBooks\n\nLinks\n\nUI Sketching on Paper – Templates\n\nAndroid mockup\n\nAndroid developers design guide\n\nAndroid ICS/JB Photoshop GUI design kit\n\nTill next time\n\nThat’s it for this post.

  "latent_11215": "A family shared photos with WSAZ Tuesday that capture the morning they say they were startled by an intruder. The homeowner took matters into his own hands.\n\nDeputies at the Johnson County Sheriff's Office say the homeowner held the suspect at gunpoint until officers arrived.\n\nIt happened Saturday morning in the Leander area.\n\nGerardo Canuto, 31, is charged with first-degree burglary, possession of burglary tools, alcohol intoxication, and carrying a concealed deadly weapon. Investigators say Canuto is in the country illegally.\n\nThe homeowner tells WSAZ that around 5 a.m. Saturday, he came downstairs to find an intruder crawling through his window. The victim lives in the 1500 block of Asa Creek Road.\n\nThat victim tells WSAZ he chased the intruder off with his walking stick.\n\nA few hours later, the homeowner found the suspect inside his barn. He isn't sure if the man was hiding or sleeping, but says he came out from behind the stacks of hay.\n\nThe homeowner ordered him to the ground. Then, he and a neighbor held him at gunpoint until deputies could get to the house.\n\nCanuto told investigators he had been drinking earlier when he got into a fight with his family. He said he wandered off looking for somewhere warm to sleep when he found what he thought was an abandoned cabin.\n\nHowever, deputies found a BB gun, ropes, a large flashlight and gloves inside a backpack that Canuto allegedly tossed inside the house before trying to crawl through the window.\n\nCanuto is also in the country illegally, according to investigators. They are not even sure if his name, address and other personal information are correct because they say he admitted his paperwork was not real. While his paperwork said he lives in Prestonsburg, Canuto told deputies he is from Pikeville, Kentucky, and was in Johnson County visiting family.\n\nDeputies have been in contact with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials. For now, he is in the Big Sandy Regional Detention Center.\n\n\"It's very scary when it first happens,\" said Special Deputy Lauren O'Bryan. \"You don't think it's going to happen to you, but it's best to always have a plan. Just kind of plan ahead to know where your gun is or where a weapon is that you can protect yourself with cause when people are breaking into your house, you never know what their intentions are -- if they're wanting to steal something, if they're wanting to hurt you or whatever. It's kind of like preparing for a tornado. You never know when it's going to hit, but eventually it can happen.\"\n\nNot only is O'Bryan an officer with the Johnson County Sheriff's Office, the victims are her aunt and uncle.\n\n\"It's hard for me to know my family is dealing with it and that I'm on this side of it,\" O'Bryan said. \"This is actually the second aunt that's been burglarized for me in the past two months. I had an aunt a couple weeks ago that had the same thing happen. They broke her window out and stole a bunch of stuff from her. Thankfully, this time they were home and they were able to stop them before anything bad happened.\"\n\nO'Bryan herself understands the fear of being a home invasion victim. When she was a teenager, someone tried to break into her house while she was home alone. The doors were locked and the would-be burglars didn't put much effort into it so they did not succeed at breaking in. However, O'Bryan remembers hiding in the laundry room, scared and armed with knives.\n\n\"Before I never even thought about being an officer, but after that it really changed me,\" O'Bryan said. \"It changed the way I thought about everything. That's what led me to this career path.\"\n\nNow, she is encouraging others to do what her uncle did -- protect themselves if someone threatens you at your home.\n\n\"If you're in fear for your life -- which they definitely were, he had a gun that they believed to be real at the time -- if you're in fear of your life like that you absolutely have the right to shoot somebody or hold them at gunpoint or whatever until an officer arrives,\" O'Bryan said.",
  "latent_11405": "Former president Bill Clinton angrily told Black Lives Matter protesters that they \"are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter,\" spending more than 10 minutes facing down the protesters at a campaign rally for his wife in Philadelphia. (Reuters)\n\nNear the height of the crime wave that blanketed the United States and suffocated D.C. in the early 1990s, The Post ran a front-page article about an 11-year-old girl named Jessica Bradford.\n\nBradford, the article began, \"knows five people who have been killed. It could happen to her, she says, so she has told her family that if she should get shot before her sixth-grade prom, she wants to be buried in her prom dress. ... She has known since she was in fifth grade what she wanted to wear at her funeral. 'I think my prom dress is going to be the prettiest dress of all,' Jessica said. 'When I die, I want to be dressy for my family.'\"\n\nA few days later, newly elected President Bill Clinton spoke at a black church in Memphis, Tenn. In the speech, he plugged NAFTA and healthcare reform. But he also focused on the country's crime problem, and mentioned the article about Bradford.\n\n\"The other day on the front page of our paper, the nation's capital, are we talking about world peace or world conflict?,\" he asked. \"No, big article on the front page of the Washington Post about an 11-year-old child planning her funeral: 'These are the hymns I want sung. This is the dress I want to wear. I know I'm not going to live very long.' That is not the freedom, the freedom to die before you're a teenager is not what Martin Luther King lived and died for.\"\n\nThe Kingsport, Tenn. Daily News picked up the Bradford story, running it against the comics page. (Kingsport Daily News)\n\nThe next year, Congress passed and he signed into law the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 -- a bill that, among other things, increased the number of people in prison and the length of their incarcerations.\n\nAs his wife runs to take his old position, Clinton has frequently found himself playing defense on the decisions he made as president. On Thursday, at a rally in Pennsylvania, he was forced to address Black Lives Matter protesters who confronted him on his crime bill. And as he did in making the case in 1993, Clinton brought up Jessica Bradford.\n\n\"I like protesters,\" he began, \"but the ones who won't let you answer are afraid of the truth.\"\n\n\"Here's what happened. Let's just tell the whole story,\" he said. \"When I became president, the headlines in the newspapers were full of ...\" He was interrupted, and changed tack.\n\n\"Vice President Biden ... he was the chairman of the committee that had jurisdiction over this crime bill,\" he continued. \"I had an assault weapons ban in it. I had money for inner-city kids for out-of-school activities. We had 110,000 police officers so we could put people on the street and not in these military vehicles and police would look like the people they were policing.\n\n\"We did all of that. And Biden said, 'You can't pass this bill. The Republicans will kill it if you don't put more sentencing in.' I talked to a lot of African-American groups. They thought black lives mattered. They said, 'Take this bill because our kids are being shot in the streets by gangs.' We had 13-year-old kids planning their own funerals. She\" -- referring to the protester -- \"don't want to hear any of that.\"\n\nHe later added: \"You are defending the people who killed the lives you say matter,\" apparently referring to a protester's sign mentioning Hillary Clinton's contemporaneous comments about \"superpredators.\" She herself has expressed regret for the comment, though her husband went in a different direction.\n\nThose comments were something of a change of position for Clinton, who earlier in this cycle appeared to walk back his role in the increased incarceration that, as Clinton conceded on Thursday, President Obama was trying to undo. \"I signed a bill that made the problem worse, and I want to admit it,\" he said at an NAACP gathering last July.\n\nHis tone on Thursday was very different, demanding that the crowd and the protesters understand the political moment during which the bill was developed. Slate's Jamelle Bouie noted on Twitter that this argument wasn't necessarily incorrect, but it misread the moment.\n\n\"Your communities deserve to have the same police protection as white ones do\" was part of his pitch for the crime bill. — Jamelle Bouie (@jbouie) April 7, 2016\n\nAs that has become clear, the politics around this have changed. But WJC, for all his political and emotional intelligence, can't see it. — Jamelle Bouie (@jbouie) April 7, 2016\n\nIt's clear that Clinton would rather defend his decisions than lament them. Armed with a microphone and 20 years of experience talking about his crime bill, he was easily able to overpower the day's protesters. But the record of the bill is far more mixed than he presented it to that crowd. In addition to the increases in incarceration that he admits were problematic, he has also made dubious claims about the effect of those additional police on the crime rate. The bill also expanded crimes that were eligible for the death penalty -- a policy issue that his wife is now trying to reconcile during her campaign.\n\nThe former president later looped another defense of his past policies into his comments. He analogized the misunderstanding of his crime bill to Republican assertions that his administration helped create the conditions that led to the recession.\n\n\"You know why they tried to blame me? Because we enforced something called the Community Reinvestment Act,\" he said, \"which led to $800 billion being loaned in neighborhoods like this. ... So when they caused the crash by having nobody home at the regulatory agencies, they said, 'If Bill Clinton hadn't made us loan money to all these African-American and Latino and immigrant neighborhoods, we'd be peachy-keen.\"\n\n\"They were wrong, too,\" he said of the Republicans. Then, pointing to the protesters, he added: \"Just like them.\"\n\nFor Clinton, those protesters -- perhaps even younger than Jessica Bradford is today -- simply don't understand what the political moment was like in 1993. The protesters would probably argue that the same could be said of Clinton about the political moment today.",
  "latent_11603": "Enver Hoxha\n\nThe Modern Revisionists on the Way to Degenerating Into\n\nSocial-Democrats and to Fusing with Social-Democracy\n\nReproduced from Zëri i Popullit dated April 7, 1964\n\nDate: April 7, 1964\n\nSource: The Party of Labor of Albania in Battle with Modern Revisionism, Naim Frashëri Publishing House, Tirana, Albania, 1972.\n\nTransciption: Ismail Badiou\n\nHTML: Mike B.\n\nPublic Domain: Marxists Internet Archive (2009). You may freely copy, distribute, display and perform this work; as well as make derivative and commercial works. Please credit “Marxists Internet Archive” as your source.\n\nEvery day that passes by brings new facts to light testifying that the modern revisionists, N. Khrushchev's group and their followers, have completely deviated and have turned into enemies of Marxism-Leninism and of proletarian internationalism, of socialism and of the revolutionary and liberation movement of the working class and the peoples under bondage, enemies of the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement. They have joined in a \"holy alliance\" with the American imperialists and the reactionaries of different countries, with all the anti-communist forces against peoples and socialism. They have turned the blade of all their daggers against Marxism-Leninism, against all fraternal parties and revolutionary communists loyal to it, against the anti-imperialist, liberation and revolutionary movement of the peoples. All their utterances about \"loyalty\" to Marxism-Leninism, to the cause of socialism, to the revolution and proletarian internationalism are sheer bluff and demagogy from head to foot.\n\nIn order to carry through their anti-Marxist, anti-socialist and counter-revolutionary line, they stand in need of allies. And where could they find better allies than among the revisionist elements in the various parties and among the Titoite clique in Jugoslavia? Therefore, N. Khrushchev and his group succeeded, through 'putsch-es' and plots, deceiving some and compromising others, under the guise of fighting \"the cult of the individual\" in bringing to power and placing at the head of certain communist and workers' parties revisionist elements of their choice while, on the other hand, they rehabilitated Tito's renegade clique and joined up with them completely. Thus, the united revisionist front came into being. This was the first step.\n\nIn addition to this, the modern revisionists have never given up efforts to find other allies too. And who could these be? It is very natural for them to turn to—and they could not help turn to—their \"brothers\", fellow traitors—the right-wing social-democrat leaders. For revisionism and social-democracy of today are two manifestations of the same ideology—bourgeois ideology. Social-democracy is the manifestation of bourgeois ideology in the workers movement, while revisionism is the manifestation of bourgeois ideology in the communist movement.\n\nThis is the common ideological basis that draws the revisionists closer to and united with the social-democrats and creates the premises for their complete fusion not only ideologically and politically but also organizationally. Therefore it is altogether natural and logical that the attempts of the revisionists to cause the degeneration of the communist parties they direct, into social democratic parties, that their tendency to fuse in with the social-democracy, is being made so very clear nowadays.\n\nThe trend to get closer and to join with social-democrats, the whole treacherous line of action of the modern revisionists, have their beginnings at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This trend was re-emphasized at the 21st and 22nd Congresses and was sanctioned in the new program of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Speaking of this line of approach to and union with social-democracy at the 22nd Congress, N. Khrushchev said: \"This is not a tactical temporary slogan but the general line of the communist movement dictated by the basic interests of the working class\". N. Khrushchev has also said: \"If we are to speak of the role and position of the non-communist parties, we should stress, above all, that in the present situation, in order to achieve the socialist transformation of society, collaboration of the communist party with the other parties is not only possible but indispensable\". (N. Khrushchev's reply to the editor of the Australian newspaper Herald, John Waters, published in Pravda June 25, 1958).\n\nThe line of approach to and union with social-democrats began to be put into effect immediately after the 20th Congress. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union addressed letters to the social-democratic parties of Western Europe calling for unity. Beginning with 1956 the Soviet Union was visited by a number of social-democratic leaders and by whole delegations of social-democratic parties who came into contact and carried on talks with N. Khrushchev's group.\n\nThe campaign for unity with social-democrats has become more intensive especially in recent times. A proof of this lies in the last year's visits to Moscow of such leaders of social-democracy as P.H. Spaak, secretary-general of the Belgian Socialist Party, Harold Wilson, the present chairman of the English Labour Party and Guy Mollet, secretary-general of the French Socialist Party, who conducted talks with N. Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders. In connection with these talks, in an interview with foreign journalists in Moscow Guy Mollet said that he had discussed with Khrushchev \"a number of questions comprising all theoretical and doctrinarian problems of a general nature and which characterize the relations between social-democratic and communist parties\". While in an interview granted to the newspaper \"Unita\" (February 22, 1964) Guy Mollet stated that \"The talks which the delegation of SFIO conducted with the leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and in particular with Nikita Khrushchev, gave us sure satisfaction in many points.\"\n\nThe leaders of communist and workers parties in certain other countries are also following the line of fusing with present-day social-democracy under the dictates of \"the conductor's baton\". This is evident n many of their acts, in various articles and statements, in the columns of the Khrushchevian review \"Problems of Peace and Socialism\", in \"the document of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party for the national conference of organization\" appearing in the newspaper Unita dt. 9-1-164, in the draft-resolution for the 17th Congress of the French Communist Party which will be held in May this year, and so on.\n\nIn all these attempts, documents and materials of the modern revisionists regardless of the phrases they use to camouflage their designs the prevailing idea is unity and fusion with the social-democrats \"on whatever basis\" and \"at all costs\", renouncing every thing that might prejudice this union, be it in the field of ideology or in that of organization.\n\nThe attempts of the modern revisionists to get close to and join up with the social-democrats are a logical consequence of their betrayal of Marxism-Leninism, are a component part of their grand strategic plan of \"world integration\" clearly formulated by Tito in his well-known interview granted to Drew Pearson on August 7, 1962. To realize this objective the revisionists make extensive use of demagogical slogans. They try to justify their approach to and union with the imperialists and reactionaries, their approach to and union with Tito's clique in the name of \"socialism\", with the Roman Pontiff in the name of \"humanity\", with the social-democrats, in the name of \"unity of the working class\", in the name of \"peaceful coexistence and of saving the world from a nuclear war of extermination\".\n\nModern Revisionists Proceed Along the Treacherous Tracks of Social Democracy\n\nThe modern revisionists try to justify the approach to and union with the social-democrats under the pretext that \"positive trends\" are allegedly being observed especially in recent times, among the ranks of social democracy; that they have allegedly expressed themselves in favor of peace, peaceful coexistence, disarmament, that they have positively modified their attitude toward the USSR, that they have expressed themselves in favor of some kind of approach to the communists, that they have expressed some sort of willingness to meet the demands of the working class, to preserve and strengthen democratic institutions, they have stated that they are in favor of socialist transformation of society and so forth. Thus, in order to justify their line of approach to the rightwing leaders of social-democracy, the revisionists try to create the illusion that it is not the revisionist train which is speeding its way to the social-democratic station, but the social-democratic station is coming up to meet the revisionist train!\n\nThis is no new tactic for revisionists. N. Khrushchev's traitorous group and those who follow them have used exactly this maneuver to justify their approach to and complete union with the Titoite clique, pretending that the Jugoslav leaders have allegedly corrected many of their errors and have adopted the line of \"Marxism-Leninism\". In the same way, in order to justify their treacherous line of reconciliation with and approach to the imperialists, to the American imperialists in particular, they have spread and continue to spread illusions pretending that the leaders of imperialism have now become \"wise\", \"realistic\", \"peace-loving\", \"reasonable\" and what not.\n\nBut facts go to prove that the present social-democrat leaders have changed as little in their nature and in their attitude as the Titoite clique and the imperialists. If we may speak of any kind of change of views and stands of the social-democratic leaders, the only obvious change of theirs is their ever growing inclination to the right.\n\nWhat Does Present-Day Social-Democracy Represent?\n\nPresent-day social-democracy is a direct follower of the traitorous 2nd International. It has inherited all the ideological luggage, organization and tactics of the parties of the 2nd International. The social-democrats began their betrayal by getting away from the basic teachings of Marxism-Leninism, which they proclaim as out-dated and inexpedient, by renouncing the class struggle and replacing it with the \"theory\" of harmony and reconciliation of classes, by negating the revolution and replacing it with reforms within the capitalist order, by giving up the revolutionary way and replacing it with \"peaceful\", \"democratic\" and parliamentary method, by denying the indispensability of breaking up the old bourgeois state machinery and accepting the capitalist state as a means to cross over to socialism, by withholding their assent to the dictatorship of the proletariat and replacing it with \"pure and general democracy\", by departing from proletarian internationalism and going so far the other way as to plunge into positions of the national-chauvinists, to open union with the imperialist bourgeoisie.\n\nUnmasking the betrayal of the old social-democrats Lenin wrote as far back as in his book What is to Be Done: \"Social-democracy should be changed from a party of social revolution to a democratic party of social reforms. Bernstein has bolstered up this political demand with a whole battery of 'new' arguments and considerations harmoniously connected with one another. He denies the possibility of endorsing socialism scientifically and of proving, from the point of view of the materialist conception of history, that it is indispensable and inevitable; he denies the fact that poverty and proletarianization are on the increase and that capitalist contradictions are getting worse; he proclaims the very notion of 'the final goal' as groundless and unconditionally rejects the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat; he denies the divergences of principle existing between liberalism and socialism and the theory of class struggle which, he pretends, cannot be carried out in a wholly democratic society governed by the will of the majority\". (V.I. Lenin: Selected Works in 2 vol. Albanian edition, vol. 1, page 110).\n\nBy embarking on this road, social-democracy turned itself into a loyal supporter of the capitalist order of things, into a servant of the bourgeoisie into a most important ideological and political abettor of the bourgeois policy in the workers movement. It has aided the bourgeoisie to oppress and exploit the workers of their country and the peoples of other countries, to suppress their revolutionary and liberation movement. \"It has been verified by practice\" Lenin says, \"that the militant group in the ranks of the workers movement who adhere to opportunist trends, are better defenders of the bourgeoisie than the bourgeoisie themselves. If workers were not under the guidance of such people, the bourgeoisie would not be able to stand their ground\" (Works, vol. 31, page 259, Albanian edition).\n\nBut social-democracy today has gone a step further in its betrayal when compared with the time of the 2nd International. At present it is characterized by a growing tendency towards the right.\n\nBeginning from 1955 the social-democratic parties in Western Europe like the English Labour Party, the social-democratic parties in France, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Western Germany and in the Scandinavian countries, have changed their programs or have been engaged in elaborating new programmatic procedures. What characterizes these programs and new programmatic procedures? They are characterized by the eclectic blending of the old opportunist theories with the \"modern\" bourgeois theories, by their permanent renunciation of the principles and ideals of socialism, by their open support for the capitalist order of exploitation and by their frenzied opposition to communism.\n\nIf the former reformists avowed, even in words alone, that the establishment of socialism was their ultimate goal, present-day social-democrats have openly rejected this end. They preach that they are in favor of the socalled \"democratic socialism\", which has nothing in common with true scientific socialism. It is its negation, its replacement with certain bourgeois liberal reforms which do not tamper in any way with the basis of capitalist society. What kind of socialism is that when most of the social-democratic programs have discarded an elementary demand of socialism to abolish private property of the means of production?\n\nFollowing the well-known statements of the socialist International \"Aims and Tasks of Democratic Socialism\" (1951), the new programs direct the working class not against capitalism as such but against \"unsupervised\" capitalism. Nationalization of a part of the enterprises by the bourgeois state, the establishment of state monopolist capitalism in the economic life of the country, the adoption of certain bourgeois-democratic reforms—all of these figure in the new programs and statements of the social-democrats as facts that go to prove that the basis of socialism has allegedly been laid in certain capitalist countries. At the same time, they deny the socialist character of transformations in the socialist countries. They repeat in this manner, openly or in a roundabout way, the bourgeois theories in vogue on \"people's capitalism\", \"capitalism under control\", \"organized\", \"democratic\" and so on.\n\nThe bourgeois reactionary press has more than once hailed this departure of socialism and in defense of capitalism. In a leading article under the title \"Burial of Marxism\" the \"Washington Post and Times Herald\" newspaper wrote: \"84 years after its establishment at the historic Congress at Gotha, the German Social-Democratic Party in its Congress at Bad-Gotsberg, renounced Marxist ideology and, in fact, ceased being socialist in the true sense of that word. It reconciled itself to the principle of 'free individual initiative, wherever that is possible in economic life'\"\n\nThe new programs of the social-democratic parties have canceled out all mention of contradictions, antagonism and class struggle, have leveled down all boundaries between the oppressed and oppressors, between the exploited and exploiters. In place of the class struggle they preach \"the sense of responsibility\" of man \"in general\". Thus the program of the German Social-Democratic Party has it: \"Freedom and democracy in industrial society are possible of attainment only if as many individuals as possible raise their social conscience and express themselves as willing to share responsibility. The social-democrats uphold the solidarity and 'harmony of all people' the attaining of their 'above classes' objective—democratic socialism\".\n\nSince \"democratic socialism\" does not encroach upon the basis of the capitalist order in any way, but it is a kind of \"reformed capitalism\", it naturally follows that there is no need whatsoever for a socialist revolution. \"Democratic socialism\", according to them, will come about through \"spontaneous economic evolution\", through limitation of the prerogatives and power of the monopolist unions and through the aid of the capitalist state itself. Nevertheless, in order to attain this ideal, it is necessary that the social-democrats come into power and the only way to achieve this is through electoral campaigns to obtain the majority of votes in the bourgeois parliament. Speaking highly of the declaration of the socialist International on \"The aims and tasks of democratic socialism\", one of its leaders, Brauntal, has said that this declaration \"puts an end to the discussions on the dictatorship of the proletariat\", \"does away with the revolutionary class war method to achieve socialism\", and \"rejects adherence to any socialist theory.\"\n\nThe social-democrats have severed all connections with Marxism-Leninism, with the theory of scientific socialism and with the materialistic conception of things. The program of the Austrian Socialist Party has it: \"Socialism is an international movement which does not at all demand an obligatory similarity of views. Regardless of where the socialists draw their points of view, from a Marxist or any other social analysis, from religious or humanitarian principles—they all aim at a common goal\". Speaking at the Congress of the German Social-Democratic Party at Gotsberg, its former Chairman, E. Olenhauer, said \"the demand to make K. Marx's and F. Engel's political program the substance of the social-democratic program for 1959 is more anti-marxist than can be imagined\" and he added; \"We can not be understood if we speak in terms of the past, we cannot solve the problems of today with our old conceptions.\"\n\nPresent-day social-democracy has not only slipped into positions of philosophic idealism and upholds idealism, but tries to find support in, and even fuse entirely with its extremist form—religion. Thus, for instance, the programs of German, Austrian, Swiss and other social-democratic parties maintain that \"democratic socialism\" has its roots in Christian ethics and doctrine, that socialism and religion, far from eliminating, are completely at one with each other. Speaking at the Congress of the Austrian Socialist Party in 1958, the author of the new program, B. Kautzky, said: \"We would like to draw up a program, which would be fully endorsed by Marxists and non-Marxists alike, by atheists and socialist believers in religion alike\". A similar attempt to reconcile christianity with socialism, religious idealist conception with socialist materialist conception, is made also in an interview given to the correspondent of the Italian newspaper \"Unita\" by Guy Mollet and which was published in this paper on February 22 of this year.\n\nSuch, in general, are the ideological views of the present social-democrats. What should be stressed in this connection is that their programs, as a rule, are more leftist than their acts. If the right socialists still try, in words, to pose as socialists in order to deceive the workers, in deeds they have long become staunch defenders of the capitalist order. Both when they are in opposition as well as when they are at the head of bourgeois governments, or take part in them, the heads of social-democracy serve to preserve and strengthen the bourgeois order through all their views and acts. All the socialist demagogy of the social democrats has been shown up by experience. Socialists have more than once been in power, at the head of bourgeois governments both in England, France and elsewhere. They are at the head of or take part to this day In the governments of capitalist countries. And what have they done for the workers, for socialism? They have done nothing but follow Leon Blum's instructions: that being in power the socialists should be \"faithful directors of capitalist society\".\n\nLet us dwell even briefly on the activity of the French Socialist Party and its leader Guy Mollet, who has more than once taken part in and even headed the French government, and whom the revisionists consider a left-wing element and conduct hearty talks with. When at the head of the government, the French socialists set the dogs loose on workers on strike, incited the outbreak of the dirty war in Indo-China, undertook police repressions against the people of other colonies, carried on the fighting against the Algerian people with more ferocity, approved the North Atlantic Pact and the re-arming of Western Germany. Guy Mollet's government signed the agreements for \"the European Common Market\" and \"Euratom\", it was one of the organizers of the military aggression on Egypt, Guy Mollet's betrayal paved the way for personal rule in France and so on and so forth. Speaking of Guy Mollet's activity even the labourite weekly \"Tribune\" wrote at the beginning of 1957 that \"Mollet is a disgrace to France as well as to socialism\".\n\nThese are the true features of social-democracy today. Many representatives of the bourgeoisie have not been wrong in stressing the great role of the social-democratic parties in suppressing the revolutionary movement of workers and in defending the capitalist order, they have not been wrong in singing their praises. Thus, for instance, T. Junilla, director of a capitalist bank in Finland, has said: \"In the struggle to win over industrial workers spiritually only the social-democrats can serve as a powerful force against the communists. If the social democrats lose this battle, it may very well be the end of democracy in Finland. This is why, being a bourgeois member of the conservative party, I feel obliged to state that we need a united, militant, social-democratic party which firmly upholds northern democracy\". The English bourgeois newspaper Financial Times wrote in the same vein on June 28, 1963: \". . . the industrialists are scared less by the Labourites, and some of them cherish the opinion that a Labour government would open up better perspectives for development than the Tories.\"\n\nIt is precisely because the social-democrats are agents of the bourgeoisie in the workers movement that the Marxist-Leninists have always had it clear that without a determined struggle to unmask and smash the social-democrats ideologically and politically, the working class cannot wage its struggle and carry it on to victory, \". . . Bourgeois parties of workers\" as a political phenomenon, V.I. Lenin has written, \"have already been set up in all advanced capitalist countries. . . . Without a resolute, relentless war on all fronts against these parties—or, what amounts to the same thing, against groups, trends and so on—it is futile to speak of the struggle against imperialism, or of Marxism, or of the workers socialist movement\" (V.I. Lenin: \"Against Revisionists\", Albanian edition, page 368). J.V. Stalin too, as a revolutionary and consistent marxist, has stressed: \"Present-day social-democratism is the ideological support of capitalism. Lenin was a thousand times right when he said that the present social-democratic politicians are 'true agents of the bourgeoisie in the workers movement, lackeys of the capitalist class from the workers ranks' and that 'in the civil war of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie' they will undoubtedly take sides with the 'Versailles' against the 'Communards'. 'No end can be put to capitalism without putting an end to social-democracy in the workers movement. Therefore, the epoch of the death of capitalism is at the same time the epoch of the death of social-democracy in the workers movement\" (J.V. Stalin: Works, Albanian edition, vol. 10, p, 242).\n\nThe 1960 Moscow Declaration too, stressing the fact that the right-wing leaders of social-democracy have aligned themselves openly with the imperialists, uphold the capitalist system, split the workers movement and that they are \"enemies of communism\", called upon the communists to continue to expose them.\n\nBut the modern revisionists, with N. Khrushchev's group in the lead, as renegades and foes to Marxism, act entirely at variance with the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, with the instructions of the Moscow Declaration; they pursue the line of joining in and fusing with the right-wing leaders of social-democracy. And this is not accidental: social-democrats of today and modern revisionists have common things together, they proceed in the same direction and towards a common counter-revolutionary objective.\n\nModern Revisionists Have Slipped into the Positions of Social-Democracy\n\nJust as the old opportunists and reformists betrayed Marxism-Leninism, the cause of the working class, of the revolution and of socialism, so do the modern revisionists betray these ideals and are pursuing the same road as their forerunners who are at the same time their spiritual inspirers. Those who have changed are not the social-democrats but the modern revisionists, who have fallen into the treacherous positions of social-democracy.\n\nRejecting Marxism-Leninism, the social-democrats claim that \"problems of today cannot be solved by old concepts\". Following in their wake, the revisionists too, speculate with the newer conditions and phenomena, and, under the guise of fighting \"dogmatism\" and upholding \"the creative development of Marxism\" claim that many things today should be looked at with a critical eye, that what was right 30 years ago cannot be such any longer, that atomic weapons and the danger of a nuclear war makes it indispensable to revise our views and stand on many questions of strategy and tactics, that he who abides by the basic theses of Marx and Lenin in the sixties of the 20th century is a dogmatist who takes no account of the great changes that have come about in the world, and he who consults the classic works of Marxist-Leninists in order to analyze and explain the present historical process, is afflicted with the mania of quotations and so and so forth. Hence, Marxism-Leninism is outdated for revisionists too, it no longer suits the newer conditions, it should be \"enriched\" with new ideas and new conclusions. Just like all the old opportunists and reformists, the revisionists too are stripping Marxism of its critical and revolutionary spirit and are attempting to turn it from a weapon in the hands of the working class into a weapon in the hands of the bourgeoisie to be used against the working class.\n\n\"Not the class struggle but the solidarity and harmony of all men who possess the sense of responsibility towards society\"--this is the motive power of present-day society, the social-democrats maintain. The revisionists too have erased the class struggle from their books, and in fact have replaced it with the idea of class reconciliation in the name of \"preserving peace\" in the world, they have renounced this struggle in the name of \"saving the world from the danger of nuclear war\", and instead of the class struggle they preach \"peaceful coexistence\" as the only method to solve all the vital problems that stand before human society. \"Peace at all costs, peace with all and above all\", \"christian love for everybody\", \"abstract humanism above classes\", these are the ideas that the modern revisionists preach far and wide. In the name of this ideal the revisionists make common cause with the enemies of the class, with the imperialists and reactionaries of various countries and their agents and lackeys—the right-wing leaders, social-democratic leaders and the Titoite clique, while, on the other hand, they fight furiously against all those who loyally uphold the interests of the working class and their Marxist-Leninist ideology—the communists parties and all the revolutionary communists.\n\nThe social-democrats have long given up the revolution and preach that socialism will come about through reforms within the framework of the bourgeois order of things, of democracy and bourgeois legality. Following in their tracks, the revisionists too have abandoned the revolutionary way, saying that the way to socialism is the way to an ever broader democracy, the way of observing and carrying out bourgeois constitutions, the way of \"reforming structures\". Just like the social democrats, the revisionists too, identify the struggle for democracy with that for socialism, confine the struggle for socialism to that for democracy. Dragging Kautzky's and Bernstein's theories from their burial place, they express themselves in and only in favor of the \"peaceful\" and \"parliamentary\" way, which they hold up as a world strategic principle, and they have concentrated all the efforts on the struggle for votes in order to win the majority of seats in bourgeois parliaments.\n\nThe social-democrats consider the capitalist state as a state above classes, as an interpreter and champion of the interests of society as a whole, they are opposed to breaking up the old bourgeois state machine, they are opposed to the dictatorship of the proletariat, which, according to them, is the negation of democracy, is a totalitarian rule and so on and so forth. And the revisionists spread the illusions that the capitalist state may change its class nature, that it may become a state that will express not only the interests of the bourgeoisie but also those of the proletariat and of the laboring masses, they say that Lenin's thesis on the indispensability of breaking up the bourgeois state apparatus must be modified, that the dictatorship of the proletariat is an out-dated idea, or, at most, suitable only for backward countries, that it may take not only various forms but also quite a different content. Both the social-democrats as well as the revisionists slander against the dictatorship of the proletariat and describe the entire period of its rule as a period of mass terror and arbitrariness, as a period of brutal violation of laws, of socialist democracy, and so on and forth.\n\nIn their practical political activity too, the modern revisionists are proceeding in the footsteps of the traitorous leaders of social democracy. As a matter of fact, they have joined with the enemies of socialism and of the peoples—with the imperialists and particularly with the American imperialists, and with the reactionaries of various countries. For the sake of getting closer to imperialism, for the sake of achieving Soviet-American collaboration, which is N. Khrushchev's and his group's highest aspiration and ideal, the revisionists do not hesitate even to betray the true friends and allies of the Soviet people, the vital interests of the socialist countries, the working class, the peoples and nations oppressed and exploited by the imperialists. A proof of this lies in such activities of the revisionists headed by Khrushchev's group as their adventuresome and capitulating attitude in the Caribbean crisis, in their pressure exerted on socialist Cuba to capitulate to the American imperialists, sacrificing its dignity and its sovereignty, in their union with the Indian reactionaries against the People's Republic of China, with the Titoite clique and with Venizelos against the People's Republic of Albania, in the infamous Moscow Treaty for a partial ban on nuclear tests, which is high treason to the interests of the Soviet Union, to the other socialist countries and to peace in favor of the American imperialists, as well as in a number of other facts.\n\nAnti-communism permeates all the ideology and practical activity of the modern social-democrats, they slander the socialist countries and communist parties, they split the workers movement, counter scientific socialism with \"democratic socialism\" which is no other than reformed capitalism, try their utmost to preserve the capitalist order where it prevails and re-establish it where it has been overthrown. The modern revisionists are also carrying on anti-socialist and anti-communist activities on a wide scale. N. Khrushchev's group and their followers have split the socialist camp and the international communist movement and are speeding ahead towards degenerating the socialist countries into \"docile bourgeois republics\" and the communist and workers parties from parties of social revolution into \"parties of social reforms\". N. Khrushchev and his group deny the proletarian class nature of the socialist state and the communist party, they are liquidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and the communist party in the Soviet Union under the pretext of turning them into the state and party of \"the entire people\". The revisionists are organizing and reorganizing with a view to changing the forms of management of socialist economy after the pattern of Titoite Jugoslavia, violating the Marxist principles of managing socialist economy, they belittle the experience of many years of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and in other socialist countries, and call on all to learn from the experience of capitalist countries, going as far as to stretch their hands to the imperialists for aid, credits and capital investments \"to build socialism and communism\", as Khrushchev himself did of late. Under the guise of fighting \"the cult of the individual and its consequences\", they have done away with the sound Marxist-Leninist cadres and have rehabilitated the traitors and enemies of socialism, living or dead. They have flung open the door of the socialist countries to the unhindered penetration of bourgeois ideology, of all kinds of alien antisocialist trends and manifestations in art, letters and in all the life of country, in the name of \"freedom of conscience\" and of \"an abstract humanity above classes\". This \"liberal\" and \"humanist\" socialism of the modern revisionists is getting closer and closer to the so-called \"democratic socialism\" which the leaders of the modern social democracy preach.\n\nThus, all the given facts show clearly that the modern revisionists are proceeding along the treacherous tracks of the social-democrats. This is very clear to the socialist leaders who have openly expressed their approval, their joys and hopes regarding the traitorous course followed by N. Khrushchev's group and their followers. Here are some of their statements:\n\nIn a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations at its last session P.H. Spaak said: \"N. Khrushchev is trying to test peaceful coexistence and the West should not make it difficult for him to make this experiment. It would be a terrible and inexcusable mistake to discourage him. At this moment the future line of demarcation will not be any longer between communists and non-communists, between colonized and colonizers, between ideologies and races. We are witnesses of the struggle between those who wait the opportune time and inhuman doctrinarians on one hand and those who have had confidence in progress and have never ceased to hope, on the other. Let us not let this great occasion slip from our hands\".\n\nIn his interview on February 24, 1964, the chairman of the English Labour Party, H. Wilson, pointed out that he was the first of the Western politicians who visited Russia after the death of Stalin and, on his return from there, reported to W. Churchill, Prime Minister at that time, that \"a great change was taking place in Soviet politics\" and that this \"is of major importance as regards relations between East and West\". He is fully justified to be proud of his farsighted anticipations which today have become realities.\n\nBefore going to Moscow with the socialist delegation to talk with Khrushchev Gerard Jacques, director of the newspaper of the French Socialist Party stated: \"We have long given up engaging in polemics with the Soviet Union and admit that this country is in the full phase of evolution. . . The problems raised are those of democracy and the democratic guarantees of the single party, of the role of the socialist party in socialist society, of the nature of the socialist regime and its structure. The attitude maintained by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the divergences between Moscow and Peking throws ample light on the attitude of this party towards dogmatism and political sectarianism\".\n\nAfter his return to Paris from colloquys with N. Khrushchev, the Secretary General of the French Socialist Party, Guy Mollet, stated that he became convinced that \"a positive evolution is taking place in the Soviet Union\", which, according to his words, were summed up in these matters: \"Admittance of many ways to build socialism\", \"end of the proletarian dictatorship\", \"internal evolution\" and so on. Whereas an interview granted the newspaper Unita (Feb. 22, 1964), Guy Mollet declared \"I am convinced that the communist world has embarked on the road to transformation\".\n\nThese statements of the leaders of social-democracy are at one with the statements made by the leaders of imperialism and their spokesmen who also express their support for N. Khrushchev's revisionist line and consider him \"the best friend of the West in Moscow\". They say that \"The Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev acts like an American politician\" and affirm that the officials in the State Department in the USA are of the opinion that \"the United States should facilitate N. Khrushchev's task to a certain extent\" and so on and so forth.\n\nTowards a Complete Fusion of the Modern Revisionists with the Social-Democrats\n\nThe falling of the modern revisionists into the ideological position of the social-democrats in major issues constitutes the basis of the complete amalgamation of revisionists with the social-democrats. By pursuing this course and recommending it to communist and workers parties of different countries, the modern revisionists with N. Khrushchev's group in the lead, aim at causing the degeneration of the communist parties into reformist parties of the social-democratic type, at impregnating the working class with bourgeois ideology and reformist illusions, at weakening the revolutionary fighting spirit of the working class movement, and alienating it from the only correct road against the capitalist order of oppression and exploitation.\n\nThe revisionists, of course, do not, as a rule, proclaim their hostile intentions openly. They accompany every step they take to the detriment of the cause of the revolution and of communism, with demagogical slogans and clothe it with all kinds of justifications. Their anti-Marxist action of fusing with social-democracy too, they try to justify with the pretext that the social-democratic parties too are allegedly workers' parties and that the unity of the working class is essential in the struggle against capitalism. Let us dwell in brief on this matter.\n\nWorkers Parties or \"Bourgeois Parties of the Working Class\"?\n\nAre the social-democratic parties really and truly workers parties? To judge whether a party is a party of the working class or not it does not suffice to look at the name it attaches to itself. Hitler's party too, called itself \"nationalist socialist\"! The only correct criterion is whether or not it defends and upholds the interests of the working class, whether or not it fights for its cause. And in order to elucidate this matter one should see to whose advantage are the ideology, policy and all practical activities of this or that party. \"Don't bush faith in phrases\", Lenin teaches us, \"but rather see to whose benefits they are\" (Works, vol. 19, p. 33, Russian edition). And if we look at this manner from this prism, from the prism of class, which is the only correct, Marxist-Leninist criterion, then it becomes clear to every true communist that the social-democratic parties are not workers parties, but they are, as Lenin has dubbed them \"bourgeois parties of the working class\". We showed above through numerous facts, that in both ideological views, political views and all around activities, modern social-democracy is nothing other than, as Lenin says, \"a political detachment of the bourgeoisie\", \"a promoter of its influence\", \"a true agency of the bourgeoisie in the workers movement\".\n\nFrom the point of view of its social make-up, too, the social-democratic parties have undergone and are undergoing visible changes. The number of workers in their ranks are becoming less and less and the number of elements of the petty bourgeoisie and of the workers bureaucrats are increasing. The modern reformists have themselves launched the slogan \"the deproletarization\" of the social-democratic parties. And this has been expressed in the new programs of many social-democratic parties. Thus, for instance, the program of the Swiss Social-Democratic Party has it: \"At the beginning socialism was the concern of the working class which used to be exploited by capitalism alone. . . . Now socialism is the concern of all mankind. It pertains to every man with a sense of responsibility for the welfare of society\".\n\nThis is for the groundwork, for the masses of the social-democratic parties, whereas as far as the leading cadres are concerned, the higher up you climb in the hierarchy of the social-democratic parties, the fewer workers you find in them. As a matter of fact many social democratic leaders have long become real capitalists: many of them take part in the administrative councils of the biggest banks and own packages of solid shares, drawing millions upon millions of dividends each year. Thus, for instance, according to returns of the recent years, 410 principal functionaries of the German Social-Democratic Party occupied 929 high paid posts in the major banks and corporations of Western Germany, 62 social democrat personalities were directors of the firms Mannesman, Klekner, Krupp, Flick and others. The same situation prevails in other social democratic parties of the West like France, England, Belgium, the Scandinavian countries and so on.\n\nThis is the kind of \"workers' class' the social-democratic parties represent. The modern revisionists, who are themselves nothing but traitors to the working class, have every reason to stick the label of \"workers' party\" not only on themselves, but only on the social-democrats, but also on any English bourgeois conservative party if such a thing is dictated by their anti-Marxist and anti-revolutionary plan of action.\n\nIt is therefore obvious enough that the argument of the modern revisionists pretending that the social-democratic parties are parties of the working class, is altogether a false one. Hence, their slogan on \"the need for unity of the working class\" is demagogical, a pretext to justify their union with the \"bourgeois parties of the working class\".\n\nThe workers' movement in almost all the advanced capitalist countries has been split. Who is to blame for this split? Who hinders the achievement of unity and action in the workers movement? The 1960 Moscow Declaration points out that the originators and promoters of this split on a national and international scale are the \"ruling classes, the right wing leaders of social democracy and the reactionary leaders of the trade unions\". Under these circumstances, in order to realize unity of action in the workers movement, the revolutionary Marxist-Leninists are guided by the following considerations:\n\na) that unity of action may be attained only in battle with splitters, therefore they wage a relentless and persistent war of principle against the splitters—the treacherous leaders of social-democracy;\n\nb) that all efforts should be concentrated to achieve unity of action at the base with the working masses of the socialist parties, that the watchword of the Marxist-Leninists for unity of action could and should be: reliance on the masses, alliance with the leftists, uncompromising combat against the treacherous right-wing leaders who cause the split in order to expose and isolate them;\n\nc) that by soliciting unity of action with socialists, the communist parties should consider this not as collaboration between two political parties of the working class but as collaboration between a proletarian and non proletarian party in order to achieve some specific objectives. In connection with this it is essential to always keep in mind and strictly observe Lenin's teachings, who has more than once stressed with force that it is essential that, when concluding an alliance or agreement with other movements for this or that question or objective, the revolutionary party of the working class will maintain its political independence at every moment and in every situation, so that it may not lose sight at any moment of the basic interests of the working class in its fight to achieve its final objective—the triumph of socialism and communism.\n\nEvery departure from Marxist-Leninist positions brings about as a consequence the alienation of the working class from its revolutionary line of action and its fall into the mire of opportunism. Such is the attitude of the Marxist-Leninists towards unity of the workers movement.\n\nBut what stand do the modern revisionists maintain in connection with this? They have not only given up fighting the splitters of the workers' movement—the right-wing leaders of social democracy but, what's more, they are advocates of unity \"at all costs\" and \"under the conditions\" with these traitorous splitters. The revisionists even rise against all those who fight against the right-wing leaders of social-democracy and who expose their betrayal, considering this fight as \"sectarian\", \"dogmatic\", as \"insolent\" and \"dangerous attack\" and so on.\n\nBut everybody knows that social-democratic leaders like Spaak, Guy Mollet and others, with whom N. Khrushchev and his followers conduct \"hearty talks\" and try to achieve unity \"at all costs\" are servitors and agents of the bourgeoisie, who have even been and continue to be at the head of bourgeois governments in many capitalist countries. Therefore, unity with these traitors is by no means a unity of the workers movement, but an attempt at unity between the working class and the bourgeoisie, for the subjection of the working class to the bourgeoisie, unity and collaboration with the reactionary bourgeois governments pretending to be \"socialist\".\n\nFormerly when they had not yet revealed so openly their treacherous features, the modern revisionists used to claim they are opposed to the right-wing leaders of social-democracy, that no unity was possible with them and so on, and they had even said a word or two against them. N. Khrushchev, for one, said at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that the cause of unity of the working class is hindered by \"imperialist reactionaries and their lackeys in the workers movement such as the anti-communist leaders of Social-democracy—Guy Mollet and Spaak. We know these leaders of anti-communism by name and we do not rely on them when we speak of unity of action of the working class\". Whereas now it is the same Khrushchev who conducts \"hearty colloquys\" with and solicits the collaboration of such anti-communist leaders as Guy Mollet, Spaak, H. Wilson and their ilk to achieve \"unity of the working class\"! One of two things must have happened: either Guy Mollet, Spaak and Co have ceased to be anti-communists or N. Khrushchev himself has ceased to be a communist and makes common cause with the leaders of anti-communism, servitors of the imperialist reactionaries! So far there is no sign to prove the first, while there are plenty of facts to prove the second.\n\nRegardless of the demagogical slogans they make use of in order to waylay the masses, the modern revisionists are not only in favor of \"unity at all costs\" with the social democrats including their traitorous leaders, but have gone even further, expressing themselves willing to collaborate with them \"on any basis\". Thus, in an article appearing in the \"Komunist\" review of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union No. 3, 1960, we read: \"Unity of action with the reformists, even with the sworn ones on this or that issue is always possible, provided they really try to achieve any reform, be it ever so small, for the benefit of the working class, of the workers\". Whereas the leaders of the French Communist Party, on the basis of a resolution of the plenum of the Central Committee during September 27 & 28, 1961 regarding collaboration with the socialist and other parties have stated: \"We on our part, are ready to collaborate on any basis\". (See the \"Komunist\" review No. 3, 1962, p. 95).\n\nThus, speculating on the slogan \"unity\", the revisionists sacrifice the principles, level off the distinction between communists and social-democrats, trample upon and sacrifice the basic interests of the working class. This is sham unity, unity in favor of the bourgeoisie and their agents in the workers movement, which aims at submitting the workers movement wholly to the bourgeois and reformist influence, at liquidating the revolutionary spirit and the revolutionary party of the working class. This is high treason to the cause of the working class and of socialism.\n\nAll of these things give rise to an important conclusion: full unity on sound basis of the workers movement can and will be achieved through bitter combat not only with the right-wing leaders of social democracy but also with the modern revisionists, against the workers movement to the poisonous and counter-revolutionary influence of social democracy and of its treacherous right-wing leaders.\n\nLiquidation of the Communist Parties—the Goal of the Modern Revisionists\n\nFacts go to prove that the hue and cry of the modern revisionists are raising about \"unity\" of the workers movement, is nothing but a bluff, a demagogical maneuver to cover their tracks. Whereas their true objective is to cause the degeneration of the communist parties into parties of the social-democratic type, and to join with the social-democrats under \"any condition\" and on \"any basis\" and then to liquidate the communist parties, to amalgamate them with the social-democratic parties.\n\nThe social-democratic leaders, who cannot plead ignorance of these attempts and intentions of the revisionists, have defined their stand and their tactics towards them in compliance with this. The social-democratic leaders pursue the same two-fold tactics towards the revisionists as the American imperialists and the Titoite clique do.\n\nOn the one hand, they sing praises to them for their revisionist line of action, back them up and encourage them as allies in their betrayal, incite them against Marxism-Leninism and against all those that stand loyal to it. To meet the revisionists halfway and to throw dust in the eyes of the masses, certain social-democratic leaders, have, especially of late, started to speak in terms similar to those of the revisionists and to make statements in favor of peace, peaceful coexistence and disarmament, they have somewhat changed their attitude towards the Soviet Union and towards the communists in their countries, and so on. This has, of course, nothing to do with any real, positive, basic change of the social democrats, but a mere change of attitude towards the revisionists for the above reasons. It is exactly this kind of \"change\" that the revisionists try, in a demagogical way, to hold out as \"an inclination to the left\" of the social-democrats, in order to justify their transition to the right, to justify their own line of approach and collaboration with them.\n\nOn the other hand the social-democratic leaders maintain a \"superior\" and \"haughty\" attitude towards the servile requests and appeals of the revisionists for approach and collaboration and demand more and more concessions. And what do the social-democrats demand?\n\nIn the ideological field they demand that the revisionists give up for good the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the role of leadership of the communist party, proletarian internationalism, and so on, not only in essence but also formally.\n\nIn the field of politics, they demand \"further democratic guarantees\", toleration of many parties, consequently of bourgeois parties as well, and the distribution of power among them in socialist states, a change in the electoral system to allow lists of candidates including anti-socialist elements in them, etc. They demand in other words \"the liberalization\" of the socialist regime and its transformation into an ordinary bourgeois democracy.\n\nIn the economic field they demand abolition of the cooperative system in the countryside, of the \"old forms\" of organization and management of economy, in order to proceed towards alignment and \"wide and all-round collaboration\" of the socialist countries with the capitalist countries and so on.\n\nIn the field of international relations they demand further and bigger concessions towards the imperialists in the name of \"preserving peace\", renunciation of support for the revolutionary and national-liberation movements and even the sacrifice of the German Democratic Republic as a condition of establishing peace in Europe.\n\nSuch are the demands put forward, for instance, by Spaak, Guy Mollet and other social-democratic leaders. These demands are as similar as two drops of water to those made to the revisionists by the imperialists, particularly the American imperialists through Eisenhower, Dulles, Kennedy, Johnson and others.\n\nThe social-democratic leaders are convinced that the revisionists will continue to make further concessions, for this is an inevitable consequence of the traitorous line which the revisionists pursue. And facts go to prove more clearly as days go by that they are not mistaken in their calculations. In fact, having embarked on the road of degenerating the communist parties into social-democratic parties headed by them, the revisionists are now attempting to make the next move—to complete fusion with the social-democratic parties.\n\nAt the top of these efforts stands the revisionist \"troika\"—N. Khrushchev's group, Tito's clique and the revisionist leadership of the Italian Communist Party with P. Togliati in the lead. A living example of how to proceed along this treacherous road is that of the leaders of the Italian Communist Party. P. Togliati and other revisionist leaders have imposed on the Italian Communist Party a line which is opportunist and reformist from top to bottom, a line that flagrantly deviates from the teachings and basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, a line which has replaced the class struggle, the revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat with the so-called \"Italian Road to Socialism\" through \"structural reforms\" within the framework of \"bourgeois democracy\", of the bourgeois state \"above classes\", of the bourgeois constitution. And this is not all. Proceeding along their anti-Marxist road, P. Togliati and other revisionist leaders of the Italian Communist Party have long been trumpeting abroad the indispensability of changing the \"character, functions and organizational structure\" of their party, allegedly to fit the major political exigencies lying before it and the \"transformations that have taken are are taking place in the economy, social and political structure of the country\" \"with the problems of the struggle for socialism in the advanced capitalist countries\" and so forth and so on.\n\nJust in what direction these changes will be made and what their objective is, is made clear by the \"Document of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party for the national conference on organization\" published in the newspaper \"Unita\" dated January 9, 1964. In this document we read: \"The essential exigency is to look for and adopt a system of new contacts and connections among all forces which accept a socialist policy and future\" in perspective so that \"the separation existing among the various organizations of the working class may be organically overcome and the basis for a single party may be laid\". It is even said that in light of the struggle against monopolist development of the country in order to direct the latter toward socialist development, we should look into the \"problem of the relation and dialogged with the political, democratic catholic movement, which is the other major force, whose support is essential in building a new society in Italy\".\n\nThese theses of the leadership of the Italian Communist Party are the continuation and further concretization of the opportunist views expressed long ago by P. Togliati. At the meeting of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party on June 24, 1956 Togliati said: \"We can detect, as a matter of fact, a drift towards socialism, a more or less clear trend towards economic reforms and transformations of the socialist type even in countries where the communist parties far from taking part in the government, are not even a major force at times. . . . This situation exists today and assumes special significance in those regions of the world which have been emancipated from colonialism only recently. But also in very advanced capitalist countries it may happen that the working class, in its majority, may vote for a non-communist party and it cannot be excluded that in such countries even non-communist parties based on the working class, may express the urge coming from the working class for a drift towards socialism. Even where communist parties exist and are strong, there may exist side by side with them other parties which may have their basis in the working class and a socialist program. The tendency to bring about radical economic changes in a direction which, in general is that of socialism, many after all come also from organizations and movements which do not call themselves socialist\".\n\nWhat is new in the latest document of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party for the conference on the organization of the party, lies in the fact that attempts are being made to pass from pseudo-theoretical considerations to practical steps to set up the so-called \"single organization of the working class\", in other words the liquidation of the communist party as a revolutionary and independent vanguard of the working class.\n\nWe have already had the occasion to point out that these views of the leaders of the Italian Communist Party are not at all original, but entirely the same as those of the Titoite renegades sanctioned in the program of the Jugoslav Communist League and already condemned unanimously by the international communist movement as profoundly anti-Marxist. It is in this revisionist program that we read: \"The view that communist parties own a monopoly in every line of development towards socialism, and that socialism is expressed by them, is theoretically incorrect and practically very harmful\". We read there further: \"The Yugoslav Communist League considers it dogmatic to clan the absolute monopoly of the communist party over the political power as a universal and perpetual principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat and of socialist construction\".\n\nThe unity of views of the Italian Communist Party leaders with those of the Titoite clique extends not only to this, but to their entire line of action. This revisionist unity was clearly expressed in the joint Tito-Togliati communiqué signed in Belgrade on January 21 of this year, as well as in a leading article by Togliati on his return from a visit to Jugoslavia.\n\nDuring this encounter in Jugoslavia Togliati and Tito did not keep it a secret that they talked about coordinating their joint activity in spreading the triumph of the \"new positive course\" in the communist movement, especially in Europe, and in overcoming the obstacles in the way of the unity of the workers and communist movement on the basis of this course. These talks pointed out again the \"special role\" which the leaders of the Italian Communist Party have assigned to themselves in the communist and workers movement in Western Europe (let us recall the theory of \"polycentralization\", implying, of course, that one of the principal and most \"attractive\" centers of direction would certainly be the Italian Communist Party with Togliati at the head!).\n\nTo achieve their end—the triumph of the \"new course\", the degeneration of the communist parties, the revisionists with N. Khrushchev at the head, need, first and foremost, to break, subdue and set moving towards degeneration not only the Italian Communist Party which Togliati himself is zealously trying to do, but also the French Communist Party, as two major parties in Western Europe. It is precisely for this reason that the \"Trojan Troika\"—N. Khrushchev's group, Tito's clique and the revisionist leaders of the Italian Communist Party—are exerting strong and all-round pressure on the French Communist Party by the right-wing socialist leaders under Guy Mollet as well as by the various revisionist elements in the ranks of the French Communist Party itself like Raimond Gouyot and others.\n\nThe French Communist Party is a party with revolutionary traditions. It has formerly made valuable contribution to the struggle against various anti-Marxist trends ranging from the right-wing socialists like Leon Blum and Guy Mollet to Tito's clique of renegades. Now this criticism seems to have been suppressed either as a result of obedience to the \"conductor's baton\" or by the pressure on the part of revisionist elements who are bent on leading the French Communist Party towards the inglorious road of submission to anti-Marxist degeneration, to the line against which it fought.\n\nLet us take, for instance, the latest document of the leadership of the French Communist Party—the draft resolution for the 17th Congress of the Party which will be held in May this year. It is said therein that for the sake of unity and collaboration with the socialist party, the French Communist Party has done much and is willing to do more, to smooth the \"obstacles\" in the way of this collaboration, that \"it has given up the idea of a single party as an essential condition for transition to socialism. This idea upheld by Stalin constituted an abusive generalization of the specific circumstances under which the October Revolution came about. Later experience has proven that common objectives of the parties representing the working class of the cities and of the countryside, lead to an ever deeper unity for transition to socialism, for building socialist society.\"\n\nHere we come across a new major concession of principle which the French Communist Party is making to the social-democrats. Through this very serious step the French revisionists are jeopardizing the very existence of the Communist Party, they are proceeding towards its liquidation, towards its complete fusion with Guy Mollet's Socialist Party. This is another clear proof of whither the modern revisionists are leading the communist parties. No wonder the big bourgeois newspaper \"Le Monde\" greets this statement with these words: \"The Communist Party firmly rejects the idea of the single party\". No matter how hard they may try to justify this step, how hard they may try to slander against Stalin, the revisionists of the French Communist Party will not succeed in covering up their betrayal, the plot they are hatching up to cause the degeneration of the French Communist Party into a social democratic one.\n\nJ.V. Stalin, like all consistent Marxist-Leninists, has never denied the possibility of collaboration with other parties in taking over the reins of state and building socialism. He has never universalized the special historical circumstances which determined the existence of a single party in the Soviet Union. It is an indisputable fact that it was precisely in Stalin's time that the communist parties in various countries of Europe and Asia, collaborated for the first time with other parties, both during the revolution in order to ascend to power, as well as after the assumption of power, during the construction of socialism. But it is clear in the documents both of the leadership of the Italian Communist Party and of the French Communist Party, the question is not whether the communist party may or may not collaborate with other parties during the socialist revolution and during the construction of socialism. The question here is that for the sake of this collaboration these documents erase all distinction between the communist parties and other parties, they deny in fact the necessity of the leading role of the communist party armed with the theory of Marxism-Leninism.\n\nJ.V. Stalin however upheld just this idea, the idea of the leading role of the communist party, an idea which is not Stalin's alone, but a basic teaching of Marx, Engels and Lenin emanating from the historic mission of the working class and from its Marxist-Leninist ideology which is the sole ideology of scientific socialism. This is clearly emphasized also in the 1957 Moscow Declaration in which we read: \"the leadership of the masses by the working class, whose nucleus is the Marxist-Leninist party, during the accomplishment of the revolution in this or other form, during the establishment of the dictatorship in this or other form\" is the general law of transition from capitalism to socialism.\n\nTime was when the leaders of the French Communist Party bitterly criticised the leaders of the Italian Communist Party because the latter placed the communist party on the same level with the other so-called \"workers parties\", advanced the necessity of the existence of many parties under socialism and denied the indispensability of the leading role of the Marxist-Leninist party. Debating on these views of P. Togliati & Co, the organ of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, \"Cahier de Communisme\" published in its January 1957 issue an article by the present member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party, R. Gorad, under the title: \"In collection with 'the Italian Road to socialism'\" pointed out the denial of the radical distinction between the communist party and other so-called \"workers\" parties permeated with the ideology of other classes, which, therefore, cannot fully represent true present and future interests of the working class, means, in fact, to place the communist party on a level with non-proletarian parties, to deny that \"there is only one scientific socialism which clearly determines the historic role of the working class, the tactics and the strategy, which enables it to carry out its mission\" and \"to admit the possibility of a reformist 'way' to socialism placed on a level with the revolutionary way\". \"Cahier de Communisme\" at the time likewise stressed that this means to slip into positions of Kardelj and other Jugoslav leaders, who have proclaimed the Scandinavian social-democratic way as one of the possible forms towards socialism thus erasing the radical distinction between scientific socialist ideology and social-democratic ideology which preaches reconciliation, class collaboration and peaceful integration, in other words, denunciation of socialist aims.\n\nTo deny the thesis on the role of leadership of the communist party as an essential condition of the transition to socialism, to place the communist party apart from other \"workers\", \"socialist\" parties, as the modern revisionists do, means to sever all connections with true scientific socialism and true socialist ideology, it means to renounce the principles and program of the communist party and to join and fuse with the social-democratic parties on the basis of their anti-Marxist program. And that's exactly what the revisionists are doing.\n\nThere was a time when the French Communist Party did not agree with the treacherous, throughly revisionist line of the Italian Communist Party leaders with P. Togliati in the lead. Are there today any divergences between the French Communist Party and the revisionist leaders of the Italian Communist Party? If there are, then why do they keep silent about it? Why did the French Communist Party find it so easy to attack the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labor of Albania and keep silent towards the Italian revisionists? If there are none then why doesn't it say openly that it is d'accord with them and that it had been mistaken before? Or is it because \"the conductor's baton\" beats that tune?\n\nTo keep silent, to shut your eyes to the treacherous line and behavior of the revisionists—such an attitude is not only anti-Marxist but also dangerous. It causes serious damage not only to the Italian Communist Party, which must be helped to see where Togliati's revisionism is leading it to, but also to the French Communist Party itself, to the entire communist movement. The revolutionary Marxist-Leninists are seriously alarmed at the catastrophe threatening the communist and workers parties. They can not nor should not keep their silence when a group of traitors try to lead the communist parties like the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Italian Communist Party, the French Communist Party and others into the abyss, but they should raise their voice to help the genuine communists, members of these parties, to see the danger clearly, to understand where their present revisionist leadership is leading them to, before it is too late.\n\nThere was a time when the communist parties of France and Italy were set up at the Congresses of Tours and Leghorn, as revolutionary proletarian parties of the new types, detaching themselves from the socialist parties of that time which had betrayed the interests of the working class and of socialism, and severing all connections with the opportunists and reformists of the 2nd International adopting the Marxist-Leninist conditions and program of the communist International. Now we are witnessing a reverse process. The line of demarcation set at the Tours and Leghorn Congresses is being wiped out. The attempts of the modern revisionists to join up and fuse with those they had detached themselves from—the treacherous social-democratic leaders—by making to them repeated concessions, by renouncing the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism, are becoming more and more evident. That is why the revolutionary communists of Italy and of France, as well as those of other countries, who are being threatened by the danger of revisionism, should rise up against these renegades. This is the only correct course to pursue. The attacks which the revisionist 'troika' under N. Khrushchev's leadership, are launching against the communist and workers parties, are very much like the treacherous acts of the social democrats of the 2nd International. That's why the Marxists should draw lessons from history, should pursue the revolutionary ways of former days in defense of the Marxist-Leninist party, in defense of the revolution.\n\nOn the eve of the 17th Congress of the French Communist Party finds itself on the horns of a dilemma: will it continue to give blind obedience to the 'conductor's baton' and allow the revisionist group in the leadership to plunge it definitely on the way of betrayal, or will it break the conductor's baton, correct its mistake, and return to the heroic revolutionary road of Marxism-Leninism?\n\nMany leaders of the French Communist Party have hurled insolent words and made impudent charges against the Party of Labour of Albania and its leadership. This we will not forget. Eventually, if not today, tomorrow, every thing will be settled in a Marxist way. We are certain that those who have acted in this manner will eventually blush with shame. We are not indebted to the French Communist Party. Its leaders are indebted to the Party of Labor of Albania. Nevertheless, we sincerely call on the French Communist Party to turn to the way of revolution, before it is too late, for the good of the French people, of the French proletariat and of the international proletariat. There is its place. Those who correct their mistakes command the respect of others and enjoy the support of the communists and of all the progressive people of the world, while the traitors are loathed by everybody. They are looked down upon and mercilessly fought by all as in the case of Khrushchev's group, Tito, Togliati and their loyal companions, against all the modern revisionists.\n\nA Stop Should be Put to the Treacherous Acts of the Revisionists; the Communist Parties Should be Protected!\n\nThrough their political course and through all their practical activity, the modern revisionists, with traitor Khrushchev in the lead, have created a grave situation in many communist parties and in the international communist and workers movement. They have wrecked the internal unity of certain parties in particular and of the movement in general, and are proceeding posthaste towards social-democratic degeneration of the communist parties, are trying to lead the whole world communist movement onto an opportunist and traitorous path. This reminds one of that period when as a result of the deviation of their leaders, the parties of the 2nd International strayed away from the revolutionary path, renounced marxism, plunged definitely into the mire of opportunism and reformism, degenerated into \"bourgeois parties of the working class\".\n\nThe betrayal of the parties of the 2nd International which was expressed clearly especially during the First World War, when they crossed over openly to the social-chauvinistic camp, met—and it could help meet—with the firm resistance of the revolutionary communists with Lenin at the head. The latter, though in the minority, expressing the true fundamental interests of the working class, of the laboring masses waged a bitter struggle of principle for years on end to unmask the traitorous leaders of the 2nd International, to expose the opportunism and reformism of the parties of this International, in defence of proletarian internationalism and Marxism, for the purpose of setting up new revolutionary parties of the working class. \"It is impossible\", V.I. Lenin wrote at that time, \"to carry out the tasks of socialism at present, it is impossible to achieve true internationalist unity of workers, without a through break with opportunism, without explaining to the masses the inevitability of its failure\". Speaking of this struggle of Lenin, J.V. Stalin has written: \"Every bolshevik, if he or she is a real bolshevik knows Lenin pursued the line of separation, of breaking with the opportunists in the Social-Democratic Party of Russia, as well as in the 2nd International, especially in the German social-democracy, long before the war, approximately beginning with 1903 & 1904 when the Bolshevik group was formed in Russia and when leftist elements appeared for the first time in German Social Democracy\". (Stalin: Works, Albanian edition, vol. 13, p. 83).\n\nThe firm struggle of principle by Lenin and other revolutionary communists to smash the opportunists and traitors of the 2nd International ideologically and politically, led to further major victories of Marxism-Leninism and of the world revolutionary movement, it was crowned with the triumph of the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia, with the setting up of new revolutionary parties of the new type, and with the failure of the 2nd International and its replacement by the 3rd Communist International.\n\nToday too the betrayal of the modern revisionists, who have departed for good from Marxism-Leninism, from the principles of the revolutionary proletarian party and from the vital interests of the revolutionary proletariat and of the broad masses of workers, has met—and could not help meet—with the firm resistance and struggle of principle of the Marxist-Leninist parties and of revolutionary communists. This is a battle of major historical significance, a battle which concerns the future of the world revolutionary and liberation movement, a battle in defense of Marxism-Leninism, against revisionism, in defense of proletarian internationalism against nationalism and chauvinism, in defense of the socialist order against liberal bourgeois degeneracy, in defense of the revolutionary communist parties against social-democratic degeneration, in defense of the Marxist-Leninist unity of the communist parties, of the international communist movement and of the socialist camp, against revisionist splitters.\n\nJust as the classic writers of Marxism-Leninism and the experience of the communist movement teaches us, the only right way to respond to the challenge of the revisionists is to muster all the efforts of the Marxist-Leninists for a determined uncompromising struggle against the revisionist renegades. The blows and pressures of the revisionists, foreign and internal, cannot be warded off by pursuing a vacillating centrist line, nor by preoccupying ourselves with maintaining a false and formal unity alone. The party cannot be rescued by sobs and sighs nor should it be sacrificed for the sake of saving the \"prestige\" of any one, at a time when this \"prestige\" is being unscrupulously utilized to bury the great cause of the working class and of socialism.\n\nN. Khrushchev's group has led the leaders of many communist parties into a blind alley. He has urged them to ignore the revolutionary past of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and of their own parties, through false slanders against Stalin, he has put the old revolutionary leaders who have a brilliant past to their credit, in an embarrassing position. Many of them fell a victim to Khrushchev's line of peace and coexistence, which has now been clearly proved to be an anti-Leninist line, a line of getting closer to and collaborating with the enemies of peace and socialism—the imperialists. The tragic thing about some of them is that although they have got wise to a number of things, although they see that the line of N. Khrushchev's group is a revisionist line fraught with errors, nevertheless they do not find enough Marxist courage to tell themselves: Halt! They do not conduct themselves towards this matter as it befits them, as revolutionary Marxist-Leninists. They try to save the party in the revisionist line which is mortal to it. They try feebly to justify this road, of which they nurture doubts and are not in complete agreement, sometimes even talking in narrow circles about differences they have with N. Khrushchev. But that's all they do, they go no further, they do not take heart and bring these matters up for discussion in their parties in a Marxist-Leninist way. They agree to taking up and discussing materials sent to them by N. Khrushchev, but they are afraid to discuss in their party documents and written materials of other parties.\n\nA big struggle takes place in their innermost conscience. N. Khrushchev's group too, are at work; they have won over many adherents in the leadership of many other parties, who exert pressure, blackmail and other maneuvers to subject their parties to the conductor's baton. Following in N. Khrushchev's tracks many communist party leaders have entered into a blind ally with their political stand. It is of course right to ward off the danger that comes to world peace from western German militarism and from the imperialist Bonn-Paris axis, but it is altogether incorrect and anti-Marxist to give up the struggle against imperialism which is the main force of war and aggression, the bastion of world reaction, the greatest international gendarme and exploiter, the greatest enemy of the peoples of the world, as the 1960 Moscow Declaration has called it, under this pretext. It is correct and Marxist to fight against \"personal power\" and its consequences, but it is altogether anti-Marxist to follow blindly N. Khrushchev's pro-American policy and not to take advantage of the split that is becoming ever deeper in the imperialist camp. We know why this attitude is maintained. Of course, the bandmaster has struck that tune. But eventually, if this 'conductory' flirts with \"personal power\" for the adventuresome, anti-Marxist intentions, what will happen? Or is the bandmaster training other musicians to open the way to new adventures?\n\nThe revisionist camp is in a critical situation. Its ship has split, water is gushing in and it is foundering. N. Khrushchev's group are trying their best to avert the catastrophe. To sidetrack further exposure they are raising a hue and cry about stopping polemics which they themselves started and why they formerly considered fully justifiable, necessary and Leninist. But under present conditions, to stop polemics would mean to every true Marxist and revolutionary to join with the traitors, to create facilities for them to distort and destroy Marxism-Leninism. In his attempt to mislead people, N. Khrushchev swears by unity. But the true revolutionaries and consistent communists will not be deceived by adventurers, demagogues and splitters! Revolutionary communists observe with fidelity great Lenin's teachings, which say: \"Unity is a great issue and a major slogan. But the cause of the workers demands unity of Marxists not unity of Marxists with opponents and those who distort Marxism\" (Lenin: Works, vol. 20, p. 211, Russian edition). Now it has become clear that N. Khrushchev and his group represent just these opponents and distorters of Marxism in the present communist movement. N. Khrushchev, on his part, continues title work splitting by diverse forms, through regional meetings, bi-partite pow-wows, dictating new instructions and tasks with a view to compromising and leading over parties and their leaders further ahead towards revisionism and betrayal. It is high time for everyone to stop and think, not to obey the \"conductor's baton\", to offer resistance to the traitors in order to defend Marxism-Leninism, the socialist camp and the Soviet Union, in order to defend the great revolutionary cause of the working class.\n\nIt behooves all communists to muster all efforts and fight the imperialists headed by the American imperialists. And the struggle against modern revisionism is a constituent part of the struggle against imperialism, for it is the offspring and ally of imperialism, the manifestation in theory and practice of bourgeois ideology, imperialism's \"Trojan horse\" in the socialist camp and the international communist movement. Great Lenin's words sound more contemporary than ever today when he said that without waging a firm and consistent struggle against opportunism and revisionism, no successful struggle can be waged against imperialism. Without exposing and smashing revisionism, no revolution can be effected, no socialism and no communism can be upheld and successfully built.\n\nWe are fully confident that, just as in the past, the present fight against modern revisionists, headed by N. Khrushchev's group, will be crowned with the further success of Marxism-Leninism, of socialism and of the international revolutionary movement. The revisionists will not succeed in the turning historical revolutionary process backwards. We are witnesses to the fact that the revisionists are being more and more exposed and discredited in their own countries as well as in the international communist movement, they are meeting with defeat after defeat, while the ranks of the parties loyal to Marxism-Leninism and those of the revolutionary communists are increasing and becoming stronger, their fight against the modern revisionists more and more intensive. The complete defeat of revisionism and the triumph of Marxism-Leninism are inevitable.",
  "latent_11702": "You see their commercials n TV all the time. Colonial Penn pretty much monopolizes cable TV with their insurance dramas. One of their commercials cracks me up. It opens with a middle-aged guy sitting up in bed in the middle of the night. He can’t sleep because something is on his mind. He gets up to go check on his kids and then he makes his way downstairs to the kitchen. He’s sitting at the table when his wife comes down and asks him what he’s doing. He tells her that he is looking at the application for some life insurance.\n\nHere’s the clincher:\n\nIt’s for a $25,000 whole life insurance policy!\n\nThis guy was unable to sleep because he was worried about his family and $25,000 of life insurance is the answer.\n\nAnyway, the commercial piqued my interest so I went to the Colonial Penn website to look around. I found out that they also offer term insurance so I ran a quote for the heck of it. Here’s the quote I got for both a 5-year and 20-year term insurance policy for a 38 year-old man:\n\nA $25,000 20-year term life insurance policy runs $37.25 per month. Doesn’t seem too bad does it? Well, it’s not too good when you shop around. I went to IntelliQuote.com and did a quick quote and found out that a $25,000 20-year term policy runs around $10 per month. The same $37 monthly premium would buy you a $500,000 policy!\n\nThe only difference is that there is no medical exam required with the Colonial Penn policy, which most likely is not the case with the IntelliQuote companies. Still, I don’t think the extra $27 per month is worth not having to take a medical exam.\n\nI guess Colonial Penn has to charge so much to pay for all those commercials.",

For our 2 person engineering department, that meant we had to do a quick sanity check to see just how many people we can support concurrently.\n\nOur app uses PHP's Zend Framework 2. Our web servers are two m1.medium Ec2 machines with an ELB in front of them setup to split the load. On the backend, we're running a master/slave MySQL database configuration. Very typical for most of the small data shops I've worked at.\n\nHere are my opinions and thoughts in random order.\n\nUse PHP's APC feature . I don't understand why this isn't on by default but having APC enabled is really a requirement in order for a website to have a chance at performing well.\n\nPut everything that's not a .php request on a CDN. No need to bog down your origin server with static file requests. Our deployer puts everything on S3 and we abs path everything to CloudFront. Disclaimer: CloudFront has had some issues lately and we've recently set the site to instead serve all static materials directly from S3 until the CloudFront issues are resolved.\n\nDon't make connections to other servers in your PHP code , such as the database and memcache servers, unless it's mandatory and there's really NO other way to do what you're trying to do. I'd guess that the majority of PHP web apps out there use a MySQL database for the backend session management and a memcache pool for caching. Making connections to other servers during your execution flow is not efficient. It blocks, runs up the CPU, and tends to hold up the line, as it were. Instead, use the APC key/value store for storing data in PHP and Varnish for full page caching.\n\nI repeat... Use Varnish . In all likelihood, most of the pages on your site do not change, or hardly ever change. Varnish is the Memcache/ModRewrite of web server caching. Putting Varnish on my web server made the single biggest difference to my web app when I was load testing it.\n\nUse a c1.xlarge. The m1.medium has only 1 CPU to handle all of the requests. I found that upgrading to a c1.xlarge, which has 8 CPU's, really paid off. During my load test, I did an apt-get install nmon and then ran nmon and monitored the CPU. You can literally watch the server use all 8 of its cores to churn out pages.\n\nGoogle Analytics shows us how many seconds an average user spends on an average page. Using this information, we ran some load tests with Siege and were able to extrapolate that with the above recommendations, we should be able to handle 30,000 users concurrently per web server on the \"exterior\" of the site. For \"interior\" pages which are PHP powered, we're expecting to see something more along the lines of 1,000 concurrent sessions per server. In advance of the email blast, we'll launch a bunch of c1.xlarges and then kill them off slowly as we get more comfortable with the actual load we're seeing on blast day.\n\nFinally, we will do more work to make our code itself more scaleable... however, the code is only about 4 months old and this is the first time we've ever been challenged to actually make it scale.\n\nAbout RockThePost.com\n\nWe help entrepreneurs raise money for a new venture.

  "latent_11754": "His name means “eat bread” in Italian.\n\nBut Andrew Mangiapane is determined on ensuring critics eat their words instead.\n\nHe’s done a good job of that the last two years with the OHL’s Barrie Colts, throwing up numbers that dwarf the ones naysayers point to when his name comes up.\n\nWhile it’s tough to ignore the brilliance involved in scoring 51 goals and 106 points in 59 games this season, no stat line comes without reminders that he’s generously listed at five-foot-10, 182 pounds.\n\nHis small frame explains why he was a sixth-round pick of the Calgary Flames last summer despite putting up 104 points as an 18-year-old.\n\nIf any team knows about how a smaller, late-round pick can pay off it’s the Calgary Flames, who took Johnny Gaudreau in the fourth round, Theo Fleury in the eighth round and also gave undrafted Martin St. Louis his NHL start.\n\nIncidentally, both Mangiapane and Fleury went 166th overall.\n\nGaudreau and Mangiapane both play left wing, both are small and the Flames would love if both were in their lineup as early as next year. They were two of the most talked-about players during training camp last summer.\n\nToo bad the two never got a chance to chat last fall as Mangiapane is itching to soak up as much knowledge as possible from the NHL’s smallest player-turned biggest of stars.\n\n“I watched him all the time in camp and I’ve been watching him a lot on TV,” Mangiapane said hours after signing an entry level contract with Calgary on Wednesday.\n\n“Johnny’s a great player and growing up I would always watch Martin St. Louis. Those are the types I watch and take as many notes as I can.”\n\nComparisons to Gaudreau, while unfair, are only natural given their stature and their employer.\n\nThey’re also pretty exciting for Flames fans as the club sorely lacks high-end skilled players who can fill top-six roles.\n\nCalgary also lacks size, making Mangiapane’s future path a fascinating study.\n\n“It’s the best compliment you can get when people say I’m like Gaudreau – he’s a great player,” said Mangiapane, who finished second in OHL goal scoring and is the OHL’s current player of the month.\n\n“There are similarities as he’s got pretty good hands in tight areas, he’s small and speedy. I’ve just got to play my game, which is being hard on the puck and not afraid to get in the dirty areas. I feel like I’m a tenacious forward with good vision who can see teammates well and has pretty good shot. I definitely feel this year I had more confidence.”\n\nThat confidence grew at the Flames’ rookie camp in Penticton, B.C., last fall where Mangiapane was a stand out, earning a spot in the main camp in which he also turned plenty of heads.\n\n“I definitely felt I had a great camp, learned a lot and was happy and excited to be there learning systems and meeting new faces,” he said.\n\n“It was pretty cool to play my first exhibition game in Edmonton. Hearing the fans boo you as soon as we stepped on the ice just because you are wearing Calgary colours was awesome.”\n\nEmbracing that sort of reception is something he hopes to get used to with the Flames next year when he’ll try to crack the lineup as a 20-year-old. It’s a long shot given his size and how patient Calgary vows to be with its youngsters.\n\nThe Flames most certainly could use a player of his description to round out their top duo of Gaudreau and Sean Monahan. Outside of landing a starting goaltender, it’s Calgary’s most pressing need this summer.\n\n“My goal next year is to make Calgary and I’ll work hard and train as much as I can to do that,” said Mangiapane, who has been trying to gain weight and muscle while following nutrition guidelines provided by the Flames.\n\n“Being a smaller player the goal is always to get bigger.”\n\nMangiapane’s current focus is trying to win an OHL title, which starts on Thursday when the Colts host Game 1 of their opening playoff series against the Mississauga Steelheads.\n\n“I haven’t played with many better people than him (Mangiapane),” Colts teammate and Winnipeg Jets prospect Brendan Lemieux (son of Claude) told the Calgary Sun earlier this year.\n\n“Forget the hockey, he’s an exceptional kid and he’s a great player as well. He’s undersized and not overly flashy/skilled, but when the puck’s in the corner, he finds a way to come out with it. Some games, you may not say, ‘Wow’ and see a whole bunch of him, but he’s got two points. He’s that kind of guy that is smarter and reading the play ahead of everybody else. He’s up there with a lot of first-round picks as for where his head is.”\n\nWords to savour for Flames fans hoping Mangiapane can be part of the next wave of talented prospects pushing for NHL roster spots.\n\nMangiapane’s next step is likely in Stockton, Calif., with Calgary’s AHL affiliate, for a brief playoff stint.\n\n“This is just the beginning,” said Mangiapane, who also led the OHL with eight short-handed goals.\n\n“Signing with the Flames makes me proud and excited.”",
  "latent_12025": "There is more at stake today than who controls the Senate. There’s also the question of who controls the argument heading into 2016.\n\nTed Cruz wants to push the Republican brand to the right. Rand Paul wants to completely revamp the brand.\n\nThe contrast between these two freshmen senators, both of whom can envision themselves in the Oval Office, is a microcosm of a simmering debate within the GOP. And how it’s resolved will also affect the party’s strategy for the last two years of Barack Obama’s term.\n\nLet’s start with Rand Paul. While other Republicans have been talking up the party's prospects on the eve of what look like a successful midterm election, the Kentucky senator has a very different message.\n\n\"Our brand is broken,\" he said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"I don’t think what we stand for is bad. We have a wall, or a barrier, between us and African-American voters.\"\n\nA couple of days earlier, Paul referred to the GOP with a word you once couldn't use in polite company:\n\n“Remember Domino’s Pizza? They admitted, ‘Hey, our pizza crust sucks.’ The Republican Party brand sucks and so people don’t want to be a Republican and for 80 years, African-Americans have had nothing to do with Republicans.\n\n“Why? Because of a perception. The problem is the perception is that no one in the Republican Party cares.”\n\nSo Paul wants to throw out the pizza recipe and bake a new pie. That’s not what you expect someone’s party is poised to take over the Senate.\n\nAnd he isn’t afraid to throw a few punches. In the CBS interview, Paul took a whack at potential rival Chris Christie for yelling at a heckler:\n\n“This bully demeanor may go over well in certain places. But I grew up in the South. We’re yes ma’am and no sir, a little bit more polite.\"\n\nPaul is clearly blazing a different path and trying to establish himself as a different kind of Republican. In the process, he is ticking off other Republicans, but no matter. That’s how he keeps landing on magazine covers like Time’s as “the most interesting man in politics.” The piece centers on Paul’s “radical ambition” and his mission as a “visionary” trying to “reinvent the conservative Republican story line.”\n\nTed Cruz comes from a different place, a hard-line and often uncompromising conservative. More than any other lawmaker, he is identified with the strategy that led to last year’s government shutdown. The Texas senator doesn’t want to change the party’s recipe so much as return the GOP to its conservative roots.\n\nIf the Republicans win the Senate, Cruz told the Washington Post, he wants a series of hearings on Obama “looking at the abuse of power, the executive abuse, the regulatory abuse, the lawlessness that sadly has pervaded this administration.” That will likely happen, although the House has held many such hearings.\n\nCruz says Republicans should also “pursue every means possible to repeal ObamaCare,” Cruz said, including parliamentary procedures to overcome a Democratic filibuster. Of course, the House has voted dozens of times to repeal ObamaCare, but this Cruz approach is about drawing the sharpest possible distinctions.\n\nAnd Cruz would not pledge to back Mitch McConnell as majority leader, a clear sign that he’s not interested in being a team player unless it serves his interests. McConnell did not originally back Paul in Kentucky, but they have forged a working relationship.\n\nBuzzFeed, by the way, calls Cruz “the clear frontrunner for the Republican nomination.This is not trolling. This is serious. Conservatives vote in Republican primaries. And Cruz is really good at talking to conservatives.”\n\nDespite their stylistic differences, Cruz and Paul have something in common: They both care less about party unity than blazing a new trail. Which is why two men who were unknown to the country four years ago are now serious contenders for the presidency.\n\nPaul has not only wants to make inroads in the black community—he even visited Ferguson--he has used his libertarian cred to try to court younger voters. He’s done this by emphasizing privacy questions, for instance, when it comes to NSA surveillance. Rand has a familiar last name, thanks to his dad, the perennial presidential candidate, but still has to square his non-interventionist foreign policy in an ISIS-challenged world, an especially tough sell in the GOP.\n\nThe surgeon believes that much of the press operates on him in an unfair way. But he gives lots of interviews anyway, intuitively understanding that it’s better to try to exploit the media than to have a hostile relationship.\n\nPaul and Cruz are essentially competing in the conservative wing of the conservative party. The establishment candidate would be Christie (if he stops yelling at hecklers) or Jeb Bush (whose sons say he’s likely to run)—or else Mitt Romney (who again told Chris Wallace he’s not running, though not with the “done done done” language of his wife Ann.\n\nCruz told the Post he likes and respects Bush, “but I think we have seen election after election that when Republicans fail to draw a clear distinction with the Democrats, when we run to the mushy middle, we lose.”\n\n“At some point, after Gerald Ford and Bob Dole and John McCain and Mitt Romney . . . we shouldn’t keep making the same mistakes over and over again.”\n\nOne man wants to free his party from the moderate establishment, the other talks about how his party sucks as badly as the old Domino’s pizza. Whether Rand Paul or Ted Cruz has that special sauce is something we may find out in 2015.\n\nClick for more from Media Buzz.",
  "latent_12178": "The suffering of the people of Pakistan is largely unknown in the West. A veil of silence has been carefully drawn over the number of people killed every day by American drones and Taliban murders. But recently a small corner of the curtain was raised as the result of a particularly appalling event.\n\nMalala YousafzaiYesterday Malala Yousafzai was brutally shot by gunmen as she was returning home from school. Masked assassins stepped onto a bus filled with terrified children, identified her, and shot her at point blank range in the head and neck.\n\nWho are these men who wage war on defenceless schoolgirls? We know who they are because they have already admitted their guilt. The cowardly murderers who perpetrated this vile deed feel no need to hide away from public opinion. They feel no shame, for they are utterly shameless. The Pakistan Taliban has claimed responsibility for this act of bloodthirsty savagery.\n\nWhat crime did this fourteen year-old girl commit that could justify the taking of her life? Was she a friend of American imperialism? Did she support the occupation of Afghanistan? Was she on the side of the Pakistan government and its army?\n\nNo, she was none of those things. On the contrary, Malala was on the side of the oppressed people of Pakistan and Afghanistan and every other country. She was an enemy of imperialism, landlordism and capitalism. She stood for the cause of freedom, progress and socialism. And for that they have tried to take her young and innocent life.\n\nSwat laid waste\n\nPerhaps nowhere has the sufferings of the people of Pakistan been greater than in the mountainous area known as Swat. The Swat valley is a picturesque place that was famed for its music and tolerance. It used to be a favourite holiday and honeymoon destination. Now it has been laid waste by a war characterised by the utmost savagery on all sides.\n\nBecause of its proximity with Afghanistan, this beautiful region has been plunged into a bloody war, in which the Pakistan army, the Taliban and US imperialism have vied with each other to win domination.\n\nFirst the Taliban seized control. They made life a hell for the people of Swat, forcing men to grow beards, beheading their opponents, imposing sharia law and other reactionary measures to keep the masses in a state of ignorance and illiteracy in which they would be more easily dominated by the mullahs and religious fanatics.\n\nIn one incident the Taliban killed 14 people in one village and hanged their bodies from the trees as a warning. Only two people dared to bury the bodies. Later they began to organize resistance to the terrorists and they are now members of the IMT. Despite all the difficulties and dangers, the comrades of the International Marxist Tendency in Swat organized a very successful Marxist School this summer, from July 13th to July 15th.\n\nThe school was attended by more than 225 comrades from all over the country. Even some soldiers were present. Also present was comrade Malala Yousafzai, who spoke in the debates. She was full of confidence and enthusiasm in the just cause for which she was fighting.\n\nNow, not three months later, she is fighting for her life in an intensive care ward in a Peshawar hospital, with a bullet lodged close to her brain.\n\nReactionary nature of the Taliban\n\nThere are those in the West who consider themselves “lefts” who think it is right to support the Taliban, allegedly because they are “fighting imperialism”. Here we have ignorance and cynicism combined in equal proportions.\n\nThe Taliban and other such reactionary outfits were never anti-imperialists. In the past they were sponsored, armed and financed by imperialism, which used them as a tool against the Soviet army in Afghanistan. Then the western media described them as “freedom fighters”. Now they describe them as terrorists. In fact they were counterrevolutionary terrorists then, and they are counterrevolutionary terrorists now.\n\nReactionary movements like the Taliban are intimately linked to the landlords and capitalists. They defend the interests, not of the poor, but of the wealthy merchants, money-lenders, landlords and drug smugglers. It is an open secret that they are financed, armed and, to a great extent, controlled by elements in the Pakistan state and the notorious intelligence service, the ISI.\n\nTo the extent that they are opposed to the American presence in Afghanistan, it is because their masters in the ISI are seeking to turn Afghanistan into a colony of Pakistan. This would not represent an advance for the suffering people of Afghanistan, only the exchange of one brutal foreign oppressor for another.\n\nThe struggle against imperialism can only be successful if it is led by the working people under the guidance of a revolutionary Marxist party. The real way to defeat the imperialists is to root out their points of support – the corrupt landowners and capitalists. The fight against the foreign oppressors can only be successful if it is linked to the overthrow of landlordism and capitalism.\n\nThe Pakistan Marxists have consistently exposed the close connections between the Islamic fundamentalists and the Pakistani state. That has earned them the undying hatred of the Taliban, who fear, quite correctly, that the spreading influence of revolutionary Marxism is undermining them.\n\nIn Swat our comrades have organized the local masses against these reactionaries. As a result many comrades have been the victims of fundamentalist terrorism. One comrade had eight bullets from a G-3 rifle pumped into him. The comrades reported that “only his will power and hatred of a repressive state and the Taliban counterrevolutionaries kept him alive”.\n\nMalala’s heroism\n\nAfter the horrors of the Taliban occupation, the Pakistani Army swept into the valley causing mayhem. That offensive uprooted an estimated 1.2 million Swat residents. The army has also been guilty of human rights abuses, including murder, torture and the massacre of prisoners. The ordinary people were, as usual, caught in between.\n\nThe Taliban counterrevolutionaries were particularly opposed to women playing any role in society other than that of domestic slaves. They wanted to prevent girls from going to school. Such was their fanatical hatred of learning that they destroyed schools and murdered schoolteachers. Malala’s father was the head of the last girls' school to be closed.\n\nDuring the occupation of Swat by the Taliban in 2009, Malala, then 11 years old, spoke out against the closure of girls' schools. At a time when the cowardly politicians in Islamabad were busy appeasing the Taliban, she spoke out against them. She wrote a blog for BBC Urdu under a pseudonym. She has subsequently continued to speak up against the Taliban, an action that took tremendous courage on her part. They began to threaten her, but she continued her defiant struggle, which took on an increasingly conscious and political character.\n\nThe Taliban leaders put out false information, accusing her of being pro-Obama and pro-Western. That is a lie. Although she was fundamentally opposed to the counterrevolutionary Taliban, comrade Malala was also opposed to US imperialism and the corrupt bourgeois regime in Pakistan. Her sympathies lay in a different direction altogether: with revolutionary socialism and internationalism.\n\nOf course, at this point it suited the bourgeois that someone like her should expose the crimes of the Taliban. She was given the national peace prize in 2011. But then the bourgeois sources go quiet on her activities. The news reports of her attempted assassination make oblique references to her growing interest in politics, but they do not say what these politics consisted of. In fact, she was a sympathiser of the IMT.\n\nThis is not hard to understand. At the present time, the Pakistan section of the IMT is the only organized Left force that exists in Swat. Over the past few years our ranks have been swelled by an influx of former members of the Communist Party who have remained loyal to the ideas of Marx and Lenin and who are continuing to struggle for socialism despite all the dangers.\n\nThe report of the Marxist school in Swat, which we published in Marxist.com, concluded: “This school has given us great energy and strength to fight for the ideas of scientific socialism which could provide an alternate to religious fundamentalism and bourgeois liberalism”.\n\nA Taliban spokesman, Ehsanullah Ehsan, confirmed by phone that Malala had been the target, calling her crusade for education rights an “obscenity.” The real obscenity is a society that is based on the slavery of millions of workers and peasants and treats women as slaves of slaves. The real obscenity is child labour and illiteracy, poverty, disease and ignorance. And these are precisely the things the Taliban wishes to perpetuate.\n\nMalala is one of the many outstanding young comrades who are looking for a way out of the present infernal impasse by taking the revolutionary road. In so doing she was well aware of the risks. She was prepared to put her life at hazard to fight for such basic human rights as education. And she has paid a heavy price.\n\nEvery class conscious worker in the world will keenly feel the tragedy of a young girl shot down in cold blood by a cowardly assassin for the crime of demanding rights for women. Our hearts bleed for the suffering of her family, friends and comrades. We fervently wish for her recovery.\n\nThis vicious attack will not deter us from our task. By exposing the baseness and cruelty of our enemies, which is only the distilled essence of the baseness and cruelty of the society that spawned these monsters, it will steel our resolve to continue the fight for which comrade Malala made such a great sacrifice.\n\nNow more than ever the only choice for humanity is: socialism or barbarism. It is a choice between the forces of darkness and light, between ignorance and knowledge, between savagery and civilization. It is an easy choice to make, and Malala made it. Let her life and courage be an example to us all.\n\nDown with the murderous counterrevolutionaries! Down with imperialism!\n\nLet us fight for justice for all, for a life free from ignorance, violence and oppression.\n\nLet us step up the fight for a better future in a socialist world.\n\nLondon 10 October 2012",

All three products launched in the United States on Feb. 13, and even with only 17 days of data being reported they were able to accomplish the following:\n\nIn its 48th month on the market, the Nintendo 3DS family sold nearly 395,000 units in the U.S. The great majority of these sales were New Nintendo 3DS XL systems, which sold 130 percent more units in its initial frame than Nintendo 3DS XL did when it launched on Aug. 19, 2012.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask 3D was the top-selling title for the month with more than 515,000 combined physical and digital units sold.

  "latent_12465": "Team LNCR: (The Freelancers)\n\nTeam specifications.\n\n(Written By Sabre Allicia =^~^=)\n\nJourney said he's going to publish this as its own (Super-Secret-Behind-The-Scenes) chapter… :o Oh gosh… Yea, this is how I write things up to help myself when I write other things up.\n\nSo yea, this is a behind-the-scenes of what goes into planning characters when I'm doing things.\n\nI wrote this all up about 2 and a bit months ago for Journey, so don't be surprised if it's all a bit random, and spaced out strangely, since this is all laid out for me to get stuff for writing. (I've gone through and updated all this, so hopefully it isn't as erratic anymore…)\n\nMost of this stuff probably will never even come up, but when I make up characters, it helps to have them *fully* established in my head. Hence why I have specs on their weapons, past, and I even cameoed a fictional company I created as their employer. Again, this is all my random rambling, irrelevant jazz I've done up. In my defence, it's questionable quality, I wrote this all up in about two nights of straight brainstorming. It's weird, and strange; but trust me, it works. XD)\n\nTeam LNCR (Lancer), also known as 'The Freelancers' are a team of extremely skilled Huntsmen and Huntresses that graduated Beacon Academy some time before the events of the narrative. Sometime after graduation, LNCR was offered a confidential deal with a corporation called Sy-Nex DevCorp (Synthesis Nexus Development Corporation), to be part of the 'Valkyrie Four' program, during which, each member was implanted a VI. (Virtual Intelligence) During this time, the team gained an almost legendary status amongst other teams and citizens alike.\n\nAs of now, they continue to operate and function as a team with precision efficiency, doing special operations for Sy-Nex alongside conventional Hunter work.\n\nAll four are equipped with \"Mjolnir\" armour. State-of-the-art armoured powered exoskeletons with integrated command-and-control interfaces. Allow for real-time information to flow between teammates, comes with an integrated HUD implant in the eye. Show enemy analysis as well as Aura levels for self and team.\n\nHUD colour customisable.\n\nThe whole team's weapons, equipment and armour are said to have been master-crafted by a weapons architect from the Silvera family.\n\nIf you would like any other information on Tex, Carolina, Washington, or Maine, feel free to check out the Red vs. Blue wiki.\n\nTexas: The one who refuses to lose again.\n\nRole: All round fighting boss\n\nAppearance: Always seen wearing a helmet. Wears jet black armour with no accent colours. Mjolnir gauntlets are custom made to accommodate her personal weapons.\n\nVI: Omega\n\nVI Equipment: Thermal Optical Camouflage. (Cloaking)\n\nSemblance: Juggernaut. (Super strength. No visual cue when used.)\n\nWeapon: Non Valeant ('Don't say goodbye' in Latin) - Gauntlet mounted machineguns. Knuckles on gauntlet have a raised angled protrusion, for that added brutality in Close Quarters Combat.\n\nSerrated combat blade.\n\nPersonality: Cold, determined, merciless and one who operates with ruthless efficiency when during an operation, Agent Texas is arguably the best overall member of LNCR, and the most dangerous. She excels in all fields of combat, being an excellent marksman, and a near unbeatable hand-to-hand combat expert.\n\nOutside of combat, she shows honour and somewhat of a caring side. (But only on the odd occasion.) Acts scornful on occasion, specifically when annoyed. (Hell hath no fury…)\n\nIn her time at Beacon, a spar between her and Carolina in the school hangar destroyed no less than five airships.\n\nDespite the fierce rivalry between Carolina and Texas, Tex openly shows her respect to her comrade, and is more than happy to work alongside her teammates, to accomplish the objective.\n\nRumours speculated in hushed whispers around the kingdom from people who have claimed to see her injured, claim that she may have numerous cybernetic or robotic implants. Passing between robotic arms, leg implants, etc. The stories are never quite the same.\n\nThis has yet to be confirmed. As far as Sy-Nex is concerned, Texas, and any other member of LNCR, are all still human.\n\nCarolina: The one who always seeks to win.\n\nRole: Specialised close quarters, adept at range.\n\nAppearance: Cyan coloured armour. Hair colour: Red.\n\nVI: Eta and/or Iota.\n\nVI Equipment: Distorter. (Chameleon like cloaking that disorientates opposition)\n\nSemblance: Acceleration. (Speed. Surrounded in a dull turquoise glow when used.)\n\nWeapon: Prodigy - Dual collapsible bladed shock staff. Staff blade collapses into the handle, and leaves the electric emitter purely exposed (for that added flash fry) Electric aspect powered by dust. Effectively a long staff, with Glaive-like blades at both ends. In the core of each blade, is an electricity emitter. Staff can split in half, for diversity in combat and allows for dual wielding with each half.\n\nGrapple hook (used in combat with application of creativity)\n\nStandard magnum handgun.\n\nPersonality: A woman with ambition. Knows how to have fun. Sometimes.\n\nDownright irritable when stressed but aside from that, handles stress well.\n\nExpert tactician, proficient and adept with dealing with the entire spectrum of combat situations.\n\nIs rumoured to have been implanted with two VI. Her, the rest of team LNCR, and Sy-Nex developments, have refused to comment on the matter. The topic of VI's and specifically their implantation is highly classified.\n\nOnce used her grapple gun to swing Maine (To his protest) into an enemy target. That target is now incapable of moving any extremity below his shoulders.\n\nConstantly competes with Texas, sometimes even placing priority of the mission below beating her. Is more noticeably affected by anger and irritation than Texas.\n\nHolds her comrade's safety in a higher regard than a mission. But not over something she becomes obsessed with.\n\nBecomes obsessed with finishing or completing a certain objective when it takes root in her mind. When in such a focused state, nothing else matters, not herself and not her friends.\n\nDistrusts strangers and people she does not know. Is weary around such people.\n\nSometimes can become blinded by emotion such as rage or anger, leading to the odd rash decision. (Which hasn't gotten her killed. Yet.)\n\nWashington: The one who has touched insanity.\n\nRole: Specialised ranged combatant, proficient at hand to hand.\n\nAppearance: Dark grey armour with Yellow accents. Hair colour: Blonde.\n\nVI: Epsilon.\n\nVI Equipment: Electronic Magnetic Pulse Emitter. (Annoyed when people pronounce it 'emp')\n\nSemblance: Deadeye. (Gun glows with a flaming gold effect. Major gun damage and accuracy buff.)\n\nWeapon: Reconcile - Wash's beloved rifle. A rifle that fires in a three round burst. Wash's\n\npreferred weapon. Capable of scoring critical hits at most ranges in any situation.\n\nIs capable of firing in single, or burst fire and is able to accommodate specialized ammunition such as Impulse or Polonium rounds.\n\nStandard Magnum handgun.\n\nPersonality: Somewhat of the most down-to-earth person in the team. He is logical, somewhat of a pedantic and can be a real cynic but is never one to shy away from duty. Only occasionally question it.\n\nHe is an expert marksman and holds many Beacon records relating to shooting.\n\nOnce shot a Nevermore in the eye after being launched off the individual launch pads on a dare. Holds more loyalty towards Carolina than Texas, however, will ultimately follow whoever's orders he agrees with more. Shows lapses in his sense of morals (which are questionable already)\n\nIs good friends with Maine, and is the only one who can convince him to see sense when he is enraged.\n\nRespects both Tex and Carolina as leaders and as comrades.\n\nEpsilon appears to sometimes give Wash annoyance, sending flashes and jolts of data through his head. His somewhat measure of insanity is due to Epsilon attempting (and failing) to commit suicide inside Washington's head. As Epsilon's state decayed, so too did Washington's mind. After an extensive (and highly classified) process, both were successfully recovered. As such, Washington is also the most in sync with his VI, both sharing a deeper mental link than any other pairing. Whether or not Washington wants this or not, appears to be irrelevant.\n\nMaine: The one with brutal efficiency.\n\nRole: Specialised Close quarters and heavy weapons. Expert at hand to hand, adept at ranged heavy weapons.\n\nAppearance: White armour with orange accents. Hair: Bald\n\nVI: Sigma.\n\nVI Equipment: Short Ranged Temporal Distortion. (Short range teleportation)\n\nSemblance: Juggernaut. (Super strength. Emanates a small, dull flame effect. Most noticeable in visor.)\n\nWeapon: Brutus - An Explosive dust projector that is capable of multiple detonation types and styles. Has a large blade/knife attached to the base. (Looks similar to the Brute Shot as I can't think of a more effective design.)\n\nPersonality: Maine is the one of the group you don't fuck around with. With a reputable temper, and the strength to match, he is the most impulsive and primal in behaviour of the group.\n\nNo one has ever heard him talk, he communicates to his team via growling or grunting. Or he did, until one mission undertaken by LNCR resulted in Maine receiving some kind of injury, which rendered him incapable of speech. Now, communication between him and the rest of the team is tasked to his VI Sigma.\n\nSome say he, with the help of his semblance, lifted and threw a Sy-Nex experimental tank, after it broke-down in a hangar, blocking the team's gunship from deploying.\n\n*There you go guys!

  "latent_12556": "Earthquake-prediction techniques could help develop a way to forecast epileptic seizures, according to research which found striking similarities between the electrical activity in the brain before and during seizures and seismological data around earthquakes.\n\nBoth are usually preceded by small, barely detectable tremors and, as with an earthquake, the longer it has been since a seizure, the longer it will be until the next one. According to scientists, these shared features mean that the patterns are not random and could even be governed by similar mathematical rules.\n\nEpilepsy comprises a set of conditions which disrupt the electrical activity in the brain and the main symptoms are recurrent, unprovoked seizures. It is one of the most common long-term neurological disorders, affecting 456,000 people in the UK and around 50 million worldwide.\n\nThe condition can often be controlled by drugs that damp down the brain's electrical activity, although surgery to remove the affected part of the brain is sometimes used in the most hard-to-treat cases.\n\nSeizures often start suddenly in a region of the brain and can then spread to engulf the organ. An earthquake also appears as a sudden, potentially damaging vibration focused around a relatively well-defined point. The researchers said both seizures and earthquakes could be thought of as \"relaxation events\", in which accumulated energy is suddenly dissipated.\n\nIn their study researchers led by neurologist Ivan Osorio from the University of Kansas showed the frequency of both earthquakes and epileptic seizures could be described by \"power laws\", which can often explain the frequency of events that, on the surface, seem random. In earthquake prediction power laws link the size of an individual quake with the time that passes between quakes of that size.\n\nOsorio suggested that the similarities between electrical activity in the brain and seismic activity could bring prediction and prevention of seizures a step closer. \"This suggests a novel research direction for the prediction of seizures based on the notion that seizures beget seizures,\" he wrote in a paper uploaded to the Arxiv website, where scientists swap research findings before they undergo peer-review.\n\nMatthew Walker of the experimental epilepsy group at University College London told New Scientist magazine that the research was an \"attractive concept\", adding that \"a good predictive method could revolutionise people's lives\". But he cautioned that the Kansas team had yet to show that its method worked in practice.",
  "latent_12572": "A couple of years ago, VMware made the decision to focus our vCloud Director development efforts on public cloud use cases and prioritize vRealize Automation (previously vCloud Automation Center) for private cloud use cases. As a result of this shift, we are using and leveraging vCloud Director to provide the compute service in vCloud Air, and our service provider partners in the vCloud Air Network are using the product to stand up compatible VMware-based public clouds. A side effect of this strategy is that vCloud Director is no longer available (since version 5.6) to our traditional customers buying perpetual licenses.\n\nIronically, not only is vCloud Director alive and prospering, but we are hearing many enterprise customers want to continue to use it to cover specific use cases around test/dev and lab management.\n\nWhile we invite customers to continue to provide and voice their feedback to us to better understand their actual needs, vCloud Air provides lots of value to customers looking to support these use cases.\n\nThe idea is that if you like how vCloud Director works, what it delivers, and how it provides logically isolated pools of resources, you can keep the same experience by subscribing to vCloud Air. By leveraging “vCD-as-a-Service” with vCloud Air, you can avoid having the “low level plumbing” in your on-premises private cloud, while keeping the focus on your own workloads. In other words, it is possible (and sometimes convenient) to move a lab environment to vCloud Air and gain the benefits of an Opex cost model versus a Capex model.\n\nProvided this solution isn’t a direct replacement for customers that have vCD on-premises and would like to keep it, we believe that the nature of the use cases fits perfectly within the characteristics of a public cloud delivery model.\n\nAt a very high level, this diagram shows how cloud resources are consumed in vCloud Air, while the role of admins managing the cloud and consumers using the resources remain the same:\n\nHere are some reasons why this may be appealing:\n\nThe user experience in vCloud Air, from an end-user’s perspective (think Org Admin role), is going to be largely similar if not identical compared to what they had on-premises. The user will have access to the vCloud Director portal.\n\nWe have recently introduced features in vCloud Director that are only exposed via APIs. This may be a problem for customers that would like to use those features but don’t want to build a UI. The vCloud Air UI covers some of this out-of-the-box without any additional customer investment.\n\nThere is (almost) complete compatibility of APIs. If your internal users (think Org Admin role) wrote a tool to automate the resources in their Orgs, it will likely work completely un-modified against vCloud Air. There are some small caveats that apply, primarily because vCloud Air is actually ahead of delivery of new features into vCloud Director.\n\nThe migration of templates and vApps from on-premises to vCloud Air is highly simplified since we are using the very same stack and format in both endpoints.\n\nEnterprise customers can get out of the business of curating the lifecycle of an on-premises setup. While this isn’t a problem unique to VMware, managing a private cloud is known to be a fairly time consuming task. By consuming vCloud Director online, the customer will no longer need to waste time on infrastructure upgrades and similar projects.\n\nAs a result of the above, people can focus on more meaningful tasks than (e.g.) checking compatibility matrixes to find out which version of product A works with which version of product B. We have teams of engineers working on this to deliver vCloud Air services (with uptime SLAs).\n\nSimilarly, this model is very much inline with the new role of IT being a broker of resources. The team currently in charge with managing the environment (think Cloud Admin role) can focus on what matters the most and how to best serve their “internal users” providing added value services instead of spending time fixing the infrastructure.\n\nSecurity remains a top concern with public cloud computing. Placing your test/dev and lab environments in vCloud Air is a great way to begin your hybrid cloud journey without exposing your department to too much risk. As your comfort and exposure to public clouds increases, you will be able to make decisions about production workloads next.\n\nWe have proven this hosted model for lab environments to work very well in the past 7-8 years. Hands-On Labs anyone? Customers can also instantiate nested environments in vCloud Air.\n\nIn a vCloud Director-as-a-Service scenario, a customer has the option of choosing between a subscription model or a PAYGO (aka OnDemand) model depending on the commercial approach that best fits their consumption patterns. This provides a great deal of flexibility (particularly compared to a standard very rigid CAPEX model). This concept is particularly intriguing for test/dev and lab management scenarios where the consumption pattern may vary substantially over the course of the day, week, month, quarter and/or year.\n\nWhat we have covered so far are the “pros” for making the move. There are clearly some caveats that need to be taken into account. Some of them are listed here:\n\nCustomers that have created vCloud Director extensions won’t be able to bring them to vCloud Air.\n\nIf your company considers your data/workloads unsuitable for public clouds, a true on-premises private cloud is the only solution.\n\nSome typical cloud admin knobs are intentionally unavailable in vCloud Air. For example, customers won’t be able to configure the service to use Linked Clones.\n\nThere may be obviously other reasons but, for the large part, we think that a lot of vCloud Director customers could find this solution appealing and fitting.\n\nLast but not least, to make it even more appealing, most of what we have discussed above applies to our hundreds of vCloud Air Network partners too.\n\nI think this is exciting. What do you think?\n\nFor more information about vCloud Air OnDemand, visit vcloud.vmware.com, and keep an eye on the blog for upcoming tips and best practices for using vCloud Air.\n\nBe sure to follow our social channels at @vCloud and Facebook.com/vmwarevcloud for the latest updates.",

The area will now become known internationally as Mayo International Dark Sky Park.\n\nIt is one of two regions, alongside Kerry, to be awarded the top star-gazing distinction for its relatively low light pollution and opportunity to see far-off galaxies in space without interference.\n\n“A gold tier classification is an honour reserved for the most exceptional of dark skies and stunning nightscapes,” said a spokesman for the International Dark-Sky Association. “This recognition completes the 360 degree experience that this stunning region has to offer.”\n\nMayo is one of the least densely populated areas in Ireland, with the remote Ballycroy and Nephin regions miles from any sizeable town.\n\nThe spokesman said that the award is “a wonderful recognition for the region’s pristine skies, enhancing its existing protected landscapes and wilderness regions”.\n\nAnd there now looks set to be a Mayo Dark-Sky Festival between 28-30 October with a schedule of dark sky events and educational programs from Ballycroy National Park.\n\nBallycroy National Park and the adjoining Wild Nephin Wilderness expand over 110 square kilometers of mountainous Atlantic blanket bog and forest. Viewing sites for visiting astronomers have been designated and graded by ease of access and facilities available. Signature viewing sites include the Claggan Mountain Boardwalk, Letterkeen Bothy and Ballycroy National Park Visitor Centre, which have excellent interpretive and parking facilities.\n\n“Ballycroy National Park and Wild Nephin are honored to have received Gold-tier International Dark Sky Park status,” said National Parks and Wildlife Service Regional Manager, William Cormacan. “We are fully committed to preserving our pristine dark skies and are excited by the many opportunities that this accreditation will present for local tourism, businesses and the park.”\n\nThe Mayo Dark-Sky designation follows a lengthy period of night sky surveying and quality monitoring by students of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology. Assisted by Professor Brian Espey of Trinity College Dublin’s astrophysics department, the research resulted in collaboration among communities in Newport, Ballycroy and Mulrannny together with Ballycroy National Park, Coillte Forestry, Mayo County Council, Mayo South West Development and the Galway Astronomy Club. The group formed the “Friends of Mayo Dark-Skies” steering committee and submitted the application for dark sky status earlier this year.\n\nOnline Editors",
  "latent_12656": "Photo\n\nUnless Congress can reach a budget agreement by March 1, the country’s national parks will be hit by a $110 million budget cut, resulting in shuttered campgrounds, shorter seasons, road closings and reduced emergency services, a parks advocacy group reports.\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park will close four campgrounds. The Grand Canyon National Park will shorten visitor center hours at the South Rim. Cape Cod National Seashore in Massachusetts will close its visitors center and restrict access to large sections of the Great Beach. And Yosemite and Yellowstone will delay summer road openings up to four weeks, according to the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees, which said it obtained the details from sources in the park service.\n\nJeffrey Olson, a National Park Service spokesman, confirmed that the information in the coalition’s statement was accurate. “We hope it doesn’t come to pass,” he said.\n\nThe park service itself has warned that the public should be prepared for reduced hours and services, including the “closing of camping, hiking and other recreational areas when there is insufficient staff to ensure the protection of visitors, employees, and historic, cultural and natural resources.”\n\nPark advocates like the coalition of former employees are urging Congress to prevent the cuts, which it estimates would slice 5 percent from the park service’s $2.2 billion budget.\n\nJoan Anzelmo, a spokeswoman for the retirees group, pointed out that America’s 398 national parks and monuments attract 280 million visitors a year, and that consumer spending at the parks supports 247,000 jobs and yields a $31 billion economic impact. “Congress should be strategic, and if you’re going to be strategic, you don’t cut the revenue generators,” she said.\n\nBeyond providing revenue, she said, visitors “have a deep, emotional connection to the parks. They’re our heritage. But if we relied on today’s Congress, there would be no Yellowstone, there would be no Grand Canyon, because they can’t put aside their partisan differences to get their job done.”\n\nAny entity that receives federal money, like school districts and military bases, is subject to the automatic federal budget cuts known as sequestration. The former park employees say that the effects would be severe because the cuts would be made over the seven remaining months of the 2013 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30.\n\nChuck Neal, a retired ecologist with the Department of the Interior, which oversees the park service, said he worried that reduced staffing at the parks could “open opportunities for local, hooligan-types to create some mischief, such as poaching and harassing wildlife.”\n\nMore broadly, conservationists see the looming cuts as part of a worrisome trend that undervalues natural resources like parks. “That trend has been in the works for some time, starting with Reagan,” Mr. Neal said. In his view, President Obama has not reversed it.\n\nState and local officials also worry about the impact on their economies. Tourism is the “No. 2 industry in Wyoming, and Yellowstone is a big part of that,” said Renny MacKay, a spokesman for Gov. Matt Mead of Wyoming.\n\nRick Howe, director of visitor services at the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce, said that businesses in communities adjacent to Yellowstone were working with the state on contingency plans. He declined to offer specifics on whether, for example, state money could be used to plow park roads so that they opened on schedule.\n\nMs. Anzelmo said the coalition released the details of how the cuts would affect the parks to alert the public and to send a message to Congress. “This is America. Come on, run the country,” she said.",

  "latent_13031": "The Journal piece was an interview with the Nobel Prize-winning Princeton University economist Angus Deaton; two years ago, Deaton and his wife and fellow Princeton economist, Anne Case, burst into prominence with a rigorous study on the rising death rate of white Americans. That is, after centuries of mostly steady decline, the white death rate had been rising since the late 1990s.\n\nIn fact, the additional deaths among white middle- and working-class Americans—some 488,500, mostly from opioid abuse, suicide, alcoholism and other deadly forms of despond—exceeded the deaths from AIDS in the ’80s and ’90s, when the disease in the U.S. was at its worst.\n\nAnd yet as Deaton and Case observed, in contrast to the AIDS crisis, this latter plague was a “quiet epidemic.” That is, the mainstream media wasn’t much interested in what was happening in the heartland, nor was the popular culture, nor was, even, the political class—including those politicians who were supposed to be representing those afflicted areas. So there were few vigils, no quilts, no Broadway plays—not much of anything, except sorrow. Indeed, even now, a scan of the headlines and top stories reveals that this epidemic doesn’t trouble the big media hubs.\n\nStill, awareness is growing; just on Sunday, the White House issued a report indicating that the cost of the opioids epidemic for just a single year, 2015, was $504 billion. That estimate was mostly the direct cost of, and the loss of output from, the 33,000 Americans who died of overdoses that year, and yet it also included the costs of treatment for non-fatal incidents.\n\nAs Deaton told the Journal, “Bad things are really happening, and they’re continuing to happen.” Detailing his and his wife’s research, he added,\n\nWe dug down a lot more into the educational differences and found that it is very much a two-Americas situation, where people with bachelor’s degrees are doing pretty well and those without them aren’t doing very well at all. . . . Sustained increases in mortality for any major group in any society are really quite rare. It’s an indication that something is very wrong.\n\nIn particular, Deaton pointed to the abusive skyrocketing of OxyContin, a drug that didn’t even exist until 1995, when it was released by Purdue Pharma. That company has racked up quite a record—a record, that is, of massive profitability amidst mass lethality. As a detailed account in The Guardian noted recently:\n\nFrom 1996 to 2002, Purdue more than doubled its sales force and distributed coupons so doctors could let patients try a 30-day free supply of these highly addictive drugs. Prescriptions issued for OxyContin in the US increased tenfold over those six years, from 670,000 a year to more than six million.\n\nIt’s important to acknowledge that what Purdue did was legal, or mostly legal; the company was fined $600 million in 2007, although that fine was a pittance compared to its OxyContin profits. And in any case, legality is not the same thing as morality.\n\nAs a 2009 bulletin from the American Public Health Association headlined, “The promotion and marketing of OxyContin: commercial triumph, public health tragedy.” Just in October, The New Yorker magazine described Purdue’s owners, the Sacklers, as “the family that built an empire of pain.”\n\nSo there we have it: A corporation and its owners made billions, and hundreds of thousands of people died (Note to those libertarians who wish to decriminalize, or even legalize, drugs: This is what you’ll get. That is, some of the smartest chemists in the world will be teaming up with the wiliest marketers to produce products that will turn people into addicts and, possibly soon thereafter, corpses).\n\nYet finally, a few populist heroes are now willing to fight these corporate emperors of pain. In May 2017, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, a Republican, filed suit against Purdue and four other drugmakers for mass-producing misery and mortality. As DeWine said:\n\nThese companies got thousands and thousands of Ohioans–our friends, our family members, our co-workers, our kids–addicted to opioid pain medications, which has all too often led to use of the cheaper alternatives of heroin and synthetic opioids.\n\nAnd others, too, have filed lawsuits. Good.\n\nYet Deaton believes that combating opioids, important as that might be, is not enough. As he told the Journal, the drugs are just the symptom; the root cause, and thus the real disease, is economic collapse:\n\nIf you’re digging into what the underlying causes are, we are beginning to speculate about working-class whites possibly having the pillars that held up their lives beginning to crumble.\n\nAnd what pillars were these? Deaton’s answer included such familiar-sounding points as “having a job with a ladder up,” and “having job where you could actually ask a woman to marry you and she would marry you.” In other words, the basic building blocks of a stable life—a job with prospects for upward mobility and a family to bolster personal stability.\n\nIf those points seem to be familiar clichés, well, that’s because many clichés have, in fact, a firm basis in reality. It doesn’t take an expert to see that if young people don’t earn enough to move away from home and strike out on their own, they are a lot less likely to form a serious relationship with either work or another person. And it’s that lack of attachment that often leaves people defenseless against the impulse toward unsafe behavior. We can add that this is Conservative Wisdom 101; people crave the security of sturdy order—and if they can’t get it, they’ll crave something else.\n\nSo what to do? Among Deaton’s suggestions was a restoration of the “social contract.” That is, the basic positive relationship between people and society, starting with a good job that pays good wages. That’s how one gets going on the American Dream.\n\nAnd yet as many Americans have discovered—and this is another story that the MSM was never much interested in, especially not during the Clinton and Obama years—it’s a fact that wages for many have been flat for most of the last half-century.\n\nThis is a change from the historic American pattern. In fact, not that long ago, before the vast inflation of real estate prices in many areas, a short-order cook could reasonably expect to buy a house and support a family. But today, what are the prospects for a Starbuck barista?\n\nFor his part, Deaton cites various factors in the waning of wages, including the erosion of the minimum wage, and also the rise of non-compete clauses, which have the effect of locking in working stiffs, not just hotshots. As a Baltimore Sun headline explained earlier this year, “Employers use non-compete agreements even for low-wage workers.”\n\nDeaton also added a factor that’s been nearly forgotten—labor unions:\n\nMany people have mixed views about unions, but unions used to give people some measure of control at work. They gave them a social life and political representation in Washington, which doesn’t really exist anymore.\n\nYes, as Deaton conceded, labor unions have their share of detractors, including many, if not most, Republicans. And yet it’s hard for Americans of any party not to notice that the collapse of private-sector unionism—from more than a third of the workforce after World War Two to around six percent today—has coincided with the flattening of wages and the increasing of pathologies. So if one hates unions, one must then find other ways of raising incomes. If not, the deaths, and other ills, seem destined to continue.\n\nSome will say that part of the problem of flatlining wages, of course, is that economic growth has been slow. And that’s true: In fact, growth was much higher in the ’50s and ’60s than it has been in the decades since. And yet growth hasn’t been that slow: Today, the GDP of the nation is $19.5 trillion, more than double what it was two decades ago. Indeed, that much GDP works out to about $60,000 per person. That’s not per worker, that’s per person.\n\nSo the question arises: Where has all that money gone? The quick answer: That wealth is now in the hands of very rich Americans, and also in the hands of foreign workers.\n\nHere at home, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve, the top one percent now control 38.6 percent of all the nation’s wealth, and the top ten percent now control most of the rest. In the meantime, the bottom nine-tenths have less than 23 percent of the wealth, down from 33 percent three decades ago.\n\nOne needn’t be any sort of class warrior, nor an income redistributionist, to see that there’s something wrong with this picture. That is, if we’re to have a united country, in which Americans from the bottom 90 percent undertake the burden of all the hard work—virtually all the key civic duties of soldiering, policing, and firefighting, for example—then we’re going to have some more equity as to incomes and wealth.\n\nVirgil hastens to add that this is not an argument for tax increases. As we all know, raising taxes tends to make the D.C. Swamp even swampier. The goal shouldn’t be to put more money in the hands of Deep State bureaucrats, nor of their Beltway Bandit contractor-cronies; instead, the goal should be to empower private-sector workers to demand higher wages from their private-sector employers.\n\nYet on that score—the power of workers to carve out a bigger share of the pie—the biggest inhibiting factors have been immigration and trade. That is, if U.S. employers have the option of bringing in cheap labor from other countries, or of moving their production offshore, well, then, American workers have lost their leverage.\n\nThe fact that immigration undercuts wages at the low end is well understood by now. And yet what hasn’t been so well understood is that outsourcing is undercutting wages even at the relatively high end. That is, it’s not just blue-collar workers who are losing their jobs to China, South Korea, and India; it’s also white-collar accountants, technicians, engineers—and even doctors.\n\nAnd that’s all because of the ideology that supports outsourcing, namely, globalism. As Breitbart’s Stephen K. Bannon has said, “The globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia.”\n\nYes, that’s the truth. A key document for understanding this reality is a 2016 study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, “The China Shock: Learning from Labor-Market Adjustment to Large Changes in Trade.” The study proves that the detrimental impact of China trade on U.S. workers has been profound. The authors note that China’s share of global manufacturing rose eight-fold from 1990 to 2012, and that among the consequences of this export-surge has been the loss of 560,000 American manufacturing jobs, and counting. As the MIT authors put it:\n\nImprovements in China’s productive capabilities and reductions in its trade costs will [lead] to a contraction of industries subject to greater import exposure.\n\nIndeed, we can add that the further reverberations—in terms of lower wages, lessened industrial muscle, and weakened national security—are far greater than just the job losses. And those other academic authors, Deaton and Case, would add that the ultimate wages of low wages are… demoralization and death.\n\nTo be sure, not every American is suffering because of the China trade. The rich—those with capital and/or a connection to the global economy—are doing just fine; they’re the ones who do well when the American supply chain becomes, instead, the global supply chain.\n\nThus we see the Two Americas: First, there’s one tiny part, mostly in the coastal clusters, getting richer, and more arrogant. And then there’s the other, larger part, mostly in the middle, growing poorer—and angrier.\n\nIt’s hard to believe that the larger part of America will allow this painful process to continue for much longer. The goal for all Americans should be, of course, One America.\n\nYes, that’s the goal.",
  "latent_13035": "When the Colorado Board of Health voted against adding Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder to the list of qualifying conditions for medical marijuana last month, a core group of advocates immediately gathered in the lobby to start plotting their next move. They had tried legislation. That failed. Then they turned to the executive branch. And that failed too. So the next step was obvious: Go to court.\n\nLast week, five PTSD patients represented by attorneys Bob Hoban and Adam Foster sued, asking Denver District Court to reverse the state health board’s decision.\n\nFor plaintiff Matthew Kahl, access to cannabis isn’t about getting stoned. It’s about saving lives.\n\nKahl came back from his second deployment in Afghanistan this year with a traumatic brain injury, severe spine damage and a heavy psychological burden. Back home in North Carolina, he could barely reintegrate with his family, let alone the rest of society. A Veterans Affairs doctor prescribed Kahl a cocktail of 15-20 pills a day, but Kahl was still miserable. His liver shut down, his kidneys started to fail, and he lost the will to live.\n\n“I was literally dying before everyone’s eyes.”\n\nPicking at his fingernails at the Holban and Feola, LLC office in downtown Denver, Kahl told The Colorado Independent his motivation for joining the lawsuit comes from remembering what it was like to lie in a hospital bed after a suicide attempt and feel his three year old son’s hand in his.\n\n“He’s been through too much. So I’m doing this for him and all the other kids whose parents can’t function.”\n\n“22 veterans kill themselves every day. They need their medicine today.”\n\n[pullquote][/pullquote]\n\nKahl said cannabis was a revelation for him. He had tried it once or twice as a teenager, but never considered it as a medicine. Now, he said, he wouldn’t be here without it.\n\n“I would’ve been dead and buried a long time ago.”\n\nAttorney Adam Foster said that after hearing stories like Kahl’s the choice to take this case on pro bono was simple. He emphasized that the health board’s July 15 decision bucked the medical community and ignored readily available scientific evidence.\n\nBoth Colorado Department of Health chief medical officer Larry Wolk and the Medical Marijuana Scientific Advisory Council recommended the board add PTSD to the list of qualifying conditions. And those recommendations were based on a growing body of research showing cannabis treats PTSD without harmful side effects pharmaceuticals often carry.\n\nAt that July 15 meeting, leading marijuana researcher Sue Sisley testified about some of the peer reviewed, published studies already out there. One found a 75 percent reduction in CAPS scores — the gold standard for measuring PTSD severity — among patients using cannabis. But board members found that existing research isn’t rigorous enough. Only a randomized control trial using marijuana supplied by the federal government would do the trick. And without that kind of study, the board felt like proper scientific backing was lacking.\n\nDr. Sisley is working on precisely that kind of study. She was funded more than $2 million by this very board, but has been stonewalled at every turn. Because the study has an experimental design, rigorous, by health board standards, Sisley must use marijuana grown by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Right now, that’s her biggest obstacle.\n\nSisley wants to investigate the treatment potential of marijuana rich in cannabidiol. CBD is a non psychoactive compound that’s been shown to have anti-inflammatory and relaxing properties. CBD-rich cannabis is the drug that brought hundreds of families with seizure-prone children flocking to Colorado.\n\nNIDA staff told her they’re growing a CBD-rich strain for her study, but not at the potency she requested. And she has no clue when that sub-par strain will even be available. She estimates it’ll be at least four years before she’ll have the kind of results the state health board said it needs.\n\n“We just can’t wait that long,” she said. “22 veterans kill themselves every day. They need their medicine today.”\n\nThis lawsuit claims the state board of health established an unattainable standard by saying it needs Sisley’s results before PTSD can get added to the list of conditions that qualify a patient for medical marijuana.\n\n“It’s as if they said, ‘You have to go to Mars to conduct this study,” said attorney Bob Hoban. It’s just not gonna happen.”\n\nHoban acknowledged that many PTSD patients do currently self-medicate. But they’re getting the CBD-rich strains either from the recreational market or by lying to get a medical card for some other condition. And both of those options, he said, are insufficient.\n\nCannabis products for the typical PTSD treatment regimen are nearly twice as expensive in the recreational market, and most dispensaries don’t even stock the CBD-rich strains that patients need. “The fact is, the rec market is made up of tourists coming to Colorado to get high just like anyone who goes to Amsterdam,” Hoban said. And they want the high potency strains with lots of THC. So that’s what’s on the shelves.”\n\nNot only is it pricier to medicate with recreational products, it’s irresponsible.\n\n“Patients need to be able to have open and honest conversations with their physicians. Expecting people to lie — especially people with anxiety — makes a sham of the system.”\n\nPlaintiff Larisa Bolivar hopes that giving PTSD patients legitimate access to this kind of medicine will reduce stigma around both cannabis and trauma. She’s proud that society is more aware than ever before that soldiers suffer psychological wounds during war that need healing long after they’ve returned home. But Bolivar wants to call attention to another kind of trauma that all too often gets swept under the rug — domestic abuse.\n\n“Women are the silent majority of PTSD sufferers,” she said. “And we need to recognize that.”\n\nMolested as a child, Bolivar was the victim of abuse throughout her teenage and young adult life. It wasn’t until she moved to Colorado and started seeing a psychiatrist about her panic attacks that she was diagnosed with PTSD. At that point she weighed 89 lbs. When Bolivar went off all her prescription drugs and tried medicating with cannabis, her anxiety decreased and her appetite returned.\n\nThen in her late-20s, Bolivar survived another harrowing trauma. She was held hostage by an abuser for seven months. After that, she took her advocacy to the next level, founding the nonprofit Cannabis Consumers Coalition that pushes for drug policy reform and consumers rights.\n\n“Just to put it bluntly, cannabis saved my life,” she said. “And now my life is fighting to save others.”\n\nThe state health board has until September 10 to file a response to the complaint.\n\nCDPHE spokesman Mark Salley said he can’t comment on pending litigation, and the Attorney General’s office didn’t respond to multiple inquiries about how the state will proceed.\n\nDr. Sue Sisley thinks the board’s decision was more political than it was scientific.\n\n“Why is it that I can prescribe all these off-label drugs for PTSD, but not this natural treatment?”\n\nThere are two medications the FDA approves for PTSD treatment, Paxil and Zoloft, but they’re no more effective than placebos. So it’s common practice to prescribe a “combat cocktail” of other drugs, Sisley explained, rattling off a long list of SSRI’s, benzodiazephines and other anti-psychotics and anti-depressants. Recognizable among them are Prozac, Lithium, Klonopin and Xanax.\n\nShe’s concerned that policymakers won’t even consider alternatives to these drugs with the pharmaceutical industry as enshrined as it is.\n\n“It reeks of political motivations,” Hoban agreed.\n\n“From day one, the CDPHE has been like, ‘our hands are tied.’ And it’s like, ‘wah wah, boo hoo, you have to make tough decisions.’ Well that’s why you were put there.”\n\nAnd this shouldn’t even be a tough decision, Hoban said. “They violate federal law every single day by regulating a federally illegal substance. And we’re talking about giving veterans access to medicine. What’s risky about that?”\n\nIf this lawsuit is successful, Colorado will be the twelfth state to let PTSD patients medicate with cannabis.\n\nDepression, public domain, via Pixabay; 80mg Propanolol, public domain, via WikiMedia; Sativa, public domain, via Pixabay.

He returned the petition for confirmation of Mr Wallace as examiner to July 26th.\n\nMoving the petition on behalf of the Irish company, Rossa Fanning said it employed 558 people - of whom just 114 are full-time - and had been loss-making for a number of years due to factors including falling demand and onerous leases.\n\nTurnover for the year to end March 2006 was some €67.6m but that fell to some €46.3m for the year to end March 2013.\n\nThe company had no bank debt but had continued to trade with the assistance of inter-company loans, he outlined. It now owed more than €30m to two companies in the wider group. Annual rental costs were some €10.3m and all the stores were held on foot of long-term leases involving five yearly upwards-only rent reviews.\n\nLast Friday, the UK group parent had stated it was withdrawing its support without which the company was insolvent but the company's petition and an independent accountant's report identified debt restructuring and other measures necessary if it were to have a reasonable prospect of survival as a going concern.\n\nAn independent accountant believed the company had a reasonable prospect of survival if certain conditions were met, including renegotiation or repudiation of leases and acceptance of a scheme of arrangement by the High Court. Even if rent issues were addressed for the three stores at Carlow, Castlebar and Fonthill Road, they may have to close given the extent of their losses, counsel indicated.\n\nFurther store closures may be necessary if rents are not repudiated or renegotiated, he added.\n\nMr Fanning also indicated the company sources most of its product from an inter-group supplier with the effect its list of creditors is small. Preferential creditors include a number of local authorities in relation to rates while no historic debt is owed to the Revenue Commissioners.\n\nThe judge also heard the parent group is prepared to allocate €2.14m to meet trading costs during the examinership period.\n\nOnline Editors",
  "latent_13182": "The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has issued a new decision on President Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE’s March 6 Executive Order 13780, “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.”\n\nThe court affirmed the portions of the district court injunction that apply to the 90-day, six-country travel ban, but it vacated the portions of the injunction that relate to the government doing an internal review of its vetting procedures, which could lead to a much larger ban based on a different criterion.\n\nThe Trump exception\n\nAccording to University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner, the courts are creating a “Trump exception” to settled law on presidential powers by ignoring the Supreme Court’s admonition in Kleindienst v. Mandel that courts may not “look behind” a “facially legitimate and bona fide reason” when the president exercises immigration authority.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit does mention the Supreme Court’s admonition in Mandel, but gives it only cursory attention (see footnote 9 on page 33 of the decision).\n\nIf the Supreme Court does not intervene, Trump may be faced ultimately with the constitutional crisis of not being able to meet his national security responsibilities as the chief of the executive branch with respect to terrorism coming from Muslim countries, unless he defies the orders of the judicial branch.\n\nTip of the iceberg\n\nThe six-country travel ban is just the tip of the iceberg. The internal reviews the court has given approval to can lead to far more serious consequences.\n\nSection 2(a) of the executive order reads as follows:\n\n\"The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall conduct a worldwide review to identify whether, and if so what, additional information will be needed from each foreign country to adjudicate an application by a national of that country for a visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual is not a security or public-safety threat.\"\n\nSection 2(d) directs the secretary of state to ask all foreign governments that do not supply this information already to begin providing it. The consequences of refusing to cooperate are explained in section 2(e):\n\n\"After the period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion in a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of appropriate categories of foreign nationals of countries that have not provided the information requested until they do so or until the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies that the country has an adequate plan to do so, or has adequately shared information through other means.\"\n\nIronically, the six travel ban countries that are protected by the injunction will be subject to the new ban if their governments refuse to provide the information needed to determine whether individuals from their countries are a security or public-safety threat. On the other hand, if these governments agree to cooperate, their nationals will not be subject to the new ban.\n\nThe order to implement this program will be far less vulnerable to court interference\n\nI predict the following improvements in the executive order for the new ban:\n\nIt will not apply just to predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nThe original travel ban order was hastily issued one week after Trump’s inauguration without an interagency review. The new one will be based on a worldwide review by the secretary of homeland security in consultation with the secretary of state and the director of national intelligence.\n\nIt will depend entirely on the cooperativeness of the government of the alien’s country. It only will ban aliens from countries with governments that refuse to cooperate, and the ban will be lifted if and when these governments agree to cooperate.\n\nIt will not apply categorically to every alien from a country with an uncooperative government. It only will ban appropriate categories of aliens from those countries.\n\nTo prevent more ad hominem attacks on his character and endless references to his campaign statements, Trump will accept the recommendations of his agency heads and let them implement the ban without further input from the White House.\n\nWhere this is headed\n\nUnlike the travel ban, which, notwithstanding pessimistic claims to the contrary, is just a 90-day suspension, the new ban will apply to uncooperative governments until they agree to cooperate, which in some cases will never happen. What's more, it almost certainly will apply to more than six countries. According to DHS Secretary John Kelley, in addition to the six countries on the travel ban list, 13 or 14 other countries also have very questionable vetting procedures.\n\nNolan Rappaport was detailed to the House Judiciary Committee as an executive branch immigration law expert for three years; he subsequently served as an immigration counsel for the Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Claims for four years. Prior to working on the Judiciary Committee, he wrote decisions for the Board of Immigration Appeals for 20 years.\n\nThe views expressed by contributors are their own and not the views of The Hill.",

However, it is thought the drug would have little to no effect on normal tissues.\n\nWhen asked if this was a drug for ageing, Dr Keizer told the BBC News website: \"I hope so, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating as you say.\n\n\"In terms of mouse work we are pretty much done, we could look at specific age-related diseases eg osteoporosis, but we should now prepare for clinical translation.\"\n\nCommenting on the results, Dr Dusko Ilic, a stem cell scientist at King's College London, said: \"The finding is impossible to dismiss.\n\n\"[But] until more high-quality research is done, it is better to be reserved about these findings.\n\n\"Though, I would not be surprised if manufacturers try to capitalise on this and, in a few years, we could buy this peptide as a supplement over the counter.\"\n\nProf Ilaria Bellantuono, Professor in Musculoskeletal Ageing, University of Sheffield, called for further tests on \"heart, muscle, metabolic, cognitive function\" to take place.\n\nBut added: \"The use of this peptide in patients is a long way away.\n\n\"It requires careful consideration about safety, about the appropriate group of patients for whom this peptide can be beneficial in a reasonable period of time so that positive effects can be easily measured at an affordable cost.\"\n\nFollow James on Twitter.",

Only two [green arrows] from open play found a team-mate in the box\n\nGeorgia back to haunt Wales\n\nDespite languishing 127 places below Wales in the world rankings, Georgia had demonstrated their ability to frustrate loftier opponents with a battling display in their defeat by the Republic of Ireland on Thursday.\n\nThey also had a strong record against Wales, winning all three of their previous encounters, including a 5-0 thrashing in 1994 which Coleman described as his \"lowest moment\" in a Wales shirt.\n\nHaving initially set up to contain Wales, Georgia grew in confidence as the match wore on and sensed an opportunity to claim a notable scalp.\n\nAfter scoring a deserved equaliser, they squandered a glorious opportunity to take the lead when Levan Mchedlidze shot wide after a swift counter-attack, and then Kazaishvili's powerful shot from 20 yards cannoned into the crossbar.\n\nWales looked tired as they tried in vain to salvage victory, lacking inspiration in midfield in the absence of Allen and Ramsey and demonstrating vulnerability in defence which may have been exploited more ruthlessly by stronger opposition.\n\nMan of the match - Gareth Bale\n\nThere were some worthy contenders in Georgia's team but, at times, the Real Madrid forward was operating at a different level to everyone else on the pitch.\n\nWhat they said\n\nWales boss Chris Coleman: \"I think people are looking at it as two points dropped but it might have been two points gained at the end of the day.\n\n\"It was the dream start but then we got too comfortable and the whole atmosphere on the pitch was too comfortable. We had to take care of business but we were punished.\n\n\"We are disappointed. The two games in four days is tough, not easy, but it is what it is and we have to get on with it. Once we got the goal we had to take care of the job and we didn't do that.\n\n\"We could have lost it in the second half.\"\n\nWhat next?\n\nWales' next World Cup qualifying match is at home to Serbia on 12 November.

  "latent_13767": "[Pugmire] May Update!\n\nPugmire\n\n(Reposted from the Kickstarter)\n\nGreetings, nobledogs! I have some more updates, but first a quick bit of re-organization. As a second Kickstarter comes over the horizon (more on that below!), I felt it was best to divide this update by Kickstarter campaign. That way Rose can more easily post this information across campaigns, and everyone is informed (some of you more than once!)\n\nPUGMIRE KICKSTARTER\n\nPugmire Core Rulebook\n\nWe’re getting specifications from the printer, and tweaking things like the final cover. Exciting! (In a very technical and production-oriented way.)\n\nRelated Stuff\n\nDice, cards, and the screen are all proofed and off to their respective printers!\n\nLast month, a backer asked about the state of the wooden boxes. I admit I hadn’t been keeping track of that, but Rich was on the ball. He tells me they’re all done and ready to be shipped once the rest of the items are printed. This is why Onyx Path is such a great partner to work with.\n\nFiction Anthology\n\nJim is sending notes out to the authors now, so they should be diving into their second drafts.\n\nPan’s Guide\n\nRevisions are in! Matthew’s done his development pass (where he incorporates the revisions, tweaks the text a little, and generally makes the whole thing more seamless). Right now it’s on my desk to review, and then we move into the next and more unusual phase of things.\n\nEarplay\n\nWe’re at the home stretch! I have the second pass of audio edits on my desk to review as well. We’re also hard at work on the technology to get it into your ears. Odds are you’ll be listening and playing in the near future!\n\nMONARCHIES OF MAU KICKSTARTER\n\nWe’re getting close to the launch! I don’t have an exact date, but right now it’s looking like later this month. We’ll certainly post an update here when we’re getting ready to launch, so all you good dogs can be clever cats and jump right on it!\n\nMonarchies of Mau Early Access\n\nFinal art is trickling in, and we’re now discussing the visual direction of the book to strike the right balance of looking LIKE Pugmire without being IDENTICAL to Pugmire. We definitely want these books to feel like companions, but cats have their own style.\n\nAND MORE\n\nThings are incredibly busy for Pugsteady (i.e., me) these days. On top of all the amazing Pugmire/Mau stuff and my additional consulting and contract work, my family and I are in the process of moving overseas! If all goes as planned, once the Mau Kickstarter is over I should be living in Dublin, Ireland. This has been in the works for several months now, so the change shouldn’t impact the Pugmire train TOO much, but there’s a chance things might be a little hectic for the next couple of months. So, for all your patience and enthusiasm, all I can say is “Go raibh maith agaibh!”",
  "latent_13803": "Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry\n\nPhotograph by Scott Olson/Getty Images.\n\nA small group of colonies manages to break away from a large empire in the closing years of the 18th century. The resulting state would probably be not much more than the Chile of the Northeast—a long littoral ribbon between the mountains and the ocean—if it were not for the imperial rivalries that allow for the rapid growth of the new republic’s influence. When one of the rival empires gets into serious financial trouble, it sells the new republic enough territory to double its size, at a bargain basement price. This new territory, rich in all aspects, also gives access to a vast internal basin of navigable rivers. On exploration, this system eventually gives place to the coast of another ocean, and to lands that contain vast reserves of such desirable minerals as gold. Another immense tract of this, today known as Alaska, is almost casually sold to the envoy of the new republic, along with tremendous deposits of what will one day be known as “oil.” …\n\nSo yes, I suppose you could say that the United States had some kind of luck, or force, or destiny, on its side. There were certainly those, even among its most secular founding fathers, who felt that more than ordinary realpolitik was involved. Thomas Paine for example was taken by the idea of a new Garden of Eden and a fresh start, and it was his words that were later to be quoted by Ronald Reagan when he said that he thought humanity had found the power to begin the world over again.\n\nOf course, with any Eden there must be a serpent and an original sin. In the American case at least, Thomas Paine knew quite clearly what it was. The vile stain of slavery was present at every point, just as the awful profitability of cotton, and the easy availability of unpaid human labor from the African trade, corrupted the ideals of the new republic from the very first. In the end, the reckoning for this historic crime led to a war in which much of the ill-gotten wealth was squandered. On the other hand, that same civil war led to the triumph of capitalism and the expansionist state, with the new republic soon becoming an empire in all but name in the Philippines, Cuba, Haiti, and Puerto Rico.\n\nAlong the way, it was inevitable that politicians like Albert Beveridge would proclaim the idea of “manifest destiny” and the natural right of Americans to a dominant role in the world. It is the self-confidence involved in this idea—or rather the loss of it—that some people think should be the subject of the current presidential campaign. A candidate can expect to be ambushed and asked to affirm or deny the special position of the United States as an exemplary city on a hill, “shining” as a beacon to the less fortunate. On a slightly lower element of the scale, people answering polls have recently been asked whether they agree with this statement: “Our people are not perfect but our culture is superior to others.” The most recent polling on the latter point shows less than half of Americans in favor of the slightly tepid proposition, though it’s not obvious whether the perfection or the superiority is being voted on the most.\n\nEspecially to the extent that it starts to look like a loyalty oath, I think that the underlying question here should be dismissed as rash or stupid or both. Is the United States “chosen by God and commissioned by history to be a model to the world”? Anybody claiming to have the answer to that question—as George W. Bush once seemed to do—would be a fool. For a start, what would be his sources of information? And how good a historian would he be? In the long view, very few of the survivors of the Roman Empire would have predicted that the inhabitants of the frozen and backward British Isles would be among the next builders of a global system, but so it proved. And there was no question that the British or English, especially the Protestant fundamentalist ones, believed that they had God on their side. In fact, I know of no European state that doesn’t have some kind of national myth to the same effect. The problem, as everybody knows, is that not all these myths can be simultaneously right.\n\nLong-term ideas of “destiny” are not easily assimilated to shorter-term glooms about the loss of American power and prestige. It’s a strange fact, but in the present political season it is the American right that seems to harbor the most skepticism about American power. I personally find this odd: Yet again the United States has managed to get itself largely on the right side of a massive historical shift—the Arab Spring—which it had not “read” very well the first time round. And yet, most of the remarks made by seekers of the Republican nomination have been sour or grudging.\n\nI remember Bernard-Henri Levy saying, in the early stages of the Iraq war that he opposed, that America had been essentially in the right about combating fascism and Nazism, and essentially right about opposing and outlasting the various forms of Communism, and that all else was pretty much commentary or, as one might say, merde de taureau. Something of the sort seems to apply in the present case, both in recent developments in Burma and Vietnam as well as in Libya and Syria. The crowds have a tendency to be glad that there is an American superpower, if only to balance the cynical powers of Moscow and Beijing. Perhaps if it were not for President Obama being in the White House, our right wing would be quicker to see and appreciate this point.\n\nThe ancients taught us to fear “hubris,” and the Bible teaches the sin of pride. I am always amazed that American conservatives are not more suspicious of self-proclaimed historical uniqueness. But proclaim it they do, as if trying to reassure themselves against the blasts of what looks like a very bad season.",

  "latent_13880": "A suspicious device that forced an Air France plane en route from Mauritius to Paris to make an emergency landing in Mombasa was a false alarm, the airline’s chief executive officer has said.\n\nFlight AF463, with 459 passengers and 14 crew members on board, had left Mauritius at 9pm local time (1700 GMT) on Saturday and was due to arrive in Paris Charles de Gaulle at 5.50am (0450 GMT).\n\nAfter the suspicious device was discovered, the plane landed at Moi international airport in Mombasa before 1am.\n\nThe Air France chief executive, Frédéric Gagey, told a news conference a decision was made to land at the closest airport able to handle a Boeing 777 aircraft after a passenger found the object in the toilets.\n\n“All the information available to us at the moment indicates that the object was not capable of creating an explosion or damaging a plane, but was rather a mixture of cardboard, sheets of paper and a timer,” he said. “It was a false alarm.”\n\nHe added that those on board were evacuated via the emergency slides. Gagey congratulated the crew for their cool-headed reaction to divert the plane. He said a safety check had been carried out in the toilets before the flight and denied any security failure.\n\nA Kenyan police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the device looked like a cardboard box with a stopwatch taped to it. He said six passengers were being questioned in relation to it, including the man who raised the alarm.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Passengers who were on board an Air France Boeing 777 aircraft that made an emergency landing are seen on a bus as they are escorted to hotels from Moi international airport in Mombasa. Photograph: Joseph Okanga/Reuters\n\nAn Air France spokesman said the passengers on the aborted flight were all being accommodated in a nearby hotel and they would depart from Mombasa at 6pm on Sunday on a new aircraft dispatched from Paris, arriving in the capital at 7am on Monday.\n\nThe Kenyan Airport Authority had posted a statement on Facebook on Sunday morning in which it described the suspect package as a bomb that “has been taken to safe destination for detonation in the morning”, but later deleted the post and replaced it as one referring only to a “suspicious object”.\n\nA Kenyan police spokesman, Charles Owino, said of flight AF463: “It requested an emergency landing after a device suspected to be a bomb was discovered in the lavatory. An emergency was prepared and it landed safely and all passengers evacuated. Bomb experts from the navy and the CID were called in and took the device.”\n\nThe plane was still in Mombasa airport early on Sunday morning, he added.\n\nA passenger who identified himself as Benoit Lucchini, from Paris, told journalists: “The plane just went down slowly, slowly, slowly, so we just realised probably something was wrong. The personnel of Air France were just great, they were just wonderful. So they keep everybody calm. We did not know what was happening. So we secured the seatbelt to land in Mombasa because we thought it was a technical problem but actually it was not a technical problem. It was something in the toilet, something wrong in the toilet, it could be a bomb.”\n\nSteven Ciaran, 30 an Irishman working on Réunion island, said he had been sitting at the back of the plane watching a film when he noticed the rushed movement of cabin crew preparing emergency drills. They told him it was a technical problem and created a calm environment among the passengers, he said.\n\n“I was very distressed because I could see we were far from the destination,” said Ciaran. “I thought the plane had difficulty and not that it had anything to do with terrorism.”\n\nScheduled flights to Mombasa were initially disrupted but normal operations later resumed.\n\nFlight AF463 is the third Air France plane to be diverted in recent weeks. Two flights from the US to Paris were diverted on 18 November after bomb threats were received but no bombs were found. France has been in a state of emergency since the 13 November attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead and hundreds wounded.\n\nIslamic State extremists claimed responsibility for the attacks in Paris as well as for the 31 October crash of a Russian passenger plane in the Sinai desert that killed all 224 people on board. Moscow says the crash was caused by a bomb on the plane and has demanded that Egypt increase security at all its airports.",

The suspected bombers were in touch with an operative from Gaza, who helped instruct them on how to assemble explosives, according to the investigation.Following the arrests, security forces seized a homemade semi-automatic rifle, a hunting rifle, ammunition, and explosives.The suspects intended to stay in an apartment in Israel used by illegal residents as part of their preparations, the Shin Bet added. There the Palestinian woman was meant to put on her explosives vest and head to the Tel Aviv area.Hamas and Islamic Jihad planned to claim joint responsibility for the attack, according to the investigation.However, there is no evidence that the central leaderships of Hamas or Islamic Jihad in Gaza were aware of this particular plot.The suspects also confessed to planning to bomb a bus carrying soldiers and to kidnap a soldier.Sha’aban and another suspect have been charged at the Samaria District Court with terrorism offenses.The arrests underline “the high motivation that exists among terrorist operatives to carry out attacks, with an emphasis on the period after Operation Pillar of Defense,” the Shin Bet said.The incident also pours light on how Gazan terrorist organizations seek to orchestrate attacks out of Samaria, and how they help would-be terrorists arm themselves and plan attacks.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

August job growth was revised up to show a smaller decline (-2,600 jobs) than initially reported (-3,700 jobs).\n\nSeptember’s monthly payroll drop kept over-the-year job growth well below the national average. While Illinois job growth has had its ups and downs since the beginning of the year, the 3-month trend shows average declines of -4,200 jobs per month from July to September, while the six-month trend shows a -400 per month average job loss from April to September. Both the 3-month and the 6-month changes are worse than reported last month.\n\n“The Illinois economy continues to sputter.” said IDES Director Jeff Mays. “Moving one step forward and one step backward, as we have done this past number of months, does little to build the positive jobs momentum that most other states have built during this recovery.”\n\n“Illinois stands apart in terms of the assets and opportunities we have to offer business across industries,” said Illinois Department of Commerce Director Sean McCarthy. “We must continue to market our exceptional assets while implementing reforms that boost our economy and make us competitive on a national stage.”\n\nIn September, the two industry sectors with the largest gains in employment were: Financial Activities (+3,600) and Manufacturing (+1,100). The three industry sectors with the largest payroll declines were: Trade, Transportation, and Utilities (-4,200); Education and Health Services (-3,400); and Leisure and Hospitality (-3,300).\n\nOver-the-year, nonfarm payroll employment increased by +3,700 jobs with the largest gains in these industry sectors in September: Financial Activities (+12,000); Education and Health Services (+9,600); and Professional and Business Services (+8,000). The industry sectors with the largest over-the-year declines include: Trade, Transportation and Utilities (-10,700); Government (-7,100); and Construction (-5,800). Illinois nonfarm payrolls were up +0.1 percent over-the-year in sharp contrast to the nation’s +1.2 percent over-the-year gain in September.\n\nThe state’s unemployment rate is +0.8 percentage points higher than the national unemployment rate reported for September 2017, which decreased to 4.2 percent. The Illinois unemployment rate is down -0.8 percentage points from a year ago when it was 5.8 percent. At 5.0 percent, the Illinois jobless rate is -0.7 percentage points lower than January 2017.\n\nThe number of unemployed workers dipped -0.4 percent from the prior month to 321,700, down -14.5 percent over the same month for the prior year. The labor force remained about unchanged over-the-month and declined by -1.3 percent in September over the prior year. The unemployment rate identifies those individuals who are out of work and are seeking employment. An individual who exhausts or is ineligible for benefits is still reflected in the unemployment rate if they actively seek work.\n\nTo help connect jobseekers to employers who are hiring, IDES’ maintains the state’s largest job search engine IllinoisJoblink.com (IJL).

The monthly historical revisions to state labor force estimates reflect new national benchmark controls, state working-age population controls, seasonal factors, as well as updated total nonfarm jobs and unemployment benefits claims inputs.

These projects range from local streets and roads repair, bicycle/pedestrian improvements, and building Caltrain grade separations to funding Phase II of the BART extension.\n\nCollection of the ½ cent sales tax began in April 2017 and as VTA was preparing to distribute the funds, an appeal of a previously dismissed lawsuit regarding the 2016 Measure B was filed.\n\nSpecifically, in January 2017, a Saratoga resident individually filed a lawsuit against VTA on the validity of the 2016 Measure B. (Cheriel Jensen v. Santa Clara Transportation Authority, et al.) VTA challenged the lawsuit as lacking merit and the court agreed and dismissed the case. We recently learned that the plaintiff just filed an appeal of the court’s dismissal to the 6th District Court of Appeal.\n\nAs a result of the ongoing lawsuit, VTA is required to keep all 2016 Measure B tax collections in an escrow account (which VTA has been doing) “until the legality of the tax is finally resolved by a final and non-appealable decision…” (California Revenue and Taxation Code, Rev. & Tax. Code § 7270(c).) Therefore, the court process impedes VTA from distributing any 2016 Measure B funds, as was planned for this fall.\n\n“As the transportation authority for the county, VTA is responsible for ensuring the transportation network remains in a state of good repair. Time spent on this legal battle could extend into years, adding to the cost of implementing these needed projects.”\n\nVTA Board Chair Jeannie Bruins\n\nThe lawsuit withholds funding (in 2017 dollars) from all nine program categories that the voters approved:",

  "latent_14328": "As you may have read today on Slate.com, Hillary Clinton Isn’t A Lesbian — But She Dresses Like One. The article is already a massive “hit” on the social media networks, just as I suspect Slate imagined it would be, with hordes of Lesbians and People Who Dress Like One sharing passionate opinions about the article’s various sentences and paragraphs. Unfortunately, this article fails to make the larger, more important point about the relationship between presidential candidates and lesbian fashion: they all dress like lesbians. Why? Because lesbians are powerful and love to win… but rarely do.\n\nAs the great Jeb Bush probably never said out loud, but probably would if he thought it could improve his poll numbers, “Nobody wants to defund the male gaze more than I do.”\n\n12 Current and Former Presidential Candidates Who Want to Dress Like Lesbians\n\nThank you to my dearest pal Heather Hogan for making these beautiful graphics for us.\n\n1. Rick Santorum\n\nSure, Rick Santorum may actively campaign against Ellen’s rights as a lesbian and as a female person entitled to make her own decisions about her body parts — but there’s one thing both of these public figures aren’t afraid to endorse loud and clear: sweater vests.\n\n2. Bernie Sanders\n\nBernie Sanders has big plans for spreading the green around — starting with copping Cara Delevingne’s love of pea green jacket situations. It’s only a matter of time ’til these two souls will surely rendez-vous at Pea Soup Anderson’s, a charming restaurant located off Interstate 5 in California. “Your jacket matches the soup,” Cara will say in her cheeky British accent. “So does yours,” Bernie will respond, chuckling softly to himself.\n\n3. Ben Carson\n\nThe connection Ben Carson feels with KD Lang probably began in 1992, a big year for both of these style icons: Ben Carson released his first book,”Think Big: Unleashing Your Potential for Excellence,” and KD Lang released her ground-breaking album, Ingenue. To be honest, I prefer the album.\n\n4. Donald Trump\n\nTrump may be a fan of Martina Navratilova’s style, if not the fact that she was born in Czechoslovakia but now dares to live in Florida. What would a meeting of the fashion minds look like for these two? Well, I think we can agree on one thing: Martina Navratilova should probably whack Donald Trump over the head with a heavy object.\n\n5. Ted Cruz\n\nTed Cruz might not have taken any political inspiration out of his meet-up with Ellen Page at the Iowa State Fair, but he clearly picked up a few important fashion pointers. Like many queer women already know, plaid flannel is the gift that keeps on giving.\n\n6. Rand Paul\n\nIt’s a universally established fact that the best way to fix your reputation as an unenthusiastic television presence is FASHION.\n\n7. Marco Rubio\n\nDid you hear the one about how Marco Rubio hit a kid in the face with a football in Iowa? Well, it’s true, which’s why anybody with children in Iowa should fear Marco Rubio. Did you hear the one about how Abby Wambach hit a goal in the face with a soccer ball? Me too, it was awesome.\n\n8. Carly Fiorina\n\nYou’ve never seen Carly looking so lovely as she did tonight\n\nYou’ve never seen her shine so bright\n\nand also so wrong about abortion, education, the affordable care act, and the minimum wage\n\nYou’ve never seen so many men and women ask Amber Heard if she wanted to dance,\n\nthey’re looking for a little romance, but don’t have half a chance!

John Kasich\n\nI think I had a polo like this once. I probably got it from GapKids. I loved GapKids. My Mom worked there for a while when I was in middle school, so we got a discount which was pretty rad. I worked there too, in 1999. It was 1999! Anything felt possible!\n\n10. Michelle Bachmann\n\nBachmann may not be running for president this year, but that won’t stop her from running to the runway, inspired by her #1 fashion icon, morning show host Robin Roberts. Despite not having any experience in politics, though, I think we can all agree that Robin Roberts would make a much better president than Michelle Bachmann.\n\n11. Mike Huckabee\n\nMike Huckabee is just like you and me: an ordinary American who doesn’t want to lose his sunglasses, or run out of pockets for fishing tackle. Jane Lynch is also like you and me: she finds women sexually appealing and enjoys having relationships with them. One thing is for sure: Jane Lynch is taller than Mike Huckabee, and probably has cooler things in her pockets.\n\n12. Sarah Palin\n\nI’m sorry, we had to.",
  "latent_14373": "On April 25, 2016, the Cryptome foundation disclosed that a large zip archive containing what seemed to be private data from hundreds of thousands of customers of the Qatar National Bank (QNB, the largest bank in the Arab Gulf in terms of assets) had been posted online.\n\nThe archive\n\nThe archive (510MB compressed, 1.4GB uncompressed) contained about 15K files in many directories. The most obviously significant were (1) a set of database tables, and (2) a directory named \"Folders.\"\n\nThe directory named \"Folders\" is a set of small dossiers of about 100 \"notable\" people in Qatar. It includes several sub-folders named \"Al Jazeera\" (the name of the Qatar-based news network), \"Al Thani\" (the name of the ruling family), \"Police, security\" and so on. Inside each folder, there is one or more files containing a mixture of data extracted from the QNB database (such as account number, passport number, and so on), and information from other sources, that varies from links to online profiles to a photo of the person, usernames and passwords. I say \"notable\" in quotes because the classification of people into folders here is a little bit dubious, for instance with some people named as spies when they are unlikely to be so.\n\nThe database tables contain profile information of about 300K-400K customers. This includes name, nationality, passport number, national ID number in Qatar, e-mail address, and physical address. It also includes card numbers, expiration dates, and account numbers for about 800K-900K debit and credit cards. There is some duplicate information between a set of main files and a set of back-ups, so the number varies depending on which files you look at.\n\nMy involvement\n\nI worked in Qatar from mid-2012 to mid-2015 as a scientist in a national research institute. From my time in Qatar I knew that QNB is the first choice for many foreign workers, so the data leak had probably affected many of my colleagues who still work in Qatar.\n\nAfter downloading the archive I did a quick search for e-mail addresses in my former institute, I found 4 people I knew, including their full names, which was a strong signal that the archive was authentic. Additionally, there were things that you only see in Qatar (such as writing \"QATAR FOUNDASHON\" instead of \"QATAR FOUNDATION\"). I alerted my colleagues, but didn't want to look more into the archive; I was not interested in learning anything private from them, and given I did not find my own e-mail address, I assumed this was old data from before I went to Qatar.\n\nHowever, hours later and after being alerted by a friend, I did find my account in the archive. My e-mail ID was not included in the main files, but in one of the backups, and my national ID number in Qatar was in multiple places.\n\nI looked more carefully in the archive and found the names of people I knew, but not their e-mail addresses. Then, I decided to create a tool to let people search for themselves if they were present in the archive or not.\n\nThe \"QNB Verifier\"\n\nThe tool I set up on April 26th was very simple. First, I hashed all the e-mails and Qatar national ID numbers I could found and uploaded the hashed identifiers to my web server. Second, I wrote a small Python script (my first program in Python) to receive a hashed user input and compare it against the stored hashes. Third, I used an Javascript implementation of MD5 to hash the input in the browser of the user.\n\nI set-up a page to give access to this tool to users, and warned them that their hashed input could be observed while in transit, but indicated that no plain-text personal data would leave their browsers. I also made it clear I was not hosting the leaked files. I kept no logs of the user input but my service providers has statistics of how many people accessed the endpoint of the service. About 10,000 did so during the 5 days or so that the service was active.\n\nIn the meantime, QNB continued calling this a \"social media speculation,\" a line they maintained for several days.\n\nThe denial-of-service attack\n\nFrom April 27th onwards I started to get thousands of requests per second from a few IP addresses. This increased substantially the CPU usage of my account. My hosting provider froze all my websites (i.e. started serving static versions of them) except for this verification service (!) and warned me that if this high CPU usage continued they will suspend my account.\n\nI added the IP addresses of the attacker to a blacklist but s/he kept on changing them. I spent hours playing whack-a-mole but fortunately for me the attack was not very sophisticated, and eventually my attacker gave up and stopped changing IP addresses. That brought my traffic down to normality and my websites were unfrozen.\n\nThe legal threats\n\nOn April 30th the service was featured in Doha News. Doha News is an independent online news service that operates from Doha. They knew me from my time in Qatar and had covered some of the work on predictive news analytics that my team did for Al Jazeera. They linked to the verification service and interviewed me over Twitter to know about my reasons and how this worked. The International Business Times also followed up on this story.\n\nOn the same day, I received an e-mail from Hispasec, a Spanish IT security firm. In their e-mail, they wrote in Spanish:\n\nI am .... from Hispasec Systems, an international IT security company, in legal representation of QNB Bank from Qatar. The entity had reported your 'qnb-ver' service for us to proceed to shut it down, because they understand it can be being utilized to collect e-mail addresses or bank account numbers: URL: http://chato.cl/2016/qnb-ver/ We understand this is a special situation, but due to its importance and the requirements of our customer, we must emphasize that you must disable this content from your website. Many thanks for your collaboration.\n\nI responded a couple of days later and had some exchanges with them. I basically stated that I was not hosting the leaked files and that I was not collecting any data. They reinstated their request and warned me about the importance of promptly removing my service to \"avoid to face any legal action concerning the spreading of the public damage and defamation.\" I have to say I never felt this was something to be concerned about; in Spain you are fairly safe unless you speak against the king.\n\nCensorship\n\nThe Internet has always been heavily censored in Qatar, and many different content categories are not accessible from the country. Censorship is, however, quite easy to circumvent with VPNs, and many people use them.\n\nOn 2014 or 2015 they set-up a censorship page, that you can see in censor.qa that shows a cartoon and explains that you have accessed a page that contains prohibited materials. This makes censorship more \"friendly,\" I guess.\n\nMy page was added to Qatar's blacklist on May 1st, 2016. I set-up an alternative, https-based access on the same day and publicized it, people continued being able to access the https-based service.\n\nIncidentally, on May 1st, 2016, Qatar National Bank issued a statement indicating that the leak had only affected a \"a portion of Qatar-based QNB customers.\" I would say that \"portion\" is very high, close to 100%. I did not hear about a single QNB customer that used my service and did not find his/her national ID or e-mail in the leaked files.\n\nDownfall\n\nOn May 2nd QNB contacted my hosting provider to report a \"phishing\" attempt from my account. Phishing is when scammers send people e-mails asking them to follow a link that looks like a bank's homepage (or other institution), so that the victims enter their credentials in the fake site, and the scammers can steal them.\n\nIn response to the phishing complaint, and without any examination, my hosting provider proceeded to close all the websites hosted in my account, including my personal site, my research site, the website of my upcoming book, the personal website of my wife, an environmental portal that she maintains, and others.\n\nI replied to the report with a detailed explanation that no personal data was being hosted, and no data was being stored, moreover that the service was designed to make this impossible by hashing the personal data on the users' browser. I received an automated response that pointed out the offending files were still there. Basically, a human would not look at the ban until the files were removed.\n\nSo, I had to shut down the service, and it took me about one day to get my hosting provider to bring the websites back into operation. I did not want to fight this. Their business is to have customers that don't require any attention, and if you use too much time from the support desk, they can easily revoke your contract and send you with a nice backup in search for another hosting. In my past experience that is 2-3 days of work that I don't have.\n\nWhat did I learn?\n\nIn my opinion, data leaks should be regulated similarly to work place accidents. Companies should have to file an official report indicating what happened and who was affected. Most importantly, customers must be told the truth, but they get nothing, or lies, or partial truths that are not helpful. This is not a problem only in Qatar (many others have done exactly the same), but is definitively made worse by Qatar censorship and heavy-handedness against any \"troublemakers.\"\n\nI learned a couple of things. First, the public is very weak in these situations. You cannot know if your data has been leaked or not, Downloading the archives and verifying yourself takes some technical knowledge that, while superficial, is beyond reach for many people. The are services that can help you, such as Have I Been Pwned?, but they use only e-mail IDs.\n\nThere are way too many choke points, from legal systems, to censorship systems, to hosting providers, that can be used to silence anyone. Also, if I had been in Qatar I would have risked jail time followed by deportation, and most likely I wouldn't have done this under those circumstances.\n\nSecond, we are also quite strong, for many reasons. The leaked archive is out there and is not going to disappear: you don't get the genie back in the bottle on the internet. That is good because people can still verify if their information was stolen, but bad because the archive contains personal data and hence the potential for abuse is huge.\n\nWe are also powerful because we are many and we can move fast, way faster than what many corporations and governments can.\n\nWhat else did I learn? If I had to do the same thing again, most likely I would find a secondary hosting provider and do it there; the price of getting your main hosting account attacked is too high, and while I was expecting QNB would go to my hosting provider, I thought they would at least look at the complaint to examine its merits. There are many hosting providers that are better suited for this than the standard ones. I would also set-up this under https from the beginning to make it more resilient and secure.\n\nEverything else, I would do the same. It was the right thing to do, and I'm glad I was able to help.",
  "latent_14392": "A doctorate (from Latin docere, \"to teach\") or doctor's degree (from Latin doctor, \"teacher\") or doctoral degree (from the ancient formalism licentia docendi) is an academic degree awarded by universities that is, in most countries, a research degree that qualifies the holder to teach at the university level in the degree's field, or to work in a specific profession. There are a variety of doctoral degrees, with the most common being the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), which is awarded in many different fields, ranging from the humanities to the scientific disciplines.\n\nIn the United States and some other countries, there are also some types of vocational, technical, or professional degrees that are referred to as doctorates. Professional doctorates have historically come about to meet the needs of practitioners in a variety of disciplines. However, the aims and means of these degrees vary greatly across disciplines making it difficult to claim a universal understanding of professional doctorates. Many universities also award honorary doctorates to individuals who have been deemed worthy of special recognition, either for scholarly work or for other contributions to the university or to society.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nMiddle Ages [ edit ]\n\nThe term doctor derives from Latin, meaning \"teacher\" or \"instructor\". The doctorate (Latin: doctoratus) appeared in medieval Europe as a license to teach Latin (licentia docendi) at a university.[1] Its roots can be traced to the early church in which the term doctor referred to the Apostles, church fathers, and other Christian authorities who taught and interpreted the Bible.[1]\n\nThe right to grant a licentia docendi (i.e. the doctorate) was originally reserved to the Catholic church, which required the applicant to pass a test, to take an oath of allegiance and pay a fee. The Third Council of the Lateran of 1179 guaranteed the access—at that time largely free of charge—of all able applicants. Applicants were tested for aptitude.[2] This right remained a bone of contention between the church authorities and universities that were slowly distancing themselves from the Church. The right was granted by the pope to the University of Paris in 1213 where it became a universal license to teach (licentia ubiquie docendi).[2] However, while the licentia continued to hold a higher prestige than the bachelor's degree baccalaureus, the latter was ultimately reduced to an intermediate step to the magister and doctorate, both of which now became the exclusive teaching qualification.[2] According to Keith Allan Noble (1994), the first doctoral degree was awarded in medieval Paris around 1150 at the University of Paris.[3]\n\nThe so-called \"professional, vocational, or technical curriculum\" (in contrast to liberal arts) of the Middle Ages included only theology, law, and medicine.[4][not in citation given]\n\n17th century [ edit ]\n\nThe doctorate of philosophy developed in Germany in the 17th century (likely c. 1652).[5] The term \"philosophy\" does not refer solely to the field or academic discipline of philosophy, but is used in a broader sense in accordance with its original Greek meaning, which is \"love of wisdom\". In most of Europe, all fields (history, philosophy, social sciences, mathematics, and natural philosophy/natural sciences)[6] were traditionally known as philosophy, and in Germany and elsewhere in Europe the basic faculty of liberal arts was known as the \"faculty of philosophy\". The doctorate of philosophy adheres to this historic convention, even though the degrees are not always for the study of philosophy. Chris Park explains that it was not until formal education and degree programs were standardized in the early 19th century that the doctorate of philosophy was reintroduced in Germany as a research degree,[7] abbreviated as Dr. phil. (similar to Ph.D. in Anglo-American countries). Germany, however, differentiated then in more detail between doctorates in philosophy and doctorates in the natural sciences, abbreviated as Dr. rer. nat., and also doctorates in the social/political sciences, abbreviated as Dr. rer. pol., similar to the other traditional doctorates in medicine (Dr. med.) and law (Dr. jur.).\n\nUniversity doctoral training was a form of apprenticeship to a guild. The traditional term of study before new teachers were admitted to the guild of \"Masters of Arts\" was seven years, matching the apprenticeship term for other occupations. Originally the terms \"master\" and \"doctor\" were synonymous, but over time the doctorate came to be regarded as a higher qualification than the master's degree. Makdisi's revised hypothesis that the doctorate originated in the Islamic ijazah, a reversal of his earlier view that saw both systems as of \"the most fundamental difference\",[8] was rejected by Huff as unsubstantiated.[9]\n\nUniversity degrees, including doctorates, were originally restricted to men. The first women to be granted doctorates were Juliana Morell in 1608 at Lyons,[10] Elena Cornaro Piscopia in 1678 at the University of Padua, Laura Bassi in 1732 at Bologna University, Dorothea Erxleben in 1754 at Halle University and María Isidra de Guzmán y de la Cerda in 1785 at Complutense University, Madrid.[11]\n\nModern times [ edit ]\n\nThe use and meaning of the doctorate has changed over time, and is subject to regional variations. For instance, until the early 20th century few academic staff or professors in English-speaking universities held doctorates, except for very senior scholars and those in holy orders. After that time the German practice of requiring lecturers to have completed a research doctorate spread. Universities' shift to research-oriented (based upon the scientific method, inquiry, and observation) education increased the doctorates importance. Today, a research doctorate (PhD) or its equivalent (as defined in the US by the NSF) is generally a prerequisite for an academic career, although many recipients do not work in academia.\n\nProfessional doctorates developed in the United States from the 19th century onward. The first professional doctorate to be offered in the United States was the M.D. at Kings College (now Columbia University) after the medical school's founding in 1767,[12] although this was not a professional doctorate in the modern American sense as it was awarded for further study after the qualifying Bachelor of Medicine (M.B.) rather than being a qualifying degree.[13] The MD became the standard first degree in medicine during the 19th century, but as a three-year undergraduate degree; it did not become established as a graduate degree until 1930. The MD, as the standard qualifying degree in medicine, gave that profession the ability (through the American Medical Association, established in 1847 for this purpose) to set and raise standards for entry into professional practice.[14][15]\n\nThe modern research degree, in the shape of the German-style Ph.D. was first awarded in the U.S. in 1861, at Yale University.[16] This differed from the MD in that the latter was, a vocational \"professional degree\" that trained students to apply or practice knowledge, rather than generate it, similar to other students in vocational schools or institutes. In the UK, research doctorates initially took the form of higher doctorates, first introduced at Durham University in 1882.[17] The PhD spread to the UK from the US via Canada, and was instituted at all British universities from 1917, with the first (titled a DPhil) being awarded at the University of Oxford.[18][19]\n\nFollowing the MD, the next professional doctorate, the Juris Doctor (J.D.), was established by the University of Chicago in 1902. However it took a long time to be accepted, not replacing the Bachelor of Laws (LLB) until the 1960s, by which time the LLB was generally taken as a graduate degree. Notably, the curriculum for the JD and LLB were identical, with the degree being renamed as a doctorate, and it (like the MD) was not equivalent to the PhD, raising criticism that it was \"not a 'true Doctorate'\".[20][21] When professional doctorates were established in the UK in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they did not follow the US model but were instead set up as research degrees at the same level as PhDs but with some taught components and a professional concentration for the research work.[22]\n\nThe older-style doctorates, now usually called higher doctorates in the United Kingdom, take much longer to complete, since candidates must show themselves to be leading experts in their subjects. These doctorates are now less common in some countries and are often awarded honoris causa. The habilitation is still used for academic recruitment purposes in many countries within the EU, and involves either a new long thesis (a second book) or a portfolio of research publications. The habilitation (highest available degree) demonstrates independent and thorough research, experience in teaching and lecturing, and, more recently, the ability to generate supportive funding. The habilitation follows the research doctorate, and in Germany it can be a requirement for appointment as a Privatdozent or professor.\n\nTypes [ edit ]\n\nSince the Middle Ages, the number and types of doctorates awarded by universities has proliferated throughout the world. Practice varies from one country to another. While a doctorate usually entitles one to be addressed as \"doctor\", use of the title varies widely, depending on the type and the associated occupation.\n\nResearch doctorate [ edit ]\n\nResearch doctorates are awarded in recognition of academic research that is publishable, at least in principle, in a peer-reviewed academic journal. The best-known research degree title, in the English-speaking world, is Doctor of Philosophy (abbreviated Ph.D.,[23] PhD[24] or, at some British universities, DPhil[25][26][27]) awarded in many countries throughout the world. Other research doctorates include the Doctor of Education (Ed.D.[23] or EdD[24]), Doctor of Arts (D.A.[23]), Doctor of Musical Arts (D.M.A.[23]), Doctor of Professional Studies/Professional Doctorate (ProfDoc or DProf),[24] Doctor of Public Health (Dr.P.H.[23]), Doctor of Social Science (D.S.Sc. or DSocSci[24]), Doctor of Management (D.M. or D.Mgt.),[citation needed] Doctor of Business Administration (D.B.A.[23] or DBA[28]), the UK Doctor of Management (DMan),[29] various doctorates in engineering, such as the US Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng., D.E.Sc. or D.E.S.[23]) (also awarded in Japan and South Korea), the UK Engineering Doctorate (EngD),[30] the Dutch Professional Doctorate in Engineering (PDEng), the German engineering doctorate Doktoringenieur (Dr.-Ing.) and the German natural science doctorate Doctor rerum naturalium (Dr.rer.nat.). The UK Doctor of Medicine (MD or MD (Res)) and Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) can be research doctorates.[24] The Doctor of Theology (Th.D.,[23] D.Th. or ThD[24]), Doctor of Practical Theology (DPT)[24] and the Doctor of Sacred Theology (S.T.D.,[23] or D.S.Th.) are research doctorates in theology.[31]\n\nCriteria for research doctorates vary, but typically require completion of a substantial body of original research, which may be presented as a single thesis or dissertation, or as a portfolio of shorter project reports (thesis by publication). The submitted dissertation is assessed by a committee of examiners, and is then typically defended by the candidate during an oral examination (viva in the UK and India) by the committee. Candidates may also be required to complete graduate-level courses in their field, as well as study research methodology.\n\nCriteria for admission to doctoral programs varies. In the U.S. and the U.K., students may be admitted with a bachelor's degree, while elsewhere, e.g. in Finland, a master's degree is required. The time required to complete a research doctorate varies from three years, excluding undergraduate study, to six years or more.\n\nLicentiate [ edit ]\n\nLicentiate degrees vary widely in their meaning, and in a few countries are doctoral level qualifications. Sweden awards the licentiate degree as a two-year qualification at doctoral level and the doctoral degree (PhD) as a four-year qualification.[32] Sweden originally abolished the Licentiate in 1969 but reintroduced it in response to demands from business.[33] Finland also has a two-year doctoral level licentiate degree, similar to Sweden's.[34] Outside of Scandinavia, the licentiate is normally a lower level qualification. In Belgium, the licentiate was the basic university degree prior to the Bologna Process and was approximately equivalent to a bachelor's degree,[35][36] while in France and other countries it is the bachelor's-level qualification in the Bologna process.[37] In the Pontifical system, the Licentiate in Sacred Theology (STL) is equivalent to an advanced master's degree, or the post-master's coursework required in preparation for a doctorate (i.e. similar in level to the Swedish/Finnish licentiate degree), while other licences (such as the Licence in Canon Law) are at the level of master's degrees.[38]\n\nHigher doctorate and post-doctoral degrees [ edit ]\n\n\"Post-doctoral degree\" redirects here. It is not to be confused with Postdoctoral researcher\n\nA higher tier of research doctorates may be awarded on the basis of a formally submitted portfolio of published research of a particularly high standard. Examples include the Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) and Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) degrees found in the UK, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries, and the traditional doctorates in Scandinavia.\n\nThe École Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin of the Université catholique de Louvain, for instance, has offered the opportunity for students who had already earned a doctorate to earn the degree of Maître Agrégé (M.AGG.)(Magister Aggregatus).[39]\n\nThe habilitation teaching qualification (facultas docendi or \"faculty to teach\") under a university procedure with a thesis and an exam is commonly regarded as belonging to this category in Germany, Austria, France, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Poland, etc. The degree developed in Germany in the 19th century \"when holding a doctorate seemed no longer sufficient to guarantee a proficient transfer of knowledge to the next generation.\"[40] The habilitation results in an award of a formal \"Dr. habil.\" degree or the holder of the degree may add \"habil.\" to their research doctorate such as \"Dr. phil. habil.\" or \"Dr. rer. nat. habil.\" In some European universities, especially in German-speaking countries, the degree is insufficient to have teaching duties without professor supervision (or to teach and supervise Ph.D. students independently) without an additional instructor/teaching certificate/license, such as Privatdozent. In many countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the degree gives the venia legendi, Latin for \"permission for lecturing,\" or the ius docendi, \"right of teaching\" a specific academic subject at universities for a lifetime. The French academic system used to have a higher doctorate, called \"State doctorate\" (doctorat d'État), but it was superseded by the habilitation (Habilitation à diriger des recherches, \"accreditation to supervise research\", abbreviated HDR) in 1984.\n\nHigher doctorates are often also awarded honoris causa when a university wishes to formally recognize an individual's achievements and contributions to a particular field.\n\nProfessional doctorate [ edit ]\n\nDepending on the country, professional doctorates may either be research degrees at the same level as PhDs or professional degrees with little or no research content. Many professional doctorates are named \"Doctor of [subject name] and abbreviated using the form \"D[subject abbreviation]\" or \"[subject abbreviation]D\",[24] or may use the more generic titles \"Professional Doctorate\", abbreviated \"ProfDoc\" or \"DProf\",[24] \"Doctor of Professional Studies\" (DPS) [41][42] or \"Doctor of Professional Practice\" (DPP).[43][44]\n\nIn the US, professional doctorates (formally \"doctor's degree – professional practice\" in government classifications) are defined by the US Department of Education's National Center for Educational Statistics as degrees that require a minimum of six years of university-level study (including any pre-professional bachelor's or associate degree) and meet the academic requirements for professional licensure in the discipline. The definition does not include a dissertation or study beyond master's level, in contrast to the definition for research doctorates (\"doctor's degree – research/scholarship\"), although individual programs may have different requirements.[45][46] There is also a category of \"doctor's degree – other\" for doctorates that do not fall into either the \"professional practice\" or \"research/scholarship\" categories.[47] All of these are considered doctoral degrees.[48]\n\nIn contrast to the US, many countries reserve the term \"doctorate\" for research degrees and if, as in Canada and Australia, professional degrees bear the name \"Doctor of ...\", etc., it is made clear that these are not doctorates. Examples of this include Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD), Doctor of Medicine (MD), Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS), and Juris Doctor (JD). For example, Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), Doctor of Education (EdD) and Doctor of Social Science (DSS) qualify as full academic doctorates in Canada though they normally incorporate aspects of professional practice in addition to a full dissertation.[49][50] In the Philippines, the University of the Philippines Open University offers a Doctor of Communication (DCOMM) professional doctorate, designed to strengthen the capability of practitioners by bringing the academic rigors of research, critical analysis, intellectual advancement, and science skills into the profession of communication as it is practiced in knowledge industries such as the academe, R&D institutions, government and development-assistance agencies.[51]\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, all doctorates are third cycle qualifications in the Bologna Process, comparable to US research doctorates. Although all doctorates are research degrees, professional doctorates normally include taught components while the name PhD/DPhil is normally used for doctorates purely by thesis. Professional and practice-based doctorates such as the EdD, DClinPsy, MD, DHSc, DBA and EngD are full doctorates at the same level as the PhD in the national qualifications frameworks; they are not first professional degrees but are \"often post-experience qualifications\".[22][24][28][52] In 2009 there were 308 professional doctorate programs in the UK, up from 109 in 1998, with the most popular being the EdD (38 institutions), DBA (33), EngD/DEng (22), MD/DM (21), and DClinPsy/DClinPsych/ClinPsyD (17).[53] Similarly in Australia, the term \"professional doctorate\" is sometimes applied to the Scientiae Juridicae Doctor (SJD),[54][55] which, like the UK professional doctorates, is a research degree.[56][57]\n\nHonorary doctorate [ edit ]\n\nWhen a university wishes to formally recognize an individual's contributions to a particular field or philanthropic efforts, it may choose to grant a doctoral degree honoris causa (i.e. \"for the sake of the honor\"), waiving the usual requirements for granting the degree.[58][59] Some universities do not award honorary degrees, for example, Cornell University,[60] the University of Virginia,[61] the California Institute of Technology, Rice University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[62]\n\nNational variations [ edit ]\n\nArgentina [ edit ]\n\nIn Argentina the doctorate (doctorado)[63] is the highest academic degree. The intention is that candidates produce original contributions in their field knowledge within a frame of academic excellence.[64] A dissertation or thesis is prepared under the supervision of a tutor or director. It is reviewed by a Doctoral Committee composed of examiners external to the program and at least one examiner external to the institution. The degree is conferred after a successful dissertation defence.[65] Currently, there are approximately 2,151 postgraduate careers in the country, of which 14% were doctoral degrees.[64] Doctoral programs in Argentina are overseen by the National Commission for University Evaluation and Accreditation,[66][not in citation given] an agency in Argentina's Ministry of Education, Science and Technology.[67]\n\nBrazil [ edit ]\n\nDoctoral candidates are normally required to have a Master's degree in a related field. Exceptions are based on their individual academic merit. A second and a third foreign language are other common requirements, although the requirements regarding proficiency commonly are not strict. The admissions process varies by institution. Some require candidates to take tests while others base admissions on a research proposal application and interview only. In both instances however, a faculty member must agree prior to admission to supervise the applicant.\n\nRequirements usually include satisfactory performance in advanced graduate courses, passing an oral qualifying exam and submitting a thesis that must represent an original and relevant contribution to existing knowledge. The thesis is examined in a final public oral exam administered by at least five faculty members, two of whom must be external. After completion, which normally consumes 4 years, the candidate is commonly awarded the degree of Doutor (Doctor) followed by the main area of specialization, e.g. Doutor em Direito (Doctor of Laws), Doutor em Ciências da Computação (Doctor of Computer Sciences), Doutor em Filosofia (Doctor of Philosophy), Doutor em Economia (Doctor of Economics), Doutor em Engenharia (Doctor of Engineering) or Doutor em Medicina (Doctor of Medicine). The generic title of Doutor em Ciências (Doctor of Sciences) is normally used to refer collectively to doctorates in the natural sciences (i.e. Physics, Chemistry, Biological and Life Sciences, etc.)\n\nAll graduate programs in Brazilian public universities are tuition-free (mandated by the Brazilian constitution). Some graduate students are additionally supported by institutional scholarships granted by federal government agencies like CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico) and CAPES (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento do Pessoal de Ensino Superior). Personal scholarships are provided by the various FAP's (Fundações de Amparo à Pesquisa) at the state level, especially FAPESP in the state of São Paulo, FAPERJ in the state of Rio de Janeiro and FAPEMIG in the state of Minas Gerais. Competition for graduate financial aid is intense and most scholarships support at most 2 years of Master's studies and 4 years of doctoral studies. The normal monthly stipend for doctoral students in Brazil is between 500 and 1000 USD.\n\nA degree of Doutor usually enables an individual to apply for a junior faculty position equivalent to a US Assistant Professor. Progression to full professorship known as Professor Titular requires that the candidate be successful in a competitive public exam and normally takes additional years. In the federal university system, doctors who are admitted as junior faculty members may progress (usually by seniority) to the rank of Associate Professor then become eligible to take the competitive exam for vacant full professorships. In São Paulo state universities, Associate Professorships and subsequent eligibility to apply for a full professorship are conditioned on the qualification of Livre-docente and requires, in addition to a doctorate, a second thesis or cumulative portfolio of peer-reviewed publications, a public lecture before a panel of experts (including external members from other universities), and a written exam.\n\nIn recent years somme initiatives as jointly supervised doctorates (e.g. \"cotutelles\") have become increasingly common in the country, as part of the country's efforts to open its universities to international students.[68]\n\nDenmark [ edit ]\n\nDenmark offers four levels of degrees: 1) a three-year bachelor's degree (e.g. Bachelor of Arts degree); 2) a five-year candidate's degree (e.g. Candidatus/Candidata Magisterii), generally compared to a master's degree; 3) a ph.d. degree, which replaced the licentiate in 1988; 4) a doctor's degree (e.g. Doctor Philosophiae), which is the higher doctorate. (A three-year extended research program, leading to the magister's degree was phased out to meet the international standards of the Bologna Process.)\n\nFor the Ph.D. degree, the candidate writes a thesis and defends it orally at a formal disputation. In the disputation, the candidate defends their thesis against three official opponents as well as opponents from the auditorium (ex auditorio).\n\nFor the higher doctorate, the candidate writes a major thesis and has to defend it orally in which the candidate (called præses) defends this thesis against two official opponents as well as opponents from the auditorium (ex auditorio).\n\nEgypt [ edit ]\n\nIn Egypt, the highest degree doctorate is awarded by Al-Azhar University est. 970, which grants ( العالمية Ālimiyya\\ Habilitation).\n\nThe Medical doctorate (abbreviated as M.D.) is equivalent to the Ph.D. degree.[69] To earn an M.D. in a science specialty, one must have a master's degree (M.Sc.) (or two diplomas before the introduction of M.Sc. degree in Egypt) before applying. The M.D. degree involves courses in the field and defending a dissertation. It takes on average three to five years.\n\nMany postgraduate medical and surgical specialties students earn a Doctorate. After finishing a 6-year medical school and one-year internship (house officer), physicians and surgeons earn the M.B. B.Ch. degree, which is equivalent to a US MD degree. They can then apply to earn a master's degree or a speciality diploma, then an MD degree in a specialty.\n\nThe Egyptian M.D. degree is written using the name of one's specialty. For example, M.D. (Geriatrics) means a doctorate in Geriatrics, which is equivalent to a Ph.D. in Geriatrics.\n\nFinland [ edit ]\n\nThe Finnish requirement for the entrance into doctoral studies is a master's degree or equivalent. All universities have the right to award doctorates.[70] The ammattikorkeakoulu institutes (institutes of higher vocational education that are not universities but often called \"Universities of Applied Sciences\" in English) do not award doctoral or other academic degrees. The student must:\n\nDemonstrate understanding of their field and its meaning, while preparing to use scientific or scholarly study in their field, creating new knowledge.\n\nObtain a good understanding of development, basic problems and research methods\n\nObtain such understanding of the general theory of science and letters and such knowledge of neighbouring research fields that they are able to follow the development of these fields.\n\nThe way to show that these general requirements have been met is:\n\nComplete graduate coursework.\n\nDemonstrate critical and independent thought\n\nPrepare and publicly defend a dissertation (a monograph or a compilation thesis of peer-reviewed articles). In fine arts, the dissertation may be substituted by works and/or performances as accepted by the faculty.\n\nEntrance to a doctoral program is available only for holders of a master's degree; there is no honors procedure for recruiting Bachelors. Entrance is not as controlled as in undergraduate studies, where a strict numerus clausus is applied. Usually, a prospective student discusses their plans with a professor. If the professor agrees to accept the student, the student applies for admission. The professor may recruit students to their group.[71] Formal acceptance does not imply funding. The student must obtain funding either by working in a research unit or through private scholarships. Funding is more available for natural and engineering sciences than in letters. Sometimes, normal work and research activity are combined.[72]\n\nPrior to introduction of the Bologna process, Finland required at least 42 credit weeks (1,800 hours) of formal coursework. The requirement was removed in 2005, leaving the decision to individual universities, which may delegate the authority to faculties or individual professors. In Engineering and Science, required coursework varies between 40 and 70 ECTS.\n\nThe duration of graduate studies varies. It is possible to graduate three years after the master's degree, while much longer periods are not uncommon. The study ends with a dissertation, which must present substantial new scientific/scholarly knowledge. The dissertation can either be a monograph or it an edited collection of 3 to 7 journal articles. Students unable or unwilling to write a dissertation may qualify for a licentiate degree by completing the coursework requirement and writing a shorter thesis, usually summarizing one year of research.\n\nWhen the dissertation is ready, the faculty names two expert pre-examiners with doctoral degrees from the outside the university. During the pre-examination process, the student may receive comments on the work and respond with modifications.[73] After the pre-examiners approve, the doctoral candidate applies the faculty for permission to print the thesis. When granting this permission, the faculty names the opponent for the thesis defence, who must also be an outside expert, with at least a doctorate. In all Finnish universities, long tradition requires that the printed dissertation hang on a cord by a public university noticeboard for at least ten days prior to for the dissertation defence.[74]\n\nThe doctoral dissertation takes place in public. The opponent and the candidate conduct a formal debate, usually wearing white tie, under the supervision of the thesis supervisor. Family, friends, colleagues and the members of the research community customarily attend the defence. After a formal entrance, the candidate begins with an approximately 20-minute popular lecture (lectio praecursoria), that is meant to introduce laymen to the thesis topic. The opponent follows with a short talk on the topic, after which the pair critically discuss the dissertation. The proceedings take two to three hours. At the end the opponent presents their final statement and reveals whether he/she will recommend that the faculty accept it. Any member of the public then has an opportunity to raise questions, although this is rare. Immediately after the defence, the supervisor, the opponent and the candidate drink coffee with the public. Usually, the attendees of the defence are given the printed dissertation.[75] In the evening, the passed candidate hosts a dinner (Finnish: karonkka) in honour of the opponent. Usually, the candidate invites their family, colleagues and collaborators.[76]\n\nDoctoral graduates are often Doctors of Philosophy (filosofian tohtori), but many fields retain their traditional titles: Doctor of Medicine (lääketieteen tohtori), Doctor of Science in Technology (tekniikan tohtori), Doctor of Science in Arts (Art and Design), etc.\n\nThe doctorate is a formal requirement for a docenture or professor's position, although these in practice require postdoctoral research and further experience. Exceptions may be granted by the university governing board, but this is uncommon, and usually due to other work and expertise considered equivalent.\n\nFrance [ edit ]\n\nHistory\n\nBefore 1984 three research doctorates existed in France: the State doctorate (doctorat d'État, \"DrE\", the old doctorate introduced in 1808), the third cycle doctorate (Doctorat de troisième cycle, also called doctorate of specialty, Doctorat de spécialité, created in 1954 and shorter than the State doctorate) and the diploma of doctor-engineer (diplôme de docteur-ingénieur created in 1923), for technical research.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, following the submission of two theses (primary thesis, thèse principale, and secondary thesis, thèse complémentaire) to the Faculty of Letters (in France, \"letters\" is equivalent to \"humanities\") at the University of Paris, the doctoral candidate was awarded the Doctorat ès lettres. There was also the less prestigious \"university doctorate\" Doctorat d'université which could be received for the submission of a single thesis.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Doctorat ès lettres was renamed to Doctorat d'État.[77] In 1954 (for the sciences) and 1958 (for letters and human sciences), the less demanding Doctorat de troisième cycle degree was created on the model of the American Ph.D. with the purpose to lessen what had become an increasingly long period of time between the typical students' completion of their Diplôme d'études supérieures, roughly equivalent to a Master of Arts) and their Doctorat d'État.[77]\n\nAfter 1984, only one type of doctoral degree remained: the \"doctorate\" (Doctorat). A special diploma was created called the \"accreditation to supervise research\" (Habilitation à diriger des recherches), a professional qualification to supervise doctoral work. (This diploma is similar in spirit to the older State doctorate, and the requirements for obtaining it are similar to those necessary to obtain tenure in other systems.) Before only professors or senior full researchers of similar rank were normally authorized to supervise a doctoral candidate's work.[78] Now habilitation is a prerequisite to the title of professor in university (Professeur des universités) and to the title of Research Director (Directeur de recherche) in national public research agency such as CNRS, INRIA, or INRA.\n\nAdmission\n\nToday, the doctorate (doctorat) is a research-only degree. It is a national degree and its requirements are fixed by the minister of higher education and research. Only public institutions award the doctorate. It can be awarded in any field of study. The master's degree is a prerequisite. The normal duration is three years. The redaction of a comprehensive thesis constitutes the bulk of the doctoral work. While the length of the thesis varies according to the discipline, it is rarely less than 150 pages, and often substantially more. Some 15,000 new doctoral matriculations occur every year and ~10,000 doctorates are awarded.[79]\n\nDoctoral candidates can apply for a three-year fellowship. The most well known is the Contrat Doctoral (4,000 granted every year with a gross salary of 1758 euros per months as of September 2016 ).\n\nSince 2002 candidates follow in-service training, but there is no written examination for the doctorate. The candidate has to write a thesis that is read by two external reviewers. The head of the institution decides whether the candidate can defend the thesis, after considering the external reviews. The jury members are designated by the head of the institution. The candidate's supervisor and the external reviewers are generally jury members. The maximum number of jury members is 8. The defense generally lasts 45 minutes in scientific fields, followed by 1 – 2 and a half hours of questions from the jury or other doctors present. The defense and questions are public. The jury then deliberates in private and then declares the candidate admitted or \"postponed\". The latter is rare. New regulations were set in 2016 and do not award distinctions.\n\nThe title of doctor (docteur) can also be used by medical and pharmaceutical practitioners who hold a doctor's State diploma (diplôme d'État de docteur). The diploma is a first-degree.\n\nGermany [ edit ]\n\nDoctorate degrees in Germany are research doctorates and are awarded via a process called Promotion (\"promotion\"). The concept of a US-style professional doctorate as an entry-level professional qualification does not exist. However, in medicine, \"doctoral\" dissertations are often written alongside undergraduate study. The European Research Council decided in 2010 that those Dr. med. doctorates do not meet the international standards of a PhD research degree.[80][81] The duration of the doctorate depends on the field: a doctorate in medicine may take less than a full-time year to complete, other fields take two to six. Most doctorates are awarded with specific Latin designations for the field of research (except for engineering, where the designation is German) instead of a general degree for all fields (e.g., the Ph.D.). The most important degrees are:\n\nDr. rer. nat. ( rerum naturalium ; natural and formal sciences, i.e. physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, computer science and information technology, or psychology);\n\n( ; natural and formal sciences, i.e. physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, computer science and information technology, or psychology); Dr. phil. ( philosophiae ; humanities such as philosophy, philology, history, and social sciences such as sociology, political science, or psychology as well);\n\n( ; humanities such as philosophy, philology, history, and social sciences such as sociology, political science, or psychology as well); Dr. iur. ( iuris ; law);\n\n( ; law); Dr. oec. ( oeconomiae ; economics);\n\n( ; economics); Dr. rer. pol. ( rerum politicarum ; economics, business administration, political science);\n\n( ; economics, business administration, political science); Dr. theol. ( theologiae ; theology);\n\n( ; theology); Dr. med. ( medicinae ; medicine);\n\n( ; medicine); Dr. med. dent. ( medicinae dentariae ; dentistry);\n\n( ; dentistry); Dr. med. vet. ( medicinae veterinariae ; veterinary medicine);\n\n( ; veterinary medicine); Dr.-Ing. (engineering).\n\nOver fifty such designations are available, many of them rare or no longer in use. For addressing, the degree is commonly written in front of the name in abbreviated form, e.g., Dr. rer. nat. Max Mustermann or Dr. Max Mustermann, dropping the designation entirely. However leaving out the designation is only allowed, when the doctorate degree is not an honorary doctorate, which has to be indicated by Dr. h.c. (from Latin honoris causa). Although the honorific does not become part of the name, holders can demand that the title appear in official documents. The title is not mandatory. The honorific is commonly used in formal letters. For holders of other titles, only the highest title is mentioned. Multiple holders of doctorate degrees can be addressed as Dres. (from Latin doctores). Professional doctorates obtained in other countries, not requiring a thesis or not being third cycle qualifications under the Bologna process, can only be used postnominally, e.g., \"Max Mustermann, MD\", and do not allow the use of the title Dr.[82]\n\nIn the German university system it is common to write two doctoral theses, the inaugural thesis (Inauguraldissertation), completing a course of study, and the habilitation thesis (Habilitationsschrift), which opens the road to a professorship.[83] Upon completion of the habilitation thesis, a Habilitation is awarded, which is indicated by appending habil. (habilitata/habilitatus) to the doctorate, e.g., Dr. rer. nat. habil. Max Mustermann. It is considered as an additional academic qualification rather than an academic degree formally. It qualifies the owner to teach at German universities (facultas docendi). The holder of a Habilitation receives the authorization to teach a certain subject (venia legendi). This has been the traditional prerequisite for attaining Privatdozent (PD) and employment as a full university Professor. With the introduction of Juniorprofessuren—around 2005—as an alternative track towards becoming a professor at universities (with tenure), Habilitation is no longer the only university career track.\n\nIndia [ edit ]\n\nIn India, doctorates are offered by universities. Entry requirements include master's degree. Some universities consider undergraduate degrees in professional areas such as engineering, medicine or law as qualifications for pursuing doctorate level degrees. Entrance examinations are held for almost all programs. In most North Indian universities, coursework duration and thesis is 6-7 years and in most South Indian universities is 5 years. The most common doctoral degree is Ph.D.\n\nItaly [ edit ]\n\nItaly uses a three-level degree system. The first-level degree, called a \"laurea\" (Bachelor's degree), requires three years and a short thesis. The second-level degree, called a \"laurea magistrale\" (Master's degree), is obtained after two additional years, specializing in a branch of the field. This degree requires more advanced thesis work, usually involving academic research or an internship. The final degree is called a \"dottorato di ricerca\" (Ph.D.) and is obtained after three years of academic research on the subject and a thesis.\n\nAlternatively, after obtaining the laurea or the laurea magistrale one can complete a \"Master's\" (first-level Master's after the laurea; second-level Master's after the laurea magistrale) of one or two years, usually including an internship. An Italian \"Master's\" is not the same as a master's degree; it is intended to be more focused on professional training and practical experience.\n\nRegardless of the field of study, the title for Bachelors Graduate students is Dottore/Dottoressa (abbrev. Dott./Dott.ssa, or as Dr.), not to be confused with the title for the Ph.D., which is instead Dottore/Dottoressa di Ricerca. A laurea magistrale grants instead the title of Dottore/Dottoressa magistrale. Graduates in the fields of Education, Art and Music are also called Dr. Prof. (or simply Professore) or Maestro. Many professional titles, such as ingegnere (engineer) are awarded only upon passing a post-graduation examination (esame di stato), and registration in the relevant professional association.\n\nThe first institution in Italy to create a doctoral program (Ph.D.) was Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa in 1927 under the historic name \"Diploma di Perfezionamento\".[84][85] Further, the research doctorates or Ph.D. (Italian: Dottorato di ricerca) in Italy were introduced with law and Presidential Decree in 1980 (Law of February 21, 1980, No. 28 and the Presidential Decree No. 382 of 11 July 1980), referring to the reform of academic teaching, training and experimentation in organisation and teaching methods.[86][87]\n\nHence the Superior Graduate Schools in Italy (Grandes écoles)[88] (Italian: Scuola Superiore Universitaria),[89] also called Schools of Excellence (Italian: Scuole di Eccellenza)[88][90] such as Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa and Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies keep their historical \"Diploma di Perfezionamento\" Ph.D. title by law[85][91] and MIUR Decree.[92][93]\n\nJapan [ edit ]\n\nUntil the 1990s, most natural science and engineering doctorates in Japan were earned by industrial researchers in Japanese companies. These degrees were awarded by the employees' former university, usually after years of research in industrial laboratories. The only requirement is submission of a dissertation, along with articles published in well-known journals. This program is called ronbun hakase (論文博士). It produced the majority of engineering doctoral degrees from national universities. University-based doctoral programs called katei hakase (課程博士), are gradually replacing these degrees. By 1994, more doctoral engineering degrees were earned for research within university laboratories (53%) than industrial research laboratories (47%).[94] Since 1978, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) has provided tutorial and financial support for promising researchers in Asia and Africa. The program is called JSPS RONPAKU.[95]\n\nProfessional degree [ edit ]\n\nThe only professional doctorate in Japan is the Juris Doctor, known as Hōmu Hakushi (法務博士)[96] The program generally lasts two or three years. This curriculum is professionally oriented,[97] but unlike in the US the program does not provide education sufficient for a law license. All candidates for a bar license must pass the bar exam (Shihou shiken), attend the Legal Training and Research Institute and pass the practical exam (Nikai Shiken or Shihou Shushusei koushi).[98]\n\nNetherlands and Flanders [ edit ]\n\nThe traditional academic system of the Netherlands provided basic academic diploma: propaedeuse and three academic degrees: kandidaat (the lowest degree), depending on gender doctorandus or doctoranda (drs.) (with equivalent degrees in engineering - ir. and law - mr.) and doctor (dr.). After successful completion of the first year of university, the student was awarded the propaedeutic diploma (not a degree). In some fields, this diploma was abolished in the 1980s. In physics and mathematics, the student could directly obtain a kandidaats (candidate) diploma in two years. The candidate diploma was all but abolished by 1989. It used to be attained after completion of the majority of courses of the academic study (usually after completion of course requirements of the third year in the program), after which the student was allowed to begin work on their doctorandus thesis. The successful completion of this thesis conveyed the doctoranda/us title, implying that the student's initial studies were finished. In addition to these 'general' degrees, specific titles equivalent to the doctorandus degree were awarded for law: meester (master) (mr.), and for engineering: ingenieur (engineer)(ir.). Following the Bologna protocol the Dutch adopted the Anglo-Saxon system of academic degrees. The old candidate's degree was revived to become the bachelor's degree and the doctorandus' (mr and ir degree) were replaced by master's degrees. Dutch university programmes tend to include advanced subject matter that e.g., at Harvard is taught in Ph.D.-courses (for instance advanced quantum mechanics or general relativity in a Dutch course for the master's degree in theoretical physics).\n\nStudents can only enroll in a doctorate system after completing a research university level master's degree; although dispensation can be granted on a case by case basis after scrutiny of the individual's portfolio. The most common way to conduct doctoral studies is to work as promovendus/assistant in opleiding (aio)/onderzoeker in opleiding (oio) (research assistant with additional courses and supervision), perform extensive research and write a dissertation consisting of published articles (over a period of four or more years, averaging about 5.5 to 6). Research can also be conducted without official research assistant status, for example through a business-sponsored research laboratory.\n\nEvery Ph.D. thesis has to be promoted by a full university professor who has the role of principal advisor. The promotor (professor) determines whether the thesis quality suffices and can be submitted to the committee of experts. A committee of experts in the field review the thesis. Failures at this stage are rare because supervisors withhold inadequate work. The supervisors and promotor lose prestige among their colleagues should they allow a substandard thesis to be submitted.\n\nAfter reviewer approval, the candidate publishes the thesis (generally more than 100 copies) and sends it to colleagues, friends and family with an invitation to the public defense. The degree is awarded in a formal, public, defense session, in which the thesis is defended against critical questions of the \"opposition\" (the review committee). Failure during this session is possible, but rare. Before the defense there may or may not be a public presentation, lasting 10 minutes (e.g. Eindhoven University) to exactly half hour (e.g. Delft University). The actual defense lasts exactly the assigned time slot (45 minutes to 1 hour exactly depending on the University) after which the defense is stopped by the bedel who closes the process.\n\nThe doctor's title is the highest academic degree in the Netherlands. In research doctorates the degree is always Ph.D. with no distinction between disciplines. Three Dutch universities of technology (Eindhoven University of Technology, Delft University of Technology, and University of Twente) also award a (lower ranked) Professional Doctorate in Engineering (PDEng).\n\nAlthough the title doctor is informally called Ph.D., legally no Ph.D. degree exists. All other university titles (B.Sc./B.Ba./LL.B./B.A. M.Sc./M.B.A./LL.M./M.A.) are protected by law, while Ph.D. is not. Any person thus can adopt the Ph.D. title, but not the doctor title, which is protected. Those who obtained a degree in a foreign country can only use the Dutch title drs. mr. ir. or dr. if approved by the Dienst Uitvoering Onderwijs[99] though according to the opportunity principle, little effort monitors such frauds. Dutch doctors may use the letter D behind their name instead of the uncapitalized shortcut dr. before their name.[100]\n\nThose who have multiple doctor (dr.) titles may use the title dr.mult.[100] Those who have received honoris causa doctorates may use dr.h.c. before their own name.[100]\n\nIn Belgium's Flemish Community the doctorandus title was only used by those who actually started their doctoral work. Doctorandus is still used as a synonym for a Ph.D. student. The licentiaat (licensee) title was in use for a regular graduate until the Bologna reform changed the licentiaat degree to the master's degree (the Bologna reform abolished the two-year kandidaat degree and introduced a three-year academic bachelor's degree instead).\n\nRussia [ edit ]\n\nIn the Russian Empire the academic degree \"doctor of the sciences\" (doktor nauk) marked the highest academic degree that can be achieved by an examination. (The \"doctor nauk\" degree was introduced in Russia in 1819, abolished in 1917, and revived in the USSR in 1934.)[101] This system was generally adopted by the USSR/Russia and many post-Soviet countries. A lower degree, \"candidate [doctor] of the sciences\" (kandidat nauk; first introduced in the USSR on January 13, 1934, by a decision of the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR), is, roughly, the Russian equivalent to the research doctorate in other countries.\n\nSpain [ edit ]\n\nbiretta. The ancient ceremony of bestowing Complutense 's Doctoral\n\nDoctoral degrees are regulated by Royal Decree (R.D. 778/1998),[102] Real Decreto (in Spanish). They are granted by the University on behalf of the King. Its Diploma has the force of a public document. The Ministry of Science keeps a National Registry of theses called TESEO.[103] According to the National Institute of Statistics (INE), less than 5% of M.Sc. degree holders are admitted to Ph.D. programmes.\n\nAll doctoral programs are research-oriented. A minimum of 4 years of study is required, divided into 2 stages:\n\nA 2-year (or longer) period of studies concludes with a public dissertation presented to a panel of 3 Professors. Upon approval from the university, the candidate receives a \"Diploma de Estudios Avanzados\" (part qualified doctor, equivalent to M.Sc.). From 2008 it is possible to substitute the former diploma by a recognized master program.\n\nA 2-year (or longer) research period includes extensions for up to 10 years. The student must present a thesis describing a discovery or original contribution. If approved by their thesis director, the study is presented to a panel of 5 distinguished scholars. Any Doctor attending the public defense is allowed to challenge the candidate with questions. If approved, the candidate receives the doctorate. Four marks used to be granted: Unsatisfactory (Suspenso), Pass (Aprobado), Remarkable (Notable), \"Cum laude\" (Sobresaliente), and \"Summa cum laude\" (Sobresaliente Cum Laude). Those Doctors granted their degree \"Summa Cum Laude\" were allowed to apply for an \"Extraordinary Award\".\n\nSince September 2012 and regulated by Royal Decree (R.D. 99/2011) (in Spanish),[104] three marks can be granted: Unsatisfactory (No apto), Pass (Apto) and \"Cum laude\" (Apto Cum Laude) as maximum mark. In the public defense the doctor is notified if the thesis has passed or not passed. The Apto Cum Laude mark is awarded after the public defense as the result of a private, anonymous vote. Votes are verified by the University. A unanimous vote of the reviewers nominates Doctors granted Apto Cum Laude for an \"Extraordinary Award\" (Premio Extraordinario de Doctorado).\n\nIn the same Royal Decree the initial 3-year study period was replaced by a Research master's degree (one or two years; Professional master's degrees do not grant direct access to Ph.D. Programs) that concludes with a public dissertation called \"Trabajo de Fin de Máster\" or \"Proyecto de Fin de Máster\". An approved project earns a master's degree that grants access to a Ph.D. program and initiates the period of research.\n\nA doctorate is required in order to teach at the University.[105]\n\nOnly Ph.D. holders, Grandees and Dukes can sit and cover their heads in the presence of the King.[106]\n\nFrom 1857, Complutense University was the only one in Spain authorised to confer the doctorate. This law remained in effect until 1954, when the University of Salamanca joined in commemoration of its septecentenary. In 1970, the right was extended to all Spanish universities.[107]\n\nAll doctorate holders are reciprocally recognised as equivalent in Germany and Spain (according to the \"Bonn Agreement of November 14, 1994\").[108]\n\nUnited Kingdom [ edit ]\n\nHistory of the UK doctorate [ edit ]\n\nThe doctorate has long existed in the UK as, originally, the second degree in divinity, law, medicine and music. But it was not until the late 19th century that the research doctorate, now known as the higher doctorate, was introduced. The first higher doctorate was the Doctor of Science at Durham University, introduced in 1882.[17] This was soon followed by other universities, including the University of Cambridge establishing its ScD in the same year, the University of London transforming its DSc from an advanced study course to a research degree in 1885, and the University of Oxford establishing its Doctor of Letters (DLitt) in 1900.[109][110]\n\nPh.D. Gown, University of Cambridge\n\nThe PhD was adopted in the UK following a joint decision in 1917 by British universities, although it took much longer for it to become established. Oxford became the first university to institute the new degree, although naming it the DPhil.[109] The PhD was often distinguished from the earlier higher doctorates by distinctive academic dress. At Cambridge, for example, PhDs wear a master's gown with scarlet facings rather than the full scarlet gown of the higher doctors, while the University of Wales gave PhDs crimson gowns rather than scarlet.[111] Professional doctorates were introduced in Britain in the 1980s and 1990s. The earliest professional doctorates were in the social sciences, including the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), Doctor of Education (EdD) and Doctor of Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy).[112]\n\nBritish doctorates today [ edit ]\n\nToday, except for those awarded honoris causa, all doctorates granted by British universities are research doctorates, in that their main (and in many cases only) component is the submission of an extensive and substantial thesis or portfolio of original research, examined by an expert panel appointed by the university. UK doctorates are categorised as:[24]\n\nJunior doctorates Subject specialist doctorates – normally PhD/DPhil; the most common form of doctorate Integrated subject specialist doctorates – integrated PhDs including teaching at master's level Doctorates by publication – PhD by Published Works; only awarded infrequently Professional and practice-based (or practitioner) doctorates – e.g. EdD, ProfDoc/DProf, EngD, etc.; usually include taught elements and have a professional, rather than academic, orientation\n\nHigher doctorates e.g. DD, LLD, DSc, DLitt; higher level than junior doctorates, usually awarded either for a substantial body of work over an extended period or as honorary degrees.\n\nThe Quality Assurance Agency states in the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies (which covers junior doctorates but not higher doctorates) that:[22]\n\nDoctoral degrees are awarded to students who have demonstrated: the creation and interpretation of new knowledge, through original research or other advanced scholarship, of a quality to satisfy peer review, extend the forefront of the discipline, and merit publication\n\na systematic acquisition and understanding of a substantial body of knowledge which is at the forefront of an academic discipline or area of professional practice\n\nthe general ability to conceptualise, design and implement a project for the generation of new knowledge, applications or understanding at the forefront of the discipline, and to adjust the project design in the light of unforeseen problems\n\na detailed understanding of applicable techniques for research and advanced academic enquiry\n\nIn the UK, the (junior) doctorate is a qualification awarded at FHEQ level 8/level 12 of the FQHEIS on the national qualifications frameworks.[22][24][113] The higher doctorates are stated to be \"A higher level of award\", which is not covered by the qualifications frameworks.[24]\n\nSubject specialist doctorates [ edit ]\n\nThese are the most common doctorates in the UK and are normally awarded as PhDs. While the master/apprentice model was traditionally used for British PhDs, since 2003 courses have become more structured, with students taking courses in research skills and receiving training for professional and personal development. However, the assessment of the PhD remains based on the production of a thesis or equivalent and its defence at a viva voce oral examination, normally held in front of at least two examiners, one internal and one external.[24] Access to PhDs normally requires an upper second class or first class bachelor's degree, or a master's degree. Courses normally last three years, although it is common for students to be initially registered for MPhil degrees and then formally transferred onto the PhD after a year or two. Students who are not considered likely to complete a PhD may be offered the opportunity to complete an MPhil instead.[114]\n\nIntegrated doctorates, originally known as 'New Route PhDs', were introduced from 2000 onwards. These integrate teaching at master's level during the first one or two years of the degree, either alongside research or as a preliminary to starting research. These courses usually offer a master's-level exit degree after the taught causes are completed. While passing the taught elements is often required, examination of the final doctorate is still by thesis (or equivalent) alone.[24] The duration of integrated doctorates is a minimum of four years, with three years spent on the research component.[115]\n\nIn 2013, Research Councils UK issued a 'Statement of Expectations for Postgraduate Training', which lays out the expectations for training in PhDs funded by the research councils.[116] In the latest version (2016), issued together with Cancer Research UK, the Wellcome Trust and the British Heart Foundation, these include the provision of careers advice, in-depth advanced training in the subject area, provision of transferable skills, training in experimental design and statistics, training in good research conduct, and training for compliance with legal, ethical and professional frameworks. The statement also encourages peer-group development through cohort training and/or Graduate schools.[117]\n\nHigher doctorates [ edit ]\n\nHigher doctorates are awarded in recognition of a substantial body of original research undertaken over the course of many years. Typically the candidate submits a collection of previously published, peer-refereed work, which is reviewed by a committee of internal and external academics who decide whether the candidate deserves the doctorate. The higher doctorate is similar in some respects to the habilitation in some European countries. However, the purpose of the award is significantly different. While the habilitation formally determines whether an academic is suitably qualified to be a university professor, the higher doctorate does not qualify the holder for a position but rather recognises their contribution to research.[17]\n\nHigher doctorates were defined by the UK Council for Graduate Education (UKCGE) in 2013 as:[17]\n\nan award that is at a level above the PhD (or equivalent professional doctorate in the discipline), and that is typically gained not through a defined programme of study but rather by submission of a substantial body of research-based work.\n\nIn terms of number of institutions offering the awards, the most common doctorates of this type in UKCGE surveys carried out in 2008 and 2013 were the Doctor of Science (DSc), Doctor of Letters (DLitt), Doctor of Law (LLD), Doctor of Music (DMus) and Doctor of Divinity (DD); in the 2008 survey the Doctor of Technology (DTech) tied with the DD.[17] The DSc was offered by all 49 responding institutions in 2008 and 15 out of 16 in 2013 and the DLitt by only one less in each case, while the DD was offered in 10 responding institutions in 2008 and 3 in 2013. In terms of number of higher doctorates awarded (not including honorary doctorates) the DSc was most popular, but the number of awards was very low: the responding institutions had averaged an award of at most one earned higher doctorate per year over the period 2003 - 2013.[17]\n\nHonorary degrees [ edit ]\n\nMost British universities award degrees honoris causa to recognise individuals who have made a substantial contribution to a particular field. Usually an appropriate higher doctorate is used in these circumstances, depending on the candidate's achievements. However, some universities differentiate between honorary and substantive doctorates, using the degree of Doctor of the University (D.Univ.) for these purposes, and reserve the higher doctorates for formal academic research.\n\nUnited States [ edit ]\n\nThe structure of US doctoral programs is more formal and complex than some others. US research doctorates are awarded for successfully completing and defending independent research presented in the form of a dissertation, along with advanced study. Multiple professional degrees use the term \"doctor\" in their title, such as Juris Doctor and Doctor of Medicine, but these degrees do not always contain an independent research component or always require a dissertation and should not be confused with Ph.D./D.Phil./Ed.D./D.Ed. degrees or other research doctorates.[118] Law school graduates, although awarded the J.D. degree, are not normally addressed as \"doctor\". In legal studies the Ph.D. equivalent is the much rarer Doctor of Juridical Science.\n\nMany universities offer Ph.D./D.Phil. followed by a professional doctorate or joint Ph.D./D.Phil. with the professional degree. Most often, Ph.D. work comes sequential to the professional degree, e.g., Ph.D./D.Phil. in law after a J.D. or equivalent[119][120][121][122] in physical therapy after DPT,[123][124] in pharmacy after Pharm.D.[125][126] Such professional degrees are referred to as an entry level doctorate program[127][128][129] and Ph.D. as a post-professional doctorate.[124]\n\nResearch degrees [ edit ]\n\nThe most common research doctorate is the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D. or D.Phil.). This degree was first awarded in the U.S. at the 1861 Yale University commencement.[130] The University of Pennsylvania followed in 1871,[131] and Cornell (1872),[132] Harvard (1873),[133] Michigan (1876) [134] and Princeton (1879)[135] followed suit. Unlike the introduction of the professional doctorate M.D., considerable controversy and opposition followed the introduction of the Ph.D. into the U.S. educational system, lasting into the 1950s, as it was seen as an unnecessary artificial transplant from a foreign (Germany) educational system, which corrupted a system based on England's Oxbridge model.[136]\n\nPh.D.s and other research doctorates in the U.S. typically entail successful completion of pertinent classes, passing a comprehensive examination, and defending a dissertation.[137]\n\nThe median number of years for completion of US doctoral degrees is seven.[31] Doctoral applicants were previously required to have a master's degree, but many programs accept students immediately following undergraduate studies.[138][139] Many programs gauge the potential of a student applying to their program and grant a master's degree upon completion of the necessary Ph.D. course work. When so admitted, the student is expected to have mastered the material covered in the master's degree despite not holding one, though this tradition is under heavy criticism.[140] Finishing Ph.D. qualifying exams confers Ph.D. candidate status, allowing dissertation work to begin.\n\nWhile not authoritative, the International Affairs Office of the U.S. Department of Education listed over 20 \"frequently\" awarded research doctorate titles identified by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in a 2008 document as representing degrees equivalent in research content to the Ph.D. at the time.[141] The 2008 version of the NSF list of research doctorates included in the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), contained 18 awards. The Doctor of Music and Doctor of Industrial Technology were removed in 2008, after the study evaluation identified that these were fully professional, rather than research-based, doctorates.[142] The current list (as of the 2016 SED, published in March 2018) contains the same 18 awards.[143]\n\nProfessional degrees [ edit ]\n\nMany fields offer professional doctorates (or professional master's) such as pharmacy, medicine, public health, dentistry, optometry, psychology, speech-language pathology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, health science, advanced practice registered nurse, chiropractic, naturopathic medicine, law, architecture, education, teaching, business, management, and others that require such degrees for professional practice or licensure. Some of these degrees are also termed \"first professional degrees,\" since they are the first field-specific master's or doctoral degrees.\n\nA Doctor of Pharmacy is awarded as the professional degree in Pharmacy replacing a Bachelor's. It is the only professional pharmacy degree awarded in the US. Pharmacy programs vary in length between 4 years for matriculants with a B.S./B.A. to 6 years for others.\n\nIn the twenty-first century professional doctorates appeared in other fields, such as the Doctor of Audiology in 2007. Advanced Practice Registered Nurses were expected to completely transition to the Doctor of Nursing Practice by 2015, and physical therapists to the Doctor of Physical Therapy by 2020. Professional associations play a central role in this transformation amid criticisms on the lack of proper criteria to assure appropriate rigor. In many cases Masters level programs were relabeled as doctoral programs.[144]\n\nRevocation [ edit ]\n\nA doctoral degree can be revoked or rescinded by the university that awarded it. Possible reasons include plagiarism, criminal or unethical activities of the author, or malfunction or manipulation of academic evaluation processes.[145]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]",

Westminster alone has 14,000 electric lamps\n\nA sense of old London: That the gas lamps have survived is partly a tribute to English Heritage, which has protected and restored them\n\nThey are evangelical about the particular beauty of their charges. Iain Bell, who oversees the operation, runs his hands over the posts like an antiquarian examining a classical sculpture.\n\nFellow engineer John Blanchard insists that the title 'lamplighter' doesn't go far enough. 'We are,' he says proudly, 'the Guardians of the Lamps.'\n\nBefore such men existed, London was a dark city. In the 18th century, it was a brave walker who ventured out without servants to lead the way with a lamp in one hand and a cudgel in the other.\n\nThose who could not afford to keep servants would pay a few coins to a 'link boy', named after their 'links' or torch wicks.\n\nThese wild street urchins, the sons of harlots and thieves, would walk ahead, carrying a stick with a rag dipped in tar and set alight. Some were cutpurses, leading their customers into courts and alleyways and stealing what they could in the darkness. Yet they were preyed on in turn.\n\nThe link boys were vulnerable to the attentions of unscrupulous men who would have their way with the boys for a few more farthings.\n\nMaintainance: Each gas light lamp is marked with the crest of the monarch in the year they were erected\n\nThose who couldn't afford to be guided in the dark took their chances — or rushed home before sunset.\n\nThen, in 1807, an extraordinary conjuring trick was performed on Pall Mall.\n\nTo celebrate the birthday of King George III, Frederick Winsor, an engineer, lit the most spectacular of candles. To gasping crowds, he instantly illuminated a line of gas lamps.\n\nEach one was fed with gas pipes made from the barrels of old musket guns and all Winsor had to do was apply a single spark to light up the whole street. The Mall was almost impassable with spectators until after midnight.\n\nOver the following decades, thousands of gas lamps went up across London.\n\nMany panicked about the new-fangled technology — explosions were alarmingly common in the early days — but for the first time in its history, London was safe, relatively speaking, to walk at night. The Victorian periodical The Westminster Review wrote that the introduction of gas lamps had done more to eliminate immorality and criminality on the streets than any number of church sermons.\n\nLabour of love: Unlike soulless, identical electric lights, the gas lamps are temperamental. Their mechanisms have to be wound and checked, the glass polished, and the 'mantles' replaced.\n\nStunning display: Gas lamps light up the moat of the Tower of London during the hugely popular poppy memorial earlier this year\n\nTo understand what London might have looked like in those early decades of gas, the lamplighters lead me into the centre of St James's Park.\n\nHere the gas lamps glow with a soft, parchment-coloured light. The light given off by an electric lamp, by contrast, is a harsh, fierce white. You don't notice how ugly it is until you've walked in the park and come out the other side on to electric-lit Constitution Hill.\n\nIain Bell jokes that at the time of the Olympics, the lamps in this part of town were the cleanest in London; the lighters kept finding excuses to clean the lamps on Horse Guards Parade, the venue for the (bikini-clad) beach volleyball matches. 'The lamps,' Bell says, 'were so clean you could eat your dinner off them.'\n\nWhen there are less enticing attractions, his lamplighters visit each lamp in London on a fortnight's rotation. Their services are paid for by each of the councils in which the lamps stand.\n\nUnlike soulless, identical electric lights, the gas lamps are temperamental. Their mechanisms have to be wound and checked, the glass polished ('We use Mr Muscle,' confesses John), and the 'mantles' replaced.\n\nThese are teardrop-shaped elements which look, from the ground, like bulbs. But from the top of John's ladder they are revealed to be tiny, bell-shaped, silk casings coated in lime-oxide, which becomes white-hot to give the lamps their glow.\n\nOnce there were hundreds of lamplighters in London, pacing the city at dusk with long, lighted poles to spark the gas running up the iron posts\n\nWhile some lamplighters change the mantles of the lamps outside Buckingham Palace at four in the morning to avoid the tourists, John likes to be up his ladder at the busiest times, revelling in his role as Lamp Guardian.\n\nThe Palace is happy to let the lamplighters shimmy up their posts, but our politicians are more precious. The Houses of Parliament look after their own lamps.\n\nHyde Park, too, has its own lamplighters, but otherwise, Iain and his team maintain 1,300 gas lamps from Richmond Bridge in the West to Bromley-by-Bow in the East.\n\nThe oldest lamps light up the inside of Westminster Abbey; the newest frame the statue of the Queen Mother near the Palace.\n\nJohn helps me climb level with one of the lamps in Smith Square. What strikes you as you open the glass window is the rush of warmth — welcome on a drizzling evening in November.\n\nIn daylight, each lamp burns with a tiny pilot light — if you look up on a grey and overcast day you can just see the flicker. At dusk, a timer fitted to each lamp moves a lever to release a stronger stream of gas which gives enough power to light up the mantles.\n\nIt's a wonderful trick. John manipulates the mechanism to show me the moment when the gas shoots up. The four mantles come on one at a time — flash! flash! flash! flash! — until the whole lamp shines.\n\nPast: A gas street lamp is seen outside the grand terraced houses of Ennismore Gardens in Kensington, London in the 1960s\n\nIn nearby Pickering Place, a gloomily Dickensian courtyard with half-timbered houses, Iain talks regretfully of the sheer waste of light in London. In Carlton Gardens, he points out the smart offices of an aerospace company. The desks are deserted, but lights are on at every window.\n\nFor a man who cherishes gas lamps, the careless second-hand wasted light from the offices is an insult.\n\nEach lamp is marked with the crest of the monarch in the year they were erected. During the great smogs of the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was possible for a man to find his way home by spotting the glow of the lantern, then feeling the markings on the post to work out where he was in the city.\n\nOutside the five-star Savoy Hotel is a rare example of a 'sewer lamp'. Its post is hollow and extends beneath the pavement to the great sewer below. The lamp was designed to extract foul smells and burn them off before they could reach the delicate nostrils of guests in the hotel's suites.\n\nSince the 19th century, almost all the lamps have been extended to raise their lanterns above the height of traffic. Modern delivery vans and lorries are rather taller than horse-drawn carriages and sedan chairs. When a lorry does drive into a lamp, which they do regrettably often, it is re-cast and put back exactly as it was.\n\nHistoric: A row of gas lamps are pictured in New Palace Yard, to the northwest of the Houses of Parliament\n\nThe lamps that stand today have survived the coming of electric light, the Blitz and the best efforts of London's lorry drivers. Their survival is testament to the care of generations of lamplighters.\n\nIn 1939, the journalist H. V. Morton wrote a book called the Ghosts Of London, which lamented the loss of the lamplighters who were once seen on every street at dusk. There were 412 of them then.\n\n'We're the last of the old brigade,' one of them told Morton.\n\nToday, there are just the five lamplighters left. It is thanks to them that this remarkable part of the city's history has endured and that in a few squares and parks and alleyways, it is still possible to walk the glowing streets which, long before electric light pollution, Dickens himself would have walked.",

Billups will appear on NBA Tonight, SportsCenter, NBA Coast to Coast and ESPN Radio, among other ESPN properties.\n\n“With my experience and passion for the game, I think I can spark interest with viewers,” Billups said in an interview with Sports Illustrated on Tuesday. “I think I have a unique perspective.”\n\nBillups will start in the studio but said he has interest long-term in learning how to be an analyst on game broadcasts. He is based in Denver and will travel to Bristol throughout the season.\n\nDubbed “Mr. Big Shot” for his icy cool in late-game situations, Billups played last season for the Detroit Pistons, who declined to pick up the team option on his contract for 2014-15. He announced his retirement in September after 17 NBA seasons, citing his inability to stay healthy having played only 61 games over the past three seasons.\n\n“I’m the kind of guy who has to be two feet in if I am going to give my best effort so broadcasting is something I looking at long-term,” said Billups, 37. “This is what I want to do and the avenue I want to take. At the moment, I’m not thinking about working in an NBA front office or coaching or anything else. I’m thinking about being the best I can be at ESPN in the studio.”\n\nBillups said he’s been interested in broadcasting for a couple of years and made it a point to do guest interviews when he could as his career closed. Asked if he could be critical of players and coaches in the league, including many who are his friends, Billups said, “There is a good and a bad way to handle everything. The kind of leader and teammate that I was, at every stop I made I was always honest with guys and honest with myself. I think that was the reason I grew to have the reputation I had in the league. It won’t be any different to be honest about a guy’s performance. That’s not anything I’m worried about. It’s not going to be personal and I’m not going to bash their personal character. But I will talk about their game if they are not performing to a certain standard.\"\n\nBillups was a five-time All-Star whose career apex came in 2004 when he won the NBA Finals MVP after leading the Pistons to an NBA title over the Lakers. He played 17 NBA seasons, including stops with Boston, Toronto, Denver, Minnesota, New York and the Los Angeles Clippers in addition to Detroit.\n\nOn the subject of LeBron James’ return to Cleveland, Billups said it was not far-fetched to believe that the Cavs could win a title immediately.\n\n“It’s possible,” Billups said. “You have to have talent, you have to have a leader that can command respect from everyone, and you have to have someone who has been there before and they have that. My concern would be the playoff inexperience of the other two studs in Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Neither one of those guys have played a playoff game but they have played in big games. They have both played in World Championships. But one game in the World Championships is different than playing the same team for two weeks straight in a series. Big difference. But they have a chance. Chicago and them are the two favorites in the East and if D-Rose (Derrick Rose) is not 100 percent and can’t be the D-Rose we all fell in love with, Cleveland wins the East. And if you get to the finals, you have a chance.\"\n\n​",
  "latent_14628": "Two planets from a period near the dawn of the cosmos are hinting that there may be more than one way to sow the seeds of planet formation.\n\nA team of astronomers reports it has found two planets orbiting a star some 376 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cetus. The team estimates that the star is 12.8 billion years old, indicating that the star and its planets formed only a billion years after the universe itself emerged in what astrophysicists have dubbed the big bang.\n\nBy contrast, the solar system humans inhabit formed about 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nThe results, set for publication in an upcoming issue of the monthly journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, represent what the study's lead scientist, Johny Setiawan, dubs “an archaeological find in our own backyard.”\n\nIndeed, the discovery is “remarkable since the planetary system most likely belongs to the first generation of planetary systems in the Milky Way,” the team writes.\n\nThe star, HIP 11952, has 83 percent of the sun's mass and 1.6 times the sun's radius. It appears to be on the doorstep of its death throes as a red giant, when its core's supply of hydrogen fuel hits “empty.” The core collapses, heats, and provides the energy for hydrogen remaining in the star's outer shell to begin fusing into helium. The star brightens, and its atmosphere heats and expands far beyond its current reach.\n\nOrbiting in the path of that expansion are two planets: one with 2.9 times Jupiter's mass orbiting HIP 11952 once every 290 days; the other with 78 percent of Jupiter's mass orbiting the star once every 6.95 days.\n\nTherein lies an intrigue: How did such planets form?\n\nFor years, astronomers have held that the stars most likely to host planets are, like the sun, enriched with elements heavier than the hydrogen they burn for fuel – elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, calcium, and silicon, for example. These are the raw materials for rocky cores around which planets form.\n\nBut these elements weren't around in the big bang's aftermath. They are forged in the fusion furnaces inside stars, which hurl them into interstellar space through explosions known as supernovae, as well as through less-violent processes. In other words, it took many generations of stars to build the universe's current inventory of these heavier elements, which astronomers dump into one bin labeled “metals.”\n\nHIP 11952, having formed relatively soon after the big bang, is in scientific parlance, \"metal poor.\" It has a far smaller inventory of these elements than one would expect for a star with planets.\n\nThe number of planets that have been found orbiting metal-poor stars is small. So far, astronomers have discovered more than 760 planets orbiting other stars. The two planets orbiting HIP 11952 bring to seven the number of planets found at metal-poor stars.\n\nWhile HIP 11952 isn't the most metal-deficient star astronomers have observed, it is the poorest yet to host planets – opening a window on processes by which the universe's earliest planets formed, the team holds.\n\nOne explanation for that process suggests that planets in a metal-poor disk could begin to form in much that same way a star does: A passing star's gravity may perturb a second star's disk of dust and gas, generating regions of different densities. The densest portions could have enough gravity associated with them to begin a process of collapse and accretion of additional gas, forming a planet.\n\nAnother explanation holds that the embryos of giant planets may, under the right conditions, undergo a second, rapid collapse that brings them into a smaller size, comparable to the planets found around HIP 11952.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\nDr. Setiawan's team says it hopes the discovery of more planets orbiting metal-poor stars will help researchers find the most likely mechanism for building the universe's earliest planets.\n\nSetiawan is a researcher with the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany.",

  "latent_14915": "Government quality and the economic returns of transport infrastructure investment\n\nRiccardo Crescenzi, Marco Di Cataldo, Andrés Rodríguez-Pose\n\nTransport infrastructure investment is a cornerstone of growth-promoting strategies around the world. However, investment in new infrastructure is not always conducive to stronger economic performance. This column argues that the lack of positive economic returns may be due to institutional failures mitigating the growth effects of public capital expenditures. In contexts marked by weak and inefficient governments and widespread corruption, different types of road investments yield low or no economic returns.\n\nInfrastructure investment has always been one of the cornerstones of economic development strategies in the EU, the US, and in many emerging and developing countries. Transport infrastructure investment has a central role in the European Commission’s Investment Plan for Europe (known as the ‘Juncker Plan’) as well as in public policies in many EU member states (e.g. the High Speed Two (HS2) project concerning the development of high-speed rail in the UK or the Messina Bridge project in Italy connecting Sicily with the ‘toe’ of the Italian peninsula). Transport infrastructure featured prominently in Barack Obama’s 2009 ‘stimulus package’ and is central in Donald Trump’s ‘America’s Infrastructure First’ policy. The World Bank also remains a strong advocate of transport infrastructure as a means to spur economic activity in less developed countries and regions. These strategies are often justified by policymakers on the basis of the presumed beneficial effects of new transportation for the economic prosperity of countries, regions, and cities. Indeed, scholarly research argues that a minimum level of transport infrastructure is essential for economic activity, promoting local accessibility and leading to improvements in the provision of services, reductions in production costs, and enhanced productivity.\n\nHowever, once a necessary basic threshold of infrastructure provision is reached, the economic impact of additional investment in transportation remains uncertain. The OECD claims that almost all of its member countries are already beyond such a threshold and that additional road expansions will have limited effects on economic performance (OECD 2009). In line with this evidence, recent research has highlighted how the returns of transport infrastructure investment in the EU have been more limited than that of expenditure in other development axes, such as human capital and innovation (Crescenzi and Rodríguez-Pose 2012).\n\nGovernment quality and infrastructure investment\n\nOne possible explanation for the lack of a clear link between transport infrastructure investment and economic growth is that the returns to investment in new infrastructure are mediated by the quality of regional government institutions co-responsible for the selection, design, and realisation of infrastructure projects.\n\nPolitical and institutional factors may influence both infrastructure spending and its economic returns at every phase of the investment (Esfahani and Ramirez 2003). From the planning and selection of transport projects to their implementation, the characteristics of the governance system play an important role in determining future efficiency gains (or the lack thereof). The need for large budgets, the high number of actors involved at all stages of the process, together with relevant asymmetric information and moral hazard problems make the transport sector particularly vulnerable to political interference (Wachs 1989, Flyvbjerg 2009, Cantarelli et al. 2010), corruption (Tanzi and Davoodi 1997, 1998), and collusion (World Bank 2011).\n\nAlthough justifications for new investment in transport infrastructure are generally based on economic efficiency arguments, the choice of whether and how to spend public resources for constructing new infrastructure may actually respond more to political and individual interests than to economic and collective ones (Crain and Oakley 1995, Henisz 2002). ‘Flagship’ and large-scale transport projects (motorways, high-speed rail, futuristic bridges, etc.) may be more appealing to incumbent politicians seeking re-election (Rodríguez-Pose 2000, Cantarelli et al. 2010), at the expense of less flashy, ‘ordinary’ transport investments (secondary roads, freight railways, etc.) or the maintenance and modernisation of existing infrastructure.\n\nRegional government quality and the economic returns of transport investment\n\nWhile the role of institutions and of government quality as mediators of the returns of public policy is increasingly acknowledged, this connection has seldom been proven empirically. In a recent paper, we test whether the quality of regional government shapes the returns of infrastructure across the regions of Europe. In so doing, we consider different typologies of transportation investment. We distinguish variations in the endowment of motorways from changes in other types of roads. Our working assumption is that this distinction reflects a set of structural differences in the underlying investment decisions – ceteris paribus, investment in different types of roads is driven by political preferences for larger/smaller budget projects, longer/shorter expenditure timeframes, higher/lower visibility of the ‘final product’ as well as by the capacity of local ‘planners’ to correctly ‘diagnose’ local needs and identify bottlenecks.\n\nWe make use of the classification by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat) of EU roads into ‘motorways’ (all dual carriageway roads) and ‘other roads’ (all other state, provincial, and communal roads). Motorways are more visible, costly to build, and normally connect urban centres across different regions. The development of local roads is much less glamourous, from an electoral point of view, but less likely to give rise to the same ‘hub-and-spoke’ effects as motorways.\n\nFigures 1 and 2 combine data on transport infrastructure investment with regional economic performance during the period of analysis. Regions are classified according to their average per capita growth rate between 1995 and 2009 and their investment in motorways and other roads respectively. The figures indicate that countries in the Iberian peninsula recorded the largest increases in motorways (Figure 1). The greatest improvements in secondary roads took place in the Netherlands, Sweden, Poland, Romania, central France, and central and southern Italy (Figure 2). Interestingly, the highest growth did not always take place in the countries and regions where road infrastructure improved the most in the period.\n\nFigure 1. Per capita GDP growth and motorways investment in the EU, 1995-2009\n\nSource: own elaboration with OECD and Eurostat data.\n\nFigure 2. Per capita GDP growth and other roads investment in the EU, 1995-2009\n\nSource: own elaboration with OECD and Eurostat data.\n\nIn order to empirically investigate how government quality shapes the links between transport infrastructure investment and regional growth in Europe, we estimate a basic regional growth regression where our two proxies for investment in motorways and secondary roads are respectively interacted with the Quality of Government (QoG) index, a survey-based indicator of government quality in European regions compiled by the Quality of Government Institute in Gothenburg.\n\nOur study unveils:\n\na very weak or insignificant direct correlation between economic growth and investments in either motorways or other roads;\n\na strong and positive connection between government quality and regional economic performance.\n\nAs the interaction terms are included in the analysis, they reveal that:\n\nno clear link between investment in motorways and growth exists, even if this investment is realised by regions endowed with better government institutions;\n\nimprovements in secondary roads display a connection with regional growth only in regions with higher quality of government.\n\nThese findings suggest that positive rates of returns from infrastructure investment are mediated by the presence of adequate government institutions. Only certain types of transport infrastructure investment are associated with higher growth across the regions of Europe. In particular, improvements in secondary road network in sound government quality conditions are linked to higher growth. By contrast, the highly popular motorway development schemes which have been at the centre of development strategies mainly in the periphery of Europe are not associated with the expected economic outcomes, even if promoted by credible, competent, and transparent local governments (which is not always the case).\n\nPolicy implications\n\nOur results challenge the assumption that economic performance in less-developed regions in Europe can be boosted by linking peripheral locations with the economic core of the continent by means of high-cost, long-distance transport corridors. Conversely, our evidence supports the idea that investment in secondary roads might deliver better returns in peripheral areas by reinforcing intra-regional connectivity and fostering the productivity of local firms. However, sound local institutions are key for these benefits to be unlocked via the selection of the most appropriate projects and their effective (and timely) realisation. This implies that ‘institution building’ needs to be put at the top of the regional development agenda, if other types of development interventions – and transport infrastructure interventions in particular – are to become more effective. A potential way to limit distortions in public investment decisions determined by political interests, pork-barrel politics, or corruption may be to set stricter rules for project evaluation and provide technical guidance to local governments lacking the administrative capacity to select the most profitable projects. Ex ante and ex post evaluations as well as in-itinere monitoring analyses and appraisals – despite increasing legislation in this respect – are not yet a consolidated practice in all European regions. Regions with weak government institutions require a more thorough following of their transport projects over the full cycle and stronger coordination with the central government and the Commission.\n\nReferences\n\nAcemoglu, D and M Dell (2010) “Productivity differences between and within countries”, American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 2: 169–188.\n\nCantarelli, C C, B Flyvbjerg, E J Molin, and B van Wee (2010) “Cost overruns in large-scale transportation infrastructure projects: Explanations and their theoretical embeddedness”, European Journal of Transport and Infrastructure Research, 10: 5–18.\n\nCrain, W M and L K Oakley (1995) “The politics of infrastructure”, Journal of Law and Economics, 38: 1–17.\n\nCrescenzi, R and A Rodríguez-Pose (2012) “Infrastructure and regional growth in the European Union”, Papers in Regional Science, 91: 487–513.\n\nCrescenzi, R, M Di Cataldo and A Rodríguez-Pose (2016) “Government quality and the economic returns of transport infrastructure investment in European regions”, Journal of Regional Science, 56(4): 555-582.\n\nEsfahani, H S and M T Ramírez (2003) “Institutions, infrastructure, and economic growth”, Journal of Development Economics, 70: 443–477.\n\nFlyvbjerg, B (2009) “Survival of the unfittest: Why the worst infrastructure gets built-and what can we do about it”, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 25: 344–367.\n\nHenisz, W J (2002) “The institutional environment for infrastructure investment’, Industrial and Corporate Change, 11: 355–389.\n\nOECD (2009) Infrastructure Investment: Links to Growth and the Role of Public Policy, in Economic Policy Reforms: Going for Growth, Paris: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nRodríguez-Pose, A (2000) “Economic convergence and regional development strategies in Spain: The case of Galicia and Navarre”, EIB Papers, 5: 89–115.\n\nTanzi, V and H R Davoodi (1997) “Corruption, public investment and growth”, IMF, Working Paper No 97/139, Washington, DC.\n\nTanzi, V and H R Davoodi (1998) “Roads to nowhere: How corruption in public investment hurts growth”, IMF Economic Issues, No 12, IMF, Washington, D.C.\n\nWachs, M (1989), “When planners lie with numbers”, Journal of the American Planning Association, 554: 477–479.\n\nWorld Bank (2011) Curbing fraud, corruption, and collusion in the roads sector, The World Bank Group, Washington, DC",

You're welcome!\n\nNOW Tony Abbott is gone, I can finally tell the truth ― something I almost never do. Folks, as you may have guessed, I have had a severe brain implosion.\n\nNo, no. I don’t think telling you about my profound mental collapse is a mistake.\n\nIn fact, I think it is my duty to make an absolute laughing stock of myself in the public domain. After all, brain snap or not, that is my day job.\n\nI want to talk about how Tony Abbott was cruelly dismissed as Australian Prime Minister, without the Australian people ever gaining the immense satisfaction of voting him and his party out in a landslide.\n\nIt is true that, in many ways, he seemed too moronic for the job, yet still he destroyed more in two years than the last two Labor prime ministers achieved in six.\n\nCompare. Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard left us with record deficits after blowing billions on public schools for trashy children, insulating poor people’s homes, green schemes to save the planet and “stimulus” cheques that saved the Australian economy from recession. What a waste!\n\nThey meanwhile showed some compassion to asylum seekers fleeing war zones, recognised that global warming is real and forced the nation’s worst polluters to pay a modest price for their dangerous emissions. Stupid hippies!\n\nBut Abbott? I won’t go through the whole list: how he stopped the boats and scrapped the carbon and mining taxes.\n\nOkay, so I just went through the whole list.\n\nAndrew Bolt has drawn scorn for his 'love letter' to Tony Abbott: http://t.co/8tfbxToAAz pic.twitter.com/NmbRnFeSq6 — The New Daily (@TheNewDailyAu) September 28, 2015\n\nAnd he did all this in the face of astonishing and unprecedented criticism from the media. Well, not News Corp outlets, obviously, but some of the other ones. And not only that, but he faced feral opposition in the Senate. Opposition in the upper house, imagine! Something no Australian prime minister has ever had to contend with before.\n\nBut your mistake, you grubby nation of gay marriage lovers, was not to care about all that. Stopping and axing things didn’t count with you. Image was all.\n\nAnd so you told the pollsters you didn’t like Abbott. That you despised him bitterly. That the sight of his face made you feel violently ill. All because you believed the verifiable information written about him in non-Murdoch newspapers, until his MPs finally saw reality and dumped him.\n\nHow dare you!\n\nYour mistake was that you didn’t only read my columns and some of the editorials published in The Australian, and actually observed the way Abbott conducted himself ‒ the way he spoke, the way he walked, the way he ate a raw unpeeled onion like it was a delicious granny smith apple ‒ and noticed that he was quickly turning the nation into an international laughing stock.\n\nYou even laughed at some of his rare qualities and pubic service. Journalists ridiculed his tiny red budgie smugglers and body hair. They dismissed his constant appearances in hardhats and hi viz uniforms as opportunistic photo opportunities. Wrote off his cringeworthy monarchism as loyalty to his birth nation, whose citizenship he may or may not have renounced.\n\nTony Abbott is almost certainly a British dual citizen — and so he can't be our PM https://t.co/x2j7yjWHM9 @IndependentAus pls retweet — Jentil (@Jentil99) August 2, 2015\n\nSuch cynicism he endured.\n\nWhen he appointed himself Minister for Women after only appointing a single female to his first cabinet, people called him a paternalistic bigot. When he warned that our finances were in strife or that a \"death cult\" was \"coming for each and every one of us”, people asked why he doubled the deficit within his first few months in power and whether he was exaggerating the shit out of the threat from ISIS for cynical political gain.\n\nAnd you believed them. You let people treat like absolute dirt a man who had a record of volunteerism no prime minister has equalled — pretending to work in Aboriginal communities, going on countless charity fun runs and triathlons at public expense, and standing around in firefighter gear near people fighting actual bushfires.\n\nAnd none of it was done just to puff his CV for an election pamphlet. As you know, the Liberal Party hates glossy pamphlets.\n\nThe only reason I know Abbott helped people secure their homes after one Sydney storm is that my wife’s uncle is a press officer at the PMO and he sent me a press release.\n\nShush, said the captain. He doesn’t like people knowing.\n\nNow, I must declare straight up — I call Tony Abbott a friend. A friend who is a boy. A boy friend, if you like.\n\nSo you’ll call me biased. Outrageously, relentlessly, idiotically biased. You’ll laugh uproariously that I can write such an embarrassing love letter to him when almost everyone else is horse-laughing (whatever that is). You'll say that I am actually a bit of dick and then lampoon me mercilessly on social media. And you’ll say that’s why I see qualities in Abbott when there are actually none worth mentioning.\n\nBut you’ll just be making another mistake.\n\nSee, I don’t think Abbott is a great man because he’s my friend. He’s my friend because he’s a great man. And because I am also a great man, I can see how great this great man is. So great and full of such great greatness that he is far greater than the people who tore him down. The ingrates.\n\nHe’s my friend especially because he’s not those things that so many journalists wrote — unless they wrote that he was great, like I did. A lot.\n\nTruth is that Abbott is rarely a thug, bully, racist, fool, liar, woman-hater, homophobe or bigot. He’s seldom cruel or lacking compassion. At least while the cameras are rolling.\n\nBut even if he were those things, he would still be my friend. And not only because Rupert told me he had to be, but because he’s totally awesome. So dreamy.\n\nTony Abbott is such a big man, and that he has been betrayed and deposed doesn’t just break my heart. It crushes it into a million tiny little pieces. I hope Australians will one day wake up to the Prime Minister they tossed away. Just because he happened to be a tosser.\n\nAndrew Bolt's love letter to Abbott draws scorn http://t.co/FRQhQjFzFg pic.twitter.com/OukN5HeKhZ — Kemal Atlay (@kemal_atlay) September 28, 2015\n\nSorry to sound so foolish and embarrassing, but here are some glimpses of the man I know — ones that put a lie to the truths that even big-name correspondents peddled about him.\n\nA woman hater? Did you know he has three daughters and a wife? Just how many woman haters have daughters and wives? A ha!\n\nA crash-through insensitive bully with no people skills? Ask my children how gentle he was with them when he called around. Actually, you'd better not.\n\nOr stupid? Just minutes after Malcolm Turnbull told Abbott he was challenging for his job, Abbott still honoured a promise to meet girl guides rather than hit the phones to save his prime ministership.\n\nFinancially illiterate? Well, when I once asked why he wouldn’t buy off his critics by sacking Joe Hockey as Treasurer, Abbott told me he kept Joe Hockey for his immense numeracy and economic skills.\n\nA homophobe? Abbott actually had a very close friendship with one of my gay friends ― and I wasn’t even jealous.\n\nIn fact, when one Fairfax writer this year accused Abbott of having a “possibly homophobic” moment, a gay adviser on Abbott’s staff texted me in a rage: “If PM was so homophobic, he wouldn’t be in the shower with me right now.”\n\nPictured: Andrew Bolt and Tony Abbott, in happier times. pic.twitter.com/2KI1Yt7Ko8 — Ellie | 김주혜 (@irrellievant) September 28, 2015\n\nEvery Prime Minister thinks they don’t get the press they deserve. But I can assure you that none has been so different in the flesh from what you read in the papers. If only journalists responsible for this great slander could see the Tony I see.\n\nYes, I know Abbott made mistakes, and I was hard on him at times. Sometimes painfully hard. I know he was too stubborn. And I know he was clumsy and stupid and naff.

This season, the Wings have secured eight out of a possible 14 points in the shootout, with just a 14.3% winning percentage.\n\nLooking at points alone, eight out of 14 seems fairly decent.

  "latent_15247": "Angry protesters filled the streets of Karachi last week, clogging traffic lanes and public squares until police and paratroopers were forced to intervene. That’s not rare in Pakistan, which is often a site of political and religious violence.\n\nBut last week’s protests had nothing to do with freedom of expression, drone wars, or Americans. They were about access to water. When Khawaja Muhammad Asif, the Minister of Defense, Power, and Water (yes, that is one ministry), warned that the country’s chronic water shortages could soon become uncontrollable, he was looking on the bright side. The meagre allotment of water available to each Pakistani is a third of what it was in 1950. As the country’s population rises, that amount is falling fast.\n\nDozens of other countries face similar situations—not someday, or soon, but now. Rapid climate change, population growth, and a growing demand for meat (and, thus, for the water required to grow feed for livestock) have propelled them into a state of emergency. Millions of words have been written, and scores of urgent meetings have been held, since I last wrote about this issue for the magazine, nearly a decade ago; in that time, things have only grown worse.\n\nThe various physical calamities that confront the world are hard to separate, but growing hunger and the struggle to find clean water for billions of people are clearly connected. Each problem fuels others, particularly in the developing world—where the harshest impact of natural catastrophes has always been felt. Yet the water crisis challenges even the richest among us.\n\nCalifornia is now in its fourth year of drought, staggering through its worst dry spell in twelve hundred years; farmers have sold their herds, and some have abandoned crops. Cities have begun rationing water. According to the London-based organization Wateraid, water shortages are responsible for more deaths in Nigeria than Boko Haram; there are places in India where hospitals have trouble finding the water required to sterilize surgical tools.\n\nNowhere, however, is the situation more acute than in Brazil, particularly for the twenty million residents of São Paulo. “You have all the elements for a perfect storm, except that we don’t have water,” a former environmental minister told Lizzie O’Leary, in a recent interview for the syndicated radio show “Marketplace.” The country is bracing for riots. “There is a real risk of social convulsion,” José Galizia Tundisi, a hydrologist with the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, warned in a press conference last week. He said that officials have failed to act with appropriate urgency. “Authorities need to act immediately to avoid the worst.” But people rarely act until the crisis is directly affecting them, and at that point it will be too late.\n\nIt is not that we are actually running out of water, because water never technically disappears. When it leaves one place, it goes somewhere else, and the amount of freshwater on earth has not changed significantly for millions of years. But the number of people on the planet has grown exponentially; in just the past century, the population has tripled, and water use has grown sixfold. More than that, we have polluted much of what remains readily available—and climate change has made it significantly more difficult to plan for floods and droughts.\n\nSuccess is part of the problem, just as it is with the pollution caused by our industrial growth. The standard of living has improved for hundreds of millions of people, and the pace of improvement will quicken. As populations grow more prosperous, vegetarian life styles often yield to a Western diet, with all the disasters that implies. The new middle classes, particularly in India and China, eat more protein than they once did, and that, again, requires more water use. (On average, hundreds of gallons of water are required to produce a single hamburger.)\n\nFeeding a planet with nine billion residents will require at least fifty per cent more water in 2050 than we use today. It is hard to see where that water will come from. Half of the planet already lives in urban areas, and that number will increase along with the pressure to supply clean water.\n\n“Unfortunately, the world has not really woken up to the reality of what we are going to face, in terms of the crises, as far as water is concerned,” Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the International Panel on Climate Change, said at a conference on water security earlier this month. “If you look at agricultural products, if you look at animal protein, the demand for which is growing—that’s highly water intensive. At the same time, on the supply side, there are going to be several constraints. Firstly because there are going to be profound changes in the water cycle due to climate change.”\n\nFloods will become more common, and so will droughts, according to most assessments of the warming earth. “The twenty-first-century projections make the [previous] mega-droughts seem like quaint walks through the garden of Eden,” Jason Smerdon, a climate scientist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said recently. At the same time, demands for economic growth in India and other developing nations will necessarily increase pollution of rivers and lakes. That will force people to dig deeper than ever before into the earth for water.\n\nThere are ways to replace oil, gas, and coal, though we won’t do that unless economic necessity demands it. But there isn’t a tidy and synthetic invention to replace water. Conservation would help immensely, as would a more rational use of agricultural land—irrigation today consumes seventy per cent of all freshwater.\n\nThe result of continued inaction is clear. Development experts, who rarely agree on much, all agree that water wars are on the horizon. That would be nothing new for humanity. After all, the word “rivals” has its roots in battles over water—coming from the Latin, rivalis, for “one taking from the same stream as another.” It would be nice to think that, with our complete knowledge of the physical world, we have moved beyond the limitations our ancestors faced two thousand years ago. But the truth is otherwise; rivals we remain, and the evidence suggests that, until we start dying of thirst, we will stay that way.",
  "latent_15256": "In the Brussels press room on Wednesday, EU Commissioner Frans Timmermans gave an unusually passionate and personal speech on the recent developments in Hungary. As the son of a Dutch diplomat, he had experienced the prevailing atmosphere of oppression in Budapest in the early 1980s, when the city was behind the Iron Curtain. \"This is gone! And this is the biggest achievement of our generation!\" Timmermans exclaimed with regard to the collapse of the Communist bloc and the subsequent reunification of Europe. \"That is why I will continue to fight for everything pertaining to liberty, openness and European cooperation.\"\n\nTimmermans, a European commissioner who is responsible for the rule of law, and the other 27 EU commissioners, have raised concerns regarding the political developments in Hungary. The debate in the College of Commissioners in Brussels was not only about laws being tightened to impose tough restrictions on universities and non-governmental organizations, but also about the overall political climate in the country.\n\nTimmermans warned that populism and nationalism in certain parts of the EU sometimes \"have wind in their sails,\" yet it is the wrong way of addressing problems. \"But I think the time has come [for] that wind to go in other sails.\" That why he is heartened by young people in Europe who support European achievements. \"I see young people across Europe standing up for Europe. Because they understand that their rights are self-evident, but not self-executing,\" said the EU Commissioner with regard to the demonstrations against the clampdown on universities in Hungary.\n\nThousands of people in Budapest came out in support of the Central European University\n\nObjections to Orban's law\n\nProtests were scheduled again for Wednesday, in particular against a new university law that would paralyze the Central European University, which was founded by international financier and philanthropist George Soros.\" And the Central European University has been a pearl in the crown of Central Europe in forming a new generation of European leaders that see east and west as geographical denominations, not moral or political denominations,\" said Timmermans in praise of the institution, which in the eyes of the Hungarian government advocates too much openness and liberalism in society.\n\nTibor Navracsics, a Hungarian politician who is currently the EU Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and Sport, also criticized the changes to the Hungarian higher education law. Navracsics is actually a fellow party member of Prime Minister Orban, but he has stated that the Central European University is one of the best educational institutions in the country and should therefore continue to operate.\n\nOrban has repeatedly stated that national and collective interests should have priority over the liberal and individualist ideals that George Soros stands for. Orban says that 2017 is the year in which Soros and other forces aligned with the Hungarian-born US billionaire must be expelled from the country. In a written statement, Orban's government dismissed international criticism of his draft bill as \"hysteria.\"\n\nWatch video 01:29 Share DW exclusive: CEU's Michael Ignatieff Send Facebook google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/2b89I DW exclusive: Central European University rector, Michael Ignatieff\n\nEU initiates dialogue, not legal procedures\n\nTimmermans announced that the EU Commission is planning to enter into formal dialogue with Orban to determine where Hungary is heading and where the prime minister stands with his country in the European Union.\n\nThis dialogue, based on European fundamental values that are defined in Article 2 of the Lisbon Treaty, does not constitute a formal procedure that can be initiated for the infringement of the rule of law. Hungary has not reached this stage yet, as the threat to the state of the law in the country is not yet \"systemic,\" stated the EU Commission.\n\nBrussels upset about anti-EU campaign\n\nThe EU Commissioners were particularly upset about a questionnaire that Orban sent to all Hungarian households. The \"Let's stop Brussels!\" initiative suggests that the EU wants to force \"dangerous things\" on Hungarians. Its six questions contain claims that certain international organizations have encouraged illegal immigrants to commit offenses in Hungary. They suggest that foreign organizations have carried out covert actions that interfere with Hungarian interests. According to the claims, the EU also wants to raise taxes and unemployment in Hungary.\n\nEU Commission President Jean Claude Juncker has rejected the Orban government's portrayal of the European Union. Last week he said that the questionnaire was one-sided and that Orban's intentions were difficult to understand. \"This way of speaking badly about Brussels after having signed the Rome declaration says more about the author of the questionnaire than about the state of the European Union,\" Juncker said disdainfully. In Rome, heads of state and government, including Orban, celebrated the future of the EU on its 60th birthday on March 25.\n\nFar from friends: Juncker finds Orban's intentions difficult to understand\n\nHungarian laws will be investigated\n\nThe EU Commission plans to investigate a number of legislative proposals in Hungary and decide by the end of April whether infringement procedures will be initiated. Along with the new higher education act, NGO funding, the rights of pregnant women in the workplace and the discrimination of Roma children in the country's education system will be investigated. \"The new laws on asylum procedures also raise serious doubts about their compatibility with EU law,\" Timmermans said. All asylum seekers can be detained in Hungary until their application has been processed. Violations of EU treaties may be penalized by the EU Commission and brought to the European Court of Justice.\n\nSeparation and discrimination are the wrong path for Hungary and other European countries to take, warned Timmermans. He went on to explain that the complexity of society is irreversible. It was like trying to unscramble scrambled eggs, said Timmermans. \"It will go wrong and make a great mess.\"\n\n\"If we do not see progress in Hungary, we will act quickly,\" he said.",

  "latent_15642": "This year has seen some phenomenally bizarre weather, from deadly tornadoes ripping through the Midwest and South to historic snowmelt-related flooding on the Mississippi River. Most hurricane forecasters are saying it's about to get worse — the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projected Thursday that the Atlantic basin is likely to see 12 to 18 named storms this season.\n\nAmid all this, the country's future weather prediction capabilities could be stymied by a battle in Washington.\n\nDuring the budget battle earlier this spring, Congress cut funding for a new polar-orbiting satellite, which is designed to monitor atmospheric temperatures and pressure, severe weather, fires and other manmade and natural disasters, and to provide continuous climate data. If it does not get built, the country faces a satellite gap, which could affect forecasters' ability to predict the weather.\n\nThe key word here is climate.\n\n\"Weather is apolitical, but climate is unfortunately not,\" Bill Sullivan, a director at Raytheon Intelligence and Information Systems and program manager for the new satellite, said in an interview.\n\nClick here to launch a gallery of images of NASA's NPP satellite\n\nNOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco said at a news conference Thursday that the agency's satellite program is in limbo.\n\nThis is at least the fourth time in the past few years that a climate-monitoring project has fallen victim to either terrible luck or bad politics. First the Orbiting Carbon Observatory failed to reach orbit, then NASA's aerosol-monituring Glory mission also died during launch. Last month we told you about the Deep Space Climate Observatory, languishing in a box in Maryland. Now a satellite called JPSS is in danger of losing its funding.\n\nHere's a bit of history: Until last year, NASA, NOAA and the Department of Defense were going to share a brand-new polar-orbiting satellite called the National Polar Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). But after a few years of planning and design work, the government decided the military and civilian agencies didn't play well together and divorced the project, giving the DOD its own satellite. The existing civilian project, called NPP for NPOESS Preparatory Project, will serve NASA and NOAA only, and is planned for launch in October. It just completed a thermal test.\n\nIt is supposed to have a companion successor called the Joint Polar Satellite System, and NOAA requested $1.06 billion in this year's budget to build it. Then the federal budget stalemate happened, and everything was funded at 2010 levels as Congress and the White House wrangled.\n\n\"The message that was getting to Congress was that NOAA needed a billion dollars to do climate research,\" said Sullivan, who is Raytheon's program manager for the JPSS. As a result, the funding was not approved.\n\nSince the funding cuts, NOAA — and contractors like Raytheon — have started marketing the satellite's weather forecasting abilities, not just its utility in informing climate models.\n\nPolar-orbiting satellites can provide global weather coverage, which is useful when trying to make future weather predictions. Geostationary satellites, like the ones that provide the satellite radar imagery on your local news, only look at a specific section of the planet. The National Weather Service needs both sets of data to complete accurate forecasting.\n\nNPP is a new polar-orbiting satellite that will replace NOAA's previous orbiters, Sullivan said. It will circle the Earth 512 miles above the surface, completing about 14 orbits every day.\n\n\"We're going to see just a huge increase in the amount of data that can be collected ... NPP provides an enormous amount of capability that is currently not on orbit,\" Sullivan said.\n\nNPP will have a life span of about five years, at which point JPSS should be ready to replace it. Sullivan said NOAA needs funding this year for construction so the JPSS project doesn't fall behind schedule. NOAA is hoping the project will get funding this year, but it looks doubtful, Sullivan said. Meanwhile, the agency is preparing for a budget battle next year, he said.\n\n\"If the program doesn't get funded at the appropriate level in 2012, it will fall behind, which is bad for all of us,\" he said.\n\n\"Not having satellites and not applying their latest capabilities could spell disaster,\" said NOAA's Lubchenko. \"We are likely looking at a period of time a few years down the road where we will not be able to do severe storm warnings and long-term weather forecasts that people have come to expect today.\"",

However, nearly one-third of Hispanic voters (31 percent) disagreed.\n\n“Seven in 10 Americans… approve of President Trump’s executive order to end “catch and release” and make the deportation of illegal immigrants who are criminals a top priority,” pollster John McLaughlin wrote in a press release.\n\nOverall, 69 percent of voters surveyed approved of deporting criminal illegal aliens. Enforcing immigration law is extremely popular with Republicans: 92 percent approve of Trump’s moves. A majority of Democrats, 50 percent, also approve, while 37 percent disapprove. Independent voters largely approved, 66 percent to 18 percent. Of those who voted for Hillary Clinton, 53 percent approved while 35 percent did not.\n\nAnother 59 percent of voters supported “cutting off federal grants to cities that break the law by refusing to turn in criminal illegal aliens,” including 46 percent of Hispanic voters. Another 43 percent of Hispanic voters disagreed with depriving sanctuary cities of federal funding.\n\nThe poll’s findings are consistent with other polls showing voters prefer immigration policies less extreme than the ones the U.S. has in place, which, according to former Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, operate on autopilot. Only 11 percent of voters want the U.S. to continue current levels of immigration that import over a million foreign nationals each year. Only 22 percent of Hispanic voters wanted to see immigration kept at current high levels or increased, Pulse Opinion Research found in November. Meanwhile, 52 percent of Hispanics wanted to see annual immigration into the U.S. reduced to 500,000 or fewer migrants. Another 49 percent said “they would support a policy of causing illegal immigrants to return home by enforcing the law,” and 51 percent believed the U.S. government did “too little” to enforce immigration laws.\n\nAs conservative author Daniel Horowitz writes, consultants and politicians who champion open borders policies claim Hispanic voters who vote for Democrats would otherwise vote Republican if the GOP would only support amnesty for illegal aliens. Yet Trump, with his support for law enforcement and normal immigration controls, improved on failed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s Hispanic support in the 2016 election, winning 29 percent of Hispanic voters.\n\nThe poll, commissioned by Secure America Now, surveyed 1,000 likely voters online from Feb. 2 to Feb. 6 with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, and a confidence level of 95 percent.",

  "latent_16162": "Infosys Ltd recording an industry-leading growth of 13.3% in constant currency terms (9.1% growth in dollar revenue) for the financial year 2015-16 has certainly pleased the company’s board, which decided to reward chief executive officer Vishal Sikka with an extra ₹ 1 crore.\n\nSikka, who took over as the first non-founder CEO of Infosys in August 2014, stood to earn up to $7.08 million. This included $900,000 in base salary, $2 million in restricted stock units, and $4.18 million or ₹ 28 crore in variable pay. Infosys’s growth surpassed the internal growth targets set by the board for the financial year ended March 2016, and hence, Sikka earned $4.33 million or ₹ 29 crore in variable pay, according to an executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n“The nominations committee recommended a higher variable pay and it was approved in the board meeting on 16 April,\" said the executive, who declined to share details.\n\nThe Infosys board had linked Sikka’s variable pay to the performance of the company’s growth although, for now, it is unclear what internal targets the board had set based on which Sikka earned the extra buck. Although Infosys managed to beat its own revenue guidance of at best 13.2% in constant currency terms, its revenue growth in dollar terms was a notch below its estimate of 9.3%. Constant currency excludes any impact of currency movement while the dollar revenue growth is the money it generates based on the business a company does in a period.\n\nInfosys declined to offer a comment.\n\nBeginning 1 April this year, Sikka will be paid up to $11 million a year, after the Infosys board in February decided to raise his compensation by 55%, and extend his term as CEO until 2021. Under the old agreement, Sikka was to be at helm of Infosys until 13 June 2019.\n\nThe board credited Sikka with putting India’s second largest software services firm back on the growth path and hence raised his compensation and gave him time to help Infosys realise its goal of becoming a $20 billion firm by March 2021. For this reason, the board tied Sikka’s higher compensation to the company’s performance, as $5 million of his new compensation is to be paid in stock options, and depend on Infosys keeping up with its stated goal of becoming a $20 billion company.\n\nHowever, the terms of this new agreement did not go down well with some of the promoters/founders of Infosys, according to two executives, and for this reason, many abstained from voting in favour of a resolution to reappoint Sikka as CEO until 2021.\n\nOnly 23.57% of promoter votes were cast in favour of a resolution reappointing Sikka as the managing director and CEO. The promoters voted overwhelmingly in favour of three of the other resolutions (two dealt with a stock incentive plan and a third was on reappointment of Jeffrey Lehman as independent director).\n\nOn a fifth resolution, the appointment of Punita Kumar-Sinha as an independent director, again, only 23.57% of promoter votes were cast in favour.\n\nOnly five of the seven original co-founders, N.R. Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, S.D. Shibulal, Kris Gopalakrishnan and K. Dinesh are categorized as promoters of the company. Together, the promoters of Infosys had 13.07% stake in the company as of 31 December.\n\nNone of them have responded to Mint’s multiple requests seeking an explanation.\n\nOn Friday, Sikka said in an interview that he is not perturbed by the decision of some of the promoters expressing their displeasure by not voting for the resolution.\n\n“I’m not disappointed. I don’t care. I have 100% backing of the board and support from the shareholders,\" Sikka said after Infosys, which ended March 2016 with $9.5 billion in revenue, said that it expects dollar revenue to expand between 11.8% and 13.8% in the year to 31 March 2017.\n\n“I still respect the founders. Why they did this, you should ask them,\" said Sikka.",
  "latent_16246": "Well, I lost my job. Before you roll your eyes and close your paper or your browser window, hear me out. This isn't going to be one of those \"millennial complaining about adulthood's minor setbacks\" columns. I've got some leads lined up and some freelance work in the pipeline, though I'm willing to listen if you've got something for me. I've adjusted my avocado toast budget. I'll be fine. No, this is going to be a \"millennial complaining about how the Mid-South Coliseum isn't an aquarium\" piece.\n\nIt seems so obvious. Of all the redevelopment plans that have been proposed for the Fairgrounds, I'm surprised something like an aquarium hasn't seriously been considered. Unlike other ideas I've seen, an aquarium is something a diverse mix of residents and tourists can enjoy. I am not trying to claim this as an original or unique idea. But I did tweet the following in May 2016: \"IDEA — Repurpose what can be salvaged of the Coliseum into an aquarium. Proximity to CMOM, Zoo, Pink Palace make it a perfect location.\" It could get some public funding, grants, private donors, and stuff so it doesn't require people to buy stuff to stay afloat.\n\nDavid Miller | Dreamstime\n\nGet it? Stay afloat? Hoo boy, I kill me. Anyway, I heard the city of Memphis is reopening the planning process for redeveloping the Fairgrounds, and I've had some time on my hands. So, between phone interviews and checking my email every 14 seconds, I've been gathering research and evidence to support my case. First, the Coliseum is just the right size, and it's in a good location. At approximately 110,000 square feet, the existing building is comparable in size to facilities like the Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans. With the surrounding acreage, there's space to build on or expand later. Visitors from the suburbs, as well as tourists from Mississippi, Arkansas, and beyond could easily access it by I-240 via Airways, or take Hollywood from I-40.\n\nFamilies could spend a summer morning playing at the Children's Museum followed by an afternoon of deep sea exploration. The Pink Palace and its CTI Giant Theater are just down the road. Football fans in town for the Liberty Bowl and Southern Heritage Classic could add another activity to their itineraries that amplifies and disperses the events' economic impact. It would bring revenue to local businesses in the surrounding neighborhoods year-round. In 2016, the Tennessee Aquarium's 745,000 visitors generated $72.2 million for Chattanooga businesses. Those are some pretty big numbers. \"But what about parking?\" some will ask, as they always do. Well, there are enough spaces to accommodate 60-something thousand people at the football stadium, plus street parking in the surrounding neighborhoods. The Tigers play six or seven home games a year. This season's schedule so far includes only one 11 a.m. kickoff. If one of the Liberty Bowl's tenants are hosting an event that might complicate parking, here's an idea: Take the bus. Catch a Lyft. Or go some other time. The fish aren't going anywhere.\n\nMoving the aquarium animals to another campus would give the zoo room to grow without encroaching further on the park. Guests could purchase a day pass that includes admission to both attractions and a shuttle ride from the ample spaces at the Fairgrounds. The Greensward could return to its original and best use as a refuge for picnickers, frisbee throwers, and stoned teens.\n\nMost importantly, think of all the kids in Memphis who have only seen fish that were fried and served with hushpuppies and slaw. They deserve field trips as cool as the ones my generation enjoyed — back in the good old days when the Wonders exhibit brought Napoleon's carriage and Catherine the Great's jewels to town every year. And if that's not convincing enough, I'd like to offer one final, irresistibly petty argument: Nashville doesn't have an aquarium.\n\nOne small concern might be finding a way to pay for such an ambitious project. I acknowledge there are some logistical details to work out. But big dreams call for big ideas, and I'm happy to help in any way I can (as I mentioned, I have some time). I'm confident that this idea can reach the right people, who will see the myriad ways in which the city would benefit. And the Timberlake Family Aquarium or the FedEx Grizzlies Servicemaster Center for Aquatic Research will one day become one of Memphis' signature attractions.\n\nJen Clarke is a digital marketing specialist and an unapologetic Memphian.",

The video shows a group of young girls riding an escalator at Trump Tower as the now–presidential candidate makes his claim about dating one of them in the future.\n\nCBS News / Via cbsnews.com\n\nIt was a line he used at least twice when talking to young girls. On Thursday, the Los Angeles Times republished a Tribune wire report, also from December 1992.

They said 14, and he replied, \"Just think — in a couple of years, I'll be dating you.\"\n\nThe Tribune news brief was headlined, \"Such a comedian.\"\n\nDonald Trump once told 14-year-old girls, 'In a couple of years, I'll be dating you' https://t.co/nslYeqp8dg\n\nTrump is currently facing a firestorm of criticism that was sparked by remarks he made in 2005 while talking to TV host Billy Bush. Those comments, recorded by a hot mic as Trump prepared to make a cameo on a soap opera, surfaced Friday and revealed that Trump tried to have sex with a married woman and claimed he could grab women \"by the pussy.\" The 2005 conversation prompted a wave of defections and unendorsements from prominent Republicans. The presidential nominee has attempted to stanch the outflow of support, despite a string of similarly withering reports this week; in addition to the CBS video, the New York Times published accounts on Wednesday from two women who said Trump made inappropriate sexual advances toward them. The Trump campaign slammed the report in a statement, saying the \"entire article is fiction, and for the New York Times to launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump on a topic like this is dangerous.\"",

  "latent_16353": "Republican state Rep. Phil Covarrubias this week twice appeared to offer a limited defense of Japanese-American internment camps during World War II, before apologizing that his comments were “taken out of context.”\n\nCovarrubias was speaking against a Democratic bill that would prevent the state from cooperating with federal authorities on a number of actions the bill deemed unconstitutional — to include detaining people for the purpose of internment camps.\n\n“For anybody that has never been in the heat of combat, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and all of that was going on, there’s not time to ask questions and find out who’s a citizen and who’s not,” said Covarrubias, a former Marine who lives in Brighton. “It’s easy to sit here and say this stuff now. But if you’re in that moment, it looks a lot different than being able to be in a nice suit and tie.”\n\nLater in the hearing on Wednesday, he returned to the subject, and referenced the terrorist attacks in Orlando and San Bernadino, Calif.\n\n“What happened prior to (the internment camps) that kicked all this off? I think we were attacked in Pearl Harbor,” Covarrubias said. “I think we need to look at the Americans that are in fear from the terrorism and the things that we’ve seen over the last few years, especially.\n\n“Everybody’s talking about the immigrants being in fear or the other people being in fear, what about our own people? What about Florida? What about San Bernadino?”\n\nThe remarks drew national attention, with The Washington Post, among others, saying they appeared to amount to a defense of Japanese internment camps.\n\nColorado has deep roots in the issue. One of ten internment camps for Japanese-Americans in the U.S. was in southeastern Colorado, and the state’s governor at the time, Ralph Carr, was a singular figure at the time in both accepting the prisoners and speaking out on their behalf.\n\nOn Thursday, Covarrubias attempted to clarify his remarks on the House floor. He was absent Friday and could not immediately be reached for comment. A House GOP spokesman said Covarrubias would not comment further on the matter.\n\n“Under no circumstances should anyone, regardless of who they are, be treated the way the American Japanese people were treated during World War II. President Roosevelt’s reaction to the attack was the wrong reaction, and I’m sad that any of that is a part of our history,” Covarrubias said. “Sorry it was taken out of the context that it was delivered.”\n\nThe measure passed on second reading on a voice vote that appeared to fall along party lines. Republicans said the measure went too far in prohibiting cooperation with federal immigration laws and in extending protections to all Colorado residents, regardless of citizenship status.\n\nThe bill also would have prevented the creation of a Muslim registry similar to one proposed by President Donald Trump during last year’s campaign.",

  "latent_16476": "The South African Communist Party’s Special National Congress, held July 7 – 11 in Soweto, Johannesburg, took stock of a range of problems besetting South Africa’s young democracy and efforts to tackle the legacies of the colonial and apartheid past.\n\nThe SACP is a tripartite alliance partner of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and the Confederation of South African Trade Unions (COSATU). The Alliance held a summit meeting just before the SACP congress in part to examine the impacts of a range of problems involving the ANC and COSATU.\n\nCOSATU has been involved in bitter internal divisions, in part rooted in antio-labor attacks against the union movement. The National Union of Metal Workers and its general secretary, Zwelinzima Vavi, were expelled.\n\nThe declaration of the SACP Congress noted, “In our present reality, the SACP is the most stable and ideologically coherent formation within the Alliance. This is a time when the ANC is acknowledging many challenges related to incumbency and the influence of money on internal democracy… [and]… the unrelenting capitalist offensive against COSATU coincides with serious challenges to its unity and strength.”\n\nThe strength of the SACP is evident in its mushrooming membership numbers of 35,000 a year in the last two years to its current high of 230,000. It is the second largest political formation, in terms of members, after the ANC. But, as its general secretary Blade Nzimande pointed out in his political report to the congress, the party “is itself not immune to the dangers of factionalism, incumbency, careerism and money politics.”\n\nThe main aim of the party gathering was to address this situation in terms of other crosscutting developments. Mainly, these are the more aggressive stance of monopoly capital in South Africa and internationally, and the impact it has on South Africa’s National Democratic Revolution (NDR) – the overarching transformative strategy of the ANC and its allies.\n\n“It is no secret that we are confronting a very challenging period in our national democratic revolution with risks, threats but also important opportunities and responsibilities,” said Nzimande. His report to the Congress detailed the vast problems confronting South Africa in the face not only of a global economy under increasingly desperate imperialist hegemony but of more intense attacks in South Africa on the left by right-wing and populist semi-fascist formations.\n\nIn one area, the mainstream media, there has been a robust offensive by the Naspers media group, resulting in the brutal and well-funded corporate capture of the public broadcaster, the SABC, and its transformation from a vehicle serving all South Africans into one for the middle class and rich. Naspers is also using its vast resources to destroy the country’s independent local newspaper operators. This is all part of an offensive designed to set the course of political and social developments in the country and keep it safe for corporate domination.\n\nThe main business of the Congress was to formulate resolutions in five main areas: party building, economic transformation, the workplace, the battle of ideas, and the upcoming 2016 local government elections. The work resulted in a hefty register of resolutions that will be taken to the party’s provinces, districts and branches to be carried out.\n\nBut much of the discussion of the Congress focused on reassessment and self-criticism concerning the direction of the transformation attempted since 1994. This needs some explanation.\n\nGoing to the Root\n\nToward the end of last year the SACP published a discussion document, Going to the Root, which aims to open up debate in the party, the broader alliance movement and the wider public on the heavy problems that persist in the country despite just over 20 years of democratic reconstruction.\n\nThe main problem the party identifies is the deepening of the triple crises that have long afflicted the majority of South Africans – unemployment, poverty and inequality, all of which are heavily racialized according to the raw legacies of the long colonial and apartheid period. The question Going to the Root seeks to answer is why, despite massive redistribution programmes over the past 20 years, these three disastrous trends continue.\n\nFor those of us on the receiving end of the sketchy mainstream media coverage of events in South Africa, the news is unremittingly bad: striking mine workers shot down by cops at Marikana, all-pervasive corruption in government, protests in poor areas against lack of service delivery, upheavals in parliament instigated by new ‘radicals’ fed up with government cronyism, and violent xenophobia directed at migrants from other parts of Africa.\n\nAnd, in the midst of all this, plummeting ratings issued by various international agencies, covering everything from South Africa’s deteriorating economic viability due to bad labor relations, hopeless education performance, lack of transparency and accountability and general bad governance.\n\nThis mainstream, largely Western, narrative has been so powerful as to convince many, even progressives of various hues, that there is nothing else going on in South Africa. As a result, few people outside the country – and a good many inside it – have any idea of the achievements made by the African National Congress in government since 1994.\n\nSome of these post-Apartheid successes easily eclipse those of progressive left governments in South America, and yet South Africa is never characterised in the same terms as those governments. One reason is that, if it were, it would challenge the dominant Western corporate and government conventional wisdom of South Africa as the focal point of Western interests in Africa. And it is this conventional wisdom, a fairly coherent neo-liberal offensive, which we find replicated in the ways South Africa is viewed and gets depicted.\n\nAs it is, nothing is reported about the creation of a welfare program providing monthly state allowances for 16 million people, and including benefits for housing, disability and sickness, child support and income support. When the democratic government took office in 1994 there were just three million South Africans receiving rudimentary welfare grants.\n\nNothing gets reported about the 3.3 million free houses built for people in the poorest areas, and benefitting some 16 million people. What does get reported is that some of this government housing has been substandard due to corrupt cost- cutting by private building contractors benefitting from local government tenders. But then again what doesn’t get reported is that government is now ensuring that all substandard free housing is replaced or renovated.\n\nNothing gets reported about the electrification program providing seven million household electricity connections since 1996. Contrast this to the achievement of all the apartheid administrations put together, which in half a century electrified just five million households, and just a few in poor areas.\n\nNothing gets reported about the vast overhaul of the education system, which for the black majority has meant the replacement of crude rote learning, sufficient only for unskilled employment, by multidiscipline curricula leading to university level education. What’s more, nine million pupils in 20,000 schools across the country now benefit from free school meals.\n\nAnd nothing gets reported about the free distribution and installation of solar water heaters to poor households, allowing people to generate their own hot water.\n\nAll these programs are works in progress and are continuing apace. They are, as the SACP, notes in its Going to the Root discussion paper, “all part of the ‘good news story’…the most important factor in the continued overwhelming majority electoral support achieved by our movement.”\n\nBut, the SACP points out, “since we are dealing with a real life process and not an abstract theory, this massive redistributive process underway since 1994 has often been uneven.” This means that targets have been missed, the quality of delivery has been poor, and maintenance of new infrastructure gets neglected.\n\nDemand is overwhelming\n\nAnother deeper problem is that the scale of demand overwhelms the scope for delivery to provide poor communities with services and amenities. And with crisis levels of poverty, unemployment and inequality not diminishing but worsening, the demand for services is only increasing.\n\nThe compounded problems the situation generates makes the ANC government an easy target of neo-liberal attacks to, as the SACP puts it, “sow popular demoralization and a lack of belief in the capacity of popular forces and the democratic state to advance development.”\n\nIn other words, by telling just one half of the story, the negative one, the opponents of progressive change in South Africa are able to cast the ANC government, and its alliance partners – the SACP and Confederation of South African Trade Unions in a completely unfavorable light. And so, while these adversaries are all too keen to spotlight public sector corruption they are silent about the intense fight-back against corruption or about the staggering scale of private sector corruption.\n\nBut the SACP goes further, and places the country’s current problems in the context of insufficient structural transformation, particularly of the productive economy, since 1994. The ANC took this self-critical approach at its last National Conference, held in 2012, and called for a “second radical phase of the national democratic revolution” – the first being the fundamental break with the past that culminated in the 1994 democratic elections.\n\nThe thinking behind the “second phase” is that while the negotiations led to the democratic breakthrough of 1994, this advance did not create a bridgehead for a radical social-economic transformation agenda. While the redistribution of surplus, largely through the fiscus, has clocked up successes, it has been conceptualized as a top-down state delivery process, and is generated from an unchanged productive economy and growth path fixated on GDP.\n\nThe result is an essentially neo-liberal, trickle-down development notion, whereby the “cake” must get bigger for everyone – particularly the working class and the poor – to have a share of it. This course of development has essentially left monopoly capital unchallenged and in the lead.\n\nFrom this position it has had a free hand in aggressively restructuring production – including, as we see with Naspers, information – shifting investments from manufacturing to speculative and non-productive activities like financial services and real estate and in the process fragmenting organised labor through casualization, informalisation, labour brokering and retrenchments. To make matters worse it has presided over massive capital flight out of the country and tax evasion.\n\nIn this situation, the SACP argues, the state’s redistributive successes have been muted by turning the mass popular base of the ANC and the Alliance into recipients, beneficiaries and clients of services that are “delivered.” Instead of being protagonists of transformation, the mass base has been pushed into passivity, which tends to rebound against government when it fails to “deliver.”\n\nThe ANC government, which includes strong input from the alliance partners at national and local level, has moved swiftly since the 2012 National Conference to create the bases for a new growth and development path through a range of policies and programmes.\n\nThey include the New Growth Path strategy for expanding jobs and development drivers in 13 key sites of production, the Industrial Policy Action Plan for state-led reindustrialization, the National Infrastructure Plan and various smaller programes, including the development of cooperatives and SMMEs. Abundant information on all of these macro policy plans is easily available from South African government websites.\n\nThe key point made by the SACP at its Congress was that despite the positive bases for change created by these policies, they will only succeed to change the social and economic landscape in South Africa if they are carried through by more mobilized and politically engaged urban and rural poor communities.\n\nThis is the decisive task confronting the Party and the Alliance as they wrestle self-critically with the ever-pertiment question, “What is to be done?”\n\nPhoto: A boy with “Rest In Peace Nelson Mandela” painted on his face looks up to the skies during the memorial service for former South African president Nelson Mandela at the FNB Stadium in Soweto, near Johannesburg, South Africa. | Peter Dejong/AP",
  "latent_16693": "As Mad Men enters its sixth and penultimate season, it’s hard not to compare and contrast it with today’s offices. Certainly, we’d like to think that we’re better able to take advantage of the skills of minorities and women, who were given short shrift in that era. And we now view all the smoking and drinking as self-destructive. Beyond that, though, it offers a few valuable lessons.\n\nLook for competence rather than credentials. There doesn’t seem to be any question that Don Draper does his job well, even though he grew up dirt poor, doesn’t seem to have been to college, and has no experience other than being a fur salesman. Yet his bosses, wisely, don’t seem to care about that. Don’t take your people for granted. While Don was able to escape the strictures of his age well enough to promote Peggy, a woman, to copywriter, he constantly criticizes her, particularly when she’s trying to expand her role. That’s deliciously ironic, of course, because he climbed to the top doing the same thing. As a result, she leaves and he loses his right-hand man, or woman, as the case may be, after he’s invested so much time training her. It’s still a valuable lesson today: Make sure your people know they’re appreciated and that they know how they can expect to move up. Don’t be afraid to be innovative — but keep your bosses informed. It’s a creative industry, so by definition they need to think outside the box, and perhaps that’s where all the liquor (not to mention Roger’s LSD) comes in handy. On the other hand, while it’s okay for the big boys to do risky things, they get cranky when the underlings do it without running it by them first. Make somebody responsible for reinforcing the right mood. Like Jennifer in WKRP in Cincinnati, Joan is competent and makes sure all the organization runs smoothly, as well as being beautiful. All those conference room setups with the coffee and pastries that put everyone in a receptive frame for the advertising? All those restaurant reservations? All those carefully arranged board meetings with the proper procedure? She handles all that, and isn’t given much acknowledgement for it, either. Don’t set your people up to compete with each other. Kenny and Pete were set up as two separate account executives. The result is that Pete, and possibly Kenny as well, feels resentful and spends more time competing with his co-worker than cooperating with him. Give your creatives freedom. Don comes and goes all day, and is just as likely to do his work at home or on a cocktail napkin as in the office. Peggy and the other copywriters work in the evenings when the office is quiet and go to the movies for ideas. You don’t see anyone telling them they have to be in the office, and that’s in the days before smartphones and tablets. If you’re happy with the results, let them work the way they want.\n\nAdmittedly, this is just a TV show, and is to a great degree idealized. None of us looks that good in a suit, for one thing. But in the same way that the people in Mad Men took their ideas from the popular culture of the day (remember “Bye, Bye, Birdie”?), you can do the same thing. Who knows. Perhaps instituting “Mad Men Mondays,” where everyone wears a suit while they discuss the previous night’s episode, might inspire your whole office.",

Check out their surprisingly entertaining smack talk. (check out\n\nSKT_soO\n\nQ:There's not much time until the finals. How are preparations going?\n\nsoO: They're going very well.\n\nWhat did you think of Dear normally?\n\nsoO: I never thought that he was particularly good; I didn't even pay any attention to him.\n\nDid you expect to face him in the final?\n\nsoO: I had no idea. I didn't even realize he had made it to the semis.\n\nDear says he's going to win the championship. Your thoughts on this?\n\nsoO: I don't know why he says he's sorry [that he's going to beat me]. I'm thankful just for the fact that he's my finals opponent.\n\n(To coach iloveoov) You have a finalist not long after you were appointed as the acting Head Coach.\n\niloveoov: I'm happy that soO reached the final, but I'm a little disappointed we couldn't have a final between SKT players. soO was very stressed preparing for his team-kill match against PartinG in the semis, and I was very surprised when he won. Right now, I think he's absorbed Soulkey's momentum. The SKT coaching staff is full of confidence.\n\nHow do you rate Dear's style?\n\nsoO: I watched all of his games, but he only beat players with so-so styles as he came up. I think I'll win without trouble. The more I watch his games, the more confident I get (laughs).\n\nYou were always getting eliminated in the Ro16 before. You think getting cosmetic eyelid surgery changed your destiny?\n\nsoO: Given the timing, I guess you could think so. I thought that it might be true myself (laughs). I changed my mindset this season and shook off my Ro16 trauma. Before, when I reached the Ro16 I became too complacent. This season, I thought that it would be hard to get any more opportunities like this and I worked very hard.\n\n(To iloveoov) You have a piece of paper in your hand. What's on it?\n\niloveoov: It's my first media day, so I prepared some answers to questions I predicted. I forgot to put the piece of paper down beforehand, but I guess it's not bad to be seen this way? (laughs)\n\nHow's it different reaching the finals now, compared to when you were a player?\n\niloveoov: As a player, coach, and head coach it all feels different. I think the pressure the smallest as a player. When I was a player, all I would think about is how to beat my opponent and what ceremonies to prepare. When I was a coach, I wondered about what the player might be thinking, how could I make him win, and how could I help him stay in good mental condition etc. Right now I feel all of these things have combined together. However, I'm confident, and will make my first finalist into a champion.\n\nNo SKT Zerg has reached a final up to now.\n\nsoO: When I was a practice partner, I was mockingly called a \"T1 Zerg.\" We took a lot of criticism back then, and that helped me a lot. Looking at the older Zerg players struggling, it gave me motivation to help my team. They were all good players, but they just didn't get looked upon fondly from the outside.\n\nBack in the day, there was a bit of a distance between the practice facilities and the team house. I don't know about the other players, but the Zergs had to walk. I remember power walking alongside Coach Park. I get treated a bit better now (laughs).\n\niloveoov: I think it's a difference in viewpoint – Coach Park just wanted them to do better. I think those 'dark ages' are just relative. Confidence is a huge part of playing the game, and there was a time when our Zergs had a lot of trouble. soO has come out of that swamp, and he'll be able to lay the first stone toward redeeming the T1 Zerg name.\n\nDoes soO get nervous easily?\n\niloveoov: You can tell who gets nervous from their unit movements. soO doesn't get nervous at all.\n\nWhat score do you predict?\n\nsoO: When I learned that Dear was my opponent, I predicted a 4 – 0. However, I'm not entirely happy with the map order. Because of the map order, I think I might give up a map. About 4 – 1. I think the first map is the most important. It's cute that Dear is predicting a 4 – 1 or 4 – 2 in his favor (laughs).\n\nWhat kind of ceremonies do you have prepared?\n\nsoO: Pay close attention to the minimap during the games. You never know what I might write.\n\nAnd if you win the championship?\n\nIt was my dream since I was young. I've always thought that kissing the trophy was really cool. If I could see a picture of myself kissing the trophy, then I'd be proud.\n\n(to iloveoov) What score do you predict?\n\niloveoov: As the players mentioned, I feel the first map is the most important. Depending on how that goes, the result will swing greatly. If soO wins the first map he will win 4 – 0, if he loses it the I think he will win 4 – 2.\n\nAny final comments?\n\nsoO: I'm sorry to the fans that my opponent is kind of weak. People who want to see Dear crying should come watch live. I'll show you his tears of defeat. I will do my best to win the championship.\n\nSoul_Dear\n\nQ: What do you think of soO?\n\nDear: soO compliments me a lot on battle.net, so it's unfortunate [that he's now saying I'm an easy opponent].\n\nDo you have anything to say to him?\n\nDear: Sorry soO hyung, I'm going to have to win this one.\n\nYou seem hungry for the title.\n\nDear: It's my first finals and I'm a potential royal roader, so I want it that much more.\n\nIn soO's case, it's taken him 1,843 days to reach a final.\n\nDear: I've been a pro-gamer since 2009, so it's not like it's taken me a short while to get here either.\n\n(Question to coach) Did you expect Dear to reach the finals?\n\nHead coach Choi Won Seok: I didn't expect it at all. There were some unfortunate happenings with the team, and our players must have felt things were chaotic as they adjusted to the new environment. I'm glad they've done well in this situation. Looking at soO's games, I think it will be difficult for him to beat Dear because of the difference in their styles. I'll be able to watch this this finals comfortably.\n\nHave you broken down soO's style?\n\nDear: SoO is good in the early and mid game, but there's not much to him in the late game. If I can get past the early-mid game well, I think I can win easily.\n\nHow's life at Soul?\n\nDear: I'm comfortable with the team, just as it was with STX.\n\nWho do you get along with best on the team?\n\nDear: I get along best with YoungJoo.\n\nWhat do you think of your style?\n\nDear: I think I'm a solid player, and I'm sad that other people don't seem to think that way.\n\nSoul's Protoss players are doing well.\n\nDear: These days, I'm thinking about the game in a calm way. I think that's my greatest weapon. Because I think that it's okay to lose every game even after trying my best, I think my games are going well.\n\nDo people treat you different now that you've reached the finals?\n\nDear: I think they treat me the same.\n\nHead coach Choi: When Dear had his semi-final match, he washed the dishes for lunch before heading to the studio.\n\nWhat kind of score do you predict. What is the most important map?\n\nDear: I think the maps are good for me, so I predict 4 – 1 or 4 – 2. The first set is important. If I win the first set, then I think even a 4 – 0 is possible.\n\nDo you have any ceremonies planned?\n\nDear: I will perform manner Nexuses. If I'm sure that I'm going to win, then you'll see me build a lot of them.\n\n[note: Another source (Inven has transcribed this as being \"I will NOT perform manner nexuses anymore\" after his humiliating loss to symbol in the GSTL. It seems that's probably what he said?]\n\nAnd if you win the championship?\n\nDear: I would want to cry, but I think I'll win so easily that I just won't be able to.\n\n(To Coach Choi) What kind of advise do you want to give Dear, and what is your prediction?\n\nHead coach Choi: Because there are a lot of good maps early, I am predicting a 4 – 0. It would be worrisome if it went until the final map. Protoss suffers a lot of reverse-sweeps, so I hope he can win cleanly in a 4 – 1.\n\nYour final words heading into the final?\n\nDear: I'm the final Protoss left this season, so I hope a lot of fans come to the final. soO said that he escaped from the swamp, but I'm going to push him back in.

  "latent_17118": "Eager Formula One fans yesterday got the first sight of one of the new generation of Grand Prix cars as Ferrari launched its latest model, the F60.\n\nEven to the untrained eye, it looks a bit different this year\n\nFerrari always manages to confuse me with its numbering system. In the past, its racing cars were numbered according to engine capacity and the numbers of cylinders they had, thus the 312 was a three-litre V-12 and the 512 a five-litre V12 and so on. The numbers always ended in a 12 in those days because for years Ferrari only ever built engines with 12 cylinders, which meant that you ended up with a sequence over the years of 312, 312B, 312B2, 312B3 etc, until they added a transverse gearbox and called it the 312T. Then we had the 312T2, 312T3 sorry, am I boring you?\n\nNot all engines are the same, even Ferrari ones\n\nTo add to the confusion, the company also designates each model internally by a different number, and for a few years these were also used for the Formula One cars, giving us the 641, 642, and 643. For the past few years theyve been horribly conventional and just called the cars by the year, so weve had F2006, F2007, F2008 etc.\n\nFerrari called their cars 2006 and so on to make them sound spacey...\n\nSo why has this years, brand-spanking new Formula One challenger been dubbed the F60? Well, apparently its to mark the fact that the Scuderia (as we sometimes like to call them to show off) is the only team to have competed in each of the 60 years of the world championship. But what, I hear you ask, about the car itself?\n\nWell the good news is that its a damn site more attractive than its recent predecessors, and better than I was expecting. New rules and regulations have meant that this years F1 cars are no longer evolutions of the previous years model. Gone are the aerodynamic appendages that had sprouted from all corners and surfaces over the recent past and gone too are the grooved tyres. Were back to slicks again. The most noticeable difference in the cars is to the front and rear wings. The fronts are much lower and wider, looking a bit like designer snow ploughs, while the rear wing is tall and narrow. Its not a combination that sits easily with the eye but at least Ferrari seem to have done a better job aesthetically than some of the hybrid models wed seen from their rivals during winter testing.\n\nLook at those lovely fat slick tyres\n\nThe idea behind this raft of changes is to improve the spectacle for the spectators. For too long, overtaking has been a problem in F1 (and, indeed in other categories of single-seater racing), due to the sophistication of the aerodynamics. The dirty air found in the immediate wake of an F1 car plays havoc with the efficiency of the front wing of any car following. Get too close and you lost downforce, meaning overtaking on track became something of a lottery. The new design of front and rear wings is meant to eliminate that problem. Once the season starts, well see how successful it is.\n\nAn avid F1 viewer last year\n\nThe other major difference to the cars this year, albeit one which wont be immediately apparent, is the introduction of something called KERS. This stands for Kinetic Energy Recovery System and is Formula Ones way of trying to appear green. The idea is that, as a car brakes heavily for a corner, the kinetic energy which is usually dissipated in the form of heat from the brakes, is instead recovered and used to help power the car out of the corner. The way in which the energy is stored varies from batteries which could be charged and then power a small motor, to a small flywheel rotating at high speed. Teams are apparently having mixed success with their various systems and Ferrari, in particular, isnt certain whether it will run with the system at the start of the season or not.\n\nThe KERS device - technical\n\nThe upshot of all of this is that the 2009 Formula One season could just prove to be one of the most interesting for a long time, as everyone tries to get to grips with the new rules and new technology. The season kicks off in Australia on 29 March.\n\nPerhaps even Kimi will smile this year",

  "latent_17300": "Utah rancher Alissa Donovan says her training as a preschool teacher helped her on the farm. 'You learn how to herd,' she says. (Photo: Elizabeth Zach)\n\nIn May 2014, I landed back in the American West after nearly two decades roaming and writing about the European continent. I’d taken a job as a new staff writer (the position didn’t exist before I filled it) chronicling the West’s vast and varied territory for the Rural Community Assistance Corporation (RCAC), based in California. The nonprofit was founded four decades ago upon the principles that guided Cesar Chavez and his farmworker housing movement, but in intervening years, has—very effectively, I might add—taken on more causes such as clean water, affordable housing and economic development. I found myself suddenly having to come quickly up to speed on subjects as diverse as California’s menacing drought, housing for homeless veterans on a Montana Indian reservation, water rights in Alaska, and fracking in New Mexico, among other compelling and complex stories.\n\nIn trying to get a handle on the bigger picture of my stories, and the people behind them, I spent one afternoon dutifully reading a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) report based on the 2010 census and in connection with it, an overview of the Farm Bill passed by Congress in February 2014. In this report, I came across two sentences, as brief and matter-of-fact as you would expect to find in, well, a USDA report on census numbers. They were, in essence, this: In the past three decades, the number of women-operated farms has increased substantially in the nation. Between 1978 and 2007, according to the agency’s Economic Research Service, the number of women-operated farms in the United States grew from 306,200 to nearly a million.\n\nA bridging of fields\n\nMy interest was instantly piqued: “Who are these women?” I wondered.\n\nMy mind’s eye filled with sepia images. They were of Willa Cather’s lonely and moody heroines on the endless Nebraska plains. There was the iconic Isak Dinesen, my own heroine: betrayed and bankrupt and yet silently, painstakingly detailing the crucible and hope of her Kenyan coffee plantation, alone. I thought about what would motivate a woman to take on an enterprise like a farm today, in America, knowing full well the financial risk and unavoidable, back-breaking work.\n\nMy first port-of-call was the USDA’s Economic Research Service, and after some twists and turns, I found my way to James Williamson, one of the lead economists/statisticians who had authored the report. After he explained to me how the numbers were derived and interpreted, I pressed for more detail, again: Who are these women?\n\n“I just do the numbers,” James told me. But, he added, almost in passing, “You would make a very large contribution to this field if you could go out and interview these women, and let us know who they are and what they do.”\n\nThat was all the encouragement I needed.\n\nBy great luck, at about this same time, I had been connected through a journalism forum to Geoff McGhee, who directs the media fellowships program at Stanford University’s Bill Lane Center for the American West. During a phone call in August 2014, he was curious about my writing and work, and I mentioned what I was learning about the increase in women farmers and ranchers. He was just as intrigued as I was, and he encouraged me to apply for a fellowship, which would be more in the way of a travel grant, allowing me the time and resources to travel the American West so as to find and meet the women who work the land.\n\nBy November, and with the support of RCAC, I had a formal proposal in place, and had also, by contacting the Center for Land-Based Learning in Winters, Calif., started developing a valuable database of farming and ranching women across the American West. This included a description of their land, whether they owned it and what it produced; whether it was profitable; their marital status and their ages and if they had a succession plan, the latter point being of particular interest to the USDA, I would later find out, in light of national food security.\n\nIn December, I learned that I had been awarded the fellowship. By then, my collection of Femme Farmers and Madames Bovine, as I’d come to call them, was numbering in the high dozens and growing daily. I had joined an online forum for farmers in the West, and by following conversations and seeing posts from women, I would contact them directly, explain my interest in their work and ask if they would meet with me. Every woman I contacted knew others, and those women knew others and so forth.\n\nMoreover, I was finding that everyone—friends, colleagues, acquaintances—I mentioned my rapidly expanding project to expressed the same reaction: Who are these women?\n\nThe women behind the numbers\n\nCome early 2015, I was about to find out.\n\nThe first six months of the year, my solo travels would lead me along thousands of miles, through deserts and sagebrush badlands, acres of every crop imaginable, over and through the Rockies and Sangre de Christo Mountains....and there was, too, a white-knuckle, death-defying drive along Wyoming’s Absaroka Range during a snow storm and through dense fog patches that still, months later, gives me pause.\n\nI traversed the flat dusty New Mexico and Arizona border regions, and braced myself through blinding thunder and lightning storms that shook and ripped open Wyoming’s seamless heavens. I side-stepped a half dozen rattlesnakes during my stays in Colorado, and grew accustomed to truck-stop cuisine and ratty dead-end motels.\n\nOn these long, silent drives, I thought about the women I was meeting, and their remote, pastoral worlds. My travels were conducted by jeep, Kubota and Polaris tractors, commuter plane, island ferry, and included—importantly— long walks with women in the fields and across their ranches as they talked to me about their lives and work.\n\nI trailed women sheep ranchers on the verdant islands of Washington’s Puget Sound and Olympic peninsula, and in eastern Oregon and Colorado’s San Luis Valley. I weaved through the vineyards with so-called Vit-Chicks (women viticulturalists) tending the world-renowned Napa and Sonoma wine-growing fields, and I shadowed lavender and peppermint farmers in central California. I spent time in northern California’s Surprise Valley, where a retired geology professor has reinvented herself as the region’s most legendary goat farmer, her cheese revered for its rich, smoky texture.\n\nI met taciturn, take-no-prisoner cattlewomen in Montana, Colorado, and California’s Central Valley, with gnarled hands and leathery faces, who limp following years of being thrown from mustangs and from week-long cattle drives, and whom I safely predict will die on their horses, absent regret, wed to the land.\n\nRosemary Graff operates Laughing Buck farm near Fort Collins, Colorado. (Photo: elizabethzach.com)\n\nI spent a very memorable few days at the Abbey of St. Walburga, on the Colorado-Wyoming border, where the Benedictine nuns there hold tight to a centuries-old calendar of silent prayer and service, but who also have made a name for themselves in raising cattle, chickens and water buffalo so as to support their monastic lives.\n\nBy mid-2015, I had spent a total of two months on the road, shuttled through eight states and had met with nearly 50 women. Meanwhile, I observed what researchers today cite as possible reasons for why women have entered the field, so to speak, in such great numbers over the past three decades. Certainly, the appeal of the farm-to-fork movement has attracted many. Women, too, have inherited farms and ranches, or else have downsized to smaller parcels, making the work more affordable and manageable. Farming, too, has become so mechanized, making it easier for a woman to farm and ranch on her own.\n\nDuring my stay at the Abbey of St. Walburga, I had the great coincidental fortune of meeting author Marcia Meredith Hensley, whose “Staking Her Claim: Women Homesteading the West” informed my own research, lending perspective on how eagerly women hit the open road and undertook challenges in the last century as they do now.\n\nThey weren’t always helpmates, but rather oftentimes trailblazers in their own right, renegade entrepreneurs at ease with their solitary lives on the open range. These women have, unfortunately, been largely overlooked by historians.\n\nOn the other hand, I also found that the nature of agricultural financing is such that, in some cases, it is absolutely essential to have a spouse or partner who can bring in a steady income should the vagaries of weather kill the crop, as it were. This fact made the older women I met—who were born to the farm or ranch and had eschewed marriage and children, choosing instead to dedicate themselves to what they felt their higher calling—all the more very impressive to me.\n\nOn this note: I asked one farmer I met, as she showed me around her newly purchased land in the California Delta, how she would ready it for planting: the acres stretched out to the horizon, had been neglected for years and were mired in weeds. She looked at me squarely, pensively, and after a moment, said: “I’ve gardened with boyfriends before. This ship here sinks….well, then, I only want my fingerprints on it.”\n\nOur visit occurred early on in my travels, in January 2015, and at that time two films were premiering nearly back-to-back—“Wild” and “Fifty Shades of Gray”—with each presenting polar opposites of the feminine: the emancipated and the submissive. The women I was meeting, by contrast, fit neither genre precisely, nor were most of them particularly eager to debate women's rights. They don’t have time. They have work to do.\n\nMichelle Lieberman and her husband operate One Acre Farm, the only independent community-supported agriculture hub in Morgan Hill, California. (Photo: elizabethzach.com)\n\nAnd I do, too.\n\nThe fellowship requires that I produce journalistic work based on my findings. A story based on my year's worth of research appeared in January 2016 in The Washington Post and can be read here. My story on the nuns at the Abbey of St. Walburga was published in October 2015 in High Country News and syndicated in The Colorado Independent. Both The Daily Yonder and Catholic Rural Life have featured my fellowship work in their publications.\n\nAnother story, broader in reach and focusing on food and where it comes from, is in the works for a separate international publication. RCAC has also published an overview of the work, reflecting a year of reporting—you can read that here. Meanwhile, I continue to meet with women throughout the West, as interest in the project grows, as do their numbers, and as they quietly farm and ranch the region’s wild lands.\n\n[If you like what you are reading, help us spread the word. \"Like\" Rural America In These Times on Facebook.

But for frustrated Browns fans like myself who are having a difficult time finding closure regarding his situation? Yes.\n\nHeroin is a legitimately-horrifying, wreck-your-life type of drug. If Gordon were having a hard time avoiding heroin, I could process the trajectory of his life without much difficulty.\n\nHis current situation is so much more embarrassing. We're all being deprived of watching the most exciting Cleveland Brown in recent history. And the reason for his suspension from football is that he can't resist a substance so mild that its most harmful documented effect is making it seem like a great idea to buy a $5 Little Caesar's Hot-N-Ready Pizza, and eat it.\n\nJosh Gordon has repeatedly tested positive for a drug considered so tame, so not-life-wrecking, that in some states it can be legally purchased in the form of edible Goldfish crackers.\n\nMany people assume that Gordon has played his last down as a Cleveland Brown. The consensus seems to be that the Browns should just cut him and be done with it.\n\nI disagree.\n\nWhile under suspension, Gordon's contract does not count towards the team payroll. And unless he plays more than 4 games this season, the Browns continue to hold his contract rights for the following year.\n\nSo what is the point of cutting him? And why should we reward him? Why should we let him escape from this terrible organization and go to a real team, while we're all stuck with the Browns?\n\nI suggest that we spitefully trap Josh Gordon in Cleveland.\n\nKeep him under contract. If he quickly grows up and gets clean, you have one of the best natural receivers in the NFL.\n\nIf he doesn't, he gets suspended again and we maintain his rights until 2018. Then we do it again, for as long as it takes, until he shapes up or has been robbed of his youth, too enfeebled to play sports at a professional level. Then we cut him.\n\nI recognize that to suggest this idea is petty and shameful. Fortunately cheering for this team for so many years has rendered me incapable of feeling shame.\n\nAlso, assume that we do cut Josh. What happens next? True Browns fans already know.\n\nGordon arrived in Cleveland in 2012. He's had four different head coaches and five different offensive coordinators. The front office has been in constant transition. The team has gone 19-45.\n\nIf we cut him, he will go somewhere better. Once distanced from the deranged tire fire that is the Browns organization, he will shine.\n\nAnd, of course, fulfilling the Universe's vile plans for us, Gordon will go to Pittsburgh or Baltimore. There, for the foreseeable future, he'll torch us twice a season.\n\nI just can't watch that.\n\nSome of my fellow Browns fans might hesitate to adopt my plan to #TrapJoshGordon, because it is both crazy and chillingly cruel.\n\nThat's very decent of you. But allow me to offer one quick fact in rebuttal: The Browns' number one receiver is Brian Hartline. I believe that even Brian Hartline would acknowledge that that is not a good thing.\n\nTo determine the viability of my #TrapJoshGordon proposal, I consulted cleveland.com Browns reporter Tom Reed. His response was swift, and saddening:\n\n\"Roster purgatory -- quite a concept. To be honest, I don't think the Browns can hang on to him beyond his signed contract because he remains in limbo with the league.... Shame is, Gordon may be the most talented player here since Jim (appropriate expletive) Brown.\"\n\nTom's right. Trapping Josh Gordon in Cleveland for decades is unethical and, even worse, not doable.\n\nBut that doesn't stop me from fantasizing:\n\nThe year is 2031. Forty-year-old Josh Gordon sits on a couch in a basement in Berea, where The Browns have stored him for the past 15 years. He stares emotionlessly at a large flat-screen monitor as Phil Dawson, age 56, laces a perfect field goal through the uprights, pushing Cleveland past Baltimore in a thrilling overtime win.\n\nJOSH\n\n\"Ya know, some times I wish I'd have just stayed clean and not squandered my God-given gifts.\"\n\nHis lament rouses a 275-pound, handlebar-mustached man snoring next to him on the sofa.\n\nJOHNNY\n\n\"You say somethin' Bro?\"\n\nJosh pauses, then reaches for the three-foot bong on the coffee table.\n\nJOSH\n\n\"Nah.

Helen Brown reviews his candid memoir\n\nCatholic guilt, the “steel swamp” of New Jersey, the grindstone graft of his parents’ lives – young Bruce Springsteen felt he was “born to run” from it all. And he did escape, in a sense, into the life of a rock star. But if there’s one thing he wants you to learn from his strikingly honest new memoir, it’s that you can run all you like from the environment that made you, but you can’t hide.\n\nToday, he feels able to credit his New Jersey childhood and the poetry of Catholicism for the electrical charge of his songs about otherwise uncelebrated blue-collar lives. And his parents’ work ethic continues to drive him, sweating and triumphant, aged 67, through live shows that can last four hours. But, as Springsteen devotees will already know, the heart that drives those lightning-bolt shows is dark and brooding.",
  "latent_17485": "SHARE\n\nTORONTO: At the annual SecTor Toronto security conference, one of the key highlights for the last several years has been the Fail Panel, which examines the areas where the security industry did not succeed and where lessons of the past have still not been learned.\n\nThis year was no exception. At the 2014 edition of the Fail Panel, the major topic of discussion was the big brand-name vulnerabilities like Heartbleed, Shellshock and POODLE and how they are properly -- or in some cases improperly -- disclosed.\n\nSecurosis CEO and analyst Rich Mogull took particular aim at the Shellshock vulnerability and how it was disclosed. Shellshock is technically a vulnerability in the BASH (Bourne Again Shell) that could have enabled an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable server.\n\nMogull noted the way that the Kaminsky DNS vulnerability was disclosed in 2008. After security researcher Dan Kaminksy found a serious security flaw in DNS, he proceeded to work with leading IT vendors to patch the issue, Mogull recounted. Two weeks passed between the time that Kaminsky first found the vulnerability and talked to vendors about the issue and when the issue was publicly disclosed.\n\nShellshock's Disastrous Disclosure\n\nNow contrast that to Shellshock, Mogull said. Linux vendor Red Hat reported that it was patching the BASH flaw, and the effort was not well coordinated. The initial patch didn't cover the entire attack surface, and there were at least six different ways to exploit the BASH flaw. To add further insult to injury, the open-source Metasploit penetration testing framework rapidly made attack signatures available.\n\nhttps://o1.qnsr.com/log/p.gif?;n=203;c=204660766;s=9477;x=7936;f=201812281312070;u=j;z=TIMESTAMP;a=20392931;e=i\n\n\"The level of communications screw-ups on Shellshock were unbelievable considering everything that we have learned about disclosure in the past 10 years,\" Mogull said. \"There appeared to be no coordination among the UNIX guys and maybe someone jumped the gun.\"\n\nIn Mogull's view, most organizations did not have the time to patch before the Shellshock attacks started to happen. Going a level deeper, he emphasized that Shellshock was a non-trivial vulnerability to defend against.\n\n\"Even though you might have though you could block it (Shellshock) on the surface, there are several ways that other applications interact,\" Mogull said. \"It was a fricking disaster.\"\n\nXen Project Gets It Right\n\nAlthough he considers the Shellshock disclosure a failure, Mogull said there are good recent examples of how disclosure can be done the right way.\n\n\"Contrast that (Shellshock) with the massive Xen vulnerability that could have destroyed every cloud service,\" Mogull said. \"It was all fixed before anything went public.\"\n\nThe open-source Xen virtualization project on Oct. 1 publicly disclosed a critical vulnerability that could have enabled an attacker to read data from other virtual machines on the same host server. The flaw triggered reboots at Amazon, Rackspace and IBM Softlayer to fix the issue, all before the vulnerability was made public.\n\n\"I believe that you don't go with with full disclosure until there is an opportunity to fix,\" Mogull said. \"The cycle to spin up attacks is short, so if we're not given an opportunity to patch we can't keep up.\"\n\nSean Michael Kerner is a senior editor at eSecurityPlanet and InternetNews.com.

  "latent_17486": "We all know that Hollywood is obsessed with remakes and sequels, and it seems that audiences are pretty OK with that since they keep going to see them. It’s a topic of hopelessness and distress for many enthusiasts who just want something fresh. And although many articles and blog posts have been written over the past decade and a half on the topic, it doesn’t seem like it’s about to change. We’re so used to it, in fact, that several news outlets picked up a fake story about the remake of Mrs. Doubtfire. We’re just that jaded.\n\nThe book industry doesn’t seem to be fairing much better, what with the Twilight and Fifty Shades appalling successes, but we’ll take what we can get and thank goodness because the movie industry seems to only get fresh ideas by adapting comics or novels these days. But what’s especially interesting has been a few recent turn of events like the release of Harper Lee’s Go Set a Watchman. Not quite remakes, not quite re-releases, but a sort of blast from the past that nobody was expecting.\n\nWhich leads us to the big news today.\n\nNews is spreading online that an old Jules Verne novel, The Will of an Eccentric, was released yesterday by ATBOSH Media. This is as close as we could get to a brand new novel from the famed writer and it’s pretty dang exciting!\n\n“But wait,” I’m sure some of my readers are saying. “I’ve see it at Steampunk conventions! Sure it’s rare, but it’s not new.”\n\nOf course, it’s not a new release. We have the internet, after all, and with the rise of Steampunk and correlating modern popularity of Jules Verne, other editions of the book have been self published by various elements since 2008. According to its Wikipedia page, The Will of an Eccentric (originally published in France in 1899 and in England in 1900) was faithfully recreated in its magazine format, all 30 issues, with plates and everything. Then in 2009, Choptank Press put the book up for on-demand printing via Lulu.com. And if you look for it on Amazon, you’ll see somebody put a copy up via Amazon’s self-publishing service Create Space back in 2013.\n\nSo what makes the ATBOSH Media release so special?\n\nIt’s essentially a question of price versus quality. The original editions sell for thousands of dollars, as I’m sure you can imagine. The 2008 printing is pretty darn rare itself and I’m sure it costs a pretty penny as well. The Choptank Press release isn’t so bad… $70 for a nice edition with all the plates and everything. The copy on Amazon, though, is pretty terrible. It was put on Create Space by Kassock Bros. Publishing Company, which is infamous for taking copyright free works and putting them on Create Space for print-on-demand with little formatting, no editing, and for works that aren’t in English, running them through Google Translate first and then sending them off to print without as much as a glance at the text. And forget about the plates. This edition is $10 (about the cheapest Create Space books come) for something you should be able to get off of Project Gutenberg for free. Unfortunately, The Will of an Eccentric doesn’t appear to have made into Project Gutenberg’s database, so if you can’t afford the $70 copy then you’re stuck for quality.\n\nUntil today.\n\nATBOSH Media has put the time and effort into creating a well edited, full edition of the Verne novel many of us never knew we wanted. From their press release:\n\n“This Modern Edition is a scholarly work and not just a straight reproduction of the 19th century British edition. Modern means the reader won’t need a dictionary to search for obscure and obsolete 19th century terms (which most of the time were British choices for French words). When first published, the book contained many logical inconsistencies and continuity errors that have also now been resolved. As with any scholarly edition, all changes have been carefully documented and annotated. These changes, along with the correction of typos & translation errors create a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience that remains true to the Verne original.”\n\nThat’s pretty awesome. I mean, this is Jules Verne we’re talking about… he deserves to have a good treatment by publishers, and what’s better is how ATBOSH Media isn’t making changes as if the book has always been that way. By notating and documenting each change, they pay respect not just to Verne himself but also the historical significance of his work.\n\nAnd the price? A very reasonable $25 for a print copy, or $10 for Kindle.\n\nI’ll confess, I’m not a huge Jules Verne fan. I love his work, but I don’t devour his books two or three times a year like some people do. But I’m super excited to add The Will of an Eccentric to my small Verne collection, and I can’t wait to get around to reading it with my daughter.",

  "latent_17546": "This article originally appeared on Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting.\n\nFormer White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has disclosed the source of $2 million in debt, which he previously failed to report, on a revised government document released Tuesday.\n\nThe corrected disclosure follows a Center for Public Integrity investigation in July that revealed Bannon’s omission.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAs a senior government employee, Bannon was required to disclose personal financial liabilities. He listed four mortgages on rental properties but failed to specify the creditors, describing them as “HOME LOAN #1,” “HOME LOAN #2,” “HOME LOAN #3” and “HOME LOAN #4.”\n\nThe Center for Public Integrity used public records to report the source of three of the debts as JPMorgan Chase – a government contractor and powerful political force – and the fourth as Quicken Loans. The revised filing for Bannon, whom Trump fired in August, officially confirms this.\n\nThe Center for Public Integrity discovered Bannon’s omission as part of #CitizenSleuth, a joint reporting project with Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting that asked the public help identify errors or potential conflicts of interest contained within top government officials’ personal financial disclosures.\n\nThe White House promised to correct Bannon’s disclosure following the Center for Public Integrity’s report in July. But it didn’t release Bannon’s amended document until this week. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the new disclosure.\n\nBannon could not immediately be reached for comment. Reached by phone this afternoon, Arthur Schwartz, a Bannon spokesman, said he’d attempt to reach him.\n\nBannon’s newest disclosure document is a product of several previous iterations: It’s been edited on seven separate occasions from May to October to add or clarify a handful of items, including formal disclosure of Bannon’s role as CEO of Trump’s campaign.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBannon’s newest disclosure offered a few new, if minor, details about his ties to businesses backed by conservative billionaire Robert Mercer. Those businesses include Cambridge Analytica (a voter targeting operation Bannon now reports as providing “data analysis”) and several limited liability companies involved in making movies advancing nationalist causes, such as fighting militant Islam and defeating liberal politicians, including 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton (now reported as “film industry”).\n\nThe correction comes amid a series of reported lapses on the disclosures of senior executive branch officials, including more than 70 financial holdings left off the public disclosure of White House senior adviser and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe New York Times reported Kushner also omitted contacts with Russian officials on a separate non-public form submitted as part of a background check. McClatchy reported last month that disclosures that several former Trump administration officials, including Bannon, must file upon exiting government had not yet been released.\n\nIn Bannon’s case, White House ethics officials approved the form with missing information, raising questions about the ability of senior officials to skirt disclosure requirements.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n“Individuals make mistakes,” Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and an expert on government ethics, said in July. “The real story is how shoddy the ethics process is in the White House.”",
  "latent_17691": "When a large portion of your life is spent revving up wasted crowds in bars, you’re bound to have a catalog of weird, raunchy memories. We reached out to Chicago’s top drag queens and asked them to give us the dirt on their wildest nights on the scene. From ball-popping performances to nights spent huffing poppers off bar rags, these are their stories:\n\nShea Couleé\n\n“My craziest memory in drag was the time my balls popped out during my performance of Mya’s, ‘My Love is like… Wo.’ I was at a monthly Scarlet show called, ‘Trannika’s Most Wanted,’ wearing a really small French-cut body suit. While I was dancing, the two made an unwarranted guest appearance. Everyone noticed and there were even a few Vines circulating with my exposed nuts. Now, I wear the memory like a badge of honor.”\n\nKahmora Hall\n\n“The weirdest thing that’s happened to me in drag was at a Neverland party a couple years ago. A tranny chaser with a foot fetish wouldn’t leave me alone the entire night. He asked if he could suck my toes, even with all my tights and pantyhose on and he did. FYI, I had not washed those in a while.”\n\nTrannika Rex\n\n“The day after Illinois’ gay marriage bill didn’t pass it was all Boystown was talking about. We had a particularly trashy, loud bachelorette party come to the drag show at Berlin that night—a real bunch of jackasses. Audience members started screaming at them to go home and they started yelling back. Someone came on stage to explain the bill and why they were particularly offensive on that of all days. The yelling only got louder. It was the only time I’ve felt out of control at a show, but the girls left quickly after the screaming match. To those girls, I’m sorry but also fuck you.”\n\nValentine Addams\n\n“One night, this guy kept asking me if I wanted a drink, so I agreed—duh. He said he was Lady Bunny’s manager, and how he knew I’d become ‘really famous’ one day. He invited me back to his room at the W Hotel, so he could ‘talk to me about how beautiful I am.’ When I asked to see his business cards, he said he forgot them in his hotel room. He eventually switched his story from ‘wanting to make me famous’ to ‘wanting to give me ‘lots of money just to go talk.’ I quickly went to change and left the bar without him seeing me and per usual, ended the night with my girls and some Taco Bell.”\n\nKim Chi\n\n“All of my friends know I physically can’t consume alcohol. One night, I was lip-synching in a giant wedding dress to a remix of Shania Twain’s, ‘You’re Still the One,’ feeling my bridal fantasy. I got down from the stage mid-song and worked my way to the bar, where the bartender handed me a generous shot of whiskey. Caught in the moment, I took the shot and went backstage with trembling legs. In the middle of my next number, I fell twice, my wig came off and I made out with an audience member, smearing lipstick all over my face. After that train wreck, my drunk ass thought it’d be fun to cover my entire face in lipstick for the curtain call—I was mortified the next day.”\n\nLucy Stoole\n\n“One of my wildest nights was when I performed at Jackhammer last year. I did two numbers in-between the punk bands onstage that night and ended up assisting patrons with putting on cock rings. We all huffed poppers off a bar rag until 3 am.”\n\nSissy Spastik\n\n“At the end of my gig one night, I was flirting with this gorgeous model. We gave each other ‘the eye,’ and I was immediately hooked by his smile. He was tall, European and horny—what’s not to love? We went home and I made him model naked for me. The next day, I showed all my friends the photos and they were drooling the house down.”\n\nSara Andrews\n\n“When I was 17 years old and living in the backwoods of Tennessee, I’d make a weekly trip to the ‘big city’ of Nashville for amateur drag night. One night, I was looking like a cheap hooker and my car broke down on the side of the interstate—mind you, cellphones weren’t around at this point. An 18-wheeler eventually pulled up beside me and the driver offered me a ride, thinking I was a stripper. He dropped me off at the nearest payphone, but blasted over the CB radio that ‘a stripper was up for grabs.’ Trucks all started showing up to catch a glimpse, but my mom came just in time.”",
  "latent_17848": "A quantum computer, like any other computer, requires a way to store and retrieve information. In other words, some sort of memory. But because of the rich quantum entanglement gooey center of quantum computing, the memory and the logic need to be linked in a manner that's very different from that in classical computing: the magic of entanglement.\n\nPhysicists have been crowing about how they can create entangled states for a while now. Unfortunately, quantum computing requires something more: a memory state should last for a long time, independently of the logic parts, while the logic part should be accessible and fast. This makes coupling these two elements together in a useful way difficult... until now, that is.\n\nIts the decoherence, stupid\n\nQuantum computing, at a practical level, is all about how predictably things change with time, called coherence. If you give a swing a push, then, after a few measurements of the swing's position, you can use that data to predict the swing's position at any time in the future. This is because the eddies in the air motion around the swing simply don't have much effect on the swing's motion. In the quantum case, the qubit is in a superposition of two states, and the relative probability of measuring the qubit in one of them changes predictably with time (and, in fact, changes very much like the position of the swing with time).\n\nNow imagine that some obnoxious shot-putter is throwing large metal balls at the swing after you give it a push. Every time one hits the swing, it noticeably changes the swing's motion and, in a very short time, you can't use previous measurements to predict the future.\n\nThe quantum world is filled with tiny swings that we can set into motion. Unfortunately, it is also filled with obnoxious, swing-hating shot-putters. We may set a qubit into motion, but the predictability of its behavior decays very, very quickly.\n\nFortunately, it doesn't have to be this way. What we can do is give the qubit an additional push every now and again to keep its motion predictable. We simply need to make sure that the pushes are always at the right time in the cycle (just like pushing a swing) and occur often enough that our pushes are more significant than the random lurches due to the shot-putter.\n\nThis technique allows one to extend the coherence of a qubit by quite a bit, and is well known in physics (your local MRI scanner will likely use the same technique).\n\nPhysicists have known how to extend the coherence of a qubit for a long time. But in quantum computing, you may want to store two entangled qubits that evolve at different rates. Then, extending the coherence of one is likely to destroy the coupling between the two qubits. In other words, if we preserve the coherence of our logic qubit, we cannot connect it to the memory qubit, and, if we don't extend the coherence, it will destroy itself before any memory operations can be completed.\n\nAll you coherence are belong to us\n\nTo solve this problem, researchers from a number of institutions took a more careful approach to the preservation of coherence. They realized that, even though the two qubits evolve at their own pace, there are periodic moments where they are at the same point in their cycle. If they give qubit a push at just that moment, then they still preserve the coherence of the logic qubit, but do not destroy its entanglement with the memory qubit.\n\nYou can think of this in terms of music. If you take two strings on a guitar and tune them so that they are nearly—but not quite—the same frequency, then you will not only hear both tones, but they will oscillate in volume. This oscillation is the frequency difference between the two vibrations, and creates what are called beat notes. Our quantum system has the same beat notes, and if we choose to apply a push to the qubit at the same point in this beat note oscillation, we will preserve the coherence of the fast decaying qubit (logic) without altering the state of the slow decaying qubit (memory).\n\nIn this case, the researchers were working with nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond—not guitars. Diamond consists of carbon atoms, arranged such that each carbon atom is connected to four others. But when nitrogen is introduced, one carbon atom is spurned by the nitrogen, leaving an electron that has a set of unique levels.\n\nThe spin—the direction the electron's internal magnetic field is pointing—provides a nice pair of states that can be set and read using light. Although it's great for computation, the electron is very sensitive to the environment and its coherence never lasts very long (typically a microsecond or so), so microwave pulses are used to flip the spin and preserve the coherence.\n\nThe nitrogen nuclear spin can also be used as a qubit. Because the nuclear magnetic moment is much smaller, it is much less sensitive to the environment, so it stays around for milliseconds—just what we want for memory. However, it takes a few microseconds to perform an operation on a nuclear spin qubit, by which time the electronic qubit has long since gone off to do other things.\n\nNevertheless, the electron's coherence lasts long enough that the nuclear spin undergoes many oscillations before it decays away. So, the researchers identified times in those oscillations when the microwave pulses would have no influence on the nuclear spin—and hit the electron with spin flips that coincide with those points. That is, they hit the beat note between the slow nuclear spin and the fast electron spin.\n\nThey demonstrated that they could perform basic logic operations, and performed one of the classic \"look, we made a quantum computer\" demonstrations: a search of a database containing four items. Although that sounds a bit cynical, this is a significant step, because it provides a convenient and natural link between a qubit that is near-perfect for logic operations with a qubit that is near-perfect for memory operations.\n\nNature, 2012, DOI: 10.1038/nature10900",

But the kidnappers soon find out that it was more trouble than it was worth when Tommy begins flushing their stolen loot down the toilet.\n\n- Description from Klasky Csupo.\n\nPlot\n\nDidi is looking for her car keys and finds that Tommy has them. She grabs them from him and puts Grandpa Lou in charge to look after Tommy as she leaves. Tommy pretends to go to sleep and Grandpa takes a seat in the armchair and watches television. As he eventually falls asleep, Tommy \"wakes up\" and finds that the front door is wide open. He exits the playpen and walks out through the door. As Tommy plays with a purple ball found on the front lawn, two-dimwitted thugs abruptly kidnap the toddler, believing that they can get a large from Tommy's family, thinking that he is the son of Ronald Thump (due to them getting their real target's house address wrong).\n\nBefore they drive away, they write a note that was meant for Ronald Thump, tie it to a brick, and toss it to the Pickles' house. The sound of the brick hitting the wall wakes up Grandpa, who walks outside and picks up the newspaper, along with the criminals' note. When he returns back into the living room, he reads the note. But he needs to put on his reading glasses to get a more lucid view of it. So he proceeds to do so, but runs to the kitchen to get another cup of coffee, oblivious to Tommy's absence.\n\nWhile in the kidnappers' moving car, Tommy drops his ball. He begins to cry and the thugs try to get him to stop crying. After a few failure, one of the thugs hand Tommy his ball, and Tommy finally stops crying. Later, they get to the hideout which is just the kidnappers' unkept apartment. As Tommy walks inside, he slips on a banana peel and loses his ball again. He begins crying once again and the thugs decide to give him some milk to get him to stop. They walk into the kitchen to make a baby bottle and Tommy stops crying to view his ball on the table. He drags a suitcase to the table and attempts to climb on top of it. His foot hits the buckle, opening the suitcase to reveal jewels and rubies. He grabs some and drops them into the toilet in the bathroom. The hoodlums return and find him doing this. They run to the toilet and argue over who should grab the jewels out of the toilet. While the thieves argue, Tommy walks to the shelf to reach his ball. He climbs onto a vacuum cleaner and inadvertently hits the switch with his foot. The vacuum cleaner is activated, and it starts sucking up nearly everything around the apartment. The kidnappers then notice that the vacuum cleaner is sucking up the money inside the suitcase. They turn off the vacuum cleaner and place Tommy on the floor. They switch the vacuum cleaner in reverse and the money comes out, along with the dust inside. They get covered with dust and find that Tommy is about to head to the window to retrieve his ball. They dive for him and end up falling out through the window. When they return upstairs, they are convinced that Tommy is plotting his next move against them and contrive a way out of their predicament.\n\nMeanwhile, Stu comes in the living room to wake up a sleeping Grandpa and notices the criminals' letter on the table. Before he can read it though, the doorbell rings, and Stu answers it to find the two kidnappers returning Tommy to him. Stu watches the crooks leave in utter confusion. As they drive away, the letter that Stu is holding blows out of his hands through the winds and ends up in the face of one of the kidnappers, causing him to run a red light and crash the car into a fire hydrant. The impact causes the two criminals to eject out of the car and end up through the back of the police car.\n\nMeanwhile, Didi returns and offers Tommy a squeaky banana. But this causes the toddler to cry hysterically as the episode ends.\n\nTrivia\n\nThe reason why Tommy cried when Didi gave him the banana toy at the end, was because he was experiencing a form of post traumatic stress disorder. (PTSD). This is caused when someone experiences a traumatic or scary event such as being attacked, sexually assaulted, nearly killed, the death of a loved one etc. It is triggered when someone or something reminds them of that time and place. For example, while being kidnapped by the thugs, he slipped on a banana peel inside of their safehouse. The symptoms are depression and sadness from being reminded of those events.\n\nAt the beginning of the episode, the grass in the Pickles' yard is colored green. At the end of the episode, the grass is colored brown.\n\nThis is the third episode to only feature one of the main characters (in this case, Tommy is the character).\n\nRonald Thump is a parody and reference to real estate tycoon Donald Trump, who is the 45th President of the United States and a famous billionaire.\n\nWhen Lou is watching a channel about fish, the channel's music from the pilot episode plays.\n\nThe episode's plot is based on the plot of the story The Ransom of Red Chief by O. Henry.\n\nby O. Henry. This episode was airing when 9/11 took place, and was rarely aired for a while afterwards.\n\nMike is smoking one cigarette throughout the entire episode\n\nThe title of the episode makes a reference to the 1986 movie \"Ruthless People\" starring Danny DeVito.\n\nGoofs",
  "latent_18210": "Morse code was once a staple of the communications industry, but with advancing technology it has become relegated almost exclusively to movies and a niche group of ham radio operators. [Jan] has created a device which might not put a stop to this trend, but will at least educate children on the basics of how Morse code works by visually displaying Morse code as it’s generated.\n\nThe setup is fairly simple. An old momentary switch (which could easily be used in an actual Morse code setup) activates two pieces of circuitry. The first is a 555 timer circuit that creates an audible tone when the switch is pressed so the user can hear exactly what an operator would hear when decoding a real Morse code message.\n\nThe second piece of circuitry is where the real genius lies: a continuously spinning roll of glow-in-the-dark tape is placed in front of a white LED. When the switch is pressed, the LED turns on, which produces dots and dashes on the roll of tape as it passes by. This eliminates the need for rolls of paper or a more complicated moving pen/pencil setup to draw on the paper which might also be less child-proof.\n\nWhile [Jan] built this as a toy, the children who used it thoroughly enjoyed it! They even decoded some Morse code messages and used the device to practice on it. After a while they’ll easily be able to master the Morse code trainer!",

Carpenter, program coordinator for a new minor in applied creative thinking at Eastern Kentucky University, “there is a larger conversation happening on campus: ‘Where does creativity fit into the E.K.U. student experience?’ ” Dr. Carpenter says 40 students from a broad array of fields, including nursing and justice and safety, have enrolled in the minor — a number he expects to double as more sections are added to introductory classes. Justice and safety? Students want tools to help them solve public safety problems and deal with community issues, Dr. Carpenter explains, and a credential to take to market.\n\nThe credential’s worth is apparent to Mr. Lahue, a communication major who believes that a minor in the field carries a message. “It says: ‘This person is not a drone. They can use this skill set and apply themselves in other parts of the job.’ ”\n\nOn-demand inventiveness is not as outrageous as it sounds. Sure, some people are naturally more imaginative than others. What’s igniting campuses, though, is the conviction that everyone is creative, and can learn to be more so.\n\nJust about every pedagogical toolbox taps similar strategies, employing divergent thinking (generating multiple ideas) and convergent thinking (finding what works).The real genius, of course, is in the how.\n\nDr. Puccio developed an approach that he and partners market as FourSight and sell to schools, businesses and individuals. The method, which is used in Buffalo State classrooms, has four steps: clarifying, ideating, developing and implementing. People tend to gravitate to particular steps, suggesting their primary thinking style. Clarifying — asking the right question — is critical because people often misstate or misperceive a problem. “If you don’t have the right frame for the situation, it’s difficult to come up with a breakthrough,” Dr. Puccio says. Ideating is brainstorming and calls for getting rid of your inner naysayer to let your imagination fly. Developing is building out a solution, and maybe finding that it doesn’t work and having to start over. Implementing calls for convincing others that your idea has value.\n\nImage Edwin Perez's FaceSaver keeps your phone from falling. Credit Cyndi Burnett\n\nJack V.

  "latent_18254": "GENEVA (Reuters) - A U.N. human rights panel urged the United States on Monday to end widespread detention of would-be immigrants including asylum-seekers, saying the practice has “grown exponentially” and violates international law.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrest an immigrant in San Clemente, California, May 11, 2017. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nThe holding of migrants and would-be refugees in custody is often “punitive, unreasonably long, unnecessary and costly” and should be used only as a last resort, the panel said in a 23-page report to the United Nations Human Rights Council.\n\nEach year, an estimated 352,850 people are detained across the United States pending the outcome of their immigration proceedings at a cost of about $2 billion, it said.\n\nThe independent experts, who form the U.N. working group on arbitrary detention, were reporting on their mission last October at the invitation of the Obama administration.\n\n“The Working Group is of the view that all administrative detention, in particular of immigrants in an irregular situation, should be in accordance with international human rights law; and that such detention is to be a measure of last resort, necessary and proportionate and be not punitive in nature, and that alternatives to detention are to be sought whenever possible,” the report said.\n\nIn Washington, a White House spokeswoman said “That’s a question for the U.N.” when asked to comment on the panel’s findings. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has backed legislation to crack down on illegal immigrants, describing it as vital to protect American lives.\n\nThe U.N. experts interviewed 280 detainees during their visits to nine prisons in Texas, California and Illinois. Some were remote locations with limited access to legal services.\n\nThey reported seeing immigrants and asylum seekers held in “punitive conditions” comparable to those of convicted criminals despite their right to seek asylum under international law.\n\nIn some cases, the length of detention pending immigration proceedings was “unreasonable”, lasting from six months to more than one year without resolution.\n\nThe experts voiced concern at Trump’s executive order in January and an implementing memorandum that “lay the groundwork for expanding the existing detention system by increasing the number of individuals subject to immigration detention”.\n\n“Under the order, apprehended individuals may be detained ‘on suspicion’ of violating federal or state law, which includes unauthorized entry,” they said.\n\nThey received information in March that the Department of Homeland Security was considering separating children from parents caught crossing the border, “in an attempt to deter illegal immigration from Mexico,” they said.\n\n“This is particularly serious given the increasing trend of unaccompanied children migrating to escape violence and reunite with family members.”",
  "latent_18258": "The US Fish and Wildlife Service has listed the southern white rhinoceros as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe measure will put under the act’s protection the last remaining unprotected species of rhinoceros, a move that the organization says could help protect the other four highly endangered species of rhinos – black, Sumatran, Indian, and Javan – from poaching.\n\nThe southern white rhino is not as close to extinction as its four cousins, with about 20,000 white rhinos in protected areas and private game reserves in four countries: South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Kenya. (The southern white rhino is actually a subspecies of white rhino; its northern counterpart is believed extinct in the wild.)\n\nIn contrast, the Javan rhino, the most threatened of the five rhino species, is now believed to number just 35 individuals, all living in Ujung Kulon National Park in Java, Indonesia. Vietnam’s last Javan rhino was declared extinct in 2010.\n\nBut the white rhino’s omission from the act had meant that traffickers, if caught during transactions, could pass off any rhino horn as a white rhino's, says Craig Hoover, head of the wildlife trade and conservation branch of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Mr. Hoover notes that the white rhino’s horns are physically indistinguishable from those cut from the other rhinos.\n\n“This is really to address what was a loophole in how we can regulate the movement of rhino horns in the US,” he says.\n\nAccording to a statement from the office, the new classification \"prohibits the sale or offer for sale in interstate commerce of this species and its parts and products, consistent with all other rhinos.\"\n\nThe announcement comes after South Africa, home to about 80 percent of the world’s rhinos, reported a severe spate of white rhino killings within its borders over the last year and a half. Last year, that country alone recorded 668 white rhinos poached, as well as 446 white rhinos slaughtered in the first six months of this year, the US embassy said in a statement. That compares to 448 dead in 2011 and 333 dead in 2009.\n\nBefore 2008, the highest poaching toll since about 1990 was largely just in the single digits, says Hoover.\n\nThe dramatic uptick in killings stems from a catastrophic collision of two factors: booming wealth in Asia, especially in recently prosperous Vietnam, and the branding of crushed rhino horn folk remedies, says Hoover.\n\n“Historically, the horn has been used as a fever reducer in Asia,” says Hoover. “But that’s not new. What is new is that rhino horn has suddenly became the cool thing, particularly in Vietnam, for things like a hangover cure or a cancer cure – none of which is grounded in any research or scientific fact.”\n\nAt this point, a kilogram of rhino horn commands about $60,000 to $65,000, making rhino horn worth more by weight than gold, according to US Fish and Wildlife Service. Rhino horn is made of keratin, the protein in human fingernails, and, if not for the puffed-up demand, would not be valuable.\n\n“Now you see why people are getting involved in illegal rhino horn trade,” says Hoover.\n\nIndeed, the surging price has spawned a coterie of international criminal syndicates that rival drug and arms cartels in the sophistication of their methods. The US, while not a major player in a market that largely spans from Africa to Asia, has nevertheless emerged as a worrisome linchpin in illegal rhino horn trading.\n\nThat’s because Americans are the largest importers of rhino hunting trophies in the world, says Teresa Telecky, Director of Wildlife for Humane Society International, noting that hunters brought some 688 trophies into the US between 2002 and 2012.\n\n“Basically, there are a lot of horns in this country,” says Dr. Telecky.\n\nIn the US, hunting trophies from both black and southern white rhinos can be imported with proper documentation from either South Africa or Swaziland, but they cannot be sold. Those trophies consist of the full rhino head, and both black and white rhinos have two horns.\n\nThe US, then, has become a hotspot for traders looking to buy up horns that will win big cash rewards in Asia. To date, a massive, undercover criminal investigation known as Operation Crash, led by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, has resulted in 14 arrests and six convictions for illegal rhino horn trading. Those convictions included two Chinese businessmen caught buying horns in the US for illegal sale in China, one of whom attempted to package the rhino in a postal box marked as bearing sweets and handicrafts.\n\nIn its March 2013 report, the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) also identified a rise in the theft of rhino horns in the US.\n\nAs the threat to rhinos becomes increasingly dire, attempts at combating the problem have also become more creative, with most aimed at curbing the ballooning price of a horn. Some conservationists have advocated legalizing the rhino trade, in hopes that doing so will convert rhino poaching into rhino farming, since rhino horns that are shaved off can regenerate, with no need to kill the animal for its horn.\n\nThat solution, though, is saddled with major questions about sustainability, as is its unclear if regenerating horns could sustain an industry that is expected to draw more participants if legalized. One Chinese pharmaceutical company is currently experimenting on how to harvest rhino horns efficiently and without injury to the animal.\n\nIn another surprising turn, private rhino owners in South Africa, who consider the animals essential to tourism, have begun poisoning the horns. The controversial practice, which does not harm the rhinos but is aimed at making those who ingest the horn powder extremely ill, seeks to warn away would-be consumers in Asia, says Telecky.\n\n“People in South Africa are really just so desperate to protect the rhinos,” she says. “They’re at their wits’ end about what to do.”\n\nTelecky’s organization has taken a less extreme approach, attempting to rebrand how Vietnamese businessmen perceive the horns. Vietnamese businessmen are among the product’s biggest buyers, purchasing horns as status symbols, she says.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

In white rhino social groups, adult males cordon off for themselves a plot of land about one square mile and rim it with dung piles to form a symbolic fence. Dominant males then patrol that land to ensure that breeding females do not leave the plot and will lunge – horn first – after any male that expresses interest in its preferred mate.\n\nAnd these are big beasts: White rhinos are the second largest land mammals in the world after elephants, placing them in a group of big-boned animals that historically have not fared well on the planet. Vanished Brobdingnagian animals include the Elasmotherium, a four-ton, furry rhino that went extinct during the Pleistocene.",
  "latent_18292": "Software Disintermediating Brokers?! Not so fast…\n\nLuke Shaw Blocked Unblock Follow Following Aug 15, 2017\n\nIn these times of rapid technological advancement, fears of robot overlords abound. Ok, ok…less hyperbolic. Software is replacing inefficient/unproductive labor; the professional services industry is not immune, and real estate industry folks are scared. With Zillow’s acquisition of Dotloop in 2015, their launch of Instant Offers, and Redfin’s flat brokerage-fee announcement, sweat is forming on the brows of many real estate pros. Will residential brokers go the way of the travel agent? What about Commercial brokerage? Our industry is notoriously slow to adopt new technology, and trends about a decade behind our residential cousin. Are we as likely to be disintermediated as they are? Is this a good thing for the marketplace? Is this a good thing for consumers of our advocacy services? My thesis: efficiency, transparency, access = good; bypassing brokers=asking for trouble.\n\nWe can already see signs that the side-stepping of brokers in commercial real estate(CRE) is a real possibility. Many of the largest disturbers of the CRE status-quo are outwardly friendly towards the brokerage community. WeWork, Regus, Liquidspace, Breather, etc. all make an effort to entice brokers to refer their clients to a shared workspace. A co-working space can be the best solution for a tenant with serious time constraints and massive fluctuations in headcount. Catering to an under-serviced sector of the market; this is good capitalism…Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on who’s reading), a few of these players are positioning themselves to disintermediate brokers, whether they are willing to admit it or not. This is a bad thing for most tenants. Hear me out!\n\nLet us begin where the rubber meets the road in an office leasing transaction; with documentation, and the negotiation of business terms. What habitants of WeWork, Regus, LiquidSpace etc., are faced with is something akin to a license agreement. These documents appear to be etched in stone. Liquidspace champions “Flexible Terms,” on its site, but follows that header with the reassurance that their technology will “Remove the burdens of lease negotiations.” What a nice thought…You don’t actually want to negotiate the rate or terms of your lease do you? If you are a 30-person business buying a license from one of these organizations, you could be looking at a >$1 million bill each year…Is that worth a bit of back- and-forth? On one office leasing transaction management platform, griddig, Teams can fully execute a Letter of Intent for an office lease. There are ~30 possible items to be negotiated on their LOI tool…Forget the actual lease/sublease document, 30 potential business terms to be discussed prior to bringing in legal counsel! Without the expertise of a broker, how would a tenant know which buttons to push? Which items to address, and what to ask for? Which are financially significant, and relevant to the tenant’s business plans? Having an experienced broker will give you the advantage of being able to read between the lines, and anticipate problems before it’s too late and you’ve signed on the dotted line.\n\nWe can assume that some leverage will remain on the side of tenants, regardless of how much technology changes the tenant/landlord relationship. The basic market forces will always be at play. But here is an important question to consider; who is controlling the information upon which business owners will make their leasing decisions? Zillow is notoriously inaccurate, CompStak, Loopnet, and other free sites in the commercial real estate vertical have equally unreliable data. Furthermore, who benefits the most from the restriction of information to the public, besides the multiple listing services/Costar? You guessed it, Landlords! With less information, and less context, you will be less likely to make an aggressive offer, and not have the supporting evidence to push for a better deal. Let’s pose another important question; who are the greatest investors in the aforementioned space-sharing companies? Right again! The institutional owners of real estate, developers, and multi-national landlord brokerage shops…To spell this out, the people who want office rents through the roof, are funding the office-space-as-a-service effort, and would control most of the relevant data in this scenario.\n\nTenant-representation brokers are a necessary balancing force in the marketplace. Tenants need someone to do the leg-work of combing the entire market for alternatives, leading the team (architect, general contractor, real estate counsel, furniture vendor, etc.), creating a bit of competition amongst lessors for your tenancy, bringing down the anxiety levels, and anticipating problems before they happen. Business owners don’t have the time nor the expertise to manage the process themselves. Every business has unique challenges, priorities, and financial objectives. One size does not fit all in an office lease, so the cookie-cutter solutions provided by co-working giants will not disintermediate us all. I, for one, welcome our robot overlords…",

The issue here is not Siri, but is that a special GPU driver for iPhone 4 is needed; and it is obviously not included in the iPhone 4S binary cache – where the Siri files are located.\n\nPerhaps the biggest news here is that we’ve determined that there is no technical reason for Apple not to allow Siri to run on the iPhone 4. The iPhone 4 hardware can support the Siri artificial intelligence system, as the A4 processor is said to be powerful enough. We are not entirely sure why Apple is making Siri an iPhone 4S exclusive but it could be due to special microphone support, or because the A5 may allow it to run slightly quicker.

  "latent_18694": "By Jamal Eason, Product Manager, Android\n\nYesterday we announced Android 5.1, an updated version of the Android Lollipop platform that improves stability, provides better control of notifications, and increases performance. As a part of the Lollipop update, we are releasing the Android 5.1 SDK (API Level 22) which supports the new platform and lets you get started with developing and testing.\n\nWhat's new in Android 5.1?\n\nFor developers, Android 5.1 introduces a small set of new APIs. A key API addition is support for multiple SIM cards, which is important for many regions where Android One phones are being adopted. Consumers of Android One devices will have more flexibility to switch between carriers and manage their network activities in the way that works best for them. Therefore you, as a developer, can create new app experiences that take advantage of this new feature.\n\nIn addition to the new consumer features, Android 5.1 also enhances enterprise features to better support the launch of Android for Work.\n\nAndroid 5.1 supports multiple SIM cards on compatible devices like Android One.\n\nUpdates for the Android SDK\n\nTo get you started with Android 5.1, we have updated the Android SDK tools to support the new platform and its new APIs. The SDK now includes Android 5.1 emulator system images that you can use to test your apps and develop using the latest capabilities and APIs.

  "latent_18965": "Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, has used a presidential TV debate to accuse the country’s powerful revolutionary guards of attempting to sabotage its nuclear agreement with the west by testing ballistic missiles with provocative anti-Israeli messages written on them.\n\nPlaceholder candidate in Iranian election overshadows Rouhani Read more\n\nThe moderate cleric, who is seeking re-election in a six-man race scheduled for 19 May, came under attack about his administration’s performance in Friday’s three-hour-long televised debate focused on domestic and foreign policy.\n\nBut Rouhani defended his record, and accused his domestic opponents of rooting for Donald Trump.\n\n“We saw what they did in order to disrupt Barjam,” Rouhani said referring to the Persian acronym for the landmark nuclear agreement. “They wrote messages on the missiles so that we won’t be able to reap its benefits,” he said, mentioning the elite force’s testing of two ballistic missiles in March 2016, just two months after sanctions were lifted.\n\nWritten on those missiles was a message in Hebrew: “Israel must vanish from the page of time.”\n\nIt was a rare criticism of the guards’ conduct in public, which underscored the president’s frustration about Iran’s parallel, unelected bodies that act independently of his government.\n\nNone of the candidates spoke of scrapping the agreements, but two powerful conservatives, Tehran mayor Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf and hardliner Ebrahim Raisi, said that the deal had failed to bring tangible economic benefits to Iran.\n\n“Mr Rouhani promised that all sanctions would be lifted after Barjam, but there was no change on people’s tables. Did it solve the issue of recession and unemployment?” asked Raisi, who is running on a campaign of “work and dignity”.\n\nGhalibaf echoed Raisi: “What did it bring for our people? Barjam was there to improve people’s life but people say rightly that nothing has changed.”\n\nGhalibaf said the agreement only benefited the top 4% wealthiest in the society and not the remaining 96%, a concept he repeated many times during the debate, which Rouhani mocked as a copy of the US Occupy movement’s slogan “we are the 99%”.\n\nRouhani in turn asked his rivals to tell the electorate what they would do with the agreement and how they would deal with the international community.\n\n“What were you doing behind the scenes [as we were negotiating],” Rouhani asked Raisi. “Some opponents said a lot of nonsense, they followed in the footsteps of Wahhabis, Zionists and hardline Americans in their opposition to the deal … you were opposed to the deal from the beginning and when Trump took office, you were cheering that he would tear up the agreement apart.”\n\nRouhani added: “If we didn’t have [the deal], our oil exports of about two million barrels per day would be reduced to 200,000 barrels per day. People should know whether you will bring back sanctions and confrontation.”\n\nDuring the debate, Rouhani was helped by his first vice-president, Eshaq Jahangiri, who is also running, but is expected to drop out at last minute in favour of the president. Jahangiri said the nuclear deal was “one of the biggest achievements of our history” and that if it did not exist, “Iran’s exports would have halted.”\n\nJahangiri, who is allied with the reformists, has been attracting attentions since the first TV debate last week, at times stealing the show from his boss. “We need to stop another adventure in our country,” Jahangiri said. “This country cannot tolerate another tension and political novices. People should be vigilant. What sort of future do you want for your kids? Do you want restrictions or freedom? Dignity or isolation? Tensions or peace?”\n\nGhalibaf, who is emerging as Rouhani’s main challenger, attacked Rouhani on many domestic issues, seizing upon a national row involving the daughter of a government minister he alleged had smuggled clothes from Italy – a charge denied by Rouhani.\n\nRouhani highlighted social freedoms in the debate and criticised the state television for blacklisting the country’s most popular traditional singer, Mohammad-Reza Shajarian. “We need to continue the path of hope, we must not allow despair to prevail,” he said.",

Sie hat deutlich gemacht, wie wichtig das nautische und technische Wissen unserer Seeleute für die gesamte maritime Wirtschaft ist. Wenn wir jetzt in Deutschland die Rahmenbedingungen bekommen, die bei unseren europäischen Nachbarn üblich sind, dann können wir den Abwärtstrend bei der Beschäftigung deutscher Seeleute stoppen“, sagte VDR-Präsident Alfred Hartmann. „Die positiven Zusagen müssen schnell von der Bundesregierung in die notwendige Form als Gesetze und Verordnungen gebracht werden. Je schneller wir die Entscheidungen verbindlich haben, desto schneller können die Reedereien daran arbeiten, das von der Bundeskanzlerin gesetzte Ziel zu erreichen: die deutsche Flagge zu stärken und Ausbildung und Beschäftigung von deutschen Seeleuten zu unterstützen.“\n\nBundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel hatte am Montag angekündigt, dass der Lohnsteuereinbehalt für Seeleute auf Schiffen unter deutscher Flagge auf 100% angehoben und kurzfristig gesetzgeberisch umgesetzt werden solle. Außerdem sollen die Sozialversicherungsbeiträge für Seeleute – wie in Europa üblich – voll erstattet werden. Bundesverkehrsminister Alexander Dobrindt kündigte außerdem an, die Schiffsbesetzungsverordnung zeitgemäß anzupassen. Der VDR hatte vorgeschlagen, zukünftig weniger europäische Seeleute an Bord von Schiffen unter deutscher Flagge vorzuschreiben. Dies würde Reedereien von einem zusätzlichen Kostenblock entlasten und helfen, dass mehr einheimische Seeleute beschäftigt werden könnten.\n\nSchifffahrtsportolio der HSH Nordbank: Schiffe am Standort halten\n\nAm Montag hatten sich in Brüssel die öffentlichen Anteilseigner der HSH Nordbank mit der EU-Kommission darauf geeinigt, die HSH-Nordbank zukunftsfähig aufzustellen.

Wir müssen gemeinsam in den nächsten Jahren alles tun, um so viele Schiffe wie möglich am Standort zu halten“, sagte Hartmann. „Dabei darf die Bundesregierung nicht wegsehen. Denn der Verbleib der Schiffe am Standort – und damit der Arbeitsplätze und Wertschöpfung in Deutschland – hat erhebliche Auswirkungen auf die maritime Wirtschaftspolitik der Bundesregierung. Unsere Branche verfügt auch nach sieben Jahren schwerer See über Kreativität, Kompetenz und wirtschaftlichen Handlungsspielraum, um das Verschwinden eines Großteils der deutschen Handelsflotte vom Standort Deutschland gemeinsam mit der Politik zu vermeiden.“\n\n---\n\nPressefotos von Alfred Hartmann: www.reederverband.de/pressefotos\n\nInfografik zur deutschen Handelsflotte und ihrer volkswirtschaftlichen Bedeutung: http://bit.ly/Handelsflotte2015\n\nDer Verband Deutscher Reeder:\n\nDer Verband Deutscher Reeder vertritt die gemeinsamen wirtschafts- und sozialpolitischen Interessen der deutschen Reedereien auf der Ebene des Bundes und der Länder sowie gegenüber europäischen und internationalen Instanzen.

  "latent_19234": "OKLAHOMA CITY — Thunder guard Andre Roberson did a solid job slowing down James Harden on Monday in Oklahoma City’s win over the Houston Rockets.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Roberson will draw another tough assignment when he will be asked to control Toronto Raptors guard DeMar DeRozan.\n\nWhile Roberson has played high-level defense all season, his recent work on the other end is drawing the attention of Thunder coach Billy Donovan.\n\nAfter a rough start this season on the offensive end, highlighted by stagnation and an overreliance on isolation plays with Thunder newcomer Carmelo Anthony, Oklahoma City took a step forward during its current five-game winning streak.\n\nA part of that improvement was Anthony accepting his role as more of a catch-and-shoot player with Russell Westbrook handling the ball most often, but Roberson’s offensive development was a factor as well.\n\nWhile Roberson still struggles at the free-throw line and won’t consistently take open shots from outside, he is still finding ways to make plays on offense.\n\n“Instinctively, when you start to attack the basket, people are going to at least protect the rim,” Donovan said. “Somebody’s not gonna give him a layup. Now the next thing is that next pass, that next read. He’s done a really good job of that.”\n\nIn the Christmas win, Roberson locked in on Harden defensively on the last possession, not allowing a good look at a game-tying 3-pointer, then finished at the rim on the other end after Westbrook picked up a rebound and pushed the ball up the floor.\n\nThe Raptors, on the other hand, came up short at the end in their latest game. They had a six-game winning streak snapped Tuesday night with a loss at Dallas, yet they still arrive in Oklahoma City having won 12 of their past 14.\n\nOne of the biggest factors in the 98-93 defeat to the Mavericks was DeRozan’s struggles.\n\nThe All-NBA guard was just 3 of 16 from the floor for eight points. It was just the second time this season that DeRozan was held below 10 points. Over the previous six games, DeRozan averaged nearly 32 points.\n\nThe winning streak came to a disappointing end considering the Raptors were facing the team with the second-worst record in the NBA.\n\n“We’re still on Christmas break,” Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. “It’s on all of us. If we’re serious about competing for a championship, I don’t care who we play, we’ve got to come in here with the right approach.”\n\nOn the positive side, Toronto did get C.J. Miles back after the forward missed three games following a dental procedure. Miles scored three points in 10 minutes against the Mavericks, but he figures to get an increased workload quickly.\n\nCasey wasn’t much in the mood for positivity after the loss on the first night of a back-to-back.\n\n“It should,” Casey said when asked if the defeat could serve as a wake-up call for his team. “We have no right — no way should we ever look at a team’s record. If we don’t come out with a certain way, a certain style, offensively and defensively, move the ball, make our shots, it’s not like we’re going to come out and dominate anybody.”",

  "latent_19445": "Leanne Watt, an expert in the management of personality disorders affecting adults, has warned that President Donald Trump’s mental instability could have serious consequences for the country and the rest of the world. Watt gave the warning in article co-authored with Richard Painter, President George W. Bush’s former White House ethics attorney. In the article published by NBC News, Watt warned that based on the experience she has gathered over several years of treating adults with personality disorders, there could be dire consequences for the country and the whole world if Trump’s mental health condition continues to deteriorate.\n\nWatt insisted that a mental health expert does not need to personally examine a person who is showing overt signs of untreated mental illness before making conclusions about that person’s mental health status, and warning the public about it.\n\n“Recognizing unfitness in a president does not necessarily mean waiting for a physical sign or even a catastrophic event.”\n\n“Personality disorders present predictable patterns that are well documented in the medical literature,” Watt and Painter wrote in the article. “In fact, we can often find the most accurate and honest account of a public figure’s Cluster B symptoms through public records.”\n\nResponding to criticism of other mental health experts who have spoken out about Trump’s mental health in the past, the writers argued that mental health professionals have an ethical responsibility to speak up when they observe public figures exhibiting behavior that is “troubling or suspect.”\n\nThe authors argued that it is dangerous for mental health experts to wait for Trump to cause trouble or do something that leads to a catastrophe before making their observations about Trump’s personality known to the public. They added that it would be irresponsible of mental health experts to remain silent after detecting that Trump is mentally unfit to be president and that he is capable of actions that could endanger the country and the rest of the world.\n\n“Waiting for unfitness to manifest beyond the types of observable and highly predictive behavior patterns studied by psychiatrists and psychologists is, we believe, naive,” Watt and Painter wrote.\n\n“We cannot rule out the possibility that a president in a downward mental health spiral could destroy important global partnerships… and leave the U.S. vulnerable to terror attacks or war.”\n\nnull\n\nWatt is not the first mental health expert who has warned that Trump could be mentally unfit for the responsibilities of the president and commander-in-chief. Several other mental health experts have raised questions about Trump’s mental health status.\n\nRecently, a group of about 800 mental health professionals released a statement, saying they were concerned that Trump’s mental health condition makes him unfit to be president and commander-in-chief.\n\nSeveral former government officials have also voiced their concerns about Trump’s mental health.\n\nPeter Wehner, a former adviser to President George W. Bush, recently said he was concerned that Trump “is psychologically and emotionally not well.”\n\nDuring a CNN panel discussion with Trump’s biographer, Michael D’Antonio, Wehner said that Trump is not “stable.”\n\n“This is a president who has a disordered mind. He’s impulsive and vindictive.”\n\nnull\n\nWehner cited Trump’s recent public comments about General John Kelly’s son and President Obama’s response to his death. He also recalled Trump’s confrontation with the Khan family and Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.).\n\n“This is a person who is just not in command of his emotions and feelings and actions.”\n\nTrump also came under criticism when he told the widow of the U.S. soldier killed in Niger that her husband “knew what he signed up for.”\n\n[Featured Image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images]",
  "latent_19558": "A rhetorical device which props up feminist ideology by making it easy to impose a state of collective guilt upon half the human race, namely the male half. Upon closer examination, we find that 'patriarchy' as a concept is either A.) Coherent only when too narrowly defined to be broadly useful, or B.) INcoherent when it IS broadly enough defined to be broadly useful.Feminist ideologues promote the idea of patriarchy nonetheless, because they are banking upon the average person's lack of analytical discrimination -- rather like slipping a 'mind rape drug' into the punchbowl of common discourse. You might wake up with a weird feeling, but you have no idea that you've been screwed.When radical feminists talk about 'patriarchy', it is actually a code word for Male Power of ANY sort whatsoever. So long as any man on earth has anything that could even vaguely be described as power (up to and especially the power of self-control ), they wll say that patriarchy still exists, and that feminism's work is not finished.

  "latent_19620": "By Jasmine Turner | January 8, 2019 at 5:39 PM EST - Updated January 8 at 6:31 PM\n\nRICHMOND, VA (WWBT) - For almost 20 years, volunteers with the Shepherd's Center in Chesterfield have worked to ensure adults 60 and older can safely get to medical appointments, the pharmacy, grocery store and other locations in Chesterfield, Colonial Heights, Chester and Hopewell.\n\n\"They're getting to stay home longer because we are helping them remain independent,\" said Pam Crandol, who has been volunteering since 2004. \"If they didn't get to the doctors to see their physicians, they would end up on the hospital or nursing facility.\"\n\nThis year the organization is facing the challenge of losing volunteers. Executive Director Susan McCammon says some drivers are retiring from volunteering, and others are not able to return to driving due to medical issues.\n\n\"If someone can spare a couple hours or week, it's just an amazing mission - and the generation we're serving now is the Greatest Generation. They are so amazing and grateful,\" McCammon said.\n\nThe 83 drivers they once had, has dropped to about 60. The organizations serve more than 600 people, ages 60 and over. So it is becoming a challenge to ensure transportation for all enrolled in the program.\n\n\"We try to get everybody's availability and layer it, and keep the bathtub full of drivers based on their availability. When one of that shifts and something happens to that critical mass, you need help, and we need help,\" she said.\n\nMcCammon said in 2018, drivers logged more than 40,000 miles in their own cars, using their own money to pay for gas.\n\n\"It's a mission from the heart,\" said McCammon.\n\nThe organization also provides a minor home repair service called, \"HandyHands.\" In 2018, they made 112 minor home repair visits to help those on fixed incomes and living in their own homes. The Shepherd's Center was also able to offer 75 educational classes resulting in 384 low-cost class registrations and provided 1,400 low cost lunches to those attending the Luncheon Forum.\n\nPam Crandol began volunteering with the organization while still working as an educator with Chesterfield County Public Schools. After she retired, she started volunteering close to full-time, working as a driver, as well as helping with the organization's Adventures in Learning program. The program allows other seniors to continue to engage their minds and stay active in their communities.\n\n\"People are so happy to see us. Because they're home so much, they don't get out,\" said Crandol. \"They're so happy to see a face, so happy to see someone that's glad to take them somewhere and do something for them, it makes their day.\"\n\nMaggie Twilley is one of the people who says her day is made when someone arrives to pick her up. She was among the founding board, and though she doesn't volunteer to drive, through the years she has volunteered with other programs in the organization.\n\n\"The more drivers they have, the more people they can help. It's deeply appreciated,\" said Twilley.\n\nIf you are interested in volunteering, call (804) 706-6689 and talk with the staff about the opportunities.\n\nCopyright 2019 WWBT. All rights reserved.",

  "latent_19681": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Oct. 5, 2015 — Here’s the problem as it is presented by the media: We have 300 million guns in this country.\n\nSome of those guns are rifles, some are handguns and some are shotguns. Americans, the vast majority of them law-abiding, own those guns. They use them mainly for hunting, self protection and to protect their families.\n\nAlong come psychopaths and sociopaths who assemble arsenals, more guns than anyone would need. They decide — for reasons few of us will ever understand — to shoot as many law-abiding adults and innocent children to death as they can.\n\nGuns, gun laws and the Second Amendment\n\nThen comes the knee-jerk reaction: Misguided individuals want to take all of the guns away. All 300 million of them.\n\nThis poses a problem: Who is going to take those guns away from those law-abiding citizens?\n\nGun owners may have lost a loved one or want to protect their family from the unthinkable. These are eventualities that become thinkable after every mass shooting. It seems that each day brings news of innocents killed by lunatics, and that news evokes fear. It also stokes the American instinct to hang onto those guns for protection.\n\nSome people advocate for the surrender of all guns or of some guns, or of putting guns under government regulation. But we will never surrender our guns. Surrender doesn’t solve the problem, and we don’t trust the government to do a good job even if they come up with a solution for gun violence.\n\nGun control solves nothing. Look at Chicago. If there were no guns, we would be having the same discussion about knives, IEDs and blunt objects.\n\nPlease note that this article did not report that innocents were killed by a gun. That would absolve the perpetrator from responsibility for the crime. Innocents were killed by crazy people who happened to buy, borrow and steal guns. If they had bludgeoned the victim to death with an axe, a claw hammer or a rolling pin, the victims would be just as dead, and we would be dealing with the same tragedies.\n\nThis fight is all about guns.\n\nIs there a gun problem? Americans own more per capita than any other nation in history. Deaths from guns are higher in the United States than the rest of our world, but here are some statistics that place that stat in its place: Two-thirds of the gun deaths in this country are the result of suicide. That’s right. They killed themselves, and the gun was merely the vehicle they chose to leave the world of the living. It appears to be an efficient way to die. Over 90 percent of suicides by gun result in the demise of the intended victim. That leaves the rest of us to worry about protecting ourselves from gun deaths by crime and mayhem.\n\nGuns are an American tradition.\n\nWe fought off the English and sent them packing. We created a nation and protected our families with the best guns we could find. We hunt for food and sport. Some of the best memories of hunting season come from bagging a buck or finding food for the Thanksgiving table.\n\nFor most of us, gun ownership is non-negotiable.\n\nThe second amendment to the Constitution places gun ownership into the permanency of American life:\n\nA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\n\nThere are no explanations to be made here: Americans have the right to own guns and to have them in their homes. We are allowed to use them at all lawful times, whether we are providing venison for the family table or defending ourselves against crazies, criminals or foreign invaders.\n\nIt is our right, and it shall not be infringed.\n\nWhen President Obama and other well-intentioned practitioners of distorted reality choose to use gun control as a reason to get in front of the cameras, look at it for what it is: politics and nothing more. If the president truly wanted to address gun control, he would go back to his hometown, Chicago, and talk to the mayor, his former chief of staff, and figure out how their city has the highest rate of gun deaths in the nation while having more gun control laws on the books.\n\nGuns, Not Mental Illness\n\nWe are in a national discussion of guns, of blame and of what to do about the problem.\n\nThe solution is complicated, and our history as Americans has contributed little to that solution. Guns have been the way Americans have resolved disputes, but rarely in our history have they been utilized to resolve disputes since the end of the Civil War. The Hatfields and the McCoys tried. That feud between neighbors did not end well. There have been some notable massacres between criminals and criminals and between criminals and the law. For the most part, the rest of us have used guns for the purposes they were intended.\n\nGun control will always be on the national agenda of political issues, and politicians will waste our time and attention by debating it. That brings us back to the original question:\n\nIf they legislate our right to bear arms away from us, who will be knocking at the door to take our guns away?",
  "latent_19723": "They introduced themselves as Rangers, and America heard from two women who have made military history, as the first female soldiers ever to earn a Ranger tab.\n\nCapt. Kristen Griest and 1st Lt. Shaye Haver, both West Point graduates, finished Ranger School earlier this week. On Thursday, they fielded a barrage of questions as they sat on a media panel to discuss their experience at the notoriously tough school.\n\n“It’s probably going to be one of the highlights of my life,” said Lieutenant Haver.\n\nCaptain Griest said that the moment was a years-long dream. Since she was a young cadet at West Point, she had trained, along with peers and mentors, for the possibility that one day there might be just such an opening for women.\n\nBeside them on the panel, their male Ranger buddies spoke repeatedly about initial skepticism that turned to deep admiration – and the ways in which the women more than shouldered the load for the team, again and again.\n\nOne male Ranger student recalled a 12-mile ruck march, in which the women, with 50-pound packs, finished well ahead of many of the males.\n\nThe rest of the males nodded in knowing agreement. “They beat me,” one student on the panel piped up.\n\nThey acknowledged, too, some initial doubts about whether women could make it physically, whether they could pull their weight.\n\n“I was pretty skeptical,” said 2nd Lt. Michael Janowski, who was Haver’s Ranger “battle buddy” in the course’s mountains and the swamps.\n\nHe knew she was tough from their time together at West Point. “I went to school with Shaye and I knew she was a physical stud,” he said. But even so, “I was skeptical of whether she could handle it.”\n\nThat was, he said, until they got to the mountains and had to do a long march. Lieutenant Janowski was the gunner for a 320 grenade launcher in that mission. “I had a lot of weight on me, and I was struggling,” he said.\n\n“So I stopped and asked at the halfway point, ‘Hey, can anyone help take some of this weight?’ ”\n\nHis fellow Ranger students responded with “a lot of deer-in-the-headlights looks,” he said. “A lot of people were like, ‘I can’t take any more weight.’ ”\n\nExcept, he said, for one person. “Shaye was the only one who volunteered to take that weight. She took the weight off me, she carried it for the last half of that ruck.”\n\nThat act “literally saved me,” he said, looking at her on the panel beside him. “I probably wouldn’t be sitting here right now if it wasn’t for Shaye.”\n\nFrom that point on, “No more skepticism,” he said.\n\nHaver said that the women arrived at the school with their own version of skepticism.\n\n“I think that we ourselves came to Ranger School skeptical, with our guards up,” said Haver, who is an Apache helicopter pilot. Not “with a chip on our shoulders,” but braced for “the haters, the naysayers.”\n\nBeing a good teammate was their No. 1 priority, to prove that “we could be trusted like everyone else, whether it was on a patrol or to carry something heavy,” she added. “Every single time we accomplished something, it gave us that extra foothold in being part of a team.”\n\nWhen she and Griest get their Ranger tabs Friday, “I can say without a doubt that the team that I’m graduating with tomorrow accepts me completely as a Ranger, and I couldn’t be more proud and humbled by the experience.”\n\nGriest’s battle buddy shared his own story about skepticism.\n\n“I was I guess ignorant and assumed that because they were women it would be harder for them,” 2nd Lt. Zachary Hagner said.\n\nBut then he saw the two women in action. “Once I got to know [Griest], I was in no way skeptical anymore. She completely changed my mind, along with Ranger Haver.”\n\nHe recalled his own dark-of-night experience, when he had been shouldering the load of a SAW machine gun for three days.\n\nAt that point, “I was like, OK, well, I need somebody to take this for me.”\n\nHe went to “every single person just in a line – no order.” Nine men “were like, ‘I’m too broken, I’m too tired,’ ” he said. “She, just as broken and tired, took it from me with almost excitement. I thought she was crazy for that,” he added, to laughter. “But she’s just motivated. That’s how she is.”\n\nUpon hearing the effusive comments of her Ranger buddies, Griest joked, “It’s really a relief to hear that.”\n\nShe had long dreamed of coming to Ranger School, since she was a West Point cadet and a mentor invited her to be part of his infantry training program if she could meet the physical standards.\n\nAt the time she couldn’t, but she continued to train. “I tried to do as much as I could,” she said. “And then some,” to get in shape. Still, by the time she could enter Ranger School, she had doubts. “Coming to Ranger School, my big concern was that I might not be able to carry as much weight, or meet the same standard.”\n\nBut she did, and what kept her going through her darkest hours was a drive not to disappoint anyone – her Ranger buddies who had placed trust in her, and the female soldiers who will one day follow in her footsteps, should Army leadership agree to open the school to any woman who can meet its standards.\n\n“I was thinking of future generations of women – that I would like them to have that opportunity, so I had that pressure on myself,” said Griest, who is an Airborne-qualified military police officer (MP).\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

  "latent_19825": "On Thursday night, Purdue heads into the GMC Dodge Crisler Center to face some formidable Wolverines. They do wear blue and yellow (maize, my ass), but as far as I know they aren't actually mutants with vicious retractable claws. They might as well be, however, with the way they've been carving up opposing defenses this season. Here are some observations:\n\n1 They're sort of like this year's Missouri.\n\nRemember Missouri? They tore through the Big 12 last year with a juggernaut offense boosted by white-hot shooting, a lot of threes, and a low turnover rate. Their defense wasn't great, but they did keep opponents off the free throw line. And they played a guard- and wing-heavy lineup with only 7 players seeing significant minutes. And everyone was like, \"OMG, I bet Painter wishes he had gone to Missouri when he had the chance.\" And then they lost to Norfolk State in the first round of the tourney. Whoops.\n\nWell, most of what I just said is true about Michigan as well. In fact the numbers are ridiculously similar:\n\n2P% 3P% 3PA/FGA TO% % bench minutes 2013 Michigan 56.8 39.8 37.0 15.1 22.5 2012 Missouri 57.0 39.8 37.9 15.4 21.1\n\nWhat to expect: The \"small ball\" incarnation of this year's Boilers will probably have to continue. Sure, we'll see a little bit of Hale, Lawson, or Carroll, but with the exception of Hammons, I suspect Painter will use his bigs surgically. One also wonders if he'll try to take advantage of our relative depth by turning up the defensive pressure and/or getting out and running a bit more than usual.\n\n2 They are REALLY good at some things.\n\nWhile Ohio State was fairly good in every four factors category, Michigan's statistical profile shows two massive strengths on offense, and two on defense. On offense, they shoot well, with an effective field goal percentage (EFG) of 57.9, #2 in the nation. They also limit turnovers (15.1%, also #2 in the nation). On defense they clean the glass (24.8%, #3 in the nation) and keep opponents off the free throw line (Opponent free throw rate of 21.1%, yet again #2 in the nation). In all other categories, they're fairly average.\n\nThese numbers suggest that they want their games to be about who can shoot better. Their low turnover rate means that they can get a shot up nearly every time down the floor, and their high EFG suggests that they'll make a lot of them. On defense they don't force many turnovers, but their solid defensive rebounding means that they're willing to give their opponents one (and only one) shot per possession. And when you're the second-best shooting team in the land, getting a roughly equal number of shots with your opponent usually means victory.\n\nWhat to expect: To beat Michigan this year, you're probably going to have to negate their massive strengths in at least two of the categories I mentioned above. To take the one and only example so far, Ohio State beat them by forcing a bad shooting night (EFG of 44.7%) and creating a lot of turnovers (21.7% of UM possessions). Based on our strengths, it seems that keeping their EFG low and getting a lot of offensive rebounds might be our path. For that reason I suspect you might see us prizing offensive boards a bit more than usual. And that's where the small ball lineup might hurt us. For a wing, Rapheal Davis is decent on the offensive glass, but other than that, our offensive rebounding relies on our bigs.\n\n3 They have a freshman named Spike Albrecht.\n\nSure Glenn Robinson, Nik Stauskas, and Mitch McGary are good. But are they named Spike Albrecht? No. That name is perfect. Like the unholy offspring of a junkyard dog and a Renaissance artist.\n\nWhat to expect: Albrecht comes in before a media timeout to give Burke a breather. During a stoppage in play, he makes a brilliant woodcut of the Fab Five on the Crisler Center floor, then circles around three times, lies down, and gnaws on an old bone until the next deadball.\n\nPrediction:\n\nOne thing I like about tempo-free stats is that they help you see in a bit more detail what makes good teams good. And then when they lose, you can see how someone managed to beat them. For example, last year Norfolk State beat Missouri by defying probability and simply outshooting them. Purdue is not going to outshoot Michigan tonight. But our recent improvement in that department as well as our FG% defense suggests that we can keep the shooting battle fairly close. Then the question is whether we can win enough other smaller battles (on the boards and with turnovers) to piece together a victory. For my part, I doubt it. I expect a Michigan State style game (minus the second half foul avalanche)--that is, a game where we're often trailing slightly but manage keep it close throughout.\n\nMichigan 75, Purdue 66\n\nPS. I hope I'm wrong! (I said this last time and it totally worked, so superstition demands that I say it again.)",
  "latent_20000": "Hi! I'm Lee White, and I need your help bringing a book of my artwork to life.\n\nAfter illustrating more than 20 published children's books for the big guns in New York (including Penguin Putnam, Scholastic, Candlewick, and more), I wanted to share some of the work I do for myself, when I am not busy trying to keep my art directors happy : )\n\nOver the past 5 years or so, I have put together quite a collection of images and thought it would be fun to share in a hardcover book. People always ask me about the inspiration behind my work so this seemed like a great place to share that with you. Many of these images can be found on my website at www.leewhiteillustration.com\n\nThe book will be called, “Illumination: The Art of Lee White.” The title comes from my most liked image ever, the fellow on a bicycle with a good bottle of wine and a little illumination from above. Here are the details:\n\n• Illumination will be a hardcover coffee table book that showcases all my personal work over the past 5 years or so, when I first started painting in watercolor.\n\n• Illumination will contain beautiful, high resolution images of the finished paintings, along with the stories behind the images, the preliminary sketches, and all sorts of other fun stuff.\n\n• Illumination will be 8x10 inches and 124 pages long.\n\n• Illumination will include lots of kitty cats!\n\nSpeaking of cats, here's a quick painting demo!:\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with\n\nsound 00:00 00:00\n\nOne of the things I really wanted to do with this book is highlight the process of making the finished paintings. Many ugly sketches are explored and discarded along the way. I like sharing this process with people. It shows that there is a \"building\" phase that images go through. Hazy, rough ideas are cleaned up, polished, and finally painted as a finished piece. I wanted to invite you inside my studio to see how this all happens.\n\nAnd I wanted to share who all these characters are in the paintings. What are they doing and where did they come from? This is the storytelling aspect of illustration that I love exploring in my work.\n\nAll the artwork is already made. The next step is to design the book, and write all the copy.\n\nBooks are expensive to make. What I'm asking for in this campaign barely covers the cost of printing the book and shipping it out. There are also other fees associated with it, like storing 3,000 books, shipping supplies, etc.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the costs (assuming 250 backers):\n\nBook printing and shipping: $8,412\n\nStorage: $200\n\nKickstarter fee: $968.13\n\nCredit card payment fe: $580.88\n\nPackaging: $250\n\nShipping: $805\n\nHandling (by fulfillment center): $312.50\n\nOther expenses: $250\n\nTotal: $11,579\n\nIf I am lucky enough to exceed my funding goal of $11,579, I will use that money to fund more copies of the book. The price I'm campaigning for is the bare minimum order, but it's much more cost effective if I order more copies during the printing process.\n\nAlso, I'll be adding stretch goals to make the book even nicer. Adding a spot varnish, dust jacket, and maybe even deckled edges would be super cool!\n\nKickstarter fundraising: October 26 to November 28 2016\n\nDesign and pre-press: October and November 2016\n\nSend to printer: December 2016\n\nProofing: January 2017\n\nShipping to fulfillment center: February 2017\n\nShipping to backers: March 2017\n\nNote: I will try as hard as I can to make this happen faster, but this is a pretty realistic timeline for a book like this. Some of the children's books I've worked on took longer than a year! I will definitely keep you updated along the way : )\n\nIf you found this page, you probably already know a little about me, but just in case, here is some background:\n\nI have illustrated a over 20 children's books, including What Are You Glad About? What Are You Mad About? and The Lost Track of Time. His latest, Emma and the Whale, will be released in March 2017.\n\nI have also done commercial work for various clients, including Marks & Spencer, Amazon, Laika, United Airlines, Verizon, Disney and National Geographic. He is represented by Rodeen Literary Management and Spinning Yarn Illustration Agency.\n\nMy personal work is shown at various galleries and art fairs throughout the year.\n\nI teach all of my watercolor secrets via the Society of Visual Storytelling, an online art school for artists of all skill levels.\n\nI graduated with honors from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, and earned an MFA in illustration, also with honors, from the University of Hartford in Connecticut.\n\nI live with my wife, little boy and grumpy old cat in a 100-year-old house in Portland, Oregon.\n\nFor those who are not familiar with how Kickstarter works, the idea is to help fund a project on the front end, in return you get various rewards (and my eternal gratitude!), depending on how much you pledge.\n\nThe whole purpose of this campaign is to fund the printing of 2,000 hardcover books, but the rewards include some fun extras, including:\n\n• your name printed in the back of the book as a thank you\n\n• a digital version of the book\n\n• a painting demo video\n\n• 4 different signed 8x10 prints only available to Kickstarter backers\n\n• original paintings at less than retail\n\nI hope there is something here for everyone who is interested in my work!\n\nHere's a visual breakdown of the different Reward Tiers:\n\nLevel 1 (MAKIN' THA' LIST) $10\n\n• Your name printed in the back of the book as a thank you\n\nLevel 2 (DIGITAL DELIGHT) $20\n\n• Digital version of the book\n\n• Your name printed in the back of the book as a thank you\n\nLevel 3 (LIGHTS!

  "latent_20153": "Good evening everybody. Sombreros, berets, comedy moustaches, onion necklaces and other lazy national stereotypes at the ready for tonight's Guardian minute-by-minute coverage of this Group A encounter at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane, 1,229m above sea level.\n\nTo put that in perspective, this is the fourth highest of the 10 World Cup finals venues. To put that in even more perspective, Paris is 130m above sea level at its highest point, compared to Mexico City at 2,240m. I make that advantage Mexico before a Jabulani has been kicked ... 5mph faster than it would be at sea level.\n\nDiego Forlan drove Uruguay top of this group last night with their emphatic win over hosts South Africa, which means defeat for either of these two sides would leave them in all sorts of bother, leaving them three points off the pace with one match to play and relying on other results, goal difference, other teams not conspiring against them by colluding and all the usual last-round-of-the-group-stage shenanigans. But you're clever and already know all that, so you don't need me to tell you.\n\nIf you're struggling to recall how either or both these sides fared in their opening matches because you're in the early stages of senility, your synapses are fried through years of alcohol and/or drug abuse, or some other reason, here are David Hytner's report on France's dull opener against Uruguay and Paul Wilson's account of Mexico's opener against South Africa, for your reading pleasure.\n\nKick-off is at 7.30pm. I'll be back at 7pm or so to bring you all the team news and pre-match build-up.\n\nOkey dokey, for anyone who's heard about them, but never seen them in action, here's RTE's answer to the Match Of The Day Lineker, Hanson, Shearer and Dixon axis of tedium in action, picking over the bones of the Republic of Ireland's exit from the World Cup qualifying play-off at the hands of France. From the left: Bill O'Herlihy and pundits John Giles, Graeme Souness and Eamon Dunphy. This is Dunphy in comparatively mellow mode. Here is in slightly less mellow mode after seeing Sven-Goran Eriksson being interviewed by Garth Crooks after England struggled to beat Ecuador four years ago.\n\nFrance: Lloris, Sagna, Gallas, Abidal, Evra, Govou, Toulalan,\n\nDiaby, Malouda, Ribery, Anelka.\n\nSubs: Mandanda, Reveillere, Planus, Gourcuff, Cisse, Gignac, Henry, Squillaci, Diarra, Valbuena, Clichy.\n\nMexico: Perez, Osorio, Moreno, Rodriguez, Salcido, Marquez,\n\nGiovani, Juarez, Torrado, Vela, Franco.\n\nSubs: Ochoa, Barrera, Castro, Blanco, Aguilar, Hernandez, Guardado, Magallon, Torres, Bautista, Medina, Michel.\n\nReferee: Khalil Al Ghamdi (Saudi Arabia)\n\nOn yellow cards and will miss next match if they get booked France: Jeremy Toulalan, Patrice Evra, Franck Ribery. Mexico: Efrain Juarez, Gerrardo Torrado.\n\nMatch pointers with which to bore your fellow drinkers (if you're in the pub and reading this on an iPhone or Blackberry, for whatever reason)\n\n• Mexico have never won a World Cup match against any of the seven countries that have won the competition (11 defeats and five draws)\n\n• France are unbeaten in their last eight finals games, although they have drawn half of those matches\n\n• Mexico have scored at least one goal in each of their last nine World Cup games against European sides\n\n• Nicolas Anelka has failed to have a shot on target in 384 consecutive minutes for the French side\n\n• Mexico have made it to the knockout stage in their previous five World Cup participations\n\nBrian O Donnchadha writes: \"I've been living in the states now for just over four years and I was finally beginning to forget what craggy-face Dunphy looked like,\" he says. \"Thanks for undoing years of hard work.\" Living in the States with a name like that? Rather you than me. I'm going to go out on a limb and guess the natives struggle with it.\n\nNot long now: The teams emerge from the tunnel, led by the referee who picks the ball of its plinth. I remain cautiously optimistic that one of them will forget to do that some night and then have to scurry back to get it hoping nobody will notice. Alternatively, it would be amusing if whoever it is whose job it is to place it on the plinth decided, for a laugh, to put a rugby ball or a nice cake there instead. Or glue the ball down to it. What are they going to do on the night of the final, when they'll need two plinths: one for the World Cup trophy and one for the official match-ball? These are the things I lie awake at night thinking and worrying about.\n\n1 min: Mexico win the toss on a windy night in Polokwane and Elect to play from right to left. France kick off. Both sets of players line up in the colours you'd expect them to.\n\n2 min: Mexico concede a free-kick not far inside the Mexico half for a Carlos Salcido bodycheck on Franckl Ribery. The ball is launched high into the night sky towards the Mexican penalty area. They clear their lines.\n\n3 min: Mexico gallop clear on the break, the ball is played down the left channel into the path of Giovani Dos Santos, who shoots across the face of goal only to see the ball hit the foot of the post and bounce back into play. Wouldn't have counted anyway - he was offside.\n\n5 min: Mexico striker Guillermo Franco picks up the first yellow card of the night, either for a foul on Abou Diaby or for standing in front of the ball so FVrance couldn't take a quick free-kick. He's furious with the referee. Nic Anelka blasts the ball over the bar from the edge of the final third.\n\n7 min: In quick succession, both goalkeepers are forced to race into action to catch through-balls being chased down by strikers. Hugo Lloris was probably given most to think about.\n\n8 min: From outside the centre-circle inside his own half, Rafael Marquez dinks a beautifully weighted long ball over the top of the France defence. It bounces and sits up beautifully for Carlos Vela to either try his luck with a diagonal volley or square for two team-mates - Franco and Salcido - sprinting into the middle. The Arsenal striker opts to shoot but blasts the ball high over the bar.\n\n10 min: It's been an entertaining opening 10 minutes, despite the best attempts of the referee, who seems a bit whistle-happy and has already had words with Mexican full-back Ricardo Osorio, telling him to pull his sleeves down. Are referees even allowed do that?\n\n12 min: For Mexico, Franco turns and shoots over the bar from the edge of the penalty area. Moments previously, France had gone close when Malouda tried to pull the ball back for Ribery in the Mexico penalty, only for a defender to make a crucial interception. There was somebody nipping at Malouda's ankles in a crowded penalty area - if he'd gone to ground he might well have got a penalty.\n\n14 min: France win a free-kick about 40 yards from the Mexico goal, in line with the right hand side of the penalty area. They try a training ground move that involves Ribery peeling off the edge of the defensive wall, picking up a short pass then whipping the ball across the face of goal from the right. It's fractionally too high for Abou Diaby at the far post.\n\n16 min: It's real end-to-end stuff here, which means I'm struggling to find time to tell you anything about how France have lined up. They're playing a 4-3-3, with Ribery in the hole behind Anelka, and Malouda in his preferred position on the left of the front bank of three, rather than the middle bank of three where Raymond Domenech has been playing him in recent matches.\n\n19 min: For Mexico, Carlos Salcido tries his luck from just outside the penalty area. He pulls a low daisy-cutter a couple of feet wide of the right upright.\n\n19 min: Mexico win a free-kick in the right channel for an Evra foul on Giovani. It's within shooting range.\n\n20 min: This ref is being a real nitpicky pain in the proverbials. He accuses the Marquez and/or Dos Santos of moving the ball a couple of feet forward from where their free-kick should be taken and insists they put it back. I don't think either of them had bothered trying to steal a couple of feet. After all that palaver, Giovani Dos Santos blasts it into the wall.\n\n23 min: Florent Malouda wins a corner for France off Ricardo Osorio, whose sleeves remain down. Ribery plays it low and shortish to Sagna, receives it back and then crosses it in from a better angle. Rodriguez heads clear with Anelka lurking.\n\n25 min: Jeremy Toulalan sends a wonderful outswinger of a cross in from the right touchline. On the edge of the six-yard box, Florent Malouda leaps highest - really high, in fact - but mistimed his jump and failed to make contact.\n\n27 min: Sprinting down the left touchline with the ball at his feet, Mexican winger Carlos Salcido cuts inside Sagna with a nutmeg, then advances on goal. William Gallas backs off him, allowing him a free shot on goal. He shoots straight at Hugo Lloris who'd come off his line to narrow the angle. The danger averted, Lloris gives Gallas a rollocking for leaving him so exposed.\n\n29 min: Rafael Marquez tries to find Dos Santos with another ball over the French backline. Close, but no cigar. Mexico striker Carlos Vela goes down and is then helped off with what looks like hamstring-twang - his World Cup is almost certainly over. Mexico play on with 10 men for the itme being.\n\n30 min: Mexico substitution: Vela off, Pablo Barrera on. France win a corner from which nothing come. After half an hour, France have enjoyed the better of an entertaining nil-niller, but certainly aren't having it all their own way.\n\n32 min: Mexico's substitute almost has an immediate impact. After more good work in his station out on the left touchline, Salcido drops a marvellous cross into the corridor of uncertainty between goalkeeepr and defence. Lloris rushes off his line to punch clear, but the ball ricochets off Barrera's head, loops back from whence it came and drops this much over the bar. That was inches away from being an incredibly lucky opener.\n\n35 min: For Mexico, Gerrardo Torrado tries a shot from 35 yards out. Some lucky punter sitting in the gods behind the goal gets a nice souvenir to bring home.\n\n37 min: Free-kick for France, 35 or so yards out, a little left of centre. Ribery shoots into the wall, where Torrado blocks with his face.\n\n38 min: Unlike in some other matches, you can actually hear some bogstandard stadium noise over the drone of the vuvuzelas. Chanting, the draught generated by Mexican waves and the stadium announcer. \"He sounds tremendous,\" declares Sean Welch, (yes that Sean Welch ... y'know, the former bass player with The Beautiful South). \"Exactly like James Earl Jones playing God on The Simpsons.\"\n\n40 min: Marvellous work from Franco, who despite lying on the ground outside the French penalty manages to hook a bouncing ball towards Dos Santos. Under pressure from Evra, he sends a low drive fizzing wide of the right upright.\n\n43 min: \"When the ref told the Mexican player to pull his sleeves down was that his way of telling him to stop trying so hard?\" asks Ian Copestake.\n\n44 min: \"A player got told off for having his sleeves rolled up you say?\" asks Joe Bentley. \"That's a slippery slope. What next? Yellow cards for slouching? Ties becoming part of the kit? The beautiful game is moving in dangerous direction here.\"\n\n44 min-and-a-bit: Nicolas Anelka tries a shot from distance but it deflects off Francisco Rodriguez, whose intercession takes the sting off it.\n\n44+2 min: As Mexico gallop clear on the counter-attack, James Earl Jones (it's remarkable - listen out on the highlights) announces there'll be two minutes of injury-time. Jeremy Toulalan cynically hauls down Guillermo Franco and gets a yellow card for his troubles. He'll miss France's match against South Africa.\n\nHalf-time\n\nCelebrity spot: I just went out for a breath of fresh air (OK, a smoke) and had to walk through the scrum of attendees at a photography exhibition launch in the front parlour of the Guardian office. And bedad who was there looking brown as a berry in a nice blue summer dress but TV presenter and former Boddington's girl Melanie Sykes. She's looking well. And this minute-by-minute report is turning into a copy of Heat magazine.\n\nHalf-time emails: \"Barry, surely your attempt to introduce Eamon Dunphy can't be complete without his gloriously bitter summation of Roy Keane's career following Keane's departure from Man Utd,\" writes Fionnan Johnson.\n\n\"Please tell Mr. Copstake that it depends on what part of the world you are from,\" writes Jesualdo Ferreira. \"Here in Portugal we tell our young people to roll up their sleeves and put up their socks. Over the border in Spain they say 'pull your socks down and tear off your sleeves'. I was talking to chap from North Korea and he said they say 'Put your sleeve cuffs down and put your socks on your hands.' I also heard that the Greeks do very bad thing with their socks! Funny old world.\"\n\nSecond half: France substitution: Gignac on, Nic Anelka on. They need to make a substitution because they've created very little. France win a free kick within range for Franck Ribery, well right of centre. Ribery dinks it over the wall towards the edge of the six-yard box and a Mexican hacks clear.\n\n47 min: \"On RTE, Ronnie Whelan and Eamon Dunphy just disected the French performance, showing that Gallas, Gouvou and the others want to be at home and are not breaking past a jog,\" writes Paul Reynolds. \"The players have no interest according to the lads and they say Domenech has zero influence.\"\n\n48 min: Two yellow cards in quick succession, both for Mexicans. Full back Moreno for a shove on Malouda, followed by right-winger Juarez for a foul on Abou Diaby.\n\n49 min: Mexico win a free-kick right of centre, close enough to goal for Marquez or Dos Santos to have a pop.\n\n50 min: Another training ground move. Dos Santos sprints past the left-hand side of the French wall to the touchline, Marquez drills the ball towards him and the Spurs player sends in a cross. It's too low and flat for any of his team-mates to get near it.\n\n52 min: \"Dunphy's finest hour was his character assassination of Terry Venables,\" writes Hugh Collins. \"Gary Lineker would rather slit his own face than express opinions this strong on any subject.\"\n\n53 min: Malouda picks up the ball on the right flank, cuts inside and advances on goal before unleashing a right-footed surface-to-air effort from the edge of the penalty area. In the Mexico goal, Oscar Perez is forced to tip the ball over. Nothing comes from the corner.\n\n55 min: Mexico substitution: Javier Hernandez on, Efrain Juarex off. From the exact same position as Malouda shot moments previously, Franck Ribery stings Perez's palms with a left-footed rasper. The goalkeeper puts the ball out for a corner, from which nothing comes.\n\n56 min: \"Even funnier than Eamonn Dunphy and co is the RTE mickey-take on their Apres Match program,\" writes M Turpie. \"Here is a send-up of Dunphy and new boy Didi Hamann.\"\n\n58 min: Mexico win a free-kick on the edge of the final third. Dos Santos tries to swing it into the far post, but succeeds only in sending the ball flying high over the bar.\n\n59 min: Mexico have a huge incentive to win this match. If they do they'll be level with Uruguay on four points, which would enable both teams to play out a draw and guarantee their berths in the knockout stages. Of course France have a huge incentive to win this match too - making sure the scenario outlined above isn't played out.\n\n61 min: Mexico substitution: Cuauhtemoc Blanco, aged 72, on, Guillermo Franco off. Mexico are turning the screw here - they're bossing the game. France are being over-run in midfield and Andre-Pierre Gignac hasn't had a kick since coming on at half-time.\n\nGOAL! Mexico 1-0 France (Hernandez) SWith his back to goal, Hernandez plays the ball back to Marquez on the halfway line, turns and sprints towards the France goal. Marquez dinks a beautifully weighted pass over the top for the substitute to run on to. He's directly in line with the static defence when the ball is played: onside. His first touch is marvellous, bringing him clean through on goal with the ball at his feet. He takes it right and wide of Lloris, slots it into the empty net and wheels away in celebration. That is a marvellous goal from the new Manchester United recruit.\n\n66 min: France free-kick in the Mexico left-back position - Ribery curls the ball into the arms of Mexico goalkeeper Oscar Perez.\n\n68 min: France are staring into the abyss here - lose this and any chance they have of avoiding a humiliating exit in the group stages is minimal. They'll have been cheering that goal in the saloons of Guadalajara, Mexico City, Tijuana and Dublin.\n\n70 min: France substitution: Sidney Govou, who has had a shocker, off. Marseille's attacking midfielder Mathieu Valbuena replaces him. Thierry Henry remains anchored to the bench, while on the touchline, Raymond Domenech remains poker-faced.\n\n72 min: I can't see France getting back into this. Half their players aren't trying a leg, while the few who are creating little or nothing. Their fans deserve better. Heck, Ireland's fans deserve better. Malouda's been their stand-out player and he's probably only playing well out of spite.\n\n73 min: Gignac shoots high and wide from outside the penalty area.\n\n75 min: \"A roar has gone up in our quiet carriage of the 20:38 from Sheffield to London as everyone refreshed their mobile internet pages (no wifi) and found on entering Chesterfield that France were losing,\" writes Paul Mason, who appears not to have considered the fact that such scenes of jubilation invariably ensue whenever any train arrives at Chesterfield. It's a very nice place and has a nice church with a crooked spire.\n\nPENALTY FOR MEXICO! Pablo Barrero skins Patrice Evra down the right flank and gets tripped by Eric Abidal in the penalty area. The ref points straight to the spot.\n\nGOAL! Mexico 2-0 France (Blanco 79) The elderly substitute takes a massive run-up and blasts the ball low and to Lloris's left.\n\n79 min: Sorry. His left, Lloris's right.\n\n80 min: That was remarkable, Evra appeared not to give a hoot as Barrero sauntered past him, leaving Abidal exposed, but with no real need to lunge in as Barrero was in danger of running the ball out of play. When the referee pointed to the spot, Domenech was leaning against the edge of the dug-out looking totally expressionless. When the penalty was scored, he was leaning against the dugout looking totally expressionless. Three minutes later, he's still leaning against the edge of the dugout looking totally expressionless.\n\n82 min: France win a free-kick about 35 yards out. Ribery blasts it into the wall, where it hits Marquez.\n\n84 min: I can feel my phone buzzing away in my pocket, with text message after text message arriving. Either I've done something to upset the missus or assorted compatriots are sharing their delight at this France demise.\n\n85 min: I forgot to mention at the time - Abidal got booked for his penalty-conceding foul on Barrera.\n\n86 min: \"Didi Hamann loves his horse-racing,\" texts my mate Bullets Curley from a field in Dublin. \"He's out here in Leopardstown drinking and smoking and backing horses.\" It's well for some.\n\n87 min: \"Has anyone ever sacked a manager during the World Cup?\" asks Sam Fletcher. \"If I were head of the FFF, I would be tempted to sack Domenech after this game. Mind you, it brings you back to the question: why have they employed him for so long?\"\n\n88 min: Blanco tries to play Dos Santos through on goal with a through-ball from distance. His visionary pass is a teensy bit too weighty and Lloris beats the Mexican striker to the ball.\n\n90 min: James Earl Jones announces that Mexico will have three additional minutes in which to heap more humiliation on France.\n\n90+1 min: Domenech is still leaning against the dug-out, while all his subs are congregated down behind one goal. He hasn't said a word since the second goal went in, probably because he knows there's no point because his players wouldn't listen to him.\n\n90+2 min: Peep! Peep! Peep! It's all over - Mexico have won a thoroughly deserved victory. To have any chance of getting out Group A, France will need to beat South Africa well and hope Uruguay and Mexico don't draw. If they play on that night like they did tonight, the draw won't matter because they've no chance of beating South Africa. Their manager is an idiot and almost to a man, their players are a disgrace to their country.\n\n\"Post this, Barry,\" writes Anthony O'Connell. \"You know you want to.\" It would be my absolute pleasure, Anto.

  "latent_20202": "This is an era of tanking and rebuilding in baseball. Teams like the Cubs and Astros drop into the cellar for a few years, stockpile talent, and then burst back into first place, stronger than ever. Never before have teams so consciously chosen between contention and reconstruction. The ebb and flow of teams through the competitive cycle has left the league less balanced than it has been since the steroid era.\n\nTo get a sense of the level of parity in baseball, I calculated the standard deviation in run differential at this point in each season going back to 1988. When the league is less even, the differences in run differential between teams tend to expand and the standard deviation gets larger.\n\nOver the last couple years, imbalance in the league has spiked. The last time parity was lower than it has been the last two seasons was in 2003, when Barry Bonds could still be counted on for at least 40 home runs a season. Six teams are on pace (by run differential) for 97-win seasons, while four threaten to lose 97 games.\n\nIt’s obvious how uneven the league is now when you look at some of the most impressive teams of 2017. The Astros aren’t quite on the historic run that the Cubs managed last year. But they’re close — after 72 games, the Astros project to finish the season with a run differential of +254, slightly better than the impressive rate the defending champions managed last year.\n\nThe Astros also have company at the top: The Yankees are just off Houston’s run-differential pace — riding unexpected performances to a strong bid for the division crown. In the senior circuit, the Dodgers are relying on league-best run prevention to power an equally impressive performance. Three of the top six teams in run differential (the Dodgers, Diamondbacks and Rockies) play in the National League West, a surprisingly competitive division that also hosts two of the worst teams in the league.\n\nSpeaking of the Padres, MLB’s worst teams have committed wholly to rebuilding, at the cost of any shred of competitiveness. While the Padres’ management doesn’t dare speak the word, executive chairman Ron Fowler said last year that they aimed “to get to .500 in hopefully” 2018. From trading established stars to turning single-A players loose on the field, the Padres have abandoned the idea of contention. That’s an amazing change of fortune for a team that went all-in two years ago, only to fall short. The Phillies are similarly terrible, having traded away their stars in an effort to tank.\n\nMany of these teams won’t finish the year with run differentials as woeful or as impressive as what they’ve posted so far (Rockies, I’m looking at you). The Astros are unlikely to keep up their historic pace, just as the Cubs ultimately fell off their record-challenging midseason pace last year. But the relentless churn of teams willfully plummeting to the bottom and then rising again with fresh talent ought to keep baseball a league of haves and have-nots for the foreseeable future.",

  "latent_20552": "Just five months before the deadly Oakland blaze where at least 36 people perished Friday night, Derick Ion Almena, 46, the man who is considered the brains behind the “Ghost Ship” artists’ colony claimed to be “the thriller love child of Manson, Pol Pot and Hitler,” and said, “I can proverbally [sic] get away with murder.”\n\nAccording to the East Bay Times, Almena made those comments during a 1,000-word Facebook rant where he indirectly alluded to being a drug user.\n\n“Addictions never admitted armed me as revolutionary,” he wrote. “… as long as i seek help and healing, have current registration, pay my insurance, piss in a cup twice weekly … i can proverbally [sic] get away with murder.”\n\nAlmena also took to Facebook one day after the deadly fire to lament over losing “everything [he] worked so hard for.”\n\nHis comments quickly produced backlash and criticism, with people calling him a “bastard” and users brooding over the fact that he seemed to have placed greater value on his material possessions than the lives of those who died tragically.\n\nSince media covered Almena’s posts, he appears to have deactivated his Facebook account.\n\nOn Monday, President Barack Obama released a statement on the devastating Oakland fire, referring to it as “one of the worst fires in the state’s history”:\n\nToday our prayers go out to the people of Oakland, California in the aftermath of this weekend’s deadly warehouse fire – one of the worst fires in the state’s history. While we still don’t know the full toll of this disaster, we do know that an American community has been devastated, and many people – including young men and women with their whole futures ahead of them – have tragically lost their lives. I want to thank the dedicated first responders who have been working tirelessly for days to contain the situation, recover victims, and treat the wounded. My Administration is in close contact with our state and local partners on the ground to make sure that authorities have everything they need as they continue response operations and investigate the cause of the fire. Oakland is one of the most diverse and creative cities in our country, and as families and residents pull together in the wake of this awful tragedy, they will have the unwavering support of the American people.\n\nAlthough Almena and his wife, Micah Allison, did not own the “Ghost Ship,” the East Bay Times notes that they leased it from an Oakland landlord and lived at the warehouse while charging $300 to $600 a month for tenants to live and work there.\n\nThe family of five was staying at a nearby hotel during the deadly conflagration.\n\nA former tenant told the Times that Almena knew of the structure’s deficiencies, which included questionable electrical hookups, artists using butane torches, and exposed wood throughout. The entire warehouse was filled to the brim with furniture and artwork but had no fire alarm or sprinkler system installed.\n\n“We argued a lot,” Shelley Mack told the East Bay Times. “They said they would fix things, and then they would collect money. They never would use the money to fix things.”\n\nHowever, not everyone agreed with the criticism of Almena. A cat owner named Nikki Kelber, 44, who lived in the “Ghost Ship” and narrowly escaped the fire with her feline suggested to the Times that Almena was being unfairly blamed for the fire.\n\nAccording to the Sacramento Bee, the death toll in Friday’s fire has risen to 36 as of Monday, and could rise further still.\n\nEight victims have been identified and their names released. Among them was Draven McGill, a 17-year-old at San Francisco’s Ruth Asawa School of the Arts.\n\nThe others identified thus far are Cash Askew, 22, of Oakland, David Cline, 35, of Oakland, Nick Gomez-Hall, 25, of Coronado, Sara Hoda, 30, of Walnut Creek, Travis Hough, 35, of Oakland, Donna Kellogg, 32, of Oakland and Brandon Chase Wittenauer, 32, of Hayward.\n\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz",

  "latent_20622": "As I reflect on another year of open source in government stories, I took a look back at the articles we published on Opensource.com this year to see if there were any noticeable commonalities. I found that most articles on the government channel fell into one of three categories: government policies, new tools available, and case studies.\n\nThis is consistent with the trend I highlighted last year (We have policies. Now what?). As Mark Bohannon is fond of saying, \"Governments are wrestling with the 'how tos' of open source choices; not 'whether' to use it.\" Government policies are become more refined and sophisticated in regards to open technologies, and increasingly, governments are choosing to \"default to open.\" However, governments still need help implementing those policies, and citizens are stepping up by creating new, open source tools and open formats to help governments get the job done.\n\nRather than do a traditional Top 10 list this year, I wanted to highlight a few standouts from each of these categories from 2014 that I think are worth reading if you missed them the first time. Or might even be worth a second read if it’s been a while.\n\nGovernments: open source policy and practice\n\nWhy isn’t all government software open source? by Ben Balter\n\nThe federal government is the single largest purchaser of code in the world. So why is this code—taxpayer-funded and integral to the day-to-day working of our democracy—so often hidden from public view? As someone who’s been on the inside, Balter does a great job explaining the US federal government’s \"culture of no\" and how the lack of \"suits\" behind open source really does make a difference in the procurement process.\n\nUS Digital Services Playbook: Default to open by Mark Bohannon\n\nBohannon describes the US’s Digital Service Playbook and other initiatives of the US federal government this year. There’s also a good discussion here about the inherent risks of governments trying to insource 'freebie' software.\n\nUK government makes “big step forward” with open document standards by Paul Brownell\n\nThe UK government announced it would henceforth require compliance with Open Document Format (ODF) in software purchases in all public administrations. Brownell praises the policy, but notes with caution that good policy does not always equal good practice.\n\nNew open source tools for governments and citizens\n\nOpen source code helps governments share information with citizens by Tamara Manik-Perlman\n\nRecordTrac, a web-based portal for making and managing public records requests (like FOIA), provides detailed data to both governments and the public to increase transparency and accountability in the records request process. Brilliant.\n\nTechnology driven governance just got a little smarter by Rajesh Ranjan\n\nThe FUEL Project provides linguistic resources needed for localization, including computer translation style and convention guides, translation assessment methodologies and matrix, complex text-layout rendering references system (UTRRS), including help documents for globalization, internationalization, localization, and translation (GILT) world.\n\nPublic crime data becomes more open and transparent city by Brittany Suszan\n\nSpotCrime’s goal is to create a public-facing crime mapping and email alert website which collects public crime data from police agencies around the world and makes it available to anyone in machine readable format without restrictions on ability to use, consume, or share. While this does read a bit like a marketing piece, it’s clear that there’s a definite need for a common open standard for law enforcement agencies to share and report crime data.\n\nCase studies\n\nCity of Vienna turns increasingly to open source by Gijs Hillenius\n\nThe administration in the Austrian capital, Vienna, outlined how and why it was expanding its use of open source solutions, including on its workstations, because of new requirements, open data, budget constraints and the major shift towards smartphones and tablets.\n\nThe State of open source at the VA (Veterans Affairs) by Luis Ibanez\n\nIn this interview, Stephen Warren, acting VA CIO discussed continuity of the VA’s open source initiative at the US’s second largest federal government agency. The most interesting piece here is how their open source VistA project didn’t really thrive until developing a community around it. This is a key takeaway for governments—it’s not enough to release your software as open source. It takes a community to maintain and innovate.\n\nVery honorable mention\n\n2014 Year of Open Source Miracles by Gunnar Hellekson\n\nThe old \"open source is insecure\" FUD is made new again thanks to the fracas surrounding Heartbleed and Shellshock.

  "latent_20673": "“When he got into the White House, he realized he had inherited real economic problems from his Republican predecessors — that seems to happen, have you noticed?” Mrs. Clinton said.\n\nBut she is not running on her husband’s coattails, she said, as she repeated a popular applause line from her stump speech. “I’m not running for my husband’s third term or President Obama’s third term. I’m running for my first term,” she said, in remarks that ran for about 40 minutes — twice as long as those of other candidates. (One of them, Lawrence Lessig, a professor at Harvard Law School, gently chided her, noting that he would respect time limits for speakers.)\n\nWhile the crowd applauded the attacks on Republican economic policies, some Democrats in the audience also displayed unhappiness with their own leaders. Scores of them heckled the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, over the party’s decision to limit the number of debates for its presidential candidates to six — a decision that one candidate, former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, said was rigged to help Mrs. Clinton. At points they nearly drowned out Ms. Wasserman Schultz with “More debates!” and “We want debates,” and the chants grew so loud that she went off script and addressed them.\n\n“What’s more important, driving the contrast with Republicans or arguing about debates?” Ms. Wasserman Schultz said. “Let’s focus on our task at hand.”\n\nShe then tried to mollify the crowd by attacking a favorite target, the Republican candidate Donald J. Trump, for not correcting a man at a New Hampshire rally on Thursday who said Mr. Obama is a Muslim. The convention hall exploded in cheers, but the party unity did not last long, as the “More debates” catcalls resumed.\n\nStill, Mr. Trump proved an easy source of applause that Democrats kept returning to.\n\n“He’s been trafficking in prejudice and paranoia through this campaign,” Mrs. Clinton said, going on to give Democrats a retort to Mr. Trump’s campaign slogan. “When you hear Mr. Trump say, ‘Let’s make America great again,’ you respond: ‘America is great. We just need to make it work for all Americans.’ ”\n\nMr. O’Malley drew one of his biggest ovations when he described Mr. Trump as “that racist, anti-immigrant carnival barker” and blasted the Republican field for stoking the grievances of Americans.",
  "latent_20720": "In previous post I told that I have few different RTL2832U based SDR dongles. I’m want to see what cheap Software Defined Radio technology can achieve. First one I tried was widely available version for 8-13 USD with RTL2832 + R820T chips. In this post I will look in to dongle with second generation tuner R820T2 which is available for 17-28 USD:\n\nInside it looks identical to first generation dongle except the different tuner chip. Most likely those chips are pin to pin compatible:\n\nSince I will not use dongle in original form factor I minimized it’s size. It is safe to unsolder IR remote control receiver and to cut off PCB as show in picture below:\n\nIt is also safe to drill some holes for mounting to the heat sink. With internal low noise amplifier (LNA) active RTL SDR dongle gets pretty hot. Even knowing that people are using dongle with no issue without any additional cooling I will feel better with dongle mounted to the heat sink:\n\nI will add additional 100nF, 1nF and 100pF bypass capacitors in parallel to all existing power supply capacitors also will make external 3.3V and 1.2V power supplies because I read online that on-board 1.2V switch mode power supply adds some noise in HF band. Additionally filter raw 5V power supply going from USB connector to SDR dongle with common mode choke and MuRata NFM21… filtering solution. Last mod but certainly not least will be high precision TCXO 28.8MHz oscillator. eBay seller claims it’s +/- 0.3PPM acurate. That is aprox 8Hz error from 28.8MHz. I measured it with high accuracy system and found actual error fluctuating in the region of 1 to 3 Hz. Few shots from the process:\n\nFinal view:\n\nNow measurements:\n\nWhat insertion loss does antenna input have over full operational band? During first generation tuner measurements I found out that dongle antenna input does not have acceptable insertion loss (in other words SWR coefficient) over full declared operation band (25MHz to 1750MHz). I don’t expect it to be impressive as these dongles were meant to be used with 75 ohm impedance antennas for digital TV broadcasts so it will not perform as good on 50 ohm antennas common in radio amateur world. But certainly not up to SWR coefficient of 8. Here is SWR plot of antenna input when LNA is disabled (0dBm gain):\n\nMarkers are set to SWR coefficient 2 meaning that inside these boundaries more then 89% of signal power will reach receiver and will not be reflected back to antenna:\n\nFrom this I see that SDR dongle best performs in the region from around 25MHz to 1076MHz. To make things more complicated I can add that reflection coefficient changes with different LNA gain, here is archive with more measurements – VNA SWR archive. Lowest source signal I can configure in my VNA analyzer is -30dBm so maybe with higher LNA gain insertion loss is changing due to RF front end overload? In future I will do noise floor measurement over full band and note minimal signal I can see in spectrum window. We will see how it will compare to insertion loss.\n\nHow accurate R820T2 dongle can be with high precision TCXO oscillator? In this measurement I fed 160.000.000 Hz carrier wave from very accurate RF generator which is clocked from rubidium frequency standard. With RTL SDR dongle + TCXO in the software I got the same 160.000.000 Hz. Well maybe we can argue that it is tiny bit off and I need to shift marker slightly to left by a few tens of a hertz but it is no way near to the error I got with original quartz resonator – 9905Hz, almost 10kHz:\n\nThe main selling point of second generation R820T2 tuners is better sensitivity. So it is even more interesting to see where is its the noise floor? And compare the result with first generation tuner. Since amplitude scale in RTL-SDR software packages is relative it is not straight forward to determine signal strength or noise floor. One of the way that came to my head first was to apply barely visible carrier wave from signal generator and call that close to noise floor. And that is what I did. In the picture below you see that in real time spectrum signal is not visible at all, only in waterfall spectrum it is possible to see traces of signal (click on picture to zoom in). This was signal strength of -95.4 dBm. In comparison with first generation tuner I was able to go only down to -88.2dBm signal level. So second generation R820T2 tuner has about 7dB lower noise floor when LNA is disabled (0dBm gain):\n\nAs with the first generation tuner here I’m also interested is really amplitude graticule step 10dB? From the noise floor I started to increase RF signal generator output power until I reached graticule levels and noted the difference. This is what I came up with:\n\ngraticule -50 <> signal applied -85,2 dBm;\n\ngraticule -40 <> signal applied -74,8 dBm (applied signal step – 10,4 dBm);\n\ngraticule -30 <> signal applied -62,3 dBm (applied signal step – 12,5 dBm);\n\ngraticule -20 <> signal applied -53,5 dBm (applied signal step – 8,8 dBm);\n\ngraticule 0 <> signal applied -33,3 dBm (applied signal step – 20,2 dBm).\n\nSince I only eyeballed the graticule with shown signal peak I call this close enough to real 10dB step though results are more scatered then with first generation dongle. This measurement was also made with LNA disabled (0dBm gain).\n\nSo now I have general idea about performance of first generation RTL SDR dongle with R820T tuner and second generation dongle with R820T2 tuner. In future I will do some measurements in other frequency bands.\n\nADDITIONAL INFO\n\nHere are additional pictures, hope they will help to understand where you need to connect voltages and TXCO. It’s not necessary to make external voltage regulators and unsolder existing ones. I chose to use external 3,3V regulator to get better cooling by attaching voltage regulator directly to case, stock one on the PCB gets pretty hot since it is linear type. NOTE that external ones that I used are also liner to avoid RF noise that could be generated by switch mode type. It’s just that they are directly connected to the metal case. External 1.2V regulator was used because stock one was switch mode type and potentially can radiate RF noise which is noticeable in HF bands with up converter.\n\nCurrent draw on 1.2V and 3.3V power rails with TXCO power from 3.3V rail:\n\nwith 0 dB LNA gain 1.2V rail draws 175mA and 3.3V 194mA;\n\nwith 50 dB LNA gain 1.2V rail draws 179mA and 3.3V 196mA.\n\nTXCO is connected to R820T2 tuner pin 9. With TXCO you do not need capacitors marked in red. They were needed only for crystal resonator:",

  "latent_21252": "Forces loyal to the Turkish government fought on Saturday to crush the remnants of a military coup attempt which crumbled after crowds answered President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's call to take to the streets and dozens of rebels abandoned their tanks.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said 161 people had been killed and 1,440 wounded after a faction of the armed forces tried to seize power using tanks and attack helicopters. Some strafed the headquarters of Turkish intelligence and parliament in the capital, Ankara, and others seized a major bridge in Istanbul.\n\nThe death toll given by Yildirim was lower than a previous military-provided total of 194 people.\n\nErdogan accused the coup plotters of trying to kill him and launched a purge of the armed forces, which last used force to stage a successful coup more than 30 years ago.\n\n\"They will pay a heavy price for this,\" said Erdogan, who also saw off mass public protests against his rule three years\n\nago. \"This uprising is a gift from God to us because this will be a reason to cleanse our army.\"\n\nA Turkish broadcaster reported that a purge of the judiciary was also underway.\n\n2,800 rounded up\n\nOne government minister said some military commanders were still being held hostage by the plotters. But the government declared the situation fully under control, saying 161 people had been killed and 2,839 had been rounded up from foot soldiers to senior officers, including those who had formed \"the backbone\" of the rebellion.\n\nA successful overthrow of Erdogan, who has ruled the country of about 80 million people since 2003, would have marked one of the biggest shifts in the Middle East in years, transforming a major U.S. ally while war rages on its border.\n\nHowever, a failed coup attempt could still destabilize a NATO member that lies between the European Union and the chaos of Syria, with Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) bombers targeting Turkish cities and the government also at war with Kurdish separatists.\n\nA policeman stands atop of a military armoured vehicle after troops involved in the coup surrendered on the Bosporus Bridge in Istanbul. (Murad Sezer/Reuters)\n\nErdogan, who had been holidaying on the southwest coast when the coup was launched, flew into Istanbul before dawn on Saturday and was shown on TV outside Ataturk Airport.\n\nAddressing a crowd of thousands of flag-waving supporters at the airport later, Erdogan said the government remained at the helm, although disturbances continued in Ankara.\n\nErdogan says he was targeted\n\nErdogan, a polarizing figure whose Islamist-rooted ideology lies at odds with supporters of modern Turkey's secular\n\nprinciples, said the plotters had tried to attack him in the resort town of Marmaris.\n\n\"They bombed places I had departed right after I was gone,\" he said. \"They probably thought we were still there.\"\n\nSupporters of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan celebrate after soldiers involved in the coup surrendered on the Bosporus Bridge in Istanbul. (Yagiz Karahan/Reuters)\n\nErdogan's AK Party has long had strained relations with the military, which has a history of mounting coups to defend\n\nsecularism although it has not seized power directly since 1980.\n\nHis conservative religious vision for Turkey's future has also alienated many ordinary citizens who accuse him of\n\nauthoritarianism. Police used heavy force in 2013 to suppress mass protest demanding more freedom.\n\nHowever, he also commands the admiration and loyalty of millions of Turks, particularly for restoring order to an\n\neconomy once beset by regular crises. Living standards have risen steadily under his rule, and while the economy has hit serious problems in recent years, it grew a greater-than-expected 4.8 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter.\n\nStill, the violence is likely to hit a tourism industry already suffering from the bombings and a row with Russia that\n\nhad appeared to have been settled, and business confidence is also vulnerable.\n\nVideo-calling address\n\nIn a night that sometimes verged on the bizarre, Erdogan took to social media even though he is an avowed enemy of the technology when his opponents use it, frequently targeting Twitter and Facebook.\n\nErdogan addressed the nation via a video-calling service, appearing on the smartphone of a CNN Turk reporter who held it up to a studio camera so viewers to the network could see him.\n\nHe said the \"parallel structure\" was behind the coup attempt — his shorthand for followers of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric whom he has repeatedly accused of trying to foment an uprising in the military, media and judiciary.\n\nA man walks inside the destroyed parliament building in Ankara after the attempted coup. (Reuters)\n\nGulen, who lives in self-imposed exile in the United States, once supported Erdogan but became a nemesis. He denied accusations he played a role in the attempted coup and said he condemned in the strongest terms the action.\n\n\"As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be\n\naccused of having any link to such an attempt. I categorically deny such accusations,\" Gulen said in a statement.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States had not received any request to extradite Gulen.\n\nJudge purge\n\nThe purge appeared to go beyond the military. Citing a decision by the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors, broadcaster NTV reported that authorities had removed 2,745 judges from duty.\n\nGunfire and explosions had rocked both Istanbul and Ankara through the night after soldiers took up positions in both\n\ncities and ordered state television to read out a statement declaring they had taken power. However, by dawn the noise of fighting had died down considerably.\n\nAbout 50 soldiers involved in the coup surrendered on one of the bridges across the Bosporus Strait in Istanbul after dawn on Saturday, abandoning their tanks with their hands raised in the air.

  "latent_21376": "Mystery of Orbiter Crash Solved Scientists do not yet know what caused the Mars Orbiter to crash. (AP)\n\nBy Kathy Sawyer\n\nWashington Post Staff Writer\n\nFriday, October 1, 1999; Page A1 NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter was lost in space last week because engineers failed to make a simple conversion from English units to metric, an embarrassing lapse that sent the $125 million craft fatally close to the Martian surface, investigators said yesterday. Officials are scrambling to determine whether a similar error is buried in the computer files of two other spacecraft currently cruising through space: the Mars Polar Lander, scheduled to hit the Martian surface on Dec. 3, and the Stardust craft bound for a comet. It now appears the error had affected the orbiter mission from its launching almost 10 months and 416 million miles before its Sept. 23 failure. And yet the problem was never caught and corrected by the system of checks and balances at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California, which manages this and numerous other interplanetary missions for NASA. As a result, flight controllers believe the spacecraft plowed into the Martian atmosphere, where the stresses crippled it, aborted its insertion into Martian orbit and most likely left it hurtling on through space in an orbit around the sun. Baffled NASA officials said they were struggling to figure out how this happened, and bracing themselves for an onslaught of derision. \"Our inability to recognize and correct this simple error has had major implications,\" said JPL director Edward Stone. The initial error was made by contractor Lockheed Martin Astronautics in Colorado, which, like the rest of the U.S. launch industry, traditionally uses English measurements. The JPL navigation team, on the other hand, uses metric measurements in the complex business of figuring out a spacecraft's position relative to moving planets and keeping it on course. The contractor, by agreement, is supposed to convert its measurements to metrics. However, officials said, this simple error should not have cost them a spacecraft. Investigators are collecting information about whether concerns were raised by anyone during the mission but ignored, whether proper procedures were followed, and in general how both human and computer monitors failed to detect the problem. \"We are revisiting all the files from day one,\" said JPL's Charles Elachi, director of space and earth sciences. \"We want to get to the bottom of this and fix it.\" The initial error occurred in computer files forwarded regularly by Lockheed Martin to JPL navigators, according to Elachi's deputy, Tom Gavin. The wrong numbers referred to tiny thruster firings performed routinely twice a day. The navigators, in turn, performed their analysis of the spacecraft's position in space based on the assumption that the descriptions of these firings were in metric units of force per second (newtons). In fact, the numbers instead represented pounds (of force per second). This led to tiny miscalculations of the spacecraft's course that compounded over time. There were subtle clues in the data that something was off, but no one recognized the cause until yesterday. Officials said there will likely be no personnel firings over the failure. As one put it, the emphasis will not be in \"pointing fingers and dealing out punishment,\" but in \"figuring out how the process failed and fixing it.\" Two separate panels are looking into the failure, including an internal JPL group and a review board consisting of both JPL and outside experts. An independent NASA group will be formed shortly. The orbiter was one in a series of missions being dispatched to Mars every two years, under NASA's recently adopted \"faster, smaller, cheaper\" philosophy. NASA officials rejected suggestions that the failure reflects badly on that approach. Historical failure rates for billion-dollar missions of the past, and the smaller, more frequent missions of today, are similar -- about 10 percent, they said. Under the discarded system of flying huge and complex missions only once in a decade or so, a loss was more devastating, officials said. In this case, they have the surveyor in Martian orbit and the lander on its way. This eases the sting of the talk show jokes that are bound to fly concerning the foolishness of the mistake, said Carl Pilcher, NASA's chief of solar system exploration. \"Oh, God, there's nothing we can do about that. We'll live through it. . . . Then we'll wow them again.\" The orbiter's main mission was to monitor the Red Planet's atmosphere, surface and polar caps for one Martian year, or 687 days. First, however, the craft was to have served as a communications relay link for the lander. Managers said backup plans will allow the lander instead to transmit data either directly to Earth, through the global Deep Space Network of antennas, or through the orbiting Mars Global Surveyor. © 1999 The Washington Post Company Back to the top",

Prometheus closes this gap, which Kubernetes complements, thanks to its conceptual similarity, simple structure, and far-reaching automation.\n\nKubernetes [1] makes it much easier for admins to distribute container-based infrastructures. In principle, you no longer have to worry about where applications run or if sufficient resources are available. However, if you want to ensure the best performance, you usually cannot avoid monitoring the applications, the containers in which they run, and Kubernetes itself.\n\nYou can read how Prometheus works in a previous ADMIN article [2]; here, I shed light on the collaboration between Prometheus and Kubernetes. Because of its service discovery, Prometheus independently retrieves information about the container platform, the current container, services, and applications via the Kubernetes API.

  "latent_21654": "Image: Son of Groucho/Flickr\n\nA Federal Communications Commission proposal that cable companies allow customers to use their own set-top boxes, instead of forcing customers to rent these boxes from the cable companies themselves, is attracting significant support among racial diversity advocacy groups.\n\nAlex Nogales, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition (NHMC), told me in a telephone conversation on Friday afternoon that the proposal is the best way to to make the price of TV more accessible to less affluent communities.\n\nIn Nogales' view, making set-top boxes more affordable would not only lead to a proliferation of Latino-oriented television programming, but would in turn would lead to a greater understanding of Latino culture among non-Latinos.\n\n\"The state of media for minorities in this country is terrible,\" Nogales told me. \"I'm paying over $150 per month for cable—what the hell am I getting for my money?\"\n\nAs an example, he cited the lack of television channels aimed at Latinos whose primary language is English. \"There's Fusion [a joint venture between Univision and ABC] and that's it,\" he said, noting that a significant percentage of Latinos in the US don't speak Spanish at all.\n\nNogales isn't alone in his support of the FCC's efforts. Robert L. Johnson, who founded Black Entertainment Television (BET), said in a statement this week that \"your audience can only find you if they have a modem or a set-top box or software that lets them know you are there and gives them access to your programs unconstrained by the network gatekeeper.\"\n\nThe FCC's proposal, which will likely come up against major lobbying efforts on the part of cable companies, was announced on Wednesday, and seeks to bring competition to the highly lucrative business of set top boxes. It's estimated that rental fees for these boxes generate several billion dollars per year for the cable companies, with the average American household spending $231 per year on rental fees. But under the FCC's proposal, consumers would not be locked into using the set-top box provided by their cable company and instead would be free to use a set-top box provided by a different company, just as they're free today to use their own cable modem for home broadband service.\n\nSeveral companies have already signaled their interest in creating these set-top boxes. Tivo told the Wall Street Journal that it sees \"great consumer benefits in choice,\" while Google has already gone on record asking the FCC to \"unleash competition\" in the set-top box market.\n\nToward the end of our conversation, I asked Nogales if he could explain why the average, non-Latino American should care whether or not minority communities have access to affordable set-top boxes. \"Surely there are bigger issues to worry about?\" some people might wonder.\n\nHe quickly shot down that line of thinking.\n\n\"If [the US Latino population] were three Mexicans and two Puerto Ricans this wouldn't be an issue,\" he said, \"but we're 18 percent of the population. Affordable set-top boxes are a necessity, not just in terms of costs but in terms of the democratic traditions of this country. These people need to be connected to the society of this country.\"",
  "latent_21702": "As Game of Thrones‘ feisty swordstress Arya Stark, Maisie Williams isn’t typically seen as a damsel in distress — nor should she be — but following the stateside release of her new movie Heatstroke, that’s all about to change.\n\nRELATED Game of Thrones Adds Jonathan Pryce, Deep Space Nine Alum and Casts Sand Snakes for Season 5\n\nIn Heatstroke — originally released in the UK in 2013, but now available in the U.S. on iTunes and VOD — Williams plays Josie, the daughter of Stephen Dorff’s Paul, who finds herself in desperate need of saving after a family trip to Africa goes horribly, violently wrong.\n\nBelow, Williams talks to TVLine about the struggles of playing helpless in Heatstroke, why she loved Thrones‘ Lady Stoneheart exclusion and why she believes Arya is finally “ready to go off on her own” in Season 5.\n\nTVLINE | What attracted you to this role? Josie is sort of the anti-Arya.\n\nI shot this two or three years ago, and when we got the script, I wasn’t in any position to be picking and choosing roles to play. I think people think stuff gets thrown at us all the time, but that’s not the case; there aren’t many roles out there for people my age.\n\nTVLINE | Did you enjoy not having to be the fighter for once?\n\n[Josie and Arya] are both completely different characters, and I enjoy doing both. I enjoy Game of Thrones for obvious reasons, but it was also refreshing to work with a different crew on a different set with different cast members.\n\nTVLINE | Do you have a favorite scene in Heatstroke?\n\nWhen Jo encounters the hyena, that was pretty cool. It was really different, something you don’t get to experience on every film set.\n\nTVLINE | I feel like you work with a lot of animals. Any favorites?\n\nThe horses are the easiest, they don’t get too grumpy. The dogs would probably be second. The hyenas were also good, but there’s always the possibility that they’re going to freak out, because they can’t really be tamed. … Oh, the cat I worked with on Game of Thrones was so badly behaved! It would never do anything it was supposed to do. I was like, “Get your game together, cat. You’re so bad.”\n\nTVLINE | Well, hopefully Arya won’t be dealing with any more cats in Season 5. Do you know what she will be dealing with?\n\nI haven’t gotten the scripts yet, so I still don’t know what’s happening. I have a rough outline of what happens in the books, but you never know what they’re going to put into this season versus next season, or what they’re going to scrap altogether. I know a couple of really cool things happen in the books with Arya, and I just had a meeting about about a certain thing that happens to Arya, but I still don’t know how it happens. And that’s what it was like last year; I was learning fight scenes, even though I didn’t know who I’d be fighting or why I’d be fighting them. People think the cast members know all the ins and outs, but we really don’t.\n\nTVLINE | Being a social media pro, I’m sure you’re aware of the Lady Stoneheart outcry. Any thoughts on that?\n\nThat was a massive deal, but honestly, I really like it. I’m so sick of going on the internet and seeing all the book readers being snobby, spoiling it for other people, then saying, “Well, it’s not a spoiler. The books have been out for years.” Like, couldn’t you just stop being mad for a second and let other people enjoy the show? They feel they have a claim on the series because they read the books first, and I understand that, but they don’t need to be mean about it. That’s why I liked moments like this, because book readers think they know what’s coming, then we change it and it’s really funny to watch their reactions. They’re always like, “That’s not what happened in the books, so the show’s really bad now.” But really, they just feel insecure because they’re used to knowing what’s coming next.\n\nTVLINE | Do you know what’s coming next, at least for Arya?\n\nI don’t know, honestly. We’re starting to catch up with what’s been written, so I’d love to do something completely new. Again, I’d love to keep making the book readers go, “Wait, is that what’s going to come in the next book? Did they make that up completely?” I love it when we do something really dramatic and shock everyone. They should throw in more stuff that no one knows about.\n\nTVLINE | As long as it’s not Arya accidentally falling out of a moon door.\n\n[Laughs] Yeah, that would suck.\n\nTVLINE | Going into Season 5, Arya’s going to be Hound-less for once. Will she be OK on her own?\n\nI think she’s going to be fine. And I think, for the first time ever, she actually believes she’s going to be fine. It’s refreshing to me; this girl’s been pulled left and right by people who’ve been telling her what she’s going to do with her life, and she’s sick of it. She knows this world, she knows who to trust and she’s ready to go off on her own.\n\nThrones fans, what are you hoping to see in Season 5? And for all you book snobs, how did you feel about the lack of Lady Stoneheart in Season 4? Drop a comment with your thoughts below.",

  "latent_21859": "It’s simple to promote solar power as a money saver and clean alternative to fossil fuel generation. But it sells solar short to focus only on savings, when it also gives Americans the freedom to generate their own energy and to challenge the economic and political power of big corporations.\n\nIndividual Freedom\n\nIf individuals want to invest their money, or pay someone else, to put solar on their rooftop, who is the government or the utility to tell them no? Americans should be free to decide how best to spend their money, and rooftop solar is one of the few ways they can spend it that pays back by cutting their use of electricity.\n\nCompetition\n\nIn more than 30 states, utilities operate as monopolies. The monopolies serving most customers are a private companies that receive a generous rate of return (10% or more) on money they invest in the grid system. Utilities suggest their monopoly is “natural,” and that the grid operates most efficiently in their clutches. But if that’s the case, why are utilities across the country scrambling to cut compensation for solar producers, add fees to the bills of solar owners, and modify electric bills so people who use less energy can’t avoid paying the utility less money?\n\nThe truth is that technology from solar to smartphones undermines the rationale for a utility monopoly, and customers should be able to compete with their utility to get the best deal.\n\nAmericans also deserve to have a say in the rules of the electricity business. Big monopoly utilities wield their customers’ dollars against them in court and at the capitol. In Florida, investor-owned utilities have one lobbyist for every two legislators. One of California’s biggest investor-owned utilities spent over $46 million opposing a policy allowing cities and towns to shop for a better deal. And utilities can use money from their captive customers to pay for membership in trade organizations that spread their monopoly-protection legislative ideas from state to state. Monopolies don’t just mean bad business, they make for bad politics, and less concentrated economic power means more people power in making the rules.\n\nBenefits for Everyone\n\nSolar is good for individuals, but their investments also pay dividends for the grid. For one, solar power produces power right where we use it. Think about a delivery from Amazon: is it better to have items sent to the distribution center 30 miles away or to your front porch?\n\nSolar also produces power during times of peak energy use. Most state or regional grids reach their peak capacity on hot, sunny afternoons, the same time solar pours electricity into the grid. Consider congestion lanes on a freeway: when traffic is heavy, the price to use them goes up. The value of solar energy is higher because of when it’s produced.\n\nFurthermore, solar on a local rooftop likely involves a local installer and maybe even a local loan. The money spent to finance and build a rooftop solar installation stays in the local economy when most other energy dollars do not.\n\nFinally, solar reduces health and environmental costs that big companies unload onto their customers. Every kilowatt-hour of energy produced at a coal or natural gas power plant produces several pounds of pollutants. Their spread into the air and water spurs warnings to limit our consumption of fish, higher incidences of respiratory diseases like asthma, and other public health dangers. Because it reduces energy consumption from power plants, rooftop solar helps avoid these health and environmental costs otherwise borne by individuals rather than the utility companies that cause them.\n\nIf you like, it’s possible to get into the weeds of the financial and economic benefits of rooftop solar versus coal or gas or nuclear, but aren’t choice, competition, and cleaner air enough?\n\nThis article originally posted at ilsr.org.

  "latent_22059": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nImmigration agents sparked panic across the country last week, when a series of high-profile operations made it clear that a new era of crackdowns on undocumented immigrants had begun. Coming on the heels of a couple of major executive orders on immigration, the arrests and deportations were a very public reminder of President Donald Trump’s promise to deport upwards of 2 million immigrants upon taking office.\n\nBut given that America’s detention system for immigrants has been running at full capacity for some time now, where is the president going to put all of these people before deporting them?\n\nIn new jails, for starters. In the same executive order that called for the construction of a southern border wall, Trump instructed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to build out its sprawling network of immigration detention centers. Starting “immediately,” his order said, ICE should construct new facilities, lease space for immigrants alongside inmates in existing local jails, and sign new contracts—likely with private prison companies. The scale of that expansion became clearer on February 5, when the Los Angeles Times reported on a memo handed down in late January from White House immigration experts to top Homeland Security officials. The document called for raising the number of immigrants ICE incarcerates daily, nationwide, to 80,000 people.\n\nIn late January, a memo to top Homeland Security officials called for raising the number of immigrants ICE incarcerates daily to 80,000 people.\n\nLast year, ICE detained more than 352,000 people. The number of detainees held each day, typically between 31,000 and 34,000, reached a historic high of about 41,000 people in the fall, as Customs and Border Protection apprehended more people on the southwest border while seeing a simultaneous rise in asylum seekers. But doubling the daily capacity to 80,000 “would require ICE to sprint to add more capacity than the agency has ever added in its entire history,” says Carl Takei, staff attorney for the ACLU’s National Prison Project. It would also take an extra $2 billion in government funding per year, detention experts interviewed by Mother Jones estimated. And, Takei warned, “we don’t know if 80,000 is where he’ll stop.”\n\nYet even if ICE does not adopt an 80,000-person detention quota, other changes laid out in Trump’s executive orders suggest that vastly more people will be detained in the coming months and years. For example, Trump ordered ICE to prioritize deporting not only immigrants who been convicted or charged with crimes, but also those who had “committed acts that constitute a chargeable offense”—a category that could include entering the country illegally and driving without a license. Trump also ordered Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who oversees ICE, to take “all appropriate actions” to detain undocumented immigrants while their cases are pending.\n\nBeyond that, ICE could stop granting parole to asylum seekers, explains Margo Schlanger, a former Obama administration official who served as Homeland Security’s top authority on civil rights. With ICE taking enforcement action against more categories of immigration offenders and releasing fewer of them, Schlanger says, “we could get to a very large sum of people in detention very quickly.”\n\nIt’s not difficult to guess who profits. In an earnings call last week, the private prison giant CoreCivic (formerly known as the Corrections Corporation of America, or CCA) announced that it saw the ICE detention expansion as a business opportunity. “When coupled with the above average rate of crossings along the southwest border, these executive orders appear likely to significantly increase the need for safe, humane, and appropriate detention bed capacity that we have available,” CoreCivic President and CEO Damon Hininger said.\n\n“There’s little doubt in my mind that they will continue to rely on the private prison industry in what’s going to be the biggest expansion of the agency in history.”\n\nAs of November, a whopping 65 percent of ICE detainees were held in facilities run by private prison companies, which typically earn a fee per detainee per night and whose business model depends upon minimizing costs to return profits to their shareholders. Since Trump’s election, private prison stocks have soared, and two new, for-profit detention centers are opening in Georgia and Texas.\n\nAnother private prison company, Management & Training Corp., is reportedly seeking a contract with ICE to reopen the Willacy County Correctional Institution, a troubled detention camp that held up to 2,000 ICE detainees in Kevlar tents between 2006 and 2011. “Historically, ICE has relied heavily on the private prison industry every time the detention system has expanded,” Takei says. “There’s little doubt in my mind that they will continue to rely on the private prison industry in what’s going to be the biggest expansion of the agency in history.”\n\nThe first new detention center contracts will likely take the form of arrangements between ICE and local governments to reopen empty prison facilities as detention centers or rent beds in existing local jails, Takei says. The arrangements, known intergovernmental service agreements, allow ICE to cut deals with local governments and private prison companies while avoiding a lengthy public bidding process. Occasionally, the local government agrees to hold ICE detainees alongside inmates in their publicly run jail—an arrangement a Department of Homeland Security subcommittee recently called “the most problematic” option for holding detainees. But most of the time, local governments simply act as middlemen in deals between ICE and private prison companies.\n\nThe opaque nature of the process allows all parties to avoid public outcry before the deals are signed, explains Silky Shah, co-director of the Detention Watch Network, an immigrant rights advocacy group. So far, immigration advocates haven’t gotten wind of many new contracts being negotiated or signed since Trump’s inauguration. “But that doesn’t mean contracting activity is not taking place,” Takei says. “I suspect there are closed-door meetings taking place across the country right now.”\n\n“There are a lot of bad things that happen if the number of beds is ramped up fast, without appropriate controls, monitoring, supervision, and care…Detainees could die.”\n\nExpanding detention quickly could have a high human cost. Schlanger is worried that conditions inside detention facilities could deteriorate without proper oversight from the Department of Homeland Security. “There are a lot of bad things that happen if the number of beds is ramped up fast, without appropriate controls, monitoring, supervision, and care,” she says, pointing to the potential overuse of solitary confinement, inadequate safety measures, poor nutrition, and insufficient medical care. “That means detainees could die.” Asylum seekers, she warns, will have a harder time fighting their immigration cases from inside detention centers, where it’s difficult to access lawyers and gather evidence. More could be coerced into voluntary deportation: “You’re vulnerable to the government saying to you, ‘Look, we’ll let you out from detention, but you have to give up your immigration case.'”\n\nWe don’t have to look far in the past to see the danger of rushing to open new detention facilities. Last year, as several thousand Haitian immigrants arrived on the southern border, fleeing natural disasters and poverty, the Department of Homeland Security began seeking contracts for new detention facilities to accommodate the surge. In their scramble to secure space for the new arrivals, ICE officials reportedly considered ignoring quality standards for the facilities—”scraping the bottom looking for beds,” as one official told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe bottom of the barrel, in this case, included a prison in Cibola County, New Mexico, owned by CoreCivic. Last summer, after an investigation by The Nation revealed a pattern of severe, longtime medical neglect in the 1,100-bed facility—which had gone months without a doctor—the US Bureau of Prisons decided to pull its inmates out and cancel its contract with CoreCivic. Yet less than a month after the last federal prisoner was transferred out, ICE was already negotiating an agreement with the county and CoreCivic to detain immigrants in the newly vacant facility. Four hundred immigrants are currently detained there. Takei notes that ICE contracted with the same company, for the same prison: “There weren’t any substantive changes.”\n\nShah expects to see familiar problems like poor medical care worsen as new deals for detention facilities are finalized. “One of the concerns we hear most often is that when people complain about ailments, [officers] will come back and just say, ‘Well, drink more water, or take an Advil and you’ll be fine,'” she says. “It’s a really harsh system already. If you’re going to expand at this level, it’s just going to become that much harsher.”",
  "latent_22156": "Let’s start with an example. You are creating an application that allows people to ask and answer software development questions. One of the use cases is to retrieve all posts from a specific user.\n\nYou can query an endpoint to retrieve all the user posts in JSON format, but there is one catch: A post can be either a question or an answer to a question. Take a look at an example JSON from this endpoint:\n\nLet me emphasize: Posts can be either a question or an answer. The either and or are key words. It gives you a hint that you should model your data as a Swift enum, like this:\n\nObserve that Question and Answer have different fields, so you need an associated value in the Post enum cases. This means that you need custom parsing.\n\nIn this case, it is not hard to make Post conform to Decodable . You only need to switch the type field and call the Decodable initializer from Question or Answer .\n\nNow you need unit tests to validate that the custom parsing works as expected. The tests will receive some input data, will produce the output model, and will validate that the model was parsed correctly.\n\nOne approach that I used before is to have the data stored in string format inside a nested struct. Take a look at this example:\n\nBut as I told you before, using JSON strings is error prone and not safe. To improve this, you can employ the JSONValue enum.\n\nIf you didn’t read my last post, I introduced a JSONValue enum to model any JSON type, one case for each possible value. You can take a peek at it below:\n\nI also made it conform to the Decodable protocol and showed how you can use it to parse a generic JSON field. If you missed the last post and want to take a look at it, you can find a link at the bottom of this post.\n\nJSONValue allows you to create the same kind of input data that you had in before in string format. But this time, if you make any mistake, the compiler will catch the error and the test will not build.\n\nYou can statically build the test cases with the JSONValue initializers:\n\nIt is a lot more readable now without all the character escaping. And it is type- and syntax-safe! You don’t need to worry if you add or omit JSON symbols like : and , because the swift compiler will take care of it for you.\n\nIf you like to have the data pretty printed, the Xcode code indentation shortcut can now give you a hand.\n\nSince your tests receive JSON strings, and now you have JSONValue , you need to convert it. First, make JSONValue conform to the Encodable protocol. To do that, switch JSONValue , and for each case encode the wrapped value.\n\nAll wrapped values in JSONValue are Encodable , so you don’t have to add any code. It works out of the box.\n\nIt still does not give you a string, so you need to call JSONEncoder.encode() . It is a throwing function, which means that you’ll need to add error handling to your tests.\n\nHere is a small extension that you can add to your unit tests target that will make the error handling much easier. Take a look:\n\nNot a good idea to use this in production code, since it may crash your app with a fatalError . But it’s amazing for unit tests.\n\nPassing the #file and #line to the fatalError function allows the error to be displayed in the correct place in your test.\n\nSince the compiler is validating most of the syntax, the only time I got a fatalError was when I tried to encode a JSON Fragment . A JSON fragment is a JSON that does not have an Object or an Array as the root.\n\nIf you do need the ability to encode JSON Fragments, you can change the jsonString function to handle the fragment cases in a different way:",
  "latent_22236": "INDIANAPOLIS - The Raiders’ wonderful season ended with a whimper.\n\nSo what did Jack Del Rio take away from his team’s final chapter? The head coach offered a weak smile.\n\n“Don’t lose your quarterback,” he said. “You don’t want that to happen.”\n\nIndeed, the Raiders, who went 12-3 with Derek Carr, went 0-2 after he broke his leg Christmas Eve. In their final defeat, they managed a season-low 203 yards and rookie quarterback Connor Cook threw three interceptions in a 27-14 wild-card loss to the Texans.\n\nThe ending prompted an obvious question Thursday at the NFL combine: Do the Raiders need to have “backup QB” on their offseason shopping list? Del Rio expressed confidence in Cook, a fourth-round pick who played well in the regular-season finale before his playoff flop.\n\n“We want to develop Connor Cook first as our backup quarterback,” Del Rio said. “He’s the guy we know we have right now. There’s always competition in this league. I wouldn’t close the door there, either, and say that we wouldn’t make it competitive for him. He did a pretty solid job developing throughout the year.”\n\nAnd the same could be said for the Raiders, who had their first winning season since 2002 and their most wins since 2000.\n\nAs a result, owner Mark Davis tore up Del Rio’s original four-year contract last month and replaced it with a new four-your deal.\n\nOn Thursday, Del Rio said he appreciated that Davis followed through on his 2015 pledge to revise his underwhelming contract once the Raiders emerged from the depths.\n\n“I bet on me on the contract,” Del Rio said. “It wasn’t a very good contract to start with, but it was an opportunity. And I bet on our ability to get this thing turned around and I feel like we have.”\n\nThe Raiders’ turnaround could make them an attract free-agent destination, a laughable notion a few years ago.\n\nDel Rio was asked about reports that running back Adrian Peterson has the Raiders among the teams on his wish list. This week, the Vikings announced they will not exercise Peterson’s $18 million option for 2017. As a result, Peterson, 31, will be an unrestricted free agent Thursday.\n\n“I think it’s great that we’re on the list of guys that are premier guys,” Del Rio said. “… The message I get is that players and coaches and people recognize that this is a good place to be. That we have turned this thing around.\n\n“When I first arrived three years ago, the thought was that no one wants to come here. We battled through that, became a place where people wanted to come and over the last two years, we’ve been able to attract some nice free agents.”\n\nThe Raiders figure to address their running-back position in the offseason. Latavius Murray, their leading rusher the past two seasons, is scheduled to become a free agent and is unlikely to return.\n\nDel Rio was asked if DeAndre Washington or Jalen Richard, who combined for 970 yards averaged 5.6 yards a carry as rookies last year, were ready to assume the lead-back role.\n\n“We’ll just see,” Del Rio said. “That’s always a fluid situation. We’re not closing the door on anybody. There are a lot of players on our roster and we’d love to have them all back. It doesn’t always work that way. We’ll work through it the best we can, try to remain in contact with all of our players, and retain those we can.”\n\nThe Raiders’ offense could be tweaked, but it should be among the NFL’s best with Carr back at the controls.\n\nHis importance to the Raiders was made clear last season, which means it’s possible the best news Del Rio has heard recently didn’t concern his extension.\n\nOn Thursday, he noted his franchise quarterback is doing just fine.\n\n“Everything that I’ve seen and hear is he’s on track or even ahead of schedule,” Del Rio said. “We expect a complete recovery and no issues.”\n\nEric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Even if you can't get through all of the zones, please send in your partial answers. You may very well win! So, without further adieu, we present, The Year Without a Santa... Hack. - Ed Skoudis\n\nThe Year Without a Santa... Hack.\n\nA Miser Brothers Weather Control System Challenge\n\nBy Ed Skoudis & Tim Medin\n\nThe world faced an unmitigated holiday disaster. Santa Claus, plagued by a bad head cold, felt unloved, unneeded, and, worst of all, unbelieved-in. He wearily announced that he was taking a year off, plunging children around the globe into deep despair. \"Warn the people,\" Santa sighed, \"Tell the papers. I'm much too tired... for Christmas capers.\"\n\nTo rescue the dire situation, Mrs. Claus hatched a plan, cunning in its details and stunning in its sheer audacity. She dispatched two kindly elves, Mr. Jingle Bells and Mr. Jangle Bells (no relation), to search the planet and find examples of Christmas spirit to shake Santa to his senses. \"Scout up some good will, and show him some proof that somebody cares. Santa will change his mind and PRESTO! Christmas is on again.\" Flying on their trusty steed, the fledgling reindeer, Vixen, the Bells boys headed south.\n\nIn plotting their path, the inexperienced Vixen made a tragic miscalculation. She flew directly between the feuding Miser brothers! Snow Miser, who controls the weather in the cold regions of the world, was engaged in eternal battle with his stepbrother, Heat Miser, master of Earth's hot climates. Despite Vixen's valiant efforts to dodge the vicious battle, she and the elves were forced down over Southtown, collateral damage in a war both hot and cold.\n\nIn a series of missteps so contrived they appeared to come from a children's holiday television special, Vixen found herself imprisoned in Southtown's dog pound, with no hope of escape. Jingle and Jangle appealed to the highest authority in the land, Southtown's mustachioed mayor, to pardon Vixen. The mayor offered his mind-boggling terms, \"You elves can work magic and all that. You conjure up a good, old-fashioned white Christmas for us right here in Southtown... and I'll spring your reindeer from the hoosegow!\" The only problem? Southtown was located deep inside Heat Miser's territory, the crown jewel of his fiery empire, a location that hadn't seen snow in over a century.\n\nWith her plan in shambles, Mrs. Claus gathered the elves, regrouped, and undauntedly doubled down in her bold approach. She'd try to convince Snow Miser himself to conjure up a wintry blast for Southtown. When they arrived at his snow castle, Snow Miser and his gaggle of curiously identical minions regaled Mrs. Claus with his favorite autobiographical tune:\n\nAlthough Snow Miser was cool with Mrs. Claus' proffered plan, he ultimately had to put her proposal on ice. \"Hold it! Hold it! No can do, Mrs. C. The South is under the control of my step brother, Heat Miser.\" Unless they could chill out Snow Miser's kin, the plan would go nowhere. The next step in her twisted scheme became obvious: a quick trip down to the dreaded depths of Heat Miser's volcano, which triggered the old devil to perform his favorite song and dance number, a strangely familiar anthem:\n\nWhen Mrs. Claus requested a snowy Southtown, Heat Miser burned with rage, rejecting the idea out of hand, his creepy hair glowing all ablaze. But, after stewing over the idea atop his hot seat, he eventually warmed to it, but only under one heated condition: he be allowed to melt the North Pole itself with sultry, tropical weather. They telephoned Snow Miser on the hotline to discuss the exchange. A predictable battle ensued, with neither side offering any ground in the negotiations.\n\nExasperated, Mrs. Claus had no choice but to appeal to a higher authority, Mother Nature herself. After considering Mrs. Claus' good-hearted plea and desire to save Christmas, Mother Nature insisted that her boys agree to the exchange. Heat Miser must allow it to snow in Southtown, while Snow Miser was obligated to allow a little warm weather at the North Pole. \"We'll get right on it, Mother Dear,\" the Miser Brothers announced in sing-song unison.\n\nAnd, that's where things start to get very interesting.\n\nYou see, Dear Reader, the naughty Miser Brothers did not EXACTLY follow Mother Nature's instructions. Instead, Snow Miser put his own unique spin on how to implement their mother's wishes.\n\n\"Hey, Hot Head, I've got an idea,\" Snow Miser taunted his brother.\n\nHeat Miser retorted, \"Let's just get this over with, you old blizzard. Give me access to your Cold Weather Control System, the Chiller, and I'll give you access to the controls of my heat machine, the Heater.\"\n\n\"Chill out for a minute, you flaming fool. I've got a more elegant idea. Instead of just exchanging access over our weather control systems, why don't we sweeten this whole endeavor with a little friendly hacking competition, a cool challenge, if you will,\" Snow miser proposed with a big toothy smile.\n\nHeat Miser liked what he was hearing, \"Sounds interesting. We could do a hot little capture the flag contest!\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" exclaimed Snow Miser, \"I'll try to hack into your Warm Weather Control System and shut it down, while powering up my Cold Weather Control System over Southtown, resulting in an icily beautiful snow storm in Southtown. At the same time, you can try to hack my Cold Weather Control System to shut it down as you activate your Warmer to create a miserably warm day at the North Pole.\"\n\n\"What a sizzling idea! I'm in,\" said Heat Miser. \"We'll start with our current state, full blast warm on Southtown and super cold on the North Pole. Call it Zone 0 in our competition. Each of us will try to hack through five levels of challenges, gradually shutting down the other's machine as we ramp up our own. You'll have your Zone 1 challenge, which will deactivate the first part of the Chiller, and I'll have my Zone 1 challenge, which will deactivate the first part of the Heater. When either of us completes Level 5, we'll have achieved our goal, and win!\" Snow Miser loved the idea, responding shiningly, \"May the best Miser win!\"\n\nThe brothers agreed to the following rules of engagement and scope, which anyone participating in this challenge is obligated to follow:\n\nNo denial of service attacks against the targets or other users\n\nNo brute force attacks\n\nApplication-level attacks only; no attacks against the underlying operating system\n\nAttack only the individual web applications located at heatmiser.counterhack.com and snowmiser.counterhack.com\n\nThe two Miser brothers decided to take their discussions onto Twitter as they taunted each other while trying to gain control of their stepbrother's machine. Snow Miser's Twitter handle is @sn0w_m1s3r, Heat Miser's is @h34t_m1s3r, and Mother Nature's handle is @m0th3r_n4tur3.\n\nAfter several hours of failing to reach Zone 5 in their respective target systems, the brothers were faced with yet another unexpected turn of events. Mother Nature had gotten wind of their proposed competition, and was quite unsettled that they hadn't simply followed the request of Mrs. Claus.\n\n\"Boys, boys, boys, I am so very disappointed with you,\" Mother Nature sighed. \"I banish each of you to your lairs for a whole weekend! You're grounded.\" The Misers sulked off to their castles in disappointment, their contest left unfinished.\n\nAnd, that's where you get involved, Dear Reader. You see, in her rush to punish her boys, Mother Nature forgot about Mrs. Claus' overall goal, namely to save Christmas by causing it to snow in Southtown, while balancing the force by bringing along a little warm weather to the North Pole. You'll have to pick up where the Miser Brothers left off, gaining control over Snow Miser's Chiller machine and Heat Miser's Heater machine, advancing each from Zone 0 through Zone 5. If you cannot achieve this goal, Santa will stay home, Christmas will be cancelled, and it may truly be the Year without a Santa Hack!\n\nWork your way through the five challenges at snowmiser.counterhack.com and the five challenges at heatmiser.counterhack.com, answering the following six questions:\n\nWhere did you find the remainder of Snow Miser's Zone 1 URL? What is the key you used with steghide to extract Snow Miser's Zone 2 URL? Where did you find the key? On Snow Miser's Zone 3 page, why is using the same key multiple times a bad idea? What was the coding error in Zone 4 of Heat Miser's site that allowed you to find the URL for Zone 5? How did you manipulate the cookie to get to Zone 5 of Heat Miser's Control System? Please briefly describe the process, steps, and tools you used to conquer each zone, including all of the flags hidden in the comments of each zone page.\n\nPlease submit your answers to holidayhack@counterhack.com by January 6, 2013. We'll award three prizes. One prize will be for the best technical answers. Another prize will go to the most creative answers that are technically correct. And, a third prize will be for a randomly drawn answer. Even if you can't make it through to Zone 5 on both the Heat Miser's target and Snow Miser's target, you may still have the best answers, so please do submit your entries! Even incomplete entries are eligible for a victory!\n\n- Ed Skoudis & Tim Medin",
  "latent_22298": "Richard Serra Drawing: A Retrospective\n\nThe Menil Collection\n\nMarch 2 through June 10, 2012\n\nOrganized by the Menil Collection, Richard Serra Drawing: A Retrospective is the first-ever critical overview of the artist’s drawings, as well as the first major one-person exhibition organized under the auspices of the Menil Drawing Institute and Study Center. The exhibition − which opened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, traveled to San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), and now concludes at the Menil Collection − traces the crucial role that drawing has played in Richard Serra’s work for more than 40 years.\n\nAlthough Serra is best known for his large-scale and site-specific sculptures, his work has also changed the practice of drawing. This exhibition shows how Serra’s work has expanded the definition of drawing through innovative techniques, unusual media, monumental scale, and carefully conceived relationships to surrounding architectural spaces. Richard Serra Drawing: A Retrospective is co-curated by Bernice Rose, chief curator emerita, the Menil Drawing Institute and Study Center; Michelle White, curator, The Menil Collection; and Gary Garrels, Elise S. Haas senior curator of painting and sculpture, SFMOMA. Installed in reconfigured galleries at the Menil, the exhibition opens on March 2 and will remain on view through June 10.\n\nThis landmark traveling exhibition brings together more than 80 works, including 41 Installation Drawings, large framed works, and nearly 30 of the artist’s notebooks. Exclusively for the Menil, the artist is creating a new site-specific work, filling an entire gallery. Also on view will be four films by the artist. All of the work on view will unfold chronologically, tracing Serra’s ever-evolving early ideas and methods.\n\nRichard Serra Drawing: A Retrospective follows the artist’s investigation of drawing as an activity both independent from and linked to his sculptural practice. The exhibition begins with work from the late 1960s, when the artist’s drawings were made primarily with ink, charcoal, and lithographic crayon on paper. Over time, his drawings increased in scale, evolving into autonomous works of art that challenged the notion of drawing.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Serra made the first of his large scaled Installation Drawings, some of which extend from floor to ceiling and extend in width to 20 feet. To make works such as Pacific Judson Murphy (1978), the artist attached Belgian linen directly to the wall and covered the entire surface with black paintstick−an oil-based pigment−to build stark, densely layered forms. These forms impact the viewer’s sense of mass and gravity, making for an experience that is as visceral as it is visual. The Installation Drawings marked a radical shift, altering conceptions of what a drawing is and how it can interact with architecture. Serra has written of these works, “By the nature of their weight, shape, location, flatness, and delineation along their edges, the black canvases enabled me to define spaces within a given architectural enclosure. The weight of the drawing derives not only from the number of layers of paintstick but mainly from its particular shape.”\n\nSince the 1980s, Serra has continued to invent new techniques and to explore a variety of surface effects, primarily on paper, including a series of large diptychs. The exhibition will also include works from several of Serra’s drawing series made in the 1990s, such as Deadweights (1991), Weight and Measure (1994), Rounds (1996-97), and out-of-rounds (1999-2000).\n\nIn Serra’s recent drawings, such as the Solids series (2007-2008), the accumulation of black paintstick on paper is extremely dense and nearly the entire surface of the paper is covered in a layer of viscous pigment. To make these drawings, Serra pours melted paintstick onto a table, puts a layer of wire mesh or screen on top, and then transfers the pigment on to a sheet of paper by pressing a hard marking tool onto the back of the paper.\n\nRichard Serra\n\nRichard Serra (b. 1938, San Francisco, California) studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of California, Santa Barbara, graduating with a B.A. in English literature. Serra then received an MFA from Yale University. The artist’s first New York exhibition was at the Leo Castelli Warehouse in 1967. His work has been the subject of major exhibitions at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (1977), Musée national d’art moderne, Centre Pompidou, Paris (1983), The Museum of Modern Art, New York (1986 and 2007), Serpentine Gallery, London (1992), Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid (1992), The Drawing Center, New York (1994), Dia: Chelsea, New York (1997), Guggenheim Bilbao (2005), Grand Palais, Paris (2008), and Kunsthaus Bregenz (2009), among other museums.\n\nThe artist has received numerous awards and accolades for his achievements. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and has received honorary doctorates from Yale, Harvard, and other universities. In 2008 he was named a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters of the French Academy and was decorated with the Order of the Arts and Letters of Spain. He received the Praemium Imperiale for Sculpture from the Japan Art Association in 1994, the Orden Pour le mérite für Wissenschaften und Künste in 2002, and the Prince of Asturias Award for the Arts in 2010.\n\nThe exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue with essays by the three co-curators and Magdalena Dabrowski, as well as contributions by Richard Shiff, the Effie Marie Cain Regents Chair in Art at the University of Texas at Austin, and Lizzie Borden, the Los Angeles-based filmmaker and writer. Also included in the catalogue are Serra’s “Notes on Drawing”; an illustrated chronology related to the artist’s drawing production; a selected exhibition history; and a selected bibliography. The catalogue is published by The Menil Collection and distributed by Yale University Press. It is available for sale in the Menil bookstore. 230 pages. 149 quadratone illustrations. HC $50, SC $40.\n\nThis exhibition is generously supported by Laura and John Arnold, National Endowment for the Arts, Sotheby’s, Eddie Allen and Chinhui Juhn, the Frances Dittmer Family Foundation, Paul and Janet Hobby, David and Anne Kirkland, Emily Rauh Pulitzer, the Four Seasons Hotel Houston, Clare Casademont and Michael Metz, Invesco, Janie C.

  "latent_22541": "“In organising the ‘free speech wall,’ the Students for Liberty have forgotten that liberty requires liberation, and this liberation is prevented by providing space … for the expression of hate,” wrote Smith in a 600-word Facebook post in which he identified himself as an anti-homophobia campaigner. Calling the area around the wall a “war zone,” he intimated that it was “but another in a series of acts of violence” against gay rights. In a Tuesday afternoon Twitter exchange with a CBC reporter, Mr Smith dubbed free speech an “illusory concept” and declared that “not every opinion is valid, nor deserving of expression.”\n\nOnly hours after students installed a “Free Speech Wall” at Carleton University to prove that campus free speech was alive and well, it was torn down by an activist who claimed the wall was an “act of violence” against the gay community. “What we wanted to promote was competition of ideas, rather than ‘if I disagree with you I’ve got to censor you,’” said Ian CoKehyeng, founder of Carleton Students for Liberty, the creators of the wall. Installed on Monday in the Unicentre Galleria, one of campus’ most high-traffic areas, the wall was really more of a 1.2 x 1.8 metre wooden plank wrapped in paper and equipped with felt markers. By Tuesday morning the wall was gone, destroyed in an act of “forceful resistance” by seventh-year human rights student Arun Smith.\n\nSo far as I can see, and despite his extensive commentary on the subject, Arun Smith still hasn’t specified any actual remark that offended him sufficiently to vandalise the wall then boast about it online. However, he does tell us that, “breaking down barriers requires anti-oppressive discourse,” which is “antithetical to ‘free speech’.” Expectations of free speech are, he informs us, “structurally oppressive.” Quizzed on his presumed entitlement to violence, Mr Smith replies, “You forget that writing can be violence. Resistance to violence is not violence.” And so he, being heroic, must resist and intervene to save some (again unspecified and exquisitely precious) potential victim. In this case, presumably, he’s saving them from the psychological hazard of passing by the statement “traditional marriage is awesome.” Four words that would obviously shatter the self-esteem of any vulnerable student already on the verge of weeping. Such are the dramas to be enacted in the modern Canadian university, one of the most indulgent and cossetting environments in the history of the world.\n\nIn fact, existing particulars don’t appear to trouble Mr Smith, for whom abstractions and potentials are much more congenial, and whose ostensible grievance is that someone is even “providing space… for the expression of hate.” To permit an area for free speech, even one the size of an average desk, is, we learn, “offensive, ill-considered and dangerous,” especially “during our Pride Week, where our communities are supposed to be able to seek liberation and celebrate our diversity.” In a lengthy, self-flattering Facebook screed Mr Smith objects to the existence of a space in which “there is potential for triggering, the invalidation or questioning of the identities of others, and/or the expression of hatred.” (The arbiters of what constitutes triggering, invalidation and hatred – sorry, potential triggering, invalidation and hatred - are of course Mr Smith and those who think like him.) Questioning a person’s “identity” is impermissible too. And the mere potential for such things is apparently so heinous, so vicious, it’s a basis for vandalism. And subsequently, self-congratulation.\n\nRegardless of its content, the free speech wall is, we’re told, “an act of violence.” A “microaggression.” And so Mr Smith feels obliged and entitled to retaliate, in order to pre-empt any hate (as defined by him) that might potentially occur at some point in the future. A line of moral reasoning that’s rather bold and which gives our saviour enormous scope for “forceful resistance” against almost anything he doesn’t like, even if it hasn’t happened yet. Naturally, Mr Smith, whose minor, incidentally, is “sexuality studies,” sees himself as a martyr: “I take full and sole responsibility for this action, I understand there will likely be consequences, and I am prepared for the imposition of those consequences, however unjust they might be.” Last night, Ezra Levant interviewed this fearless champion of the potentially oppressed. If nothing else, it’s an illustration of what happens when someone internalises the ticks and contortions of identity politics and cultivated victimhood. And when a passive-aggressive outlook is a person’s default state.\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nIn the comments, one reader suggests that Mr Smith, who seems determined to remain on campus for as long as possible, may have developed something akin to institutional syndrome. Certainly, he’s learned to mouth the usual vanities, and the attempts to rationalise his authoritarian urges are accompanied with a smile. So those seven years and counting haven’t entirely been wasted. As another reader notes, Mr Smith appears to base his moral displays on which group a person can be said to belong to, if you squint and tilt your head, rather than on what a person actually does, or wishes to do, to others. And so Mr Smith tells us that, “Contrary to popular belief, feelings and emotions are entirely valid and matter.” (Unlike free speech, reciprocity and personal property, feelings must be inviolate.) Though some people’s feelings evidently trump others, to the extent that the feelings of Designated Victims – designated by Mr Smith – are to be spared even from potential questioning, while others – thee and me, I guess – will have to learn our place, humbled and silent, in the New Hierarchy.\n\nIt doesn’t require much of a stretch to see how such thinking might appeal to a certain, rather unpleasant, kind of personality. Which brings us to the nub of this grim comedy. Taken at face value, Mr Smith most likely imagines himself as daring and radical, shaking our preconceptions with his pretentious vandalism, all carefully wrapped in claims of put-upon virtue and Marxoid jargon. But it seems to me he’s all too ready to conform, and to insist that others do the same, while simply following a pattern of petty, dogmatic idiocy that we’ve seen many times before. Readers will note how these acts of vandalism are often encouraged by, or conducted by, uptight leftist faculty. They’re so very keen to show us what they will not tolerate. And in that respect, Mr Smith is the ideal, self-satisfied product of a modern leftist education.\n\nVia Kate.\n\nAfter wading through so much mental faeces, your host could use a drink.",
  "latent_22654": "Guest post by @SteveALee of OpenDirective.com\n\nTL;DR: Learn how Node.js backend code via Azure Functions can access a Google API once a user logs in with Google via the Auth0 Lock widget.\n\nWithout a doubt, authentication for web apps is one of the most complex features to implement correctly. If you’re not careful, it will eat a large chunk of your development time. Worse, if you don't get it exactly right you're left vulnerable to being hacked, which will take even more of your precious time, not to mention damaging your reputation. Therefore, it's nice to have Auth0 around to help mitigate this problem with their flexible service along with some of the best documents and support in the business. I picked a complex case as my first attempt at auth for a Single Page App (SPA) Software as a Service (SaaS) product.\n\nAuth0 provides the simplest and easiest to use user interface tools to help administrators manage user identities including password resets, creating and provisioning, blocking and deleting users.\n\nThis post is the story of my experience along with some working JavaScript code for Azure Functions with Auth0.\n\nServerless Architecture\n\nAzure Functions are part of Microsoft’s offering in the relatively new Serverless Architecture space. Sometime referred to as Functions as a Service (FaaS), Serverless Architecture allows you to concentrate your development offerts on you ‘Business Logic’ or backend application code. In this extension of Platform As a Service (PaaS), Microsoft manage all the lower layers of the hardware and software stack for you. For example: servers, operating systems, web servers and even platforms such as Node.js. Note that serverless code is event driven and triggers may be HTTP requests but can also be from other sources such as a database update. This introductory article on MartinFlower.com explains a web app use of Serverless Architecture and also links to a very thorough post by Mike Roberts.\n\nThe Problem\n\nI'm developing a set of open source components used in a commercial SaaS designed to support the needs of people with cognitive disabilities or low digital literacy. The initial components and product will provide simplified access to shared photographs and email. Given this, Google Picasa and Gmail seemed like natural choices for the initial underlying services. Unfortunately, the Picasa API has been feature stripped recently when Google moved over to Google Photos.\n\nMy initial requirement for the user experience is that they can easily authenticate by signing into their existing Google account. The code should then be able to access their photos and emails, using the Picasa and Gmail APIs. This will require authorized access based on the user credentials provided when they sign in. The initial user story that we cover in this post is:\n\nAs a user, I want to log into the app with my Google account so I get a list of my Google Photos albums.\n\nThat all seemed fairly straightforward after spending some time learning the basics of OAuth and OpenID flows from a mixture of Auth0 and OpenID documentation. Then I read the various Google API and auth docs and ended up confused. Google spreads the documentation around several places and it is not always consistent or precise. In addition, Google’s docs are often unclear on whether they are describing access from a client or backend and which specific authentication flows they are talking about. Finally, they often use their own SDKs (or libraries), which obscures the details and is largely irrelevant. This also adds another large download for client users.\n\nGetting Nowhere Very Slowly\n\nAfter exploring the Google APIs with some experimental code accessing them directly from the SPA I wanted to pull my hair out. The Picasa API in particular is very flaky in how it handles CORS and authentication. Plan B was to use Auth0 to do all the heavy lifting. My hope was their Lock widget would solve the technical issues relatively easily. For example, Lock handles the nonce and state attributes used to stop hacking. Lock is also flexible in user experience options, for example it easily allows the addition of extra services. However, I soon found out the access_token that Lock provides to a SPA is not usable in Google APIs and it was hard to find any answers.\n\nLock is an embeddable login form for desktop, tablet and mobile devices. It provides the easiest way for securing your website and mobile apps.\n\nAt this point, I started to think that backend access was going to be the solution. In addition to reliable access there's also the question of what to do when tokens expire. We need to avoid having the user keep logging in, so refresh tokens will be required which must be stored securely in the backend, as they effectively allow endless access. Several other design requirements pointed to backend access, and using Azure Functions meant a rapid development and relatively low DevOps requirements. Win - win.\n\nI found after more experimental code that this did eventually work out, but only after I stumbled across a highly relevant Auth0 document and requested help from the awesome Nico, a Customer Success Engineer at Auth0. As Nico pointed out, if you use Auth0 as the identity provider then even when proxying other third party identity providers, the access_token s you get are from Auth0. They can be used with Auth0 APIs or your own, but are not what third party APIs require. Auth0 does provide a mechanism for backend code to get the access_token from third party identity providers. However, the token is hidden in the Auth0 UI for security purposes.\n\nAuth0 and Azure Functions: Making Life Easy\n\nWithout further delay, here's the low-down on what you need to do to let a user sign in with Google via the Auth0 Lock and then access a Google API with their credentials, using the Google access_token . I'll also present some links to important docs. Here's the complete flow we use:\n\nSPA displays the Auth0 Lock passing suitable options User logs in with Google, approving access to requested scopes (eg read photos, read emails) If required, Auth0 creates a new Auth0 user linked to the Google user SPA gets the Auth0 user id_token and access_token SPA calls the backend HTTP endpoint to get a list of photos, etc., and passes the access_token with this request Backend Azure Functions validates the JWT and optionally checks the user is allowed access Backend uses the userid in the access_token to find the user profile using the Auth0 admin API Backend extracts the Google access_token from the user’s profile. Backend calls the Google Picasa API and processes the results, returning them to the SPA in the HTTP response\n\nIn order for this to work, you need to have the following configured:\n\nYou should also read:\n\nHere is a simple vanilla HTML and JavaScript example that allows the user to sign in with the Auth0 Lock and then calls the Azure Functions backend to get a list of Google Photos albums:\n\n<!doctype html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"> <title>Auth0 and Google APIs</title> <script src=\"https://cdn.auth0.com/js/lock/10.9.1/lock.min.js\"></script> </head> <body> <button id=\"btn-login\">Login</button> <button id=\"btn-get\">Get Albums</button> <pre id=\"profile\"/> <script> function getGoogleAlbums(accessToken) { var AZUREFUNCTION = 'AZURE FUNCTION URL HERE' var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest() xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function() { if (this.readyState == 4 /*&& this.status == 200*/) { alert(this.status+'\\r\n\n'+this.responseText.replace(/\\\\\"/g,'')) } } xmlhttp.open(\"GET\", AZUREFUNCTION, true); xmlhttp.setRequestHeader('Authorization', `Bearer ${accessToken}`) xmlhttp.send(); } var lock = new Auth0Lock( 'THIS CLIENTS ID HERE', 'DOMAIN.eu.auth0.com', { allowedConnections: ['google-oauth2'], allowForgotPassword: false, allowSignUp: false, closable: false, auth: { connection_scopes: { 'google-oauth2': ['https://picasaweb.google.com/data/'] }, params: { scope: 'openid profile photos', audience: 'https://API_ID HERE' }, responseType: \"id_token token\" }, languageDictionary: { title: \"Sign into Google\" } } ); // Listening for the Lock authenticated event lock.on(\"authenticated\", function(authResult) { localStorage.setItem('accessToken', authResult.accessToken); localStorage.setItem('idToken', authResult.idToken); lock.getUserInfo(authResult.accessToken, function(error, profile) { if (error) { // Handle error return; } localStorage.setItem('profile', JSON.stringify(profile)); }); }); document.getElementById('btn-login').addEventListener('click', function() { lock.show(); }) document.getElementById('btn-get').addEventListener('click', function() { var accessToken = localStorage.getItem('accessToken') var idToken = localStorage.getItem('idToken') getGoogleAlbums(accessToken) }) function view() { // Verify that there's a token in localStorage var token = localStorage.getItem('accessToken'); if (token) { showProfile(); } } function showProfile() { var profile = JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('profile')),null,2); document.getElementById('profile').textContent = profile; } view() </script> </body> </html>\n\nNow for the Azure Functions backend code. This is a JavaScript HTTP Azure Function with the method set to GET . Tokens are passed from the frontend code above in a URL parameter.\n\nNote, this initial block of constants should not normally be included in the main code (if only to stop you accidently checking your secrets into GitHub). Rather it’s good practice to place them in the Function App Service’s Settings and reference them from the code.\n\n// constants const AUTH0_DOMAIN_URL = 'https://DOMAIN.auth0.com' const AUTH0_API_ID = 'https://API_ID' const AUTH0_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE = `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- <Get this from the Auth0 client Advanced settings -> certificates> -----END CERTIFICATE-----` const AUTH0_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR ADMIN CLIENT APP ID' const AUTH0_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET = 'YOUR ADMIN APP CLIENT SECRET'\n\nThis main body of the code can be added via the Azure Functions console:\n\n// Create decorator that checks the JWT signature and specified fields const jwtValidateDecorator = require('./azure-functions-auth0')({ clientId: AUTH0_API_ID, clientSecret: AUTH0_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE, algorithms: ['RS256'], domain: `${AUTH0_DOMAIN_URL}/` }) // The main Functions Function module.exports = jwtValidateDecorator((context, req) => { if (req.user) { // Get a token to access the admin API getAdminAccessToken() .then(({object: {access_token}}) => { const userId = req.user.sub // has been added to the req by the decorator return getUserProfile(access_token, userId) }) // Get the album list from google .then(({object}) => { const google_access_token = object.identities[0].access_token // hidden from the Auth0 console return getAlbums(google_access_token) }) // Get the album titles .then(({object: {feed: {entry}}}) => { const titles = entry.map(ent => ent.title.$t) return { status: 200, body: JSON.stringify(titles), headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'} } }) .catch(err => { return { status: 400, body: err.message } }) .then(res => { context.done(null, res) }) } else { const res = { status: 400, body: 'Something is wrong with the Authorization token' } context.done(null, res) } })\n\nHere are the supporting functions called from the main code block above. They can be placed in the same Function for simplicity. An alternative is to place them in a separate module file and “require” them as usual with Node.js. Azure Functions allows you to provide several Functions and supporting code in a single Functions App. const request = require('request')\n\n// Call a remote HTTP endpoint and return a JSON object function requestObject(options) { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { request(options, function (error, response, body) { if (error) { reject(error); } else if ((200 > response.statusCode) || (299 < response.statusCode)) { reject(new Error(`Remote resource ${options.url} returned status code: ${response.statusCode}: ${body}`)) } else { const object = (typeof body === 'string') ? JSON.parse(body) : body // FIXME throws resolve({code: response.statusCode, object}) } }) }) } // Get an access token for the Auth0 Admin API function getAdminAccessToken() { const options = { method: 'POST', url: `${AUTH0_DOMAIN_URL}/oauth/token`, headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' }, body: { client_id: AUTH0_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID, client_secret: AUTH0_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET, audience: `${AUTH0_DOMAIN_URL}/api/v2/`, grant_type: 'client_credentials' }, json: true } return requestObject(options) } // Get the user's profile from the Admin API function getUserProfile(accessToken, userID) { const options = { method: 'GET', url: `${AUTH0_DOMAIN_URL}/api/v2/users/${userID}`, headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}` } } return requestObject(options) } // Get user Google Photos album list function getAlbums(accessToken) { const options = { method: 'GET', //url: `https://www.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/labels`, url: 'https://picasaweb.google.com/data/feed/api/user/default?alt=json', headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}` } } return requestObject(options) }\n\nWe need to check the Auth0 access_token is valid before allowing the API code to be executed. This is done by a decorator (or wrapper) function based on the npm azure_functions_auth0 module but modified to work correctly with an Auth0 API access_token .\n\n// azure_functions_auth0.js // based on the npm package azure-functions-auth0 // But modified to handle the Auth0 API accessToken const jwt = require('express-jwt'); //import ArgumentError from './errors/ArgumentError'; const ArgumentError = Error module.exports = (options) => { if (!options || !(options instanceof Object)) { throw new ArgumentError('The options must be an object.'); } if (!options.clientId || options.clientId.length === 0) { throw new ArgumentError('The Auth0 Client or API ID has to be provided.'); } if (!options.clientSecret || options.clientSecret.length === 0) { throw new ArgumentError('The Auth0 Client or API Secret has to be provided.'); } if (!options.domain || options.domain.length === 0) { throw new ArgumentError('The Auth0 Domain has to be provided.'); } const middleware = jwt({ secret: options.clientSecret, audience: options.clientId, issuer: options.domain, algorithms: options.algorithms }) return (next) => { return (context, req) => { middleware(req, null, (err) => { if (err) { const res = { status: err.status || 500, body: { message: err.message } }; return context.done(null, res); } return next(context, req); }); }; }; };\n\nRunning the Code\n\nFor a local client development server, I simply installed npm package 'lite-server' configured to port 8000 with a ‘bs-config.json’ file.\n\nFor the backend, you'll need to create an HTTP Azure Function with the method set to GET. You'll also need to install the two npm dependencies of express-jwt and request . In the Azure Functions control panel go to \"Functions App Settings\" -> \"Console\" to open up a console. Then cd to the folder for your function and enter the following command:\n\nnpm install express-jwt request\n\nYou'll also need to set up CORS by adding your client URL - eg. localhost:8000. This is found in the Azure Functions console panel and click on \"Function app settings\" -> \"Configure CORS\". Finally, copy the Function’s URL into the SPA code constants block.\n\nObservations\n\nAs this is a Serverless backend with no local state storage, the same authorization code will run for every similar endpoint. We can tidy up the code to be more DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) by moving the code to get the Auth0 Admin and Google access_token s into a module shared by all your Functions in the Function App.\n\nConclusion\n\nAuth0 provides all the features needed to access Google APIs with a user’s credentials. When a user signs in through Auth0 you get an Auth0 access token. You then need to obtain the third party access token for Google’s APIs. This is done with backend code for security. The code accesses the user’s profile via the Auth0 Admin API and can then obtain the access token provided when the user signed in with Google.\n\nAzure Functions provides an ideal way to create the backend code in Node.js without the need to create and configure servers or Node itself. An HTTP function is easy to create and configure via the Azure Functions control panel, or everything can be done locally and then deployed to Azure.\n\nBest of all, both Auth0 and Azure Functions provide free subscriptions that allow you to explore them in detail.

The five-time national champion finished in 2 minutes, 32.13 seconds — nearly 35 seconds slower than her personal best of 1:57.34 in 2010 in Monaco.\n\n\"I've been running throughout my pregnancy and I felt really, really good during the whole process,\" Montano said after the qualifying heat.\n\nThat the 28-year-old former University of California star finished last in her heat didn't matter one bit to the crowd gathered at Hornet Stadium. Trailing the lead pack by more than 120 meters for most of the race, Montano received a rousing ovation as she finished her first lap and the cheering grew louder when she finally crossed the finish line.\n\n\"I just didn't want to get lapped and be the first person to get lapped in the 800,\" said Montano, the 800 national champion the past four years.\n\nShe was never close to being lapped, taking a nice relaxed pace from the start and maintaining it throughout.\n\nThat was according to the plan Montano laid out after consulting with her physician. Not only did doctors give Montano the OK to run, they encouraged her.\n\n\"That took away any fear of what the outside world might think about a woman running during her pregnancy,\" Montano said. \"What I found out mostly was that exercising during pregnancy is actually much better for the mom and the baby. ...

  "latent_23449": "Article by LEON TROTSKY translated into English for first time\n\nOn the first anniversary of the start of the war, LEON TROTSKY wrote this perceptive assessment of the situation, and the need for a Marxist analysis and programme. Originally published on 4 August 1915 in Nashe Slovo (Our Word), a Paris-based newspaper for Russian revolutionaries, this is the first time it has been translated into English – by Pete Dickenson.\n\nThe past year – 365 days and nights of continuous mutual extermination of the peoples – will go down in our history as a staggering testament to how deeply humanity is still imprisoned in shameful blind barbarism by its social roots.\n\nIn order to stigmatize the German Mausers, which have a bigger diameter than the Allied guns, and the German shells, which spread their suffocating stench further than those of the Quadruple Entente1, Allied rhetoric created a special term, ‘barbarie scientifique’ or scientific barbarism. The perfect term! It is only necessary to extend it to the entire war and its socio-historical background – regardless of state and national borders. All those technical forces that created human progress moved to the business of the destruction of the cultural foundations of society and, above all, of the annihilation of mankind: this is the ‘mobilisation of industry’, which is now spoken about in all the languages of European civilization. Educated barbarism is armed with all the conquests of human genius – from Archimedes to Edison – to erase from the surface of the earth everything created by humanity collectively, by Archimedes and Edison. If the Germans stand out in this bloody, insane competition, it is only because they are more widely, systematically and efficiently organised than their mortal enemies.\n\nAs if to give the fall of mankind the most humiliating character, the war, using the latest proud technological conquest of aviation, has driven man into trenches, into dirty earthen caves, sewers, where the rulers of nature, eaten away by parasites, lying in their own filth, lie in wait for other troglodytes, covered with lice, and newspapers and politicians in various languages all say that it is precisely this that is now serving civilization. Crawling on all fours from the dark primordial swamp, humanity brought its organised mind to bear in the struggle with nature. By heroic revolutionary upheavals, it brought elements of reason to state structures, displacing blind inertia, ‘by the Grace of God’, with the idea of popular sovereignty and a parliamentary regime. But in the very foundations of its social life, in its economic organisation, humanity remains entirely in the grip of dark forces, beyond rational control, which are always threatening to spontaneously explode with accumulated contradictions and then bring them down onto the head of mankind, in the form of global catastrophes.\n\nColossal, shameful war\n\nEurope, torn by capitalist development from medieval provincialism and economic inertia, in a series of revolutions and wars, created incomplete ‘national’ states, from both large and small powers, and linked them in a transient and ever-changing scheme of antagonisms, alliances and agreements. Nowhere having achieved national unity, capitalist development came into conflict with the state framework it had created, and for the last half-century sought a way out in continuous colonial plunder, leading, untypical for Europe, to an ‘armed peace’. This system, in which the ruling upper classes economically, politically and psychologically adapted themselves to the monstrous growth of militarism, gave birth to a war for world domination – the most colossal and shameful war that history has known.\n\nThe war has already involved seven of the eight great powers and threatens to involve the eighth2; in order to broaden its base, it draws in the minor powers one after the other (all the work of diplomacy now consists of this). It automatically dissolves individual subordinate aims into the mechanics of mutual debilitation, exhaustion and extermination. With the generality, formlessness and multiplicity of its aims, combining and throwing against each other all races and nationalities, all state systems and all stages of capitalist development, this war of usurpation wants to show that it is completely free from any racial or national origins, religious or political principles – it simply expresses the bare fact of the impossibility of the further coexistence of peoples and states on the basis of capitalist imperialism.\n\nThe system of alliances, as it developed after the Franco-Prussian war, was generated by a desire to create a guarantee of stability of states through a rough military balance of opposing forces. This equilibrium, demonstrated by the current ‘guerre d’usure’ (war of attrition), precludes the possibility of a fast and decisive victory of one party and makes the outcome of the war dependent on the gradual depletion of the approximately equal material and moral resources of the opponents.\n\nOn the western front, the thirteenth month of the war finds the trenches in about the same place they were in the second month. Here they have moved tens of metres in either direction – through the bodies of thousands and tens of thousands of soldiers. On the Gallipoli Peninsula, as well as on the new Austro-Italian front, the lines of trenches immediately signified lines of military hopelessness. On the Russian-Turkish border it is the same picture on a provincial scale. Only on the eastern (Russian) front, giant armies, after a series of movements in both directions, now roll back to the east onto the body of ravaged Poland, which each party promises to ‘liberate’.\n\nIn this picture, generated by the blind automatism of capitalist forces and the conscious shame of the ruling classes, there are absolutely no points of reference that, from a military point of view, would allow, in any way whatsoever, any hopes and plans to be linked with a decisive victory for either side. If only the ruling powers of Europe had as much historical good intent as bad, then they would still have been powerless by force of arms to resolve the problems that caused the war. The strategic situation in Europe gives a mechanical expression to the historical impasse, into which the capitalist world has driven itself.\n\nInternational’s bloody crime\n\nEven if the socialist parties were powerless to prevent the war in its first period, or to hold the rulers to account, if from the outset they had declined to take any responsibility for the global carnage, and the parties had used their close links to warn the people against the rulers and to denounce them, played a waiting game – in the sense of revolutionary action, counting on the inevitable turn in the mass mood – how great would now have been the authority of international socialism to the masses. Deceived by militarism, weighed down by mourning and increasing want, all the more would the masses have turned their eyes to the true shepherd of the peoples!\n\nLook! In a condition of desperation, both groups of military powers are now grasping for every small state: Romania, Bulgaria or Greece, for the l’etat du Destin (the country of destiny), whose weight could finally tip the balance in one direction or another. What really would be a ‘make or break’ weight under these conditions is the International, the great power of international socialism, whose every word would find an ever greater echo in the minds of the masses! The liberation programme, which individual sections of the broken International are now dragging through the bloody filth in the tail of the General Staff baggage train, would become a powerful reality in an international appeal of the socialist proletariat against all the forces of the old society.\n\nBut history, even at this time, remained stepmother to the oppressed class. Its national parties incorporated into their organisations not only the initial successes of the proletariat, not only its desire for total liberation, but also all of the indecision of the oppressed class, its lack of self-confidence, its instinct for submission to the state. These parties have been passively dragged into the world catastrophe and, making a cowardly virtue of necessity, took it upon themselves to cover up an unprincipled bloody crime with the lie of liberation mythology. Arising from a half-century of world antagonisms the military catastrophe was a disaster transferred onto the edifice of the fifty year-old International. The anniversary of the war is also the anniversary of the most terrible fall of the strongest parties of the international proletariat.\n\nThe only way out\n\nAnd yet we meet the bloody anniversary without any mental decline or political scepticism. Revolutionary internationalists had the inestimable advantage that they held their position in the face of the world’s greatest catastrophe, with analysis, criticism and revolutionary foresight. We renounced all the ‘national’ point-scoring issuing from the General Staff, not only those with a cheap price tag, but even those with a surcharge. We continued to see things as they are, to call them by their names and anticipate the logic of their further movement. We have seen how, in a mad kaleidoscope in front of bleeding humanity, old illusions were adopted and new programmes hastily adapted to them, they were approved and, in the maelstrom of events, failed, yielding place to new illusions and more new programmes that hurtled to the same fate, all the more exposing the truth. And the social truth is always revolutionary!\n\nMarxism, the method of our orientation to the historical process and the instrument of our intervention in this process, is able to withstand the blows of 75mm guns, as well as the 42cm Mausers. It prevailed when the parties standing, it seemed, under its banner were shattered. Marxism is not a snapshot of working-class consciousness – it gives the laws of historical development of the working class. In its struggle for liberation the working class can be unfaithful to Marxism – by sheer force of circumstances, the analysis of which constitutes Marxism – but in betraying Marxism, the working class betrays itself. Through downfall and disappointment, through tragic disasters, arriving at new, higher forms of self-knowledge, the working class again comes to Marxism, consolidating and deepening in its consciousness its latest revolutionary conclusions.\n\nThis is the process that we have seen over the last year. The logic of the situation of the working class powerfully drives it out everywhere from under the yoke of the national bloc and – an even greater miracle! – clears out from many socialist brains the mould of possibilism. Despite their apparent success, how pathetic and contemptible seem the hasty efforts of the official parties once again to proclaim at their meetings, the revolutionary role of the states’ melinite3 and to inculcate, through multiple repetition, the slavish illusion of ‘the defence of the fatherland’, not leaving the great imperialist road!\n\nThe hopeless military situation, the parasitic greed of the ruling capitalist cliques feeding on this hopelessness, the widespread growth of armed reaction, the impoverishment of the masses and, as a result of this, a slow but steady sobering of the working class – this is a genuine reality, the further development of which will not be held back by any force in the world! In the bowels of all the parties of the International is a process, as yet only an ideological revolt, against militarism and chauvinist ideology – a process that not only saves the honor of socialism, but also indicates to the nations the only way out of the war, with its slogan ‘to the end’, this finished formulation coming up against the blind alley of ‘scientific barbarism’.\n\nTo serve this process is the highest task which now exists on our bloody and dishonored planet!\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

My posited ultra-handheld device category is still in the mysterious future and tablet sales have slowed. There are certainly interesting developments – smart watches, virtual and augmented realities and whatnot – but none seems to have the scope to really hit like mobile did. We may be seeing the audience just settling in with what they have.\n\nFamiliar Shapes\n\nIn 2014, despite everything else, it’s still all about the smartphone. PC sales may be up and Sony may have sold a fair few PlayStation 4s, but Apple sold 10m iPhone 6’s in a weekend. And when you think about it that makes a lot of sense. Potential platforms are more specialist than the smartphone. You’ll use VR in certain circumstances and your tablet in others, but you’ll likely have your phone with through all of those situations. Phones handle all of your quick computing, your easy access apps and a variety of other media functions too (photos, music, etc). Of course phones would remain the core around which everything else you do would work.\n\nThose of us in tech and games are conditioned to expect total revision every two or three years now, almost to expect it. But it’s not really happening. Though they may have bigger and smaller sizes and new features, the smartphone looks to be as durable a paradigm as the PC has been. 20 years from now we’ll largely still use them in much the same way as we do today. They’re not going anywhere. There will be an iPhone 7, 8, 9, 29, and 209. Well maybe not that last one, but still. Perhaps it’s okay to assume that we’re moving into a phase of relative platform stability.\n\nSo what does that mean for games? Sometimes the games industry settles into a routine, a way of being where recent innovations are absorbed and exploited. At those times it’s less about what’s new and exciting in technology or business and more about simply putting what’s out there to good use. A key canary in this particular coal mine is the way that developers drift back to looking for publishing money. Another is the way that brands start to reassert themselves, and how licensed content starts to seem like an attractive business model. A third is how games stop hitting the headlines outside the usual channels.\n\nPrimarily though it’s watching how, with the old order having been previously unseated, new orders start to morph into next year’s old orders. In mobile gaming this started to happen about 18-24 months ago. As the iPhone got all full up things like the cost of user acquisition started to rise and the prevalence of incumbent games sitting at tops of charts became all too apparent. We slowly started to see the tail off of breakout games (with Flappy Bird acting as the great exception) and an increase in talk of bigger budgets, more competition on visuals, a need for game companies to get good at PR, speculation over the power of YouTubers to overcome discovery woes and subsequent speculation about the ethics of sponsored coverage in that medium.\n\nAll of this is essentially the move toward stability.\n\nTwo Roads\n\nWhen platform are in their unstable phase, nobody knows anything the rules for success are anarchic. Games that “should” succeed totally fail whereas games that shouldn’t ride the waves to monstrous success. However when stability does begin to emerge it tends to mean that two avenues for success form, and the degree to which they are success depends on the particular platform.\n\nThe first road is to sell games based on distribution-led strategies. Thats’ where all that talk of user acquisition, retention, advertising, paying for clicks and views and plays and installs and so on comes in. That sort of thinking usually surfaces early and settles on a variety of tactics for success, and it usually drives some notables in the space. The sense of conventional wisdom moves quickly but adopts relatively comfortable shapes, and both startups and investors buy into that wisdom (regardless of how true it is: a good example is that gaming startups and investors often still believe that mobile game companies should strive for a catalog of releases – even though all the data says otherwise). For those that get in on the ground early this is the time when you see big exits from companies that only formed 3/4 previously.\n\nHowever this approach tends to tap out. While the process-oriented side of the business tends to figure out the early shape of what works in any platform it also tends to red-ocean itself into stasis pretty quickly. Companies that operate that way never really know how to value creativity and their culture eventually winks it out, leaving nothing but stat-head thinkers who get trapped in you-can-only-improve-what-you-can-measure thinking. Ultimately they stall, sometimes even falling back just as quickly as they first arose. It turns out that for all their structure and process the product that they’ve built engenders little true loyalty. It’s just a game, same as any other.\n\nThis is where the second road starts to matter. it’s the game developer who treats their game as a piece of media, of art. They focus on selling the vision of the game, of building a pre-selected audience and a marketing story. Rather than make the conversation all about business, they make it about the journey, about the magic of the game, the thauma, the fiction and the promise of what it will be. This path is as completely different from the business-led path as HBO and other cable television channels are to regularly broadcast TV. Broadcast is a world of low-rent product that sells based on reach. HBO is a world of selling on quality, on vision and voice. And usually it comes after the business wave, after the first roaders have done their thing.\n\nIs that happening in mobile? I really hope so. One encouraging example of this is Robin Hunicke’s studio Funomena, working on a new game Luna (pictured above). At the Mobile Games Forum in Seattle this week, she stood up on stage and talked about its artistic influences, the kind of experience she was trying to create and the importance of games-as-art and finding not just customer but a fan, of building a relationship. Another is the wonderful adventure that is Monument Valley. Speaking about what it’s like to develop that kind of game, lead designer Ken Wong is keen to stress how the studio maintained an entirely quality-first approach. A third is Camouflaj’s episodic game Republique, which continues to try to make storytelling/adventure work in this new space.\n\nBeyond a certain point every platform needs its artists to keep it growing. It takes orthogonal thinking by people who aren’t businesslike to engender a wider and more lasting conversation, to find the new genres, new ideas of what might work and so on. The reason I say “I hope so” that these kinds of games are happening in mobile is bigger than simply saying I like cool games though. I do, but I also mean “It’s not certain”.\n\nBut Where’s Our HBO Equivalent?\n\nArtists need organizations structured to support their efforts. They need patrons. In console gaming that patronage layer exists with some publishers and platform holders like Sony, people who can offer an umbrella in which quirk can be allowed to manifest and sometimes come good. On PC Steam sort-of offered an environment that permitted that to happen, although Valve didn’t actively fund many of the games on there.\n\nIn mobile, however, patrons are lacking. There are publishers, some of them ambitious, some of whom talk in terms of helping developers and giving them fair deals, but none of them really constitute patrons yet. They’re too meat-and-potatoes still, usually operating with limited remits and asking for big business cases to be proven around potential games before they’ll invest. And so it’s left to individual developers to secure financing in an uncertain landscape. That kind of effort is rarely scalable.\n\nHBO style TV needed HBO to make it happen. Without that organization TV would have stayed in the hands of process thinkers and never gone much beyond game shows and soaps. Gaming is much the same. Mobile games could do with a more ambitious kind of publisher, but we’re not really seeing that yet. Aside from hearing Robin Hunicke, the vast majority of the day’s conversation at MGF was still very meat-and-potatoes. It was talks about the psychology of winning and monetization techniques, app discovery strategies and what packages to include in your game to improve performance. Still very first-road in other words, still just about process. And it’s been like that for a while, essentially just repeating and repeating.\n\nWill anyone step up and rethink mobile publishing and bring forth the next wave of mobile games? That is the question.",
  "latent_23700": "On screen, restaurants can tell audiences a whole lot more about characters besides their favorite foods. It’s a fact that is made eminently clear in the show Billions. The Showtime series, which stars Damien Lewis as a billionaire hedge fund manager and Paul Giamatti as the U.S. Attorney trying to take him down, frequently finds its characters dining out in New York City. On a recent episode of the Eater Upsell, co-creator of Billions Brian Koppelman explained to hosts Helen Rosner and Greg Morabito what the audience can learn by paying attention to the restaurants featured in Billions.\n\nFor example, the first time the audience meets Lewis’s character Bobby Axelrod, he indulges in a slice of pizza at a classic New York slice joint, one that he has been going to since childhood. The choice is deliberate. “That scene came out of a conversation in the writers' room about how to connect with who Axe really is as a person, separate from who he is in business,” Koppelman says.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, Koppelman uses restaurants to connote extreme wealth. In a scene from Season 2, Momofuku chef David Chang, appearing as himself, serves Axelrod and an associate a private dinner at Momofuku Ko. “There's a lot of stuff that [scene] can tell you, about how the New York food world works, what Bobby Axelrod's place in New York City is, what he's trying to show the guy that he's taking to dinner,” Koppelman explains.\n\nAxelrod’s wealth and power mean a private dinner from one of New York City’s most famous chefs (within the television show’s universe as well as in real life) isn’t out of reach. “The world that those two people live in is such that the two of them maybe met at somebody else's table one night, and developed some sort of relationship, and maybe that guy gave a chef his plane to use for a weekend, and the chef said, ‘Anytime you want,’” Koppelman adds. “Any of that stuff could have happened that result in the guy sitting there alone at Ko.”\n\nThese analyses may be straightforward, but the most recent season of Billions also included a scene that required slightly more food knowledge to dissect. Wags, Axelrod’s right hand man played by David Costabile, dines at New York’s Sushi Nakazawa, the omakase counter run by Daisuke Nakazawa, a protege of documentary-famous Jiro Ono. While there, Wags witnesses some suited-up finance bros wrapping their sushi in ginger and drowning it in soy sauce. He breaks from conversing with the chef in Japanese to point out their error. In the midst of an expletive-filled rant he tells them, “This man is an artist. He had to spend 10 years learning how to make the tamago.”\n\nWith this context, the power dynamics at play in the scene become clear. “If you're watching the show and you don't know that stuff, it's still great to see a guy freak out that someone's eating sushi wrong, and then you go, ‘Is this guy the asshole, or is that guy the asshole?’,” Koppelman says. “If you know that backstory, it's really clear who the asshole is.”\n\nHear the complete interview with Brian Koppelman as he talks about spreading the word on his favorite restaurants, engaging with chefs, and why screenwriting is his favorite form of self expression.

  "latent_23788": "Iran might have hit Turkish soldiers, Pentagon says\n\nTolga Tanış - WASHINGTON\n\nA drone that killed four Turkish soldiers last week in Syria might belong to Iran, the Pentagon has said.There are four actors who might have conducted the deadly attack, a senior U.S. official told Hürriyet following a report in which a senior Turkish official said an Iranian-made drone was used in the attack in northern Syria.“These are the coalition, Russia, the Assad regime and Iran-backed Shia militias,” said the U.S. official.“It is not the coalition. ‘We didn’t,’ Russia said. There is no reason for them to conduct such an attack, and also there is no indication contradicting what they say. So the only two left are the regime and the militias. Iran has the capability. We know that they have armed UAVs. And there are Shia militias around Rasm al-Abboud where this UAV took off from. So it might be Iran,” the official said.Turkey identified the drone as Iranian-made, but it has still not identified whether Hezbollah, the Quds Force or another Shiite militia group in Syria had used it, Hürriyet Daily News reporter Sevil Erkuş quoted the Turkish official as saying on Dec. 7.The drone killed four Turkish soldiers on Nov. 24.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, accompanied by National Intelligence Agency (MİT) Chief Hakan Fidan, paid a surprise visit to Tehran early on Nov. 26, where the Turkish delegation discussed “issues regarding ISIL and counter-terrorism” with Iran and also raised the issue that their findings on the attack on Turkish soldiers in Syria indicated that an Iranian-made unmanned drone was used, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Hürriyet Daily News.The Turkey-backed rebels’ operation near al-Bab is not part of the NATO coalition against the jihadist group, the U.S. official also said.“Turkey started the Jarablus operation unilaterally,” the official said, referring to the Euphrates Shield operation that began on Aug. 24.“Then after an agreement we reached to clear the border area from ISIS [ISIL] and to create a buffer zone, we supported the operation. Dabiq was out of this buffer zone. Yet, the coalition gave support when Turkey-backed opposition groups liberated Dabiq. But when Turkey advanced south from Dabiq, it was different than what we agreed, and the coalition didn’t support these efforts,” the official said.When asked why the coalition had not supported the Turkish advance on al-Bab, the official said: “Our concern about al-Bab is that the area is too close to the location where Syrian regime forces are. It is dangerous when the Turkish military and the regime forces are that close. We don’t want to see it.”The official replied affirmatively when asked if the U.S. was concerned about a clash between the People’s Protection Unit (YPG) forces, which are also advancing toward al-Bab, and the Turkish military.Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) and its armed wing, the YPG, as terrorist groups linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).“We are also concerned about a clash between YPG and Turkish forces. We are concerned about all efforts that would distract from the efforts focusing on ISIS,” the official said.",

  "latent_23897": "One year ago this morning, a lone gunman walked into a house of worship and stalked the prayer hall, communal kitchen and living rooms. Wherever he saw people, he lifted his gun without expression and fired. He killed six people and critically wounded others, including a police officer.\n\nThe August 5, 2012 mass shooting in Oak Creek, Wisconsin received national attention for a few days, but then faded into the background as one in a list of mass shootings last year. One year later, people I meet know Aurora and Newtown but draw a blank when I use the shorthand \"Oak Creek.\"\n\nIf the gunman were seen as Muslim, and the victims Christians, gathered in a Sunday church service, we may still be talking about Oak Creek today. But the gunman was a white supremacist. And the victims were Sikh Americans whose men wear turbans as part of their faith.\n\nToday, on the one-year anniversary, we must remember Oak Creek as the largest act of violence on a faith community since the 1963 church bombings. We must remember the Sikh community's response to the shooting because it offers a model for how one small community can rise from the ashes of tragedy to bring people together in forgiveness and healing - and even effect policy change. But most of all, we must remember the story of Oak Creek because it could happen again.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Oak Creek tragedy, the Sikh community entered the national spotlight for the first time. In the midst of grief, the community found the courage to explain their faith, respond with forgiveness, and call for healing. Sikh youth of Oak Creek stepped before news cameras to call for an end to hate - not just against Sikhs but against all people. The families cleaned the gurdwara themselves, turning a site of massacre back into a house of worship, and gathered to pray for the departed, including the gunman.\n\n\"Last year, we prayed for the soul of Wade Michael Page,\" said Raghuvinder Singh, whose father Punjab Singh remains hospitalized one year after the shooting, unable to move or speak except to blink his eyes. \"Our faith teaches us compassion for every person. We continue to pray that his soul goes in peace.\"\n\nIn the last year, many Sikh Americans have extended the ethic of compassion into seva or sacred service. In Oak Creek, Sikhs have formed new organizations including Serve2Unite and Sikh Healing Collective. Pardeep Kaleka, whose father was killed fighting the gunman, has teamed up with Arno Michaelis, a former white supremacist, speaking to young people about combatting hate.\n\nAnother victim's son, Harpreet Saini, whose mother was killed in the shooting, became the first Sikh in U.S. history to testify before Congress in a historic Senate hearing last September. He asked the government to give his mother the dignity of at least being counted as a hate crime statistic, to measure the problem so that we can begin to address it. The Sikh Coalition, joined by civil rights and faith-based organizations, including Groundswell at Auburn Seminary, led a campaign calling for the FBI to track hate crimes against Sikhs and other communities - and won.\n\n\"We've made progress in the last year,\" said Amardeep Singh Bhalla of the Sikh Coalition. \"But one year later, the underlying conditions that allowed Oak Creek to happen are still in play.\"\n\nHate groups in America are on an alarming rise by almost 70 percent since 2000, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. In the last year, Sikhs have continued to endure discrimination, bullying, vandalism, racial profiling, and gun violence. In Fresno, California, an 81-year-old Sikh man, Piara Singh, was badly beaten with steel pipe while walking home from temple. In a Florida attack, Kanwaljit Singh sustained multiple gunshot wounds from an unidentified shooter while driving with his 13-year-old son. In Washington, a turban-wearing Sikh cab driver was brutally attacked and beaten by a man screaming anti-Muslim and racial slurs. Just days ago, the walls of a Sikh house of worship in Sacramento were defaced by graffiti spelling out \"terrorist.\"\n\nOak Creek is not an isolated incident. Yet, remarkably, rather than retreating into itself or thickening its walls against a future attack, Sikh gurdwaras in Wisconsin and across the country have opened up to the broader community in the last year.\n\nIn Oak Creek this weekend, thousands of people of all faiths and backgrounds attended the anniversary events - a federal observance on Friday, a memorial run on Saturday, prayer services on Sunday, and a candlelight vigil on Monday. The gurdwara has been bustling with Sikhs from Milwaukee and around the country, a wide array of Wisconsin residents, police officers, government officials, and survivors of other mass shootings. This openness embodies a sense that all people can share in the Sikh spirit of Chardi Kala--everlasting optimism and ever-rising high spirits, even in the face of suffering.\n\n\"I'm proud to represent Oak Creek,\" said Oak Creek Mayor Steve Scaffidi at the federal observance. \"Not as a scene of violence, but as a symbol of what one small community can do.\"\n\nToday, the gurdwara shows no sign of the massacre that took place there one year ago - except for a single bullet hole in the entrance to the prayer hall. The plaque below it reads \"We are One.\" The Oak Creek tragedy calls us to fulfill that promise, but first, we must choose to remember it.\n\nRemember Oak Creek. Watch the Film.

When the teacher ordered Stewart to go to his class, he cursed at her before picking up a wet floor sign and swinging it near the teacher's face.\n\nStewart was placed in double-locked handcuffs and placed in an EBRSO patrol car before he was taken to the EBR Parish Prison for booking.\n\nThe student later told deputies that he was \"just playing\" and did not actually hit the teacher with the sign.",

  "latent_24472": "COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka arrested two human rights activists in the former northern war zone, the military said on Monday, using anti-terrorism legislation that was used to crush Tamil Tiger rebels during the final phase of a 26-year war.\n\nRuki Fernando, a human rights adviser, and Praveen Mahesahn, a pastor and director of a rights group, were arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), which provides security forces with sweeping powers for the arrest and detention of suspects.\n\n“Police have taken them into custody under PTA for questioning as they have visited some place, suspicious in nature,” military spokesman Ruwan Wanigasooriya told Reuters.\n\nThe arrests were carried out by a terrorism investigation department of the police, which works closely with the military in the north.\n\nResidents living in the area where the two men were picked up said they had been gathering information on the circumstances surrounding the arrest last week of an ethnic Tamil woman in former rebel de-facto capital of Kilinochchi.\n\nBalendran Jayakumari, a 50-year-old widow and mother of four has been held under the counter-terrorism law for three months on charges of harboring a criminal who shot at a police officer to evade arrest.\n\nThe UN Human Rights High Commissioner Navi Pillay in a report last month expressed grave concern at the harassment and intimidation against individuals or groups who met or attempted to meet her.\n\nRights groups have criticized Sri Lanka over the abuse, and sometimes death, of suspects held in custody.\n\nThe arrest of the two activists came amid growing international pressure on the government to address allegations that tens of thousands of civilians were killed by the army in the final weeks of the war. Many more people are still missing.\n\nMilitary and police sources told Reuters Jayakumari and the two human rights defenders were detained on suspicion that they were involved in attempts to revive the defeated Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\n\nWestern governments and United Nations have asked the island nation to investigate alleged war crimes and continuing human rights abuses.\n\nThe United States has also called for a resolution at the U.N.’s Human Rights Council to investigate “past abuses and to examine more recent attacks on journalists, human rights defenders, and religious minorities.”\n\nThe U.S. embassy in Colombo urged the authorities to “ensure that all those detained are given transparent and due legal process, including full access to legal counsel.”\n\n“With these latest actions, we remain convinced that continued scrutiny by the Human Rights Council is necessary,” the Embassy said in a statement.",
  "latent_24504": "Stephen Dunn/Getty Images\n\nThis series will evaluate one team per day, starting on Jan. 23 and ending on Feb. 22 (the first game of spring training). It is based on last season's performance, the offseason changes since then and the author's outlook for the team in 2013. Please keep in mind that rosters can, and will, change before Opening Day. We started in the American League East, worked across to the National League, tackled the Central divisions, and now jump to the AL West, going in alphabetical order. Next up, the Seattle Mariners.\n\n2012 finish: 75-87 (4th place, AL West)\n\nNotable additions\n\nLHP Joe Saunders, RHP Jeremy Bonderman, RHP Kameron Loe, RHP Jon Garland, OF Raul Ibanez, OF Michael Morse, OF Jason Bay, 1B Kendrys Morales, 1B Mike Jacobs, 2B Robert Andino, C Kelly Shoppach, C Ronny Paulino.\n\nNotable losses\n\nLHP Jason Vargas, LHP George Sherrill, RHP Kevin Millwood, RHP Shawn Kelley, OF Scott Cousins, INF/OF Chone Figgins, OF Trayvon Robinson, C John Jaso, C Miguel Olivo.\n\nWhy they will improve this year\n\nI'm in love with this team. I'll just put that out there. The young talent is amazing and you'd have to be crazy to dislike Felix Hernandez. But in order to improve, the M's need big progressions from guys like Dustin Ackley, Kyle Seager and Jesus Montero.\n\nOne of the things holding Seattle back in recent years has been their lack of pop in the lineup. Safeco Field was where home runs went to die (Richie Sexson and Adrian Beltre can confirm), but they have moved the fences in for 2013.\n\nEven if they hadn't, the additions of sluggers Morse and Morales might still have added 25 homers each. The lineup is instantly upgraded with those two, as well as Ibanez off the bench as a designated hitter. I really like Vargas, but it was necessary to unload him for a big bat, and they may have found a better replacement with Saunders anyway.\n\nThe pitching staff should be strong again this season, but it's the strides they made on offense that intrigue me the most. Adding Morse, Morales and Ibanez are huge moves that will definitely improve a team that finished dead last in the American League in both runs scored and batting average a season ago. With the new bats, plus growth from the young guns, they could climb those ranks rapidly.\n\nWhy they will regress this year\n\nOne thing Mariners fans never wanted to hear, even if just a whisper, was that there could be something wrong with Hernandez's throwing arm. In a worst-case scenario, there actually is something wrong with that golden arm and the Mariners are absolutely sunk for 2013.\n\nWithout Hernandez, the team is significantly worse. But another big worry in Seattle is if Ackley continues to struggle with the bat (he definitely did not meet expectations in 2012), and Seager regresses from his powerful rookie season.\n\nBoth are very real possibilities. However, assuming the best for those two, what if Morse and Morales' power don't translate to Seattle? They can both hit the ball a mile, but as previously mentioned, that didn't help former big bats that came to Seattle. Even if they all have great years, will the offense be good enough? It will be tough to measure up to the Angels and Rangers in their own division.\n\nBehind Hernandez, the Mariners figure to line up Saunders, Hisashi Iwakuma, Blake Beaven and Erasmo Ramirez. Really? That's it? That's even more evidence that losing Hernandez would ruin this team's season. There's potential in that rotation, but it could be shockingly mediocre this year.\n\nThe outlook for 2013\n\nLike I wrote, I do really like this team. The lineup excites me and I really do expect Seager to continue growing and Ackley to turn it around after last year. Morse and Morales are two of my favorite \"under-the-radar\" players and I think they were exactly the right moves for Seattle.\n\nIf Hernandez is healthy, he will be one of the best pitchers in baseball again, but the biggest question marks for me come after that. Saunders has been pretty solid over the last few years, but can he be consistent? Even less of a sure thing is the rest of the rotation who is either inexperienced, young or both.\n\nOne thing I'm really looking forward to is seeing the impending call-ups of Taijuan Walker, Danny Hultzen and James Paxton. All three have been studs in the minor leagues and could make immediate impacts in the rotation down the stretch. And don't forget about top catching prospect Mike Zunino and top infield prospect Nick Franklin, who should get a shot at some point this year.\n\nFor me, watching the development of all the young talent will be the most exciting aspect of this Mariners season. I don't think 2013 is their year, but they are very close. In 2014, they could legitimately contend for the division title, as long as health and regression don't become huge issues.\n\nIt's the opinion of this writer that the Mariners stay stuck in fourth place, but finish at .500 and start opening some eyes around baseball. Once the aforementioned minor league pitchers, as well as Ackley, Montero and Seager really get comfortable, this team is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nPotential changes before Opening Day\n\nAccording to Pete Abraham on Twitter, the Red Sox have \"internally discussed\" acquiring Mike Carp, who was recently designated for assignment by Seattle. The Mariners have nothing to lose with him, and might as well try to pick up a prospect or two from Boston there.\n\nI doubt that general manager Jack Zduriencik will make a run at Kyle Lohse, but it wouldn't hurt if they can afford to give up that draft pick. If anything, I could see the M's making a run at another bullpen arm or two and a veteran bat like Casey Kotchman would have been nice if he didn't just sign with Miami.\n\nBiggest surprise: Joe Saunders\n\nBiggest disappointment: Jesus Montero\n\nBold prediction: Mike Morse hits 35 home runs, drives in 125 runs\n\nProjected lineup\n\n1. Dustin Ackley, 2B\n\n2. Franklin Gutierrez, CF\n\n3. Kyle Seager, 3B\n\n4. Michael Morse, LF\n\n5. Kendrys Morales, DH\n\n6. Jesus Montero, C\n\n7. Justin Smoak, 1B\n\n8. Michael Saunders, RF\n\n9. Brendan Ryan, SS\n\nProjected rotation\n\n1. Felix Hernandez, RHP\n\n2. Joe Saunders, LHP\n\n3. Hisashi Iwakuma, RHP\n\n4. Blake Beaven, RHP\n\n5. Erasmo Ramirez, RHP\n\nProjected finish: 81-81, 4th place\n\nFor more preseason evaluations:\n\nYou can follow Jeremy on Twitter @Jamblinman.",

Hundreds of staff members, reporters, business leaders and members of Congress were expected to travel with the president.\n\nThe CDC recommended that pregnant women avoid traveling to Cuba, adding the country to a long list of countries and territories listed in earlier advisories. The CDC also cautioned other travelers to Cuba, which lies less than 100 miles south of Florida, to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, including protecting themselves from mosquito bites and using condoms or abstaining from sex. The virus can be sexually transmitted from a male partner.\n\n[Lower risk for Zika at high altitudes, CDC says]\n\nSome three dozen nations and territories in the Americas are grappling with local transmission of Zika, including the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Aruba. On March 8, the World Health Organization joined with the CDC in advising pregnant women to avoid areas where the Zika virus is actively spreading.\n\nThough most people who are infected with Zika do not get sick or experience only mild symptoms, the virus is suspected in microcephaly, a serious birth defect in which children are born with undersize heads and underdeveloped brains, as well as Guillain-Barré, a rare neurological syndrome that can cause muscle weakness and paralysis. A study this month published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which examined a group of pregnant Brazilian women who tested positive for Zika infection, found that nearly one-third of the women had ultrasounds showing fetal anomalies with “grave outcomes.”\n\n[Mounting evidence points to Zika as culprit behind babies' brain damage]\n\nScientists have not developed a vaccine or treatment for Zika.\n\nNearly all cases in the continental United States have been limited to infected travelers who brought the virus back home from Latin America or other regions. But based on the spread of previous outbreaks, the CDC estimates that 700,000 people in Puerto Rico – about one in five residents – could be infected by Zika virus by the end of this year.\n\nRead more:\n\nThis lab is ground zero in the U.S. fight against Zika\n\nWhy the rise in Zika cases in Puerto Rico raises risk for rest of U.S.\n\nZika outbreak: 'The more we learn the worse things seem to get'\n\nZika has pregnant women worried and their doctors have few answers\n\nWant to avoid Zika?

  "latent_24898": "The four Mounties involved in the death of Robert Dziekanski after zapping him with a Taser are facing perjury charges for their testimony at a public inquiry.\n\nBut Richard Peck, the special prosecutor appointed to look into the case, also declined to recommend any other charges against the officers relating to Dziekanski's death.\n\n\"Mr. Peck has concluded that there is no substantial likelihood of conviction in relation to any potential charges arising from the circumstances of the physical altercation with Mr. Dziekanski or the subsequent investigation into his death,\" said a statement Friday from the attorney general's criminal justice branch.\n\nInstead, Peck has recommended the perjury charges, and the branch said in a news release it has accepted the recommendation. The branch plans to proceed on the charges without a preliminary inquiry, the news release said.\n\nBentley's lawyer, David Butcher, said his client would plead not guilty.\n\n\"No substance to the allegations at all, they will be defended with full vigour,\" Butcher said in a brief interview.\n\nLawyers for the other officers could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nDziekanski's mother, Zofia Cisowski, released a written statement applauding the charges.\n\n\"I am pleased that the special prosecutor has announced criminal charges against RCMP officers involved in the death of my son,\" wrote Cisowski, who lives in Kamloops, B.C.\n\n\"I hope that justice will finally be achieved in the death of my son.\"\n\nThe charges are a result of the officers' testimony at the later public inquiry into the incident, the branch said.\n\nDziekanski died in October 2007 after spending hours in Vancouver's airport waiting for his mother to come from the B.C.

Gerry Rundel, Const. Bill Bentley, Cpl. Monty Robinson and Const.

  "latent_24911": "Hispanic infants and other minority children may be getting inferior care at neonatal intensive care units, a new study suggests. The researchers found that Hispanic, American Indian, Alaskan Native and other minority babies had lower “quality of care” scores than white, black, and Asian infants in California NICUs. The results also suggest that improved parent-provider communication could help close these gaps, and curb the consequences of unconscious biases.\n\n“We were interested in looking at the areas related to disparity and health care that we could directly influence,” study coauthor Jochen Profit, neonatologist and professor of pediatrics at Stanford University, told Fatherly. Prior work on healthcare disparities in NICUs had largely focused on factors that doctors cannot prevent, such as socioeconomic status (areas with high poverty and crime rates are always under-served). “As neonatologists…we wanted to shine a light on where there were disparities after babies were born, and whether we can address this as a profession.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs far as racial bias goes, preliminary studies have shown that African American and Hispanic infants are more likely to receive care poor-quality care in NICUs. Studies have attributed this to lack of access, often as a result of poverty, but more up-to-date research suggests that even once they’re in the hospital, minority children are treated differently. Studies suggest that black and hispanic premature infants who are admitted to the NICU receive fewer antenatal steroids in the hospital and less breast milk at discharge. But this is the first study to examine overall quality of care.\n\nFor this study—a retrospective analysis based on a population of 18,616 babies across 134 hospitals in California—Profit and his team assessed quality of care for each infant using a nine-item scale, which measures of chronic lung disease, growth velocity, all steroid administration, and mortality, among other factors. Researchers controlled for specific hospitals that had generally bad NICU outcomes, length of the mother’s pregnancy, and other risk factors to try to ensure that all children analyzed were about equally sick. “We tried to compare apples with apples,” Profit says.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe researchers found that Hispanic, American Indian, and Alaskan Native babies had lower scores on the non-item scale than white, African American, and Asian American infants. That surprised Profit, but not nearly as much as the wide variation in quality of care that he found across all NICUs—implying bias is only one in a sea of problems. “Race and ethnicity appear to be one of the factors contributing to that variation, but it’s really not uniform,” he says.\n\nThe study comes with several caveats—it’s retrospective, controlling such a study is difficult, and the analysis did not take poverty into account even though it’s a substantial risk factor for negative outcomes—so Profit stresses that we cannot draw conclusions about actual biases held by healthcare providers. And he suspects that, if unconscious biases are at play, most physicians are self-aware enough to identify the problem and fix it, once it has been pointed out.\n\n“I don’t think any health care professionals are going to work and deciding to give lesser care to sick infants based on biases,” Profit says.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

The first regular box contained none other than the most important and awesome person in the Wizarding world's wand, Luna Lovegood. I fucking squealed yep I squealed.

  "latent_25070": "INDIANAPOLIS - The Raiders’ wonderful season ended with a whimper.\n\nSo what did Jack Del Rio take away from his team’s final chapter? The head coach offered a weak smile.\n\n“Don’t lose your quarterback,” he said. “You don’t want that to happen.”\n\nIndeed, the Raiders, who went 12-3 with Derek Carr, went 0-2 after he broke his leg Christmas Eve. In their final defeat, they managed a season-low 203 yards and rookie quarterback Connor Cook threw three interceptions in a 27-14 wild-card loss to the Texans.\n\nThe ending prompted an obvious question Thursday at the NFL combine: Do the Raiders need to have “backup QB” on their offseason shopping list? Del Rio expressed confidence in Cook, a fourth-round pick who played well in the regular-season finale before his playoff flop.\n\n“We want to develop Connor Cook first as our backup quarterback,” Del Rio said. “He’s the guy we know we have right now. There’s always competition in this league. I wouldn’t close the door there, either, and say that we wouldn’t make it competitive for him. He did a pretty solid job developing throughout the year.”\n\nAnd the same could be said for the Raiders, who had their first winning season since 2002 and their most wins since 2000.\n\nAs a result, owner Mark Davis tore up Del Rio’s original four-year contract last month and replaced it with a new four-your deal.\n\nOn Thursday, Del Rio said he appreciated that Davis followed through on his 2015 pledge to revise his underwhelming contract once the Raiders emerged from the depths.\n\n“I bet on me on the contract,” Del Rio said. “It wasn’t a very good contract to start with, but it was an opportunity. And I bet on our ability to get this thing turned around and I feel like we have.”\n\nThe Raiders’ turnaround could make them an attract free-agent destination, a laughable notion a few years ago.\n\nDel Rio was asked about reports that running back Adrian Peterson has the Raiders among the teams on his wish list. This week, the Vikings announced they will not exercise Peterson’s $18 million option for 2017. As a result, Peterson, 31, will be an unrestricted free agent Thursday.\n\n“I think it’s great that we’re on the list of guys that are premier guys,” Del Rio said. “… The message I get is that players and coaches and people recognize that this is a good place to be. That we have turned this thing around.\n\n“When I first arrived three years ago, the thought was that no one wants to come here. We battled through that, became a place where people wanted to come and over the last two years, we’ve been able to attract some nice free agents.”\n\nThe Raiders figure to address their running-back position in the offseason.

  "latent_25244": "“I don’t recognize any of what Bannon is saying from our days at Harvard Business School,” Arthur Zwern, a technology entrepreneur and fellow classmate from the Harvard Business School Class of 1985, told me recently. Like so many people who have attended H.B.S.—eminences from Michael Bloomberg to Jamie Dimon, from Stephen Schwarzman to Sheryl Sandberg, and even George W. Bush—Zwern was having a hard time reconciling how his alma mater, the acknowledged pinnacle of business education, could have shaped the economic nationalist views of Donald Trump’s chief strategist.\n\nMany H.B.S. alumni simply want to disown Steve Bannon. “As a second-generation Holocaust survivor I find a lot of the anti-immigrant rhetoric offensive and morally repugnant,” Zwern continued. “Each section at H.B.S. was selected to maximize diversity in everything from race to nationality to political views, and every class was taught by the case method. That led to a culture of inclusiveness and acceptance and ‘coopetition’—completely the opposite of something like Breitbart News.”\n\nBannon, for his part, often seems to want to disown his alma mater, too. The story he loves to tell about his Harvard years casts him as an outsider, a married Navy Officer, older than his classmates, from a blue collar background. In other words, he might have been among them, but he wasn’t one of them.\n\nBannon has spun the story out in countless ways in recent years. When he stirs up resentment about “elites” and “the Establishment,” he is ostensibly talking about the people of H.B.S.—names like former Treasury secretary Hank Paulson, who orchestrated the bailout of the banks that makes Bannon so angry. When Bannon says that working people are “tired of being dictated to by what we call the party of Davos,” he appears to be taking aim at them again. The line he draws between himself and his classmates couldn’t be clearer.\n\nIt’s a useful myth, however, because it conceals his essential similarity with his fellow students. One thing that I learned while reporting my book about H.B.S., The Golden Passport, is that Harvard Business School leaves an unmistakable mark on its alumni. At its simplest, the H.B.S. stamp is not an economic ideology as much as an attitude, a permanent validation that starts at the moment of acceptance. “[They] told us that simply by getting into H.B.S., ‘You’ve won,’ ” writes Philip Delves Broughton in Ahead of the Curve, his memoir of attending the school. “Regardless of who we were when we arrived, or what we might learn or become over the next two years, simply by being accepted by H.B.S., we had entered an uberclass. It was H.B.S., not anything that came before it, that conferred the ‘winner’ tag on all of us.”\n\nHarvard may not want to claim Bannon as one of its own, and vice versa, but he has all of the attributes. H.B.S. provides its alumni with a license to lead, teaches them that they belong in charge, whether of a mayonnaise company or the nation. A Harvard Business School graduate sees his power, and wealth, and goodness, as part of the natural order of things. H.B.S. professor Bill George tacked an adjective on to it—authentic leadership—and the rewards for wielding it aren’t just pecuniary anymore; they’re spiritual as well. “For authentic leaders, there are special rewards,” George wrote in Harvard Business Review in 2007. “No individual achievement can equal the pleasure of leading a group of people to achieve a worthy goal.”\n\nOne of the school’s most notable alumni of the past half century put it another way. “Bannon’s worldview is not consistent with what most H.B.S. leaders profess to believe, but it makes plenty of sense that he was educated there,” this person told me. “Yes, there’s plenty of time spent on ethics, integrity, and giving back. But H.B.S. also teaches you to win, to get your way, to make people follow you, to get to the top.”\n\nWhether it requires, say, firing half the staff of a mayonnaise company or the “deconstruction of the administrative state,” as Bannon recently described his mission as the president's chief strategist, H.B.S. provides you with the confidence to execute your vision.",

  "latent_25938": "For any country, the foundation of successful diplomacy is a reputation for credibility and reliability. Governments are wary of concluding agreements with a negotiating partner that violates existing commitments and has a record of duplicity. Recent U.S. administrations have ignored that principle, and their actions have backfired majorly, damaging American foreign policy in the process.\n\nThe consequences of previous deceit are most evident in the ongoing effort to achieve a diplomatic solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis. During his recent trip to East Asia, President Trump urged Kim Jong-un’s regime to “come to the negotiating table” and “do the right thing”—relinquish the country’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Presumably, that concession would lead to a lifting (or at least an easing) of international economic sanctions and a more normal relationship between Pyongyang and the international community.\n\nUnfortunately, North Korean leaders have abundant reasons to be wary of such U.S. enticements. Trump’s transparent attempt to renege on Washington’s commitment to the deal with Iran known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—which the United States and other major powers signed in 2015 to curb Tehran’s nuclear program—certainly does not increase Pyongyang’s incentive to sign a similar agreement. His decision to decertify Iran’s compliance with the JCPOA, even when the United Nations confirms that Tehran is adhering to its obligations, appears more than a little disingenuous.\n\nNorth Korea is likely focused on another incident that raises even greater doubts about U.S. credibility. Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi capitulated on the nuclear issue in December of 2003, abandoning his country’s nuclear program and reiterating a commitment to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In exchange, the United States and its allies lifted economic sanctions and welcomed Libya back into the community of respectable nations. Barely seven years later, though, Washington and its NATO partners double-crossed Qaddafi, launching airstrikes and cruise missile attacks to assist rebels in their campaign to overthrow the Libyan strongman. North Korea and other powers took notice of Qaddafi’s fate, making the already difficult task of getting a de-nuclearization agreement with Pyongyang nearly impossible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Libya intervention sullied America’s reputation in another way. Washington and its NATO allies prevailed on the UN Security Council to pass a resolution endorsing a military intervention to protect innocent civilians. Russia and China refrained from vetoing that resolution after Washington’s assurances that military action would be limited in scope and solely for humanitarian purposes. Once the assault began, it quickly became evident that the resolution was merely a fig leaf for another U.S.-led regime-change war.\n\nBeijing, and especially Moscow, understandably felt duped. Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates succinctly described Russia’s reaction, both short-term and long-term:\n\nThe Russians later firmly believed they had been deceived on Libya. They had been persuaded to abstain at the UN on the grounds that the resolution provided for a humanitarian mission to prevent the slaughter of civilians. Yet as the list of bombing targets steadily grew, it became obvious that very few targets were off-limits, and that NATO was intent on getting rid of Qaddafi. Convinced they had been tricked, the Russians would subsequently block any such future resolutions, including against President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.\n\nThe Libya episode was hardly the first time the Russians concluded that U.S. leaders had cynically misled them. Moscow asserts that when East Germany unraveled in 1990, both U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and West German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher offered verbal assurances that, if Russia accepted a unified Germany within NATO, the alliance would not expand beyond Germany’s eastern border. The official U.S. position that there was nothing in writing affirming such a limitation is correct—and the clarity, extent, and duration of any verbal commitment to refrain from enlargement are certainly matters of intense controversy. But invoking a “you didn’t get it in writing” dodge does not inspire another government’s trust.\n\nThere seems to be no limit to Washington’s desire to crowd Russia. NATO has even added the Baltic republics, which had been part of the Soviet Union itself. In early 2008, President George W. Bush unsuccessfully tried to admit Georgia and Ukraine, which would have engineered yet another alliance move eastward. By that time, Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders were beyond furious.\n\nThe timing of Bush’s attempted ploy could scarcely have been worse. It came on the heels of Russia’s resentment at another example of U.S. duplicity. In 1999, Moscow had reluctantly accepted a UN mandate to cover NATO’s military intervention against Serbia, a long-standing Russian client. The alliance airstrikes and subsequent moves to detach and occupy Serbia’s restless province of Kosovo for the ostensible reason of protecting innocent civilians from atrocities was the same “humanitarian” justification that the West would use subsequently in Libya.\n\nNine years after the initial Kosovo intervention, the United States adopted an evasive policy move, showing utter contempt for Russia’s wishes and interests in the process. Kosovo wanted to declare its formal independence from Serbia, but it was clear that such a move would face a certain Russian (and probable Chinese) veto in the UN Security Council. Washington and an ad-hoc coalition of European Union countries brazenly bypassed the Council and approved Pristina’s independence declaration. It was an extremely controversial move. Not even all EU members were on board with the policy, since some of them (e.g., Spain) had secessionist problems of their own.\n\nRussia’s leaders protested vehemently and warned that the West’s unauthorized action established a dangerous, destabilizing international precedent. Washington rebuffed their complaints, arguing that the Kosovo situation was unique. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs R. Nicholas Burns made that point explicitly in a February 2008 State Department briefing. Both the illogic and the hubris of that position were breathtaking.\n\nIt is painful for any American to admit that the United States has acquired a well-deserved reputation for duplicity in its foreign policy. But the evidence for that proposition is quite substantial. Indeed, disingenuous U.S. behavior regarding NATO expansion and the resolution of Kosovo’s political status may be the single most important factor for the poisoned bilateral relationship with Moscow. The U.S. track record of duplicity and betrayal is one reason why prospects for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue through diplomacy are so bleak.\n\nActions have consequences, and Washington’s reputation for disingenuous behavior has complicated America’s own foreign policy objectives. This is a textbook example of a great power shooting itself in the foot.\n\nTed Galen Carpenter, a senior fellow in defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, is the author of 10 books, the contributing editor of 10 books, and the author of more than 700 articles and policy studies on international affairs.",

We're back this week with a roundup that focuses on the goings-on at 400 Maryland Ave. SW — that's the federal Department of Education, in case you didn't know.\n\nDeVos comments on LGBT student protections in new profile\n\nA long piece about Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in Politico includes her public comment, for the first time, on the Justice Department's February decision to rescind Obama-era guidance protecting transgender students' rights.\n\nIt was reported back then that the secretary was privately a personal advocate of LGBT rights and that she had opposed the Justice Department's decision.\n\n\"I didn't feel the timing was appropriate,\" DeVos told Politico this month.\n\nDick DeVos donated to Michigan PACs\n\nIn the past, DeVos, her husband and his father have given many millions of dollars to political candidates. DeVos pledged during her confirmation hearings, \"If I am confirmed, I will not be involved in any political contributions, and my husband will not be, either.\"\n\nThe Detroit News reported this week that her husband, Dick DeVos, this year contributed a total of $5,000 to two Michigan political action committees, which donated the money mostly to Republican campaigns. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., sent a letter rebuking the secretary, saying she was \"concerned that you, your husband and your extended family continue to utilize your vast wealth to influence and impose your agenda on a political system in which you already wield power as the secretary of education.\"\n\nThe Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, Greg McNeilly, the chief operating officer of Dick DeVos' company, Windquest Group, reached out to NPR. \"From our perspective, it's an issue that is not about Mrs. DeVos in her formal capacity as Secretary, rather as a private citizen since it involves her husband, Mr. DeVos,\" McNeilly told NPR via email. He also drew a distinction between giving money to the PACs and directly to candidates.\n\nOffice of Federal Student Aid to lose jobs\n\nWhile many senior positions at the Education Department remain unfilled, The Washington Post reported last week that buyouts and early retirements are being offered specifically to shrink the Office of Federal Student Aid.\n\nFSA is charged with administering more than $120 billion in grants, loans and work-study funds each year. The money helps 13 million students pay for college. The office has around 1,400 employees, the Post reported, and lost around 24 from December through mid-June.\n\nIn May, the top official in the division, an Obama appointee, suddenly resigned. It was reported at the time that he quit over plans underway to transfer responsibility for student aid programs to the Treasury Department.\n\nHe was replaced by the CEO of a private student loan company, A. Wayne Johnson.\n\nNearly 600 policy documents rolled back\n\nThe department announced last week it was rolling back about 600 policy documents, including 72 relating to special education, that it says are outdated or redundant. This doesn't change the letter of the law. But public schools rely on these regulations as guidance for providing special services, accommodations and instruction.\n\nDeVos and the Trump administration have argued that too much regulation makes it harder for local school officials to decide what is best for children.\n\nThe immediate implications were unclear. A department spokeswoman, Liz Hill, told the blog Disability Scoop, \"There are no policy implications to these rescissions.\"",

Earlier studies put the annual Chinese air pollution death toll at 1 to 2 million, but this is the first to use newly released Chinese air monitoring figures.\n\nThe study released Thursday blamed emissions from the burning of coal, both for electricity and heating homes. The study, to be published in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS ONE, uses real air measurements and then computer model calculations that estimate heart, lung and stroke deaths for different types of pollutants.\n\n\"Nearly everyone in China experiences air that is worse for particulates than the worst air in the U.S.\"\n\nStudy lead author Robert Rohde said that 38 percent of the Chinese population lives in an area with a long-term air quality average that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency calls \"unhealthy.\"\n\n\"It's a very big number,\" Rohde said Thursday. \"It's a little hard to wrap your mind around the numbers. Some of the worst in China is to the southwest of Beijing.\"\n\nTo put Chinese air pollution in perspective, the most recent American Lung Association data shows that Madera, California, has the highest annual average for small particles in the United States. But 99.9 percent of the eastern half of China has a higher annual average for small particle haze than Madera, Rohde said.\n\n\"In other words, nearly everyone in China experiences air that is worse for particulates than the worst air in the U.S.,\" Rohde said.\n\nIn a 2010 document, the EPA estimates that between 63,000 and 88,000 people die in the U.S. from air pollution. Other estimates range from 35,000 to 200,000.\n\nUnlike the U.S., air pollution in China is worst in the winter because of burning of coal to heat homes and weather conditions that keeps dirty air closer to the ground, Rohde said. Beijing will host the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nOutside scientists praised the research. Jason West at the University of North Carolina said he expects \"it will be widely influential.\"\n\nAllen Robinson at Carnegie Mellon University said in an email that parts of the United States, like Pittsburgh, used to have almost as bad air but have become much cleaner \"through tough regulations combined with large collapse of heavy industry (it moved to Asia).\"\n\nAs China starts to clean up its air, limiting coal use, it will also reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief global warming gas, Rohde said.",

  "latent_26282": "A Pennsylvania detective had a nickname of a suspect, but no real name. He turned to Facebook, found a picture, and eventually apprehended the person. This anecdote from a Washington Post investigation into law enforcement use of facial recognition software illustrates how social media can be a boon for catching criminals.\n\nAs people share more about their thoughts and actions on social media and as algorithms grow more sophisticated, law enforcement’s ability to mine such information for clues into how to prevent crimes raises concerns of profiling and questions of oversight.\n\nLaw enforcement profiling predates social media. From 1956 to 1971, FBI counterintelligence program COINTELPRO tracked political organizations and their leaders, including Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nRecently, the ACLU’s “Mapping the FBI” project uncovered intelligence gathering that used racial and ethnic mapping. The project’s documentation includes a 2009 memo from the bureau’s Detroit office that called Michigan’s Middle East and Muslim community “prime territory for attempted radicalization and recruitment by” terrorist groups. The FBI’s reason: most State Department-labeled terrorist groups originate in the Middle East and South Asia.\n\nIn 2010 a 20-year-old Arab-American man in California found a tracking device on his car and learned the FBI had been surveilling him, a US citizen, for months, if not longer. Since 2011 the Associated Press has investigated the NYPD’s spying on Muslim communities, documenting what The Atlantic calls “horrifying effects” on both those surveilled, who have not been accused of any crimes, and on counterterrorism efforts as a whole—in six years, the program did not generate a single lead.\n\nThe NSA and British intelligence agency GCHQ collect raw Internet traffic that includes email, social media, and chats. US law enforcement agencies at all levels can obtain information from Internet and communication companies with court orders. But police don’t need permission to monitor what already flows freely on the web. Ars Technica reported on the London Metropolitan police’s extensive efforts to monitor social media:\n\nFor the past two years, a secretive unit in the Metropolitan Police has been developing the tools for blanket surveillance of the public’s social media conversations. Operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, a staff of 17 officers in the National Domestic Extremism Unit (NDEU) has been scanning the public’s tweets, YouTube videos, Facebook profiles, and anything else UK citizens post in the public online sphere.\n\nSeveral commercial tools exist to monitor social media streams, and companies actively market them to law enforcement. Police departments at the University of Maryland, Hampton University, and the city of Boca Raton, Florida use tools from the Virginia-based technology company ECM Universe to surveil social media users and analyze the text of their messages. A brochure touts that with the tool,\n\n[A] city can monitor activist groups who are using social media to organize their efforts on the ground and receive alerts in a matter of minutes from the time of the postings when dangerous radical elements emerge from the crowd.\n\nSuch language underscores the need for oversight on how to use information gathered from social media. Participating in an activist group is not a criminal activity, and “dangerous radical elements” do not emerge at every activist meeting.\n\nUS law enforcement generally needs a reason and court permission to investigate someone. Predictive analytics involves mining data to look for undetected or unconsidered patterns. Agencies “don’t necessarily know what they need to monitor on Twitter,” software company SAS wrote in a paper detailing its tools, one of which maps people’s friends and followers on Facebook and Twitter. Users maintain hundreds of connections on these sites, including people they may not have contacted for years or people they don’t even know. To what extent will a person’s connections implicate them?\n\nPredictive policing has helped police departments lower crime. But such efforts used previously reported and anonymized crime data; inclusion of social media data adds another dimension of concern.

  "latent_26290": "Two US federal funding agencies announced today which experiments they will support in the next generation of the search for dark matter.\n\nThe Department of Energy and National Science Foundation will back the Super Cryogenic Dark Matter Search-SNOLAB, or SuperCDMS; the LUX-Zeplin experiment, or LZ; and the next iteration of the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment, ADMX-Gen2.\n\n“We wanted to pool limited resources to put together the most optimal unified national dark matter program we could create,” says Michael Salamon, who manages DOE’s dark matter program.\n\nSecond-generation dark matter experiments are defined as experiments that will be at least 10 times as sensitive as the current crop of dark matter detectors.\n\nProgram directors from the two federal funding agencies decided which experiments to pursue based on the advice of a panel of outside experts. Both agencies have committed to working to develop the new projects as expeditiously as possible, says Jim Whitmore, program director for particle astrophysics in the division of physics at NSF.\n\nPhysicists have seen plenty of evidence of the existence of dark matter through its strong gravitational influence, but they do not know what it looks like as individual particles. That’s why the funding agencies put together a varied particle-hunting team.\n\nBoth LZ and SuperCDMS will look for a type of dark matter particles called WIMPs, or weakly interacting massive particles. ADMX-Gen2 will search for a different kind of dark matter particles called axions.\n\nLZ is capable of identifying WIMPs with a wide range of masses, including those much heavier than any particle the Large Hadron Collider at CERN could produce. SuperCDMS will specialize in looking for light WIMPs with masses lower than 10 GeV. (And of course both LZ and SuperCDMS are willing to stretch their boundaries a bit if called upon to double-check one another’s results.)\n\nIf a WIMP hits the LZ detector, a high-tech barrel of liquid xenon, it will produce quanta of light, called photons. If a WIMP hits the SuperCDMS detector, a collection of hockey-puck-sized integrated circuits made with silicon or germanium, it will produce quanta of sound, called phonons.\n\n“But if you detect just one kind of signal, light or sound, you can be fooled,” says LZ spokesperson Harry Nelson of the University of California, Santa Barbara. “A number of things can fake it.”\n\nSuperCDMS and LZ will be located underground—SuperCDMS at SNOLAB in Ontario, Canada, and LZ at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota—to shield the detectors from some of the most common fakers: cosmic rays. But they will still need to deal with natural radiation from the decay of uranium and thorium in the rock around them: “One member of the decay chain, lead-210, has a half-life of 22 years,” says SuperCDMS spokesperson Blas Cabrera of Stanford University. “It’s a little hard to wait that one out.”\n\nTo combat this, both experiments collect a second signal, in addition to light or sound—charge. The ratio of the two signals lets them know whether the light or sound came from a dark matter particle or something else.\n\nSuperCDMS will be especially skilled at this kind of differentiation, which is why the experiment should excel at searching for hard-to-hear low-mass particles.\n\nLZ’s strength, on the other hand, stems from its size.\n\nDark matter particles are constantly flowing through the Earth, so their interaction points in a dark matter detector should be distributed evenly throughout. Quanta of radiation, however, can be stopped by much less significant barriers—alpha particles by a piece of paper, beta particles by a sandwich. Even gamma ray particles, which are harder to stop, cannot reach the center of LZ’s 7-ton detector. When a particle with the right characteristics interacts in the center of LZ, scientists will know to get excited.\n\nThe ADMX detector, on the other hand, approaches the dark matter search with a more delicate touch. The dark matter axions ADMX scientists are looking for are too light for even SuperCDMS to find.\n\nIf an axion passed through a magnetic field, it could convert into a photon. The ADMX team encourages this subtle transformation by placing their detector within a strong magnetic field, and then tries to detect the change.\n\n“It’s a lot like an AM radio,” says ADMX-Gen2 co-spokesperson Gray Rybka of the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nThe experiment slowly turns the dial, tuning itself to watch for one axion mass at a time. Its main background noise is heat.\n\n“The more noise there is, the harder it is to hear and the slower you have to tune,” Rybka says.\n\nIn its current iteration, it would take around 100 years for the experiment to get through all of the possible channels. But with the addition of a super-cooling refrigerator, ADMX-Gen2 will be able to search all of its current channels, plus many more, in the span of just three years.\n\nWith SuperCDMS, LZ and ADMX-Gen2 in the works, the next several years of the dark matter search could be some of its most interesting.",
  "latent_26371": "\"Montanus\" redirects here. For other uses, see Montanus (disambiguation)\n\nFor the unrelated Catholic philosophy emphasizing the authority of the Pope, see Ultramontanism\n\nMontanism , known by its adherents as the New Prophecy, was an early Christian movement of the late 2nd century, later referred to by the name of its founder, Montanus .\n\nMontanism held similar views about the basic tenets of Christian doctrine to those of the wider Christian Church, but it was labelled a heresy for its belief in new prophetic revelations. The prophetic movement called for a reliance on the spontaneity of the Holy Spirit and a more conservative personal ethic. Parallels have been drawn between Montanism and modern-day movements such as Pentecostalism and the charismatic movement.[1]\n\nIt originated in Phrygia, a province of Asia Minor, and flourished throughout the region, leading to the movement being referred to elsewhere as \"Cataphrygian\" (meaning it was \"from Phrygia\") or simply as \"Phrygian\".[2] It spread rapidly to other regions in the Roman Empire before Christianity was generally tolerated or legal. It persisted in some isolated places into the 6th century.\n\nFoundation [ edit ]\n\nScholars debate as to when Montanus first began his prophetic activity, having chosen dates varying from c. AD 135 to as late as AD 177.[3][page needed] Montanus was a recent convert when he first began prophesying, supposedly during the proconsulate of Gratus in a village in Mysia named Ardabau; no proconsul and village so named have been identified, however. Some accounts claim that before his conversion to Christianity, Montanus was a priest of Apollo or Cybele.[a] He believed he was a prophet of God and that the Paraclete spoke through him.\n\nMontanus proclaimed the towns of Pepuza and Tymion in west-central Phrygia as the site of the New Jerusalem, making the larger - Pepuza - his headquarters. Phrygia as a source for this new movement was not arbitrary. Hellenization never fully took root in Phrygia, unlike many of the surrounding Eastern regions of the Roman Empire. This sense of difference, while simultaneously having easy access to the rest of the Mediterranean Christian world, encouraged the foundation of this separate sect of Christianity.\n\nMontanus had two female colleagues, Prisca (sometimes called Priscilla, the diminutive form of her name) and Maximilla, who likewise claimed the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Their popularity even exceeded Montanus' own. \"The Three\" spoke in ecstatic visions and urged their followers to fast and to pray, so that they might share these revelations. Their followers claimed they received the prophetic gift from the prophets Quadratus and Ammia of Philadelphia, figures believed to have been part of a line of prophetic succession stretching all the way back to Agabus (1st century AD) and to the daughters of Philip the Evangelist. In time, the New Prophecy spread from Montanus's native Phrygia across the Christian world, to Africa and to Gaul.\n\nAftermath [ edit ]\n\nThe response to the New Prophecy split the Christian communities, and the proto-orthodox clergy mostly fought to suppress it. Opponents believed that evil spirits possessed the Phrygian prophets, and both Maximilla and Priscilla were the targets of failed exorcisms. The churches of Asia Minor pronounced the prophecies profane and excommunicated New Prophecy adherents. Around 177, Apollinarius, Bishop of Hierapolis, presided over a synod which condemned the New Prophecy. The leaders of the churches of Lyons and Vienne in Gaul responded to the New Prophecy in 177. Their decision was communicated to the churches in Asia and Pope Eleuterus, but it is not known what this consisted of, only that it was \"prudent and most orthodox\".[15] It is likely they called for moderation in dealing with the movement.\n\nThere was real doubt at Rome, and its bishop (either Eleuterus or Victor I) even wrote letters in support of Montanism, although he was later persuaded by Praxeas to recall them.[16] In 193, an anonymous writer found the church at Ancyra in Galatia torn in two, and opposed the \"false prophecy\" there.[18]\n\nEventually, Montanist teachings came to be regarded as heresy by the orthodox Church for a number of reasons. The clash of basic beliefs between the movement's proponents and the greater Christian world was likely enough for such conflict to occur. Additionally, in the opinion of anti-Montanists, the movement's penchant for dramatic public displays by its adherents brought unwanted attention to the still fledgling religion. Thus, fears concerning the appearance of Montanist practices to their non-Christian rulers fueled anti-Montanist sentiment. The imperial government carried out sporadic executions of Christians under the reign of Marcus Aurelius, circa AD 161-180, which coincides with the spread of Montanism.\n\nThere was never a uniform excommunication of New Prophecy adherents, and in many places they maintained their standing within the orthodox community. This was the case at Carthage. While not without tension, the church there avoided schism over the issue. There were women prophesying at Carthage, and prophecy was considered a genuine charism. It was the responsibility of the council of elders to test all prophecy and to determine genuine revelation. Tertullian, undoubtedly the best-known defender of the New Prophecy, believed that the claims of Montanus were genuine beginning c. 207. He believed in the validity of the New Prophecy and admired the movement's discipline and ascetic standards. A common misconception is that Tertullian decisively left the orthodox church and joined a separate Montanist sect; in fact, he remained an early-catholic Christian.[22]\n\nAlthough what became the orthodox Christian church prevailed against Montanism within a few generations, inscriptions in the Tembris valley of northern Phrygia, dated between 249 and 279, openly proclaim allegiance to the New Prophecy. Speros Vryonis considers these inscriptions remarkable in that they are the only set of inscriptions which openly reveal the religious affiliations of the deceased before the period of toleration, when Christians dared not to do so.[23]\n\nA letter of Jerome to Marcella, written in 385, refutes the claims of Montanists that had been troubling her. A group of \"Tertullianists\" may have continued at Carthage. The anonymous author of Praedestinatus records that a preacher came to Rome in 388 where he made many converts and obtained the use of a church for his congregation on the grounds that the martyrs to whom it was dedicated had been Montanists.[24] He was obliged to flee after the victory of Theodosius I.\n\nIn his own time, Augustine (354 – 430) records that the Tertullianist group had dwindled to almost nothing and, finally, was reconciled to the church and handed over its basilica.[25] It is not certain whether these Tertullianists were in all respects \"Montanist\" or not. In the 6th century, on the orders of the Emperor Justinian, John of Ephesus led an expedition to Pepuza to destroy the Montanist shrine there, which was based on the tombs of Montanus, Priscilla and Maximilla.\n\nA sect called \"Montanist\" existed in the 8th century; the Emperor Leo III ordered the conversion and baptism of its members. These Montanists refused, locked themselves in their houses of worship, set the buildings on fire and perished.[23]\n\nBeliefs [ edit ]\n\nBecause much of what is known about Montanism comes from anti-Montanist sources, it is difficult to know what they actually believed and how those beliefs differed from the Christian mainstream of the time. The New Prophecy was also a diverse movement, and what Montanists believed varied by location and time. Montanism was particularly influenced by Johannine literature, especially the Gospel of John and the Apocalypse of John (also known as the Book of Revelation).\n\nIn John's Gospel, Jesus promised to send the Paraclete or Holy Spirit, from which Montanists believed their prophets derived inspiration. In the Apocalypse, John was taken by an angel to the top of a mountain where he sees the New Jerusalem descend to earth. Montanus identified this mountain as being located in Phrygia near Pepuza. Followers of the New Prophecy called themselves spiritales (\"spiritual people\") in contrast to their opponents whom they termed psychici (\"carnal, natural people\").\n\nEcstatic prophecy [ edit ]\n\nAs the name \"New Prophecy\" implied, Montanism was a movement focused around prophecy, specifically the prophecies of the movement's founders which were believed to contain the Holy Spirit's revelation for the present age. Prophecy itself was not controversial within 2nd-century Christian communities.[32] However, the New Prophecy, as described by Eusebius of Caesarea, departed from Church tradition:\n\nAnd he [Montanus] became beside himself, and being suddenly in a sort of frenzy and ecstasy, he raved, and began to babble and utter strange things, prophesying in a manner contrary to the constant custom of the Church handed down by tradition from the beginning.[35]\n\nThe Montanist prophets did not speak as messengers of God but were described as possessed by God while being unable to resist.[15] A prophetic utterance by Montanus described this possessed state: \"Lo, the man is as a lyre, and I fly over him as a pick. The man sleepeth, while I watch.\" Thus, the Phrygians were seen as false prophets because they acted irrationally and were not in control of their senses.[36]\n\nA criticism of Montanism was that its followers claimed their revelation received directly from the Holy Spirit could supersede the authority of Jesus or Paul the Apostle or anyone else.[37] In some of his prophecies, Montanus apparently, and somewhat like the oracles of the Greco-Roman world, spoke in the first person as God: \"I am the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.\"\n\nMany understood this to be Montanus claiming himself to be God. However, scholars agree that these words of Montanus exemplify the general practice of religious prophets to speak as the passive mouthpieces of the divine, and to claim divine inspiration (similar to modern prophets stating \"Thus saith the Lord\"). That practice occurred in Christian as well as in pagan circles with some degree of frequency.\n\nOther beliefs [ edit ]\n\nOther beliefs and practices (or alleged beliefs and practices) of Montanism are as follows:\n\nIn On the Resurrection of the Flesh , Tertullian wrote that the Holy Spirit through the New Prophecy cleared up the ambiguities of scripture. [41] The new prophecies did not contain new doctrinal content, but mandated strict ethical standards. To the mainstream church, Montanists appeared to believe that the new prophecies superseded and fulfilled the doctrines proclaimed by the Apostles. [15]\n\n, Tertullian wrote that the Holy Spirit through the New Prophecy cleared up the ambiguities of scripture. The new prophecies did not contain new doctrinal content, but mandated strict ethical standards. To the mainstream church, Montanists appeared to believe that the new prophecies superseded and fulfilled the doctrines proclaimed by the Apostles. The power of apostles and prophets to forgive sins. Adherents also believed that martyrs and confessors also possessed this power. The mainstream church believed that God forgave sins through bishops and presbyters (and those martyrs recognized by legitimate ecclesiastical authority).\n\nThey recognized women as bishops and presbyters. [46]\n\nWomen and girls were forbidden to wear ornaments, and virgins were required to wear veils. [47]\n\nAn emphasis on ethical rigorism and asceticism. These included prohibitions against remarriage following divorce or the death of a spouse. They also emphasized keeping fasts strictly and added new fasts.\n\nMontanus provided salaries for those who preached his doctrine, which orthodox writers claimed was promoting gluttony. [49]\n\nSome of the Montanists were also \"Quartodeciman\" (\"fourteeners\"), preferring to celebrate Easter on the Hebrew calendar date of 14 Nisan, regardless of what day of the week it landed on. Mainstream Christians held that Easter should be commemorated on the Sunday following 14 Nisan. However, uniformity in this matter had not yet been fully achieved when the Montanist movement began; Polycarp, for example, was a quartodeciman, and St. Irenaeus convinced Victor, then Bishop of Rome, to refrain from making the issue of the date of Easter a divisive one.[51] Later, the Catholic Church established a fixed way of calculating Easter according to the Julian (and later the Gregorian) calendar.\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ Dialogue Between a Montanist and an Orthodox (4.4) and possibly alluded to by Claim made in(4.4) and possibly alluded to by St. Jerome\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nBibliography [ edit ]\n\nJerome, Schaff, ed., To Marcella (Letter) (xli), CCEL\n\nLabriolle, Pierre (1913), La Crise Montaniste (in French), Paris: Leroux .\n\n.

  "latent_26386": "The integrity of America’s electoral system lags far behind other Western democracies, according to a new report by the Electoral Integrity Project.\n\nOverall, the U.S. electoral system has about as much integrity as those in Argentina, Mongolia and Rwanda, according to the joint project from Harvard University and the University of Sydney shows.\n\nThe findings come amid an increasingly partisan debate over election laws and electoral boundaries that is undermining the perceived integrity of American elections, as Republicans and Democrats set up rules — which vary widely between states — governing everything from access to the ballot box to campaign finance.\n\nThe study surveyed more than 700 American political scientists on the perceived integrity of their states' electoral systems. The experts were asked to rate the state's performance on everything from election laws and procedures to district boundaries, voter registration and campaign finance laws.\n\nUnlike many other Western democracies, there is wide variance in the integrity of individual systems in American states, which have the constitutional authority to administer elections, draw their own district lines and set rules that govern voter access.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe survey found Vermont has the best electoral system in the United States, while Arizona and Wisconsin ranked at the bottom of the pack.\n\nGlobally, the Electoral Integrity Project rates Denmark and Finland as the strongest electoral systems in the world, followed closely by Norway, Iceland and Sweden. The United States scores a 64 out of a possible 100 points. The lowest-ranked nations in the world include dictatorships such as Syria, Ethiopia, Burundi and Equatorial Guinea.\n\nPippa Norris, the Harvard political scientist who runs the study, said the difference between the United States and other Western democracies is that debates over everything from early and absentee voting to voter identification laws and poll closing times have become partisan footballs here.\n\nIn other countries, those questions are purely administrative issues.\n\n\"Particularly since 2000, what's been happening is increasing partisan polarization in American elections,\" Norris said. \"Those are the sort of issues that in most countries are administrative issues. What's happened since 2000 is the lawyers have thrown their hats in the ring.\"\n\nIn recent years, Democrats and Republicans have battled in state legislatures over virtually every aspect of election administration.\n\nMany of the states that scored lowest in the Electoral Integrity Project's report have been at the heart of those battles over election rules.\n\nAfter taking over a number of legislatures in the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans led the charge to require voters to show identification at the polls in states such as North Carolina, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, among others. Democrats have sued over many of those laws, which they say unfairly affect older and low-income voters who might not have access to identification documents or the money to obtain them.\n\nDemocratic-led states such as California and Oregon, on the other hand, have passed laws that aim to register more voters. In California, a universal voter registration law led to a surge of new voters ahead of November's elections.\n\nArizona scored particularly badly in categories involving electoral laws, district boundaries and the efficacy of electoral authorities. The Supreme Court in 2013 struck down a state law that required voters to show proof of citizenship when registering, and the chief election official in Maricopa County lost her job this year after a debacle at early voting sites led to long lines during the presidential primary.\n\nWisconsin scored particularly low in the district boundaries category. A panel of three federal judges ruled last month that the state's legislative district lines unfairly benefitted Republicans. The state also scored dismally on election laws, after court battles over voter identification rules.\n\nNorth Carolina, where legislative Republicans passed a sweeping election reform measure in 2013 and subsequently redrew district boundaries after courts ruled the old lines unconstitutionally violated minority rights, scored lower than any other state when it came to district boundaries.\n\n\"America is particularly bad in terms of gerrymandering of political districts,\" said Pippa Norris, the Harvard political scientist who runs the Electoral Integrity Project. \"That's a problem for voter choice. It's also a problem of course for voter turnout.\"\n\nOf the 15 lowest-scoring states, Republicans control both state legislative chambers in 14. And in most of those 14 — including Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Michigan, Ohio, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin and Arizona — the Republican-led legislatures have made significant changes to state election laws in recent years.\n\nRhode Island, where Democrats control both chambers of the legislature and the governor's mansion, is the lone state near the bottom not controlled by Republicans.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, researchers gave the highest marks to smaller states with few electoral controversies, as well as those that conduct their elections largely by mail.\n\nAlong with Vermont, Idaho, New Hampshire, Iowa and New Mexico ranked among the best-run states. Washington and Colorado, which conduct their elections by mail, ranked in the top 10 as well.\n\nThe report finds states in the South are generally seen as having more troubled electoral systems than Northeastern and Western states.\n\nThe political scientists pointed to the 2013 Supreme Court decision striking down Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, ruling that states with histories of racial discrimination no longer needed to seek Justice Department approval before changing election laws. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that racial discrimination in election laws was no longer a pervasive problem.\n\n\"Evidence from these expert evaluations ... suggests that this may have been unduly optimistic,\" the researchers wrote.",
  "latent_26461": "The mood was not a good one when Christian Democratic parliamentarians from the state of North Rhine-Westphalia met in Berlin last Monday evening. Normally, such gatherings focus on agreeing on a common line ahead of votes in the Bundestag, Germany's parliament. But this time, the deputies needed to vent. Angela Merkel's grand coalition, which pairs her CDU with the Social Democrats, has been in office since last autumn. And many lawmakers within the chancellor's party are tired of the SPD presenting itself as the driving force in the government.\n\n\"We have to avoid the impression that the SPD is governing and that we, as election victor, are happy to be a part of the government,\" complained Wolfgang Bosback, a senior CDU member well known for his temper. A fellow parliamentarian, Jens Spahn, complained that two more issues -- pension reform and minimum wage -- could soon give the SPD even more opportunity to take center stage. \"The only thing missing is if the German European Commission representative were to come from their party,\" Spahn says, referring to demands that SPD member Martin Schulz, outgoing president of European Parliament, become a member of the Commission. \"If Schulz becomes commissioner, it would contradict two election results -- those in Germany and those in Europe.\"\n\nThe fight over who will become the next Commission president has reached Berlin. And that means that an issue that was already one of the most complicated that Merkel has ever faced has become even more so. The number of contradictory interests is unusually large. She wants to keep Britain in the European Union, she doesn't want to antagonize the SPD, she doesn't want to anger people within her own party and she doesn't want to be seen as the one who ignored the election result and prevented election victor Jean-Claude Juncker from taking what many see as his rightful position as Commission president. Economists call such a situation \"lose-lose.\" Novelist Joseph Heller called it a \"catch-22.\" For Merkel, it is a serious political problem.\n\nDuring the depth of the euro crisis, Merkel was able to rely on the SPD. But this time, she can't. The SPD, together with other Social Democratic parties in Europe, are intent on installing their lead candidate Schulz as deputy head of the Commission, meaning he would have to become Germany's representative on the EU's executive body. Juncker, who needs SPD support in European Parliament to become Commission president, has agreed to the move. Should Merkel decline to support Schulz as Germany's Commission representative, the SPD would withdraw its support for Juncker and the entire deal would fall apart.\n\n'No Legal Foundation'\n\nFor German conservatives, however, Schulz represents the worst of the SPD's tax-and-spend mentality. During the European election campaign, they said he \"seems like an Italian\" -- implying that he wants to abandon austerity, the main pillar of Merkel's euro-crisis policy. \"It is out of the question that Schulz will be Germany's representative on the Commission. The SPD has enough cabinet posts for a party that won just 25 percent in German elections,\" says Hans-Peter Friedrich, the conservatives' deputy floor leader in Berlin.\n\nPlus, Merkel's party doesn't want to allow European Parliament to dictate who will become Germany's commissioner. There is \"no legal foundation\" for such a procedure, they say.\n\nThe chancellor agrees and wants to block Schulz as well. Indeed, it is part of a much more expansive plan which she hopes will convince Britain to remain in the EU. And one that could leave Juncker on the outside looking in.\n\nShe believes that the SPD is not prepared to allow Germany's governing coalition to collapse because of a dispute over Martin Schulz's next job. Merkel, SPD head Sigmar Gabriel and Horst Seehofer, chairman of the Bavarian sister party to Merkel's CDU, the Christian Social Union, met on the Monday evening after EU elections to discuss the situation. One of the issues addressed was that of the German representative on the Commission. The tone was businesslike and the trio was only interrupted once, when Merkel had to speak with US President Barack Obama on the telephone.\n\nGabriel didn't openly demand that Schulz be named to the post, but Merkel and Seehofer were both able to read between the lines of his comments. Merkel, for her part, didn't reject Schulz outright, but she made it clear that she wasn't particularly enthusiastic. She also reminded Gabriel that the CDU received substantially more votes in the European election than the SPD did -- even without adding in the votes received by the CSU in Bavaria. With such a result, it would be \"very difficult\" to convince German conservatives that an SPD man should be named Germany's representative on the Commission.\n\nGabriel, of course, knows that as well. \"The stage is Brussels,\" he said during a telephone conference with SPD leaders last Monday and said: \"Let's focus on Juncker and avoid mentioning Schulz's name at all for now.\"\n\nSchulz himself is also aware of the fragile political situation in Germany and has developed a Plan B. Before the election, SPD party heads and government leaders from around Europe promised to support him as the center-left's lead candidate. He has also positioned himself to be named floor leader for the Social Democrats and Socialists in European Parliament in mid-June. More importantly, he will lead the center-left in negotiations with the conservatives, talks that will focus on issues European Parliament will address in the next five years as well as important posts. As such, Juncker's interest in keeping Schulz in the running for the Commission job is great.\n\nMerkel, though, believes that this is the weak link in their strategy. And it will be here, despite all of her public expressions of support for Juncker, that she will focus her energies.\n\nWill Juncker Withdraw?\n\nSpecifically, she intends to argue that, faced with anger within her own party, she has little choice but to prevent Schulz from becoming Germany's commissioner. Plus, SPD leader (and German vice chancellor) Gabriel has made it clear that he does not intend to allow Merkel's government to collapse over the issue. And, if Social Democratic support for Juncker begins to splinter across Europe -- at least according to Merkel's strategy -- then Juncker will realize that his own chances to become president of the Commission are dwindling. And he will withdraw.\n\nA high-ranking advisor to European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, who is currently speaking to heads of government across Europe about the situation, confirms the scenario. \"I presume that Juncker will withdraw from the race himself, should criticism of his person continue as it has,\" he says. That would clear the way for a compromise candidate. Whether European Parliament, which is more self-confident than ever before, would approve such a candidate is an open question. Particularly given the fact that no serious names have emerged.\n\nMerkel Expresses Britain's Importance in Europe\n\nIn short, Merkel's calculation is one with an unusual number of variables and only one constant: The British should remain in the EU. Merkel sees the bickering over Juncker as a tricky political challenge but believes that a break between the EU and Britain would be a historical failure.\n\nMerkel made the distinction clear last Wednesday in German parliament. She uttered two or three sentences focused on her support for Juncker -- and followed it up with a long, passionate speech on Britain's importance to Europe. The \"nonchalant way\" that some have spoken of a possible British secession is \"extremely negligent,\" she said. The question as to whether the British stay is anything but unimportant, she said. Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (a senior member of the SPD) echoed the sentiment: \"Great Britain is a strong partner of Germany's and makes a decisive contribution to Europe's joint foreign policy and, as such, to the defense of European interests in the world.\" Germany's government, he said, has made it a goal to \"cooperate more closely on foreign policy.\"\n\nAnd despite her frustration with the role Britain has played in several past EU debates, Merkel values Britain's influence on the 28-member bloc. The similarities between Berlin's and London's positions become clear in a confidential German government paper on the tasks facing the next Commission. \"Growth and competitiveness\" should take precedence, the paper reads. \"The potential of the European market and free trade\" should be tapped to the fullest. The French, Spanish and Italians would not unconditionally sign off on such a focus at the moment. But British Prime Minister David Cameron surely would. The chancellor also knows that Britain's pro-market position in many debates allows her to focus on other areas, such as the EU budget, the banking union and the trans-Atlantic free-trade agreement.\n\nCameron seeks to reinforce his resistance at a mini-summit planned with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfelt, Dutch leader Mark Rutte and Merkel south of Stockholm on Monday and Tuesday. He's hoping he can count on the Swedes, the Dutch and Hungary as well as Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who has been more openly criticizing Juncker in recent days. Should they join him, he would be within reach of achieving a blocking minority in the European Council, the body representing the leaders of the EU member states, against Juncker -- especially if he could get the Germans on board.\n\nMore than anything, it is expected that Cameron will make clear just how much pressure he is under. If Juncker succeeds in becoming Commission president, British observers and diplomats fear it will trigger a political earthquake in London. If he doesn't prevent Juncker's election, outcry will be significant and sneering headlines are sure to appear in newspapers like the Daily Mail or the Daily Telegraph.\n\nPressure on the prime minister could even force him to move up the national referendum on EU membership, currently planned for 2017. And were that to happen, a British exit from the EU would become a very real possibility.\n\n'Playing with Dynamite'\n\nCameron's staff is currently doing all it can, in a nationwide campaign, to put the focus squarely on the European Parliament and trying to paint it as a power hungry body trying to pull influence away from EU leaders. British diplomats accuse Juncker, Schulz and a handful of other EU parliamentarians of seeking to leverage European treaties to improve parliament's position within Brussels' institutional structures. \"They are playing with dynamite,\" they claim.\n\nGermany's own chancellor is partly responsible for the fact that things have gotten this far; in recent months, Merkel's approach has been more hands off than normal. For quite some time, for example, she ignored Martin Schulz's efforts on the center-left to establish support for the concept of a Europe-wide leading candidate on the German model. Indeed, it became something of a Schulz fait accompli. Merkel even agreed to make Juncker the lead candidate for the center-right European People's Party -- to which her CDU belongs -- even though she privately shared the widespread reservations about the former Luxembourg prime minister. Finally, at last week's EU summit, she lost control of proceedings and was only able to stop what would have been a highly contested vote on Juncker with considerable effort.\n\nSince then, the image she has presented publicly is one of wavering. First she downplayed Juncker, describing him as just one of many who could do the job. Then she backed him publicly, promising several times she would intercede on his behalf.\n\nMerkel has since spoken to almost all of the 27 other EU leaders in the search for a compromise. That process is expected to continue until the end of June. \"We have time,\" she told German parliament in Berlin this week.\n\nMeanwhile, Jean-Claude Juncker is expressing his optimism. On Monday, he sent out his first Tweet in five days, quite a delay when viewed against his Twitter activity during the election. \"I'm more confident than ever that I will be the next European Commission President,\" he wrote. Juncker refused to further elaborate when contacted by SPIEGEL.\n\nBy Nikolaus Blome, Horand Knaup, Peter Müller, Christoph Scheuermann, Gregor Peter Schmitz and Severin Weiland",

  "latent_26634": "CLOSE Donald Trump told The Wall Street Journal he might keep some provisions of President Obama's health care law after all. Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nRepublican National Committee Chair Reince Preibus will be President-Elect Donald Trump's chief of staff. (Photo: Michael Reynolds, EPA)\n\nNEW YORK — Donald Trump on Sunday tapped Reince Priebus — the Republican Party chairman who helped engineer his stunning presidential victory last week — as his White House chief of staff.\n\nTrump also considered campaign CEO Stephen K. Bannon for the slot, but announced that the former Breitbart News executive would serve chief strategist and senior counselor for the administration that takes office in little more than two months.\n\n“I am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country,” Trump said in a statement. “Steve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again.”\n\nIn thanking Trump for the appointment, Priebus said he would strive to \"create an economy that works for everyone, secure our borders, repeal and replace Obamacare and destroy radical Islamic terrorism.\"\n\nBannon, who joined Trump's team in August, said that \"we had a very successful partnership on the campaign, one that led to victory. We will have that same partnership in working to help President-elect Trump achieve his agenda.”\n\nPriebus, a lawyer and political operative who became Republican Party chairman in 2011, developed the get-out-the-vote operation that Trump's campaign rode to a come-from-behind victory over Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. While critical of some of Trump's comments at times, Priebus became one of the GOP establishment's most vocal proponents of Trump after the New York businessman won the party nomination.\n\nThe new White House chief of staff is also a close ally of a frequent Trump critic, House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nAs a news executive, Bannon helped turned Breitbart into a leading voice of conservatism and a champion of Trump's candidacy.\n\nBut Ryan has been one of the news site's top targets.\n\nBeyond personnel announcements, the president-elect began sketching out policy priorities this weekend and appeared to temper some of his campaign rhetoric. His proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexican border may include some fencing instead, Trump said, and his initial deportation plan will focus on \"criminals\" who are in the country illegally.\n\nIn \"certain areas, a wall is more appropriate,\" but \"there could be some fencing,\" Trump said in an interview with CBS’ Sunday newsmagazine 60 Minutes.\n\nWhile pledging more deportations, Trump said he would emphasize criminals before deciding what to do about law-abiding families who are in the country illegally.\n\n\"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers,\" Trump told CBS, later adding: \"After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that they're talking about who are terrific people.\"\n\nTrump put the number of deportable criminals at two to three million, but immigration experts say it is much lower.\n\nTrump said on 60 Minutes that if Americans are afraid of how he might run the government, it is “only because they don't know me.”\n\nFor instance, reporter Lesley Stalh suggested that gays and lesbians may fear Trump would roll back marriage equality for same-sex couples.\n\n“You know, I’ve been a supporter,” Trump said. “These cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They've been settled. And I'm fine with that.”\n\nTrump railed against lobbyists and special interest on the campaign trail, but acknowledged that he has numerous lobbyists on his transition team, because \"That's the only people you have down there\".\n\n\"They know the system right now,\" Trump said, \"but we're going to phase that out. You have to phase it out.\"\n\nIn addition to the 60 Minutes interview, the president-elect and aides holed up high in Trump Tower throughout the weekend as they pursued staffing decisions and policy planning for an administration that takes office in little more than two months.\n\nWorkers pour cement while installing reviewing stands for the presidential inauguration in front of the White House in Washington, DC on November 12, 2016. (Photo: Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSince his election win over Clinton on Tuesday night, Trump has granted a couple of select interviews, spoken with Republican officials and foreign leaders — and tweeted, including more pot shots at his media coverage.\n\n\"Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the 'Trump phenomena,\" Trump tweeted early Sunday.\n\nTrump pledged to be \"very restrained\" with social media during his presidency, but told 60 Minutes that \"the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they're spending much more money than I spent. And I won.\"\n\nSocial media, Trump said, \"has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that.\"\n\nTrump also seemed to extend olive branches to his critics over the weekend, including possible compromises on his plan to repeal President Obama's health care law.\n\nTrump spoke in terms of keeping provisions that forbid insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nTrump has also said his priorities include a program of road-and-bridge projects (\"infrastructure\"), de-regulation of financial institutions, and beefing up border against drugs and illegal immigration.\n\nWhile the Trump campaign has provided little information, foreign governments have confirmed that their leaders spoke with the president-elect. The government of France, for example, said President Francois Hollande spoke with Trump for some 10 minutes Friday about terrorism and Syria.\n\nA Japanese official said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will be in New York on Thursday to meet with the incoming U.S. President.\n\nAs Trump and his team huddled upstairs in his Manhattan tower, thousands of demonstrators massed outside on Fifth Avenue throughout the weekend, protesting what they called his racist and sexist behavior throughout the campaign. Many protesters pointed out that Clinton will likely win the popular vote over Trump.\n\nIn a weekend interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said he wants to bring the country together after a rancorous campaign.\n\nAsked if he regretted his own aggressive rhetoric, Trump told the Journal: \"No, I won.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fPomdA",

  "latent_26764": "86 Tips for CorelDRAW\n\nThe manuals often hide secrets that we do not see or forget. These secrets we discover later in a second reading of the manual or show us somebody. Or maybe it’s more fun: we discover it for ourselves, as surely as it has ever happened to us. There are tricks that do not even come out in the manuals. Sure some of you already know many, but there are new Corelians every day eager to learn those secrets that help us work more effectively. Some only work in version 10, but many are worth for most versions. With them you will optimize your time working with CorelDRAW.\n\n1.- Select: Double click on the selection tool select all objects in the document. We will use it in almost all our sessions with CorelDRAW.\n\n2.- With the tool selection and dragging select all the objects that are completely within the selection frame.\n\nTips CorelDRAW 1CorelDRAW TipsWith the tool selection and dragging while pressing ALT select all the objects that are inside the selection frame and those that simply touch, even if they are not integers.\n\n3.- To remove an object from a multiple selection, we select it again while we press uppercase.\n\nHOME |ABOUT US | CONTACT US | REQUEST A QUOTE | FREE TRIAL\n\n4.- To remove the selection without pressing outside the selection, press ESC . Very useful when we do not have holes in the screen to click where there are no objects.\n\n5.- We can select objects that are behind others, but that we know they are there (in drawing lines display mode), pressing ALT while we select. This skips the first object in front, even if it is filled. If we press again select the next object below.\n\n6.- We can select objects with any drawing tool by means of a click, as if it were the selection tool itself.\n\n7.- To duplicate an object quickly we can select it, drag and, before releasing, to click with the right mouse button. If we want to duplicate it exactly where it is, the easiest thing is to press the + key when it is selected.\n\n8.- When moving an object we can create copies by its displacement by pressing the space bar. If we press while CTRL , restricts movement to horizontal or vertical and also works.\n\n9.- To navigate the screen with the keyboard, instead of the scroll bars, press ALT + direction arrows .\n\n10.- Tool Zoom: click with the main button increases. Right click reduces. Without changing the zoom tool or touching the keyboard.\n\n11.- To move by screen we have the navigator that there are where the scroll bars meet. If you click and drag, you move through the document. The rectangle shows the visible window. We can remove it quickly by pressing the N key.\n\n12.- With the new option of micro-displacement, we can move with the arrows of the keyboard the value of displacement, with CTRL microdesplazamiento and with Shift , superdesplazamiento. We can customize your values ​​by double-clicking the rules.\n\n13.- The guide lines can move them as if they were objects, and even select several at a time and can even be distributed. Also in version 10 there are 2 types of guide lines: normal and preset, which are placed automatically. They have different color to differentiate them from each other.\n\n14.- The toolbox side deployables can be “detached” from the tool as if it were a new toolbar.\n\n15.- To remove new toolbars from the property bar or from a toolbar and use them individually, select the element of the desired bar while pressing CTRL + ALT and drag it to the desktop. This creates a duplicate of the selected item.\n\nIf you just press ALT , you remove it from the toolbar or properties when you move it.\n\nIt is very useful if you want to move tool icons from one bar to another without opening the customization options.\n\n16.- A little exploited utility of the program is New window of the window menu, so you do not have to be switching between normal visualization and drawing lines. With dual monitor graphic cards is phenomenal, because you can put the second window full screen on the other monitor and updated in each action. You can edit in either, or three, or four … Each has its own zoom and view, which gives more interest to this option.\n\n17.- Just like to switch between programs press ALT + TAB , to switch between open Corel documents, press CTRL + ALT. If we have many open and we pass by, we can go back with Shift + CTRL + TAB . We can see the names of the open documents at the bottom of the window menu.\n\n18.- We can quickly open the dialog box of the filling of a selected object by double clicking on its color sample of the status bar.\n\n19.- Right dragging an object over another changes the cursor and when you open it opens a context menu in which we can move or copy an object, copy the properties of the source object in the target object, make a Powerclip or create a changing image.\n\n20.- If we drag with the right button an object on the paper while we press CAPTIVATES , we change the fill properties of the new objects. If we press ALT , it changes the contour properties.\n\n21.- To search for a color by its name in the color palette we click on a color while we press Shift . We get a window where we can write the number or the color name.\n\n22.- If we hold a color of the color palette, we get a popup palette with percentages of ink. In the palettes of flat inks we have 10 levels and in the others we have 49. In these last the original color is the center.\n\n23.- To select many nodes in irregular shapes that do not let us select them with a box, we can hold ALT and drag the shape tool to draw an irregular shape with freehand containing the nodes that we want. We can add individual selections or by means of a box if we hold down Shift .\n\n24.- If we have a group of objects in which there are objects of artistic text, and we want to convert all text objects to curves, it is not necessary to make the selection of element in element: we can turn the group into curves and trace us all the curve elements.\n\nCaution: it also converts curves to rectangles, ellipses, polygons …\n\n25.- Edit powerclip: we have a keyboard shortcut to edit the contents of a powerclip: once selected, press CTRL and without releasing make a new click. The powerclip editing mode opens.\n\nWhen we finish the modifications, press control and without letting click where there is nothing to finish the edition in this level, returning to the document.\n\n26.- Curiosity: By pressing ALT once or twice we alternate between white cursor / black cursor. Useless? Maybe with some types of padding I find the cursor …\n\n27.- Combine / Uncombine text: this trick is little known: With an artistic text object of several lines, we decompine ( CTRL + K ) and separate the lines, each as a text object. If we do it again, separate the words and if we do it again, separate the letters as different text elements.\n\nTo reassemble the text, combine ( CTRL + L ), but taking into account that we must select one by one and in order from the first letter to the last. The words and lines are also in order. This is because Corel remembers the original order in which the text was written and has the last word or written letter. That’s why it orders the other way around.\n\nIf it is a lot of text, it is faster to select everything, change the order (reverse order in the organize menu), and combine.\n\n28.- Rounding rectangles:\n\nWith the form tool and a rectangle, clicking on a corner node, deselecting the other 3 and we can round that one.\n\n29.- Variations of rotate and tilt. If we press CTRL + Shift , we can scale and rotate with the restricted angle. If we press ALT , we rotate and tilt at the same time and ALT + CTRL , rotate and tilt with controlled angle.\n\n30.- To release a clone from its master object, we cut and paste the clone. Eye: if we cut and paste the teacher, the clones disappear.\n\n31.- Double-clicking where the horizontal and vertical rules are joined is the origin of the rules in the lower left corner of the paper.\n\n32.- We can simultaneously adjust the height and width of an object if we\n\npress ALT and handle one of the corners of the selection frame. In this way we save ourselves to first adjust the height and then the width through the side panels of the selection frame.\n\n33.- To reflect 100% an object on itself, without it moving, and in a single step without going through the menu of scalar and reflect, we pull a side handle of the selection frame while we press CTRL + CAPITAL , until exceed the center of the object.\n\nThis reflection without displacement is also obtained with the reflection buttons of the transform toolbar and in the properties bar (if not text).\n\nIf we want to reflect simultaneously in vertical and horizontal without\n\nmoving, we press CTRL + CAPITAL + ALT when stretching of a corner, but making sure to surpass the center of the object both vertically and horizontally.\n\nIf we continue to drag out of the object, it continues to increase by 100%.\n\n34.- To quickly open the contour pen dialog box with a selected object, double-click the contour color swatch in the Status Bar. We can also press F12 .\n\n35.- You can print all the keyboard shortcuts of Corel commands to consult the ones we use the most and can learn them. This is done from the Tools menu, options, workspace, customization, commands, shortcut keys, see all. We can sort them by command, table, pulse or description by clicking on the headers. It is advisable to print with the landscape paper or, if possible, in A3, on the large table.\n\nRemember that keyboard shortcuts are customizable, and can be changed to others that are more accessible (for small hands), or easier to remember.\n\n36.- You can edit the bitmap that you import to CorelDRAW simply by double clicking on the image. Photopaint is automatically opened for editing.\n\nWhen you save after editing, changes are saved to the image that is embedded in the CDR.\n\n37.- Change the color of the guide lines. At times we are working with many guide lines and almost dizzy more than help. To be able to classify them and to distinguish them better we can change the color to those that we want, individually. To change the color, select one or more guide lines and right click on the new color in the color palette.\n\n38.- Guide lines, like all objects, can be locked\n\nindividually to avoid accidental movement. This option greatly improves the option to block the guideline layer, as it allows us to continue using and moving other guideline.\n\n39.- If you want to place nodes equidistant in a curve, you can select a node that is not the first one of the curve and press “+” several times. Each time creates a new node in the center between the selected node and the next node (towards the first node of the curve). For example, in a two-node curve, we select the last one (the small one) and press +. As the new node is also selected, each new pulse adds a new node equidistant between the selected nodes.\n\n40.- Easily close a curve. It is sometimes difficult to find the first node and the last of a curve to close it. To find the first node of a curve, select it, change to the form tool and press the home key on the keyboard. The first node is selected. To find the last node we would press End (End). But we just want to close the curve, we need to select the two, so we press Start, press and hold Shift and press End. We already have the two selected and there is only Join two nodes in the Toolbar of the tool form, or in the context menu of the right mouse button.\n\n41.- You can give the option to adjust paragraph text to a paragraph text\n\n, for example, to be able to comfortably put footnotes to images that already fit a text of paragraph and thus to avoid that the main text “mount” on the caption This function is not available for text, neither in the text properties bar nor in the context menu of the right mouse button, since normally, what we want to adjust is text to objects or photographs. We can create an icon of the function “adjust text” through the menu Tools, personalization, commands, choose the category of text, drag the icon to the desktop and we accept.\n\nWe will have a new toolbox. If we had previously selected the text tool, we can drag the icon directly to the properties toolbar of the text tool, which is where we need it, and there it will be when we want to make use of it.\n\n42.- Create a mixture of two objects by tracing a stroke directly with the interactive mixing tool. We create the two objects that we want to mix. Select the tool interactive mix and whilewepress ALT draw the stroke between both objects. When the stroke is finished on the other object, the mixture is created.\n\n43.- Quickly mix colors from the palette. After filling an object with color, we can mix that color with others to find the hue we need. Simply press CTRL and click on another color.\n\nIt will be mixed with the one with the object in 10% portions of ink. This can come in handy for, say, yellowing a green.\n\nWhen cutting an object with the knife tool sometimes\n\nwe would like to see the shape of the cut without seeing the rest of the object trimmed, and even toggle between one or the other. When we are finishing the cut and before releasing the mouse, we can press TAB consecutively to see one part, the other or both. When we let go it will remain what is seen, automatically erasing the rest.\n\n45.- When we drag from the rules we get guide lines parallel to the rule. We can pull them perpendicular if we pull them out while we press ALT.\n\n46.- To alternate between lines and curves in the same stroke without drawing with the tool raised, we press a TAB and continue moving the cursor to place the next node. To continue with curves press TAB again.\n\n47.- Delete the last stroke without drawing. When we draw with the raised hand tool and we want to undo the last stroke, we usually stop drawing and remove nodes with the tool shape. Then, without removing the selection, and with the tool raised, we continue drawing.\n\nFor if we want a little magic, instead of doing all that and without stopping to draw, we can press Shift and draw backwards until we reach the last part correct. It’s like deleting nodes as they pass over them. When we release capitals we can continue to draw.\n\n48.- To zoom in on all objects press F4 or double click on the Zoom Tool.\n\n49.- Double click on the tool selects all the nodes of the selected object.\n\n50.- Double click with the tool form on a line creates a new node. Double click on a node, delete it.\n\nWhen we want a floating window, like a toolbar, a color palette or property bar, to return to its coupled position, we double-click on the blue area of ​​the title. To make it float again we double click on the two lines at the end. Do you want to know who the Corel programmers are? The computer geniees and all the equipment that has created this program marvel? In Corel 10 you can know with this secret trick: you open the Help menu, About CorelDRAW, and a screen appears with the presentation image of CorelDRAW 10 and a few buttons to the side. You double click just above the W and … these are our heroes.\n\n53.- This is very basic and should be at the beginning, but it is never late: double clicking on the shadow or the edge of the paper opens the page preparation dialog.\n\n54.- Another classic: pressing the spacebar changes from the\n\ncurrent tool to the selection tool, or toggles between it and the previous tool, except with the text tool, in which it obviously creates a space.\n\nTo go to the selection tool from the text tool, you must press CTRL + Spacebar .\n\n55.- To move the colors of the color palette, click on the triangle at the end. If we click with the right mouse button, an entire row is moved.\n\n56.- An essential trick: press F8 while restarting Corel restores the values ​​of a new installation. This avoids many unnecessary reinstallations due to program failures and instabilities or unfortunate customizations. It is very useful when Corel does “weird things”.\n\n57.- A headache for me has been how to solve that the same CMYK values ​​of a bitmap and those of a vector object are not identical, especially when they overlap, which is when it is most noticeable. For filming is not necessary, because it does well, but for printer, which is where we make our models to present the customer, it goes wrong. In Corel 10 I have solved it as follows: in the menu tools, color management, at the bottom, in style, select ” color management disabled” (I guess it will be color management off). On my Epson Stylus Color 1520 works perfect.\n\n58.- Calibrate the rules of Corel so that our monitor shows real measurements when putting a Zoom of 1: 1. We will need a transparent plastic ruler. In the menu tools, options, workspace, toolbox, zoom tool, hand. There we have a button to calibrate rules. It works by relating measures of pixels with measures of centimeters.\n\nWe put the rule of plastic on the rules on screen and we are varying the value of pixels until it coincides with the rule, both vertically and horizontally. It is important that we have our eyes at the center of the screen. From now on we can use the 1: 1 zoom and see the actual size of things without printing them.\n\n59.- why do not you keep the changes in the configuration of a document that we want to remain as predetermined? Because in the menu Tools, options (or faster CTRL + J ), in the documents section, we must activate “Save options for defaults for new documents” after making the changes, and activate those boxes of the fields that we have modified and we want them to be predetermined.\n\n60.- To edit an object belonging to a group, press CTRL and select the object, even if the group is not selected. The selection box will consist of 8 circles instead of 8 squares.\n\n61.- In principle you can not duplicate an object belonging to a group, because the command is not active, but if we move it and right-click (see trick 7) it can. The duplicate will also belong to the group.\n\n62.- If we want to remove an object quickly from a group without ungrouping, we cut the object and re-paste it ( CTRL + X and CTRL + V ). It will remain in the same position, but outside the group.\n\n63.- To modify a curve with the form tool, we can use the nodes, the knobs of the nodes or the curve itself. Each one acts differently and will be useful according to what we want.\n\n64.- This trick is for those who have mice with wheels and who agree to click with it. When you do this, the cursor “sticks” to the scrollbar scroller and stays fixed in it until we click to release it.\n\nWith this function you only have to move the mouse without holding down to move us through the vertical scroll bar. This can be very useful in certain displacement actions to avoid the escape of the cursor by leaving the scroll bar while we move, such as when we do photo retouching. It also works with other programs.\n\n65.- Redraw screen. On some occasions, especially when moving objects when zoomed in on part of the document, part of what was on the screen disappears, like a redraw failure. To correct it, press CTRL + W , which is to redraw the screen. Our drawing appears again complete.\n\n66.- Complete toolbars with more functions. To put more functions that, by our work, we are interested to have in an existing toolbar, we click with the right mouse button on it and we mark Customize, Toolbar “name”, to add new command … Automatically sends us to the menu of command options, where we can select the one we want by looking in the list and dragging it to our toolbar.\n\n67.- Transparent toolbars. Sometimes we need to have open many toolbars, the object manager, other dockable windows and we need to move them continuously to see our chart. These are the times when you wonder when you will buy that 25 “monitor. Meanwhile we have a “hidden” function that is to make the toolbars transparent. We find it, of course, in the customization options, where it says application. If we click “convert UI to transparent” there are more options: transparency degree, and what we want to make transparent (command bars, dockable windows …). Unfortunately, I’m afraid it only works with next-generation operating systems. (2000, XP …)\n\n68.- We can modify the elements of the status bar by pressing ALT and moving the mouse: Dragging the item out of the status bar will delete it. By dragging we can also move an element to another position in the status bar. Stretching from the edges of the spaces they occupy, we increase their size horizontally to see more information. It would really be an extension of what I said in Trick 15.\n\n69.- Importing an image with its original size and resolution is very simple if when the import square appears you make a single click – without drag – press Enter or space bar – the one I use for your convenience. If you click with the mouse and drag you are scaling the image and if you drag while you press ALT freely scales the height and the width of the image.\n\n70.- We can easily color monochrome bitmap images (1 bit black and white). For this we select the image and color as if it were a vector object. Left button on a color palette gives the fill and right button gives the outline, only here instead of fill and outline we talk about the white area and the black or background and figure. If in our image we give any fill to the background, it will be transparent, without the need to use GIF format or alpha channel. We can do very interesting things with this effect.\n\n71.- To enlarge / reduce a text frame and to enlarge / reduce the size of the typography, as in the artistic text, we press ALT while dragging the handle of a corner.\n\nThe last line of the text forced to full justification is sometimes very “rare”. To solve this defect we have a good option: ALT + 0160 adds a space, like when you press the space bar. What happens is that with this trick does push the last line. To avoid having to repeat ALT + 0160 until the text is put in place, we can do it 1 time and go back that space. Then we simply press the space bar as many times as necessary, because having a character behind it, it is considered as something and pushes, whereas only the space bar does not.\n\n73.- To increase or decrease with keyboard the size of the text -art or paragraph-, instead of using the property bar and try 1 point more or a point less with several mouse clicks until you find the size that we want, we can select the text and while pressing CTRL , press the up arrow on the numeric keypad (8) to increase or the down arrow (2) to reduce.\n\nCopy objects properties from the object manager without touching the drawing. It is not as powerful as a keyboard or mouse shortcut, but it can help those who use the layers a lot.\n\nYou select an object of the desired color in the object manager, just inside the same layer, and that is not inside a group, and while typing capital letters you drag with the right button on the object that you want to have the same properties . You get a contextual menu that allows you to do it. This menu does not come out any other way in the object manager.\n\n75.- Separate the vuncated paragraph text frames so that each text frame is left with only the text they showed: You select all the linked text frames you want to separate and the short ones ( CTRL + X ) and then the new ( CTRL + V ). Copies of the frames have only the text they showed when they were linked and the link is lost. They are also in the same place if you have the position of duplicates at zero.\n\nInserting symbols into text strings can be as easy as pasting. Copies an object to the clipboard, for example a logo. Now type in artistic or paragraph text and paste ( CTRL + V ) as if you put one more letter. You paste the object stuck to the size of the letters. It also works with Shift + Insert. It’s a shame that you convert the original colors into CMYK.\n\n77.- To quickly change the status bar from the lower position to the top, in addition to “right click on the status bar, customize, status bar, position” can be done with a double click on the bar status when no document is open.\n\n78.- in the welcome screen that comes out when you open the program – if you have not disabled it, of course – you have to click on one of the options to enter the program. If you want to open a new document, which is the default option of that screen, pressing Enter will open it and you do not need to click.\n\n79.- In trick 5 he commented that we can select objects that are behind others while we press ALT . When we work with line visualization and we have the option Consider as fill, something similar happens, but we can select objects without pressing ALT if we select them directly by the contour instead of by the center.\n\n80.- Non-black bar codes. This is a problem that I have encountered occasionally and that although I wish it could be done directly with CorelDRAW it can not. The need arises when I want to create a label for 1 ink that is not black and the barcode does not change color and I get 2 colors in the separation. Knowing that bar codes need a high contrast with the background, this can not be done with any color but, to save that problem, to change color we export the bar code as CMX or AI (vector formats) and we return it to import into our CorelDRAW document. We will have a group of objects that we can change color. Be careful also with any modification, because now we could move a bar and alter the code !!\n\nCORELDRAW TRICKS BAR CODES\n\n81.- Copy the outline color of an object in the fill of another one or vice versa, only with the status bar. This is very useful when you are testing fill and outline colors. Although with the eyedropper and the bucket can be very useful, when it comes to contours you can pick up a fake sample. Try with a fine contour without getting too close to the zoom. From a black pantone outline can come out a gray CMYK.\n\nThe most accurate is to copy colors from the status bar. You select the source object, select the contour color sample from the status bar, and drag it to the target object. There, if you look at it, when passing through the contour the sample dragged changes briefly in case we want to copy the color to the contour, and if we loose on the filling, we fill with the color that we carry, just as if we had dragged a color from the palette.\n\n82.- The default option of a powerclip is “blocking content to Powerclip” and changes in size or position of the object also affect the size or position of its content and that may not be what we want. To freely manage a powerclip object without affecting its content we must unlock the content and the option we have only when we right click on the object: we have to unselect “lock content to Powerclip”.\n\n83.- It has happened to me sometimes that, working with CorelDraw, I delete all the objects on the screen and it seems that we have lost the job. Of course we do not dare to save and we go back to the previous version or we start again. I do not know exactly what the fault is, but if we save the document as it is, apparently in white, we close it and reopen it, everything appears in its place and we can continue working.\n\nI think we have all gone before or after the happy change of language that causes us to work with Corel. We have been struggling to change the traditional Spanish by the international and back to begin – I the first. Yesterday it happened to me again and it took me two minutes to go back to English and unconfigure the entire keyboard. I could not leave it in Spanish anymore.\n\nI have found in the windows control panel / regional settings / languages ​​a box that has solved the topic: hotkeys for languages, change sequence of keys, and not enable the sequence of keys. It turns out that the options of key sequences are:\n\nCTRL + Shift\n\nALT left + Shift\n\nPrecisely these keyboard shortcuts can be used to the scale and Corel objects reflect, among others, or as part of key strokes, such as editing text with CTRL + Shift + T . As it is a Windows option, and we have assigned a sequence to it, as soon as it detects it executes the assigned order. As simple and annoying as that.\n\n85.- To create many equidistant parallel lines to guide a page, the fastest way is to assign the position values ​​of duplicates to zero and the distance we want, draw a horizontal line of paper width and duplicate it. Instead of pressing CTRL + D again and again – which is the duplicate shortcut – we hold down CTRL + D and the page will fill at a high speed with equidistant lines. If we want to quad, we can do the same with the verticals.\n\n86.- Blank files after a program failure. When Corel hangs and then we can not open or there is nothing in the document, we can try the following: Normally Corel saves a copy of your temporary C in somewhere that depends on whether you have a default temporary folder for Corel and operating system you use. Look for files with a CDR extension, whatever they are called, with a size similar to your file, inside the disk where Corel is installed. You may encounter a temporary called cor1.cdr. It is also possible to find a tmp called @@@@@ cdr.tmp or something similar that you can try importing to Coreldirectly or changing its extension by the CDR.\n\nAdvertisements",

This is our part of free speech.”\n\n“College campuses are not free speech areas. Do you understand? Obviously, you don’t understand.”\n\nThe professor noted that Fresno State has a designated “free speech area,” but a Fresno State free expression policy obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation and effective June 2015 shows that students can engage in free expression “in all outdoor spaces on campus.”\n\n“Fresno State Students for Life received full permission to chalk pro-life messages near the library. Rather than countering with his own message, Dr. Thatcher took the illegal approach of censoring speech and inciting students to help in this,” stated Kristan Hawkins, Students for Life of America’s president, in the press release. “No students should have to endure this kind of intimidation and harassment for simply expressing their views, but especially not those who want to help the women betrayed, and the preborn children killed, by the abortion industry.”\n\nThatcher told The Daily Caller News Foundation that he had no comment.\n\n“The university’s policy is clear: Free speech on campus is not limited to a ‘free speech zone’ or any other narrowly defined area,” said Joseph I. Castro, president of Fresno State. “The students who wrote the chalk messages received prior university approval and were well within their rights to express themselves in this manner.”\n\n“Those disagreeing with the students’ message have a right to their own speech, but they do not have the right to erase or stifle someone else’s speech under the guise of their own right to free speech.

  "latent_26982": "Michigan governor slashes $54 million more from school funding\n\nBy Tom Eley\n\n21 October 2009\n\nMichigan Governor Jennnifer Granholm on Monday vetoed $54 million more from public school funding in a bid to help meet the state’s $2 billion budget deficit. The cut comes on top of a $165-per-student cut enacted in a temporary budget passed earlier in the month, which is now effective for the year.\n\nThe additional cuts would affect 39 school districts in the state, 26 of them grouped in the three southeastern Michigan counties of Oakland, Macomb, and Wayne, around metropolitan Detroit.\n\nThe districts were targeted for additional cuts due to a special exemption that had previously allowed them to spend more per student than other schools in the state because of their relatively large property tax bases.\n\nThese are hardly “rich” school districts. Most of them are in largely working class suburbs of Detroit that have already been devastated by the Obama administration’s forced bankruptcy of the US auto industry.\n\nThe Detroit suburbs of Livonia and Dearborn would each lose $4.9 million in funding if Granholm’s veto holds. Wayne County would see 10 districts lose money. The Detroit public school system, already in a state of collapse, would not suffer additional cuts.\n\nGranholm claims she vetoed the funding in order to force lawmakers to come up with additional forms of revenue to meet the budget deficit. But there is little chance the funding will be restored. “Those lines the governor vetoed will simply be unfunded,” a spokesman for Republican Senate Majority Leader Mike Bishop said. “If the governor wants to veto parts of this budget, we will not refund them.”\n\nThe affected school districts were shocked by the news. Northville Schools Superintendent Leonard Rezmierski called Granholm’s veto “a horrific amount of reduction after we’ve started school.”\n\nHeidi Nanse, president of the Livonia Parent Teacher Student Association, told the World Socialist Web Site the cuts would be “devastating.” She said that rather than driving down funding for school districts like Livonia, the state should be increasing funding for poorer districts, such as those in Detroit proper. “This decision is very bad for our children, and children are our future,” Nance said.\n\n“It’s going to be devastating,” Trenton public schools Superintendent John Save told the Detroit Free Press. “We had no idea this was coming down.”\n\n“We feel totally abandoned.... It puts us in an almost impossible position,” said Tim McAvoy, a spokesman for the Troy public schools, noting that the school district must now cut an additional $3 million on top of $2 million in cuts it must put in place resulting from the state’s per-pupil funding cuts, and having already slashed $7 million from its budget this year. “To slash these funds when we are well into our fiscal year is unconscionable. It puts us [in] an extremely difficult position.”\n\nGranholm and the state legislature waited until the last minute to pass the education funding bill, which was required to be in place by Tuesday morning. The state’s ongoing budget crisis had left school districts without necessary state money to fund ongoing operations such as employee payroll.\n\nThe bill also cuts $8 million in funding to small rural high schools, $16.3 million to intermediate schools, $3 million to vocational education, and $2 million to adult education.\n\nThis may only be the beginning. Funding reductions to Michigan’s public education system will, by all indications, be intensified in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe cut of $165-per-student funding was based on the assumption that the state could raise an additional $100 million in revenue. While the legislature failed to appropriate the $100 million, tax revenues for public education have eroded still further. The state treasury has just revealed that projected sales tax revenues have plummeted beyond expectations, leaving collections for school aid $264 million further in the red.\n\nAs a result, “Granholm may have to order cuts later this fall that school officials say could amount to reductions of about $300 per student,” according to the Detroit News. The treasury indicated that still more cuts would follow over the next five years.\n\n“If this school aid bill were a check drawn on a bank, it would be returned for insufficient funds,” Granholm declared. “To bring the budget into balance, I have vetoed $54 million in appropriations. But even these reductions will not fully resolve the shortfall.”\n\nMeanwhile, Michigan’s budget crisis continues, with Granholm, House Democrats, and Senate Republicans bickering over equally reactionary measures to meet the state’s estimated $2 billion shortfall.\n\nAll are in agreement that spending on social programs and education, and the jobs and benefits of state workers, must be savagely cut. None propose any increases in income taxes on the wealthy or the financial institutions that have preyed on the state’s industry and workers.\n\nIn addition to spending cuts, Granholm favors increased forms of regressive taxation that target workers’ purchases, while Republicans and Democrats in the state legislature have resisted any new forms of taxation. Republicans call for blocking a tax credit to low-income workers, while Democrats demand a 3 percent surtax on doctors’ gross sales receipts, which would inevitably be passed on to health care consumers.",

  "latent_27554": "Preview | Recap | Notebook\n\nHeat-Spurs Preview\n\nBy TIM REYNOLDS\n\nPosted Jun 14 2014 7:32PM SAN ANTONIO (AP) Early Sunday evening, LeBron James will gather his Miami Heat teammates around him and offer a few final words of wisdom before they try to extend their reign as NBA champions. James never rehearses the speech, but already knows what the gist will be. \"It would be in the range of, `Why not us?\"' James said Saturday. \"Why not us? History is broken all the time. And obviously we know we're against the greatest of odds.\" Against the greatest of odds, against maybe the greatest of San Antonio Spurs teams, too. Both are very much against the Heat now, and both are winning. The Spurs are a victory away from their fifth championship, and will go for it at home Sunday night in Game 5 of the NBA Finals. The Spurs are the 32nd team in NBA history to hold a 3-1 lead in the finals. All 31 of the previous teams have won the title. \"History is made to be broken, and why not me be a part of it? That would be great,\" James said. \"That would be a great story line, right? But we'll see what happens. I've got to live in the moment, though, before we even get to that point.\" The Spurs have the same way of thinking. They took command of the finals in stunning fashion by not just winning in Miami, but winning twice - and winning big. San Antonio won Games 3 and 4 on the road by a combined 40 points, never trailing by more than two in either contest and running out to 25-point leads in each. \"We've got to act like we're coming into it like it's a road game,\" Spurs guard Danny Green said. \"It's a mentality thing. We have to come up with the same mentality we do on the road and try to protect home court and play with desperation.\" There was no talk from the Spurs on Saturday about closing in on a title, or anything remotely close to that topic. They thought they had it wrapped up with 28 seconds left in Game 6 last season against Miami and saw it slip away - so even with a 3-1 lead and being at home instead the road for this potential clinching situation, it's pretty clear that San Antonio isn't willing to leave anything to chance. \"They're going to come out and give us their best punch possible,\" Spurs star Tim Duncan said. \"We know that they're back-to-back champs and they've been in this situation before and they have all the confidence in the world that they can win these games. So we have to do just the same. Come out there and say, hey, we're going to take it little by little, quarter by quarter, and see what happens.\" That all sounds good, and he meant every word. Thing is, the Heat - these Heat, anyway - haven't been in this situation before. Since James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh teamed up, the Heat have never trailed 3-1 in a series. Until now. \"We're not so entitled or jaded that we're above having to fight for it, and that's what it is right now,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"It's competition. So we've got to find a way to fight and get this next game, and that's what it's all about.\" Miami took a day off Friday. Mario Chalmers played with his son, James watched some film and rested at home, Udonis Haslem tried to relax with family. Wade, who missed nine of his first 10 shots - raising questions about his health - went a different way. He went into the gym, by himself, looking for answers. \"I have very good reason that everything could change,\" Wade said. \"As I continue to say throughout the season, it's a game-to-game thing.\" Wade was down 2-0 in the 2006 finals, and trailed by 13 points in the fourth quarter of Game 3 of that series against Dallas. The Heat won that championship in six games. \"You have to pull from your experiences,\" Wade said, \"and know where you came from to know where you're trying to go.\" That also applies to the Spurs. Losing the last two games of the finals last year still stings San Antonio. That series was portrayed widely as the Spurs' last hurrah - an aging team with old stars, there's no way they could come back from something as devastating as letting the 2013 championship slip away, right? Wrong. The Spurs finished with the best record in the regular season, and are one win shy of just being the best team, period. \"Whatever success anyone has is due to a lot of factors,\" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. \"Some of it is not even your doing. Sometimes things just happen. So success is a pretty complicated thing.\" So are comebacks. But James is eager for the chance. \"For me, it's like you either don't make the playoffs or you win a championship,\" James said. \"There's no in-between.\"\n\nCopyright 2014 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

Players wrapped themselves in flags from around world, a reminder that the San Antonio Spurs look far beyond the border to build champions, as confetti fell from above. Painfully denied 12 months ago by the Miami Heat, this victory party was worth the wait. \"It makes last year OK,\" Duncan said. The Spurs finished off a dominant run to their fifth NBA championship Sunday night, ending the Heat's two-year title reign with a 104-87 victory that wrapped up the series in five games. \"We had a great first quarter, but from that point on they were the better team, and that's why they're the champions in 2014,\" said LeBron James, who led the Heat with 31 points and 10 rebounds. San Antonio erased an early 16-point deficit and routed Miami for the fourth time in the series, denying the Heat's quest for a third straight championship. A year after the Spurs suffered their only loss in six finals appearances - a heartbreaking seven-game defeat - they turned the rematch into no match at all. \"We wanted to redeem ourselves. I'm just glad we were able to do that,\" Parker said. Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard had 22 points and 10 rebounds for the Spurs, who added this title to the ones they won in 1999, 2003, '05 and '07. They nearly had another last year, but couldn't hold off the Heat. \"I've said many times, a day didn't go by where I didn't think about Game 6,\" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said of the turning point in last year's finals. \"So I think, just in general, for the group to have the fortitude that they showed to get back to this spot, I think speaks volumes about how they're constituted and what kind of fiber they have.\" Not to mention tons of talent, and perhaps the best coaching in the game. \"They played exquisite basketball this series and in particular these last three games and they are the better team. There's no other way to say it,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. The Spurs won four titles in nine years, but hadn't been back on top since 2007, making Foreigner's \"Feels Like the First Time\" an appropriate song choice after the final buzzer. Duncan and Popovich have been here for all of them, and it was the fourth for Parker and Ginobili, who with Duncan are once again the reigning the Big Three in the NBA. Chris Bosh finished with 13 points and Dwyane Wade just 11 on 4-of-12 shooting for the Heat. The painful conclusion to last year's NBA Finals served as the fuel for this one, powering the Spurs to a league-best 62-win season and a rematch with Miami - the first in the finals since Chicago beat Utah in 1997-98. Round 2 went to the Spurs, but both teams have challenges to navigate if there is to be a rubber match. San Antonio will face questions - as it has for years - about the age of its core, and whether Duncan, Ginobili and Popovich want to stick around. The Heat will brace for the potential free agency of James, Wade and Bosh, and will need younger, fresher pieces around the three All-Stars if they all stay. But this moment belongs to the Spurs. Playing a methodical, albeit winning, style for many years made San Antonio respected, but never beloved. The Spurs were TV ratings killers, casual viewers finding them not much fun to watch. But Popovich opened up the offense a few years ago, making the Spurs an easy-to-like, tough-to-beat group that thrives on ball movement and 3-point shooting. \"You showed the world how beautiful this game is,\" Commissioner Adam Silver told the Spurs during the postgame award ceremony. A decade and a half after winning their first title in 1999, when Duncan was in his second season, the Spurs remain the NBA's model organization, a small-market team that simply wins big and hardly ever does it with a high draft pick. Instead, they found players overseas or in other organizations who would fit the Spurs' way of doing things and mesh with the Duncan, Parker and Ginobili, who have teamed for 117 postseason victories. That included Leonard, acquired in a draft-night trade with Indiana after playing at San Diego State, and Patty Mills, an Australian national who scored 17 points off the bench. In the end, the Spurs made winning their fifth title look stunningly easy - much to the delight of the home crowd. After the slow start, they had their fans standing, chanting and dancing much of the second half. Notes: It was the Spurs' 12th win by 15 or more points, most ever in a postseason. The Spurs outscored opponents by 214 points in the postseason. ... Miami had won 11 straight series, tied for the fifth-longest streak in NBA history. --- Follow Brian Mahoney on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Briancmahoney\n\nCopyright 2014 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

  "latent_27648": "Sometimes interviews go perfectly according to script and everything is just dandy. Also, frequently boring. In those instances, you nod dutifully after exhausting every possible line of questioning, turn off your recorder, and usually buy some form of burrito to soak up the tears. But other times things just sort of naturally veer into wacky territory. That’s not to say that CCP CEO Hilmar Pétursson’s dreams of a virtual-reality-born utopian future aren’t admirable (personally, I’d love for them to come true), but these are some huge – almost preposterously so – ideas. Do you want to hear how EVE Online could, according to its creator, help end class disparities once and for all? Then you’ve come to the right place.\n\nI once met an EVE Online player who recounted to me in-person, with an almost childlike grin on his face, how much fun he had fooling new players into suicidally barreling through the most dangerous reaches of space and losing every scrap of anything they’d pried from the game’s cold claws. He loved the manipulation, he feasted on the frustration. Other players were his playthings.\n\n[pullquote]This could bring about a place where we’re no longer constrained by the atoms of this particular Earth.[/pullquote]\n\nBut then I tried putting things on more relatable terms, and his armor cracked a bit. What was it like to be in those people’s shoes? Had he even thought of those players as people with lives and precious little leisure time and dreams of one day adopting the self-assured swagger of Nathan Fillion as seen in Firefly? Sure, in fairness EVE is not a place people venture into if they’re looking to be coddled, but it’s important to at least be aware of how your seemingly harmless actions are affecting other people. “Maybe I’m a bad person,” he conceded. “Maybe I’m a bad person.”\n\nI don’t think he thought he was actually a bad person. And I can’t really blame him all that much. The Internet is a strange place, and when you’re primarily communicating with strangers through text or – at best – disembodied, faceless voice, it’s easy to forget you’re even dealing with other people in the first place. Or maybe you realize that they’re people, but they’re demi-people to your brain. Not actually on your radar, in a galaxy far, far away from your thoughts and priorities.\n\nAnd so, by way of that anecdote and a couple others, I ended up bringing CCP CEO Hilmar Pétursson around from, “We don’t want to say too much about EVE Valkyrie‘s future. Right now, we’re staying focused and taking advantage of the platform” to a wide-ranging discussion of how Valkyrie, EVE Online, and Oculus Rift will extinguish all the world’s communicatory ills in one massive, beautifully idealistic supernova. The man had stars in his eyes, but that’s what it takes to steer a universe like EVE. Passion, obsession, and unflinching hope. Madness, in other words. But good madness, I think.\n\n“I figure, ‘OK, we have multiple games – EVE, Dust, and Valkyrie – that all happen in the same universe,” Pétursson began after I shared my experiences with communication breakdowns on the Internet. “We have had some experimentation with allowing people to meet each others’ avatars, which I think frankly was premature. We under-delivered a lot on that. But I see VR as a way to let people have a tight relationship in an abstract way over large distances. To come and meet together. It’s like when people come together at Fanfest in Iceland each year. There’s this immense joy when people actually meet face-to-face and talk about their adventures in EVE in a much more personal way.”\n\n“To be able to bring that out without people having to fly across the Earth to a volcanic rock in the Atlantic – just to have a social experience where we could meet and look at each other across a table with eye tracking and you are who you are in EVE and I am who I am in EVE – [that’s amazing]. And then we can manage our trust relationships, our long-term planning, and all of that in a really sort of immersive, personal way. We could have a VR conference and it’d be just like we were there. There is massive potential like that for reality and also for something like EVE. People are doing important stuff in EVE, as evidenced by the recent battle that lost nearly half a million dollars. We should meet with people and talk about it more.”\n\nOuter space meetings! Huzzah! But that’s just the start of what Pétursson saw in VR’s future, and his next bout of crystal ball gazing revealed a rabbit hole a million miles deep. The world is a colossal place, separated by bottomless valleys of distance, language, class disparity, misunderstanding, and a general inability to just reach out and touch people. How do we bridge those gaps? You guessed it: by building The Matrix. Wait, no, you probably didn’t guess that. But, uh, here we are.\n\n“I think VR can get online communication out of the domain where we’re externalizing all this emotion into some logical construct – that is to say, prose – and then to doing combat in a very abstract arena in logic,” he explained, jet-lagged grogginess gradually making way for wide-eyed enthusiasm. “When it’s ultimately born from some emotion – and I think we can all relate to reading some post on a forum and becoming angry, what to do with all this anger – you try to pour it into an argument. It’s a bit of a poor way to cope or interact with people.”\n\n“By using more multi-frequency options, more of our minds, voices, eye contact, gestures – all these things – I think we will have a happier mankind if we can use more of that without having to go and fly all over the place all the time. With VR, 3D spatial sound, the awareness of your own body, that projected through a networked simulation onto somebody else – then we have interaction patterns that connect to our brains on multiple levels. And at some point, you’re just in The Matrix.”\n\nAnd while I don’t necessarily believe that VR will turn the Internet into a place of calm agreement,understanding, and emotional pow-wows around virtual campfires, I do agree that current solutions leave a lot to be desired. I’ve spewed my share of frustration into comment threads, forums, and blog posts, but mainly for little else than my own catharsis. And I write for a living! Occasionally when I put words onto pages, things supposedly happen. But we’re people. When we’re not communicating on multiple levels, most of us get our thoughts and feelings across horribly. Or we just vomit vitriol. Or we demonize and abuse others, because they’re symbols, not people. The list goes on.\n\nOculus CEO Brendan Iribe, who was also sitting in on the interview, added that these sorts of utilitarian-to-the-point-of-upotia goals could be possible sooner rather than later. In fact, improving the general state of online communication is one of Oculus’ pie-in-the-sky plans.\n\n“We see VR long-term being very much about communications,” he said. “It’s something we’ve always been limited by with technology. You can’t simulate face-to-face communications. You’re always looking through a screen or a window, which your brain very clearly knows is not real. It’s just a window with a camera or FaceTime or a text or email. Sure, I know somebody is on the other end, but there’s this massive filter or funnel to get to them. It’s not very personal. VR could be the first time your brain is truly convinced that that person is right there, right in front of you, and is real.”\n\nFor now, though, it’s still one step at a time, and both Pétursson and Iribe acknowledged that we’re not living in The Future yet. There’s still heaps of work to be done, and without success in the here and now, they might as well kiss those dreams of a VR-powered tomorrow goodbye. At the moment, virtual reality is only a headset with some fancy motion tracking. No eye-tracking or facial expressions or gestures or faultless voice recognition. So then, what’s next? Well, Oculus isn’t overly concerned with having us talk to the monsters just yet, but we might be touching them soon. Er, soonish.\n\n“Right now the VR controller of choice is a traditional game controller, but we’re still R&D-ing internally what VR control is going to be,” Iribe explained. “I think it’s gonna take a while. We don’t want to release anything until we get it right. Usually when people put on the VR headset, the first thing they do is go, ‘This is amazing,’ but then the second thing is they lift their hand and go, ‘But wait, when am I gonna see my hands move?’ The long-term goal is to bring your hands into the experience. We don’t want to do that in some wonky way. We’re not gonna bring them in until it literally, absolutely feels like it’s your own hand. How long will that science part of it take? We don’t know yet.”\n\nHurry up with that, Oculus! Your flip-flop-wearing tech guru’s name is Palmer, for crying out loud.\n\nBut if there’s one thing CCP’s Pétursson is familiar with, it’s playing the long game. EVE Online has moved through the online gaming space less like an infinite fighter fleet and more like a lumbering capital ship. It’s grown and evolved slowly, methodically, and it’s thrived in doing so. Integrating VR into the game, Pétursson reasoned, will likely be a similar process. But the potential results will hopefully be more than worth it.\n\n“Think about it: You’re no longer bound by the constraints of physical reality,” he enthused. “And all the constraints of social injustice and disparity, those exist in part because we can’t have six billion people live the lives that, frankly, we live. The Earth won’t sustain it. We’d need ten Earths for that.”\n\n“But this could bring about a place where we’re no longer constrained by the atoms of this particular Earth. We can give people really compelling experiences that are just limited to a small niche of the world today. And they’ll nearly be real.”\n\nGranted, if little else changes, they’ll still be hungry, cold, and possibly ill, but… sorry. Yes, Pétursson’s argument is full of holes, but I can’t fault someone for wanting to help make the world a better place with technology. Iribe, more than a little biased given that his company is front-and-center here, concurred with a massive grin.\n\n“We kind of joke about it that it’s going to make the world a very small place. Suddenly you put this on and you can be in front of and interacting with anyone in the world as though they’re actually a few feet from you. That’s going to be an incredibly powerful paradigm for the next decade or two in terms of where we go with computers.”\n\nOr Oculus’ evolution will fall short, EVE players will once again demand that CCP focus on spaceships and nothing else, and we’ll be back at Square Whatever The One We’re On Right Now Is. That’s kind of the problem with predicting the future: it’s impossible. But the hope is that, if you place your bets and take things one day at a time, you’ll come out on top eventually. It’s worked for EVE once, it’s working for Oculus so far, and I think it’s worked overall for that whole human race thing we’re all a part of.\n\nMaybe virtual reality will change the world, or maybe it’s just a neat toy. Either way, you might want to have a bottle of red and blue pills handy, just in case.",
  "latent_27651": "Gary Dennis Danielson (born September 10, 1951) is a former professional American football player and a current college football commentator. Danielson was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). He played for the Detroit Lions from 1976 to 1984 and for the Cleveland Browns in 1985, 1987, and 1988. He is currently working for CBS Sports as a commentator for its college football coverage; he previously held the same position for ABC Sports.\n\nPlaying career [ edit ]\n\nDanielson played high school football at Divine Child High School under Tony Versaci in Dearborn, Michigan, and graduated in 1969. He played college football at Purdue University and graduated in 1973 with a Bachelor of Arts in industrial management. He would later earn a Master's degree in physical education in 1976. Danielson had succeeded Mike Phipps as the Boilermakers' starting quarterback in 1970, and had 30 touchdown passes and 14 interceptions with a 46 percent completion rate in two full seasons as a starter.\n\nDanielson spent two years in the short-lived World Football League as a non-starter, with the New York Stars/Charlotte Hornets in 1974 and the Chicago Winds in 1975.[1] The Winds franchise folded a month before the league's collapse in October, and Danielson signed with the Lions for the 1976 season.\n\nHe amassed 13,764 passing yards and 81 touchdowns in 101 games in the NFL. He ranks fourth in Lions history in passing yards and touchdowns. His five touchdowns in a 1978 game against the Minnesota Vikings is still tied for a Lions record.\n\nBroadcasting career [ edit ]\n\nDanielson got a start on his broadcasting career before his playing days were over. He was a part-time anchor/reporter at WDIV-TV during the off-season while a member of the Lions. In Cleveland, he co-hosted a sports talk show while a member of the Browns.[2]\n\nAfter retiring from the Browns, Danielson joined ESPN as a college football analyst. He continued to work in that capacity for ESPN/ABC Sports until 2006, when he joined CBS Sports as a college football analyst, partnered with Verne Lundquist (and later Brad Nessler) on the network's primary broadcast team during Southeastern Conference telecasts. He also serves as the college football radio analyst for Paul Finebaum where he appears weekly during the college football season. Starting in the 2011 college football season, Danielson became a weekly guest on Mike's On: Francesa on the FAN with Mike Francesa. He has also become a regular guest on The Dan Patrick Show.\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nDanielson is married to wife Kristy with whom he has four children.[2] The two met in college at Purdue, where Kristy's father, George King, was the head basketball coach and athletic director.[3]\n\nThe Danielson family resided in Rochester Hills, Michigan, where the children attended Rochester Adams High School. Son Matt Danielson played college football at Northwestern.[4]\n\nDanielson ran an importing and exporting business with former Lions teammate James Jones in the early 1990s.[5] He has also invested in business ventures with former Browns teammate Bernie Kosar.[6]",

Mr. Ainslie left the mayor's executive, saying he could not support Mr. Ford's re-election. After Mr. Ford made robo-calls to tell Mr. Ainslie's constituents about the subway vote, the councillor accused him of being \"a bully and a liar,\" and said he would complain to the city's integrity commissioner.\n\nThe mayor has made it clear that he intends to run for re-election next year, although his brother has said he is unlikely to run again for councillor, suggesting he would prefer to try his hand in provincial politics. The municipal campaign period begins in January.\n\nMr. Ainslie's letter is unlikely to lead to the show's demise since that is beyond the power of the broadcast council. Still, in their first show since the letter was sent, the mayor and his brother emphasized the positive – spending most of the first hour talking sports, Toronto's No. 2 spot in a new international ranking and asking listeners to call in to say what they liked most about the city. The mayor handed over $100 to a guest who came on the show to promote a charity fundraising faceoff between Toronto and Vancouver and the mayor read out a long list of community events.\n\nMr. Ford did touch on the federal by-election battle in Toronto Centre, which the Prime Minister announced on Sunday will be held November 25.

Wildside producer Lorenzo Mieli announced the news Thursday at the series' Rome premiere.\n\nThe show debuts on Sky Italia, Germany and Austria on its Sky Atlantic channel on Friday. It will also air on Canal Plus beginning Monday, on Sky Atlantic in the U.K. and Ireland starting on Oct. 27 and on HBO in the U.S. early next year.\n\nJust as with season one, Italian company Wildside is currently developing the second season, and will take it to partners HBO, Sky and Canal Plus for co-financing as soon as Sorrentino finishes the script.\n\n\"We are of course hoping to do it,\" said Sky Italia chief of content Andrea Scrosati, \"but nothing is signed yet.\"\n\nThe first two episodes of the 10-part series premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September to rave reviews. Law stars as the fictional first American pope, an outrageously conservative figurehead who seems hell-bent on turning the world of the Vatican upside down. Diane Keaton, Silvio Orlando and James Cromwell also star.\n\nThe show, which features a chain-smoking, irrational pope with an unconventional approach to religion, created early buzz out of Venice. \"I'm sure someone somewhere is going to be offended by it, but that's what storytelling is about. Opening discussions, openly, freely and diplomatically ... I'm all for that,\" said Law in a recent interview with Radio Times.\n\nSorrentino said in Venice his goal was to tackle the topic with curiosity rather than to provoke, adding that the protagonist is the opposite of Pope Francis, which was not accidental. \"It's possible that after a very liberal pope, there is someone that might have very different ideas. I think it's an illusion that the church has a long-term idea towards modernity,\" he said at the time. The show worked with consultants from the Catholic Church throughout the production process for season one.\n\nThe first season had a budget of approximately $45 million, making it Italy's most expensive TV production ever. FremantleMedia sold the series globally in more than 80 countries. The Young Pope was produced by Wildside and co-produced by Haut et Court TV and Mediapro.\n\nItalian prime minister Matteo Renzi recently told The Hollywood Reporter that he was a big fan of the show, which is seen as representing the original production boom in Italian television.\n\nThe busy Sorrentino also has announced his next film project, a feature on Italy's former prime minister and media mogul Silvio Berlusconi.\n\nOct. 20, 9:45 a.m.: Updated with statement from Sky Italia.",

It’s great that it came.\"\n\nDavis is arguably the greatest Cyclone of all-time. He was a two-time All-American and the only NCAA player to twice rush for more than 2,000 yards in 1995 and 1996.

  "latent_27730": "In this Dec. 14, 2017, photo, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., speaks on Capitol Hill, in Washington, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2017. Republicans, led by Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, see the tax bill as the answer to their political prayers. It will show Americans they can govern, deliver tax cuts and please Trump. And yet, there are some who suggest that maybe it's not the all-end and be-all. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Despite the sheer size and society-spanning impact of the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul, the quickest and most potent political victory that Republicans would savor by pushing the bill through Congress next week may be what it averts: another big GOP legislative crash in the age of Trump.\n\nEven if Republicans are correct that tax cuts for business and the wealthy bolster the economy, it can take time for obvious results to show. And even with millions of families likely to enjoy lower taxes, many won’t feel much until they file their 2018 tax returns in early 2019. That’s well after the November 2018 elections that may be a coin flip for control of Congress, and recent races suggest those contests may be heavily influenced by President Donald Trump’s unpopularity.\n\nApproval of the tax bill seems certain, with House passage assured and two of the few potential Senate GOP opponents lining up Friday behind the measure: Marco Rubio of Florida and Tennessee’s Bob Corker. That means a White House signing ceremony, probably by Christmas.\n\nRepublicans hope that would overshadow their embarrassing failure to repeal President Barack Obama’s health law. Another flop would have infuriated GOP backers and donors already enraged by the Affordable Care Act debacle, fueling hard-right primary challenges against Republican incumbents or encouraging conservatives to stay home in November.\n\nIf the tax bill isn’t approved, “the country’s reaction is going to be, ‘Why did we put you in in the first place?’” said David Winston, a GOP pollster who advises congressional leaders.\n\n“Passing the tax bill is necessary but not sufficient for Republicans to retain control of Congress in 2018,” said GOP consultant Whit Ayres. “It does give the party a concrete accomplishment that they can take to the voters, and that’s critical.”\n\nDemocrats view the tax legislation as a rich political opportunity.\n\nSurveys this month have shown clear majorities oppose the legislation. Quinnipiac University and Marist polls also find that at least 6 in 10 people surveyed say the bill would primarily help the rich. Analyses by Congress’ nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation have shown most benefits going to corporations and the wealthy, with more modest help for middle- and low-income families, an attack angle Democrats are already using.\n\n“It’s daylight robbery,” House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California said last week. “And with every iteration, the GOP tax scam becomes even more cowardly, outrageous, dishonest, brazen. Theft from middle-class families, giving money from them to the richest people in our country and to corporations.”\n\nDemocrats see another opening in the measure’s $10,000 limit on deductions for state and local property, income and sales taxes. That could raise taxes for suburban voters in high-tax states such as California, New York and New Jersey. Democrats who did surprisingly well among suburban voters in their recent victories in the Alabama Senate and Virginia governor’s races and in local contests around the country see the bill as another path to corralling that critical bloc next November.\n\nDemocrats need to gain 24 seats to capture majority control of the House. The Senate is a tougher task even after Democrat Doug Jones’ upset in Alabama cut the GOP edge to 51-49.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York called the bill’s trimming of deductions “a gut punch to millions of middle class and upper-middle-class Americans who live in the suburbs, the same people who are turning away from President Trump.”\n\nOther provisions give Democrats tempting populist targets.\n\nThe individual tax cuts expire in 2026 while corporate reductions are permanent. Especially over time, many families would see their taxes rise, not fall.\n\nThe bill’s repeal of the Obama health law’s tax penalty on people not buying coverage is expected to drive up insurance premiums by about 10 percent, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, though Republicans might pass additional legislation to ease that.\n\nRepublicans note that beginning early next year, people could increase their take home pay by reducing the money withheld in their paychecks to reflect tax changes. They say the bill’s poor polling would be trumped by its effect on people.\n\n“I’m convinced this is going to launch more investment in businesses and workers. I’m convinced this is going to give bigger paychecks, a simpler system,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.\n\n“This legislation will bring real relief to the middle class by taking money out of Washington’s pocket and putting it into theirs,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. He added: “Only those who don’t know the struggles of hardworking American families could conclude otherwise.”\n\nTrump told reporters Saturday that Democrats “have their sound bite, the standard sound bite, before they even know what the bill is all about.”\n\nSome Republicans worry they may experience the same fate as Democrats after they approved the health law in 2010. That November, Democratic incumbents were defeated in droves, costing them House control.\n\n“Legislative success does not necessarily translate into political success. Just ask the Democrats,” said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., a moderate who’s retiring next year. “We’re going to be running with the wind in our face regardless of what’s accomplished.”\n\nPart of that headwind could come from Trump, which worries many Republicans.\n\n“If we get some things done it’ll maybe improve our chances, but the president’s not making it any easier,” said Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho. “He’s making it very, very difficult. All the news about his latest tweet and what he says and then he gets mad at us because we don’t defend it. So we’ll see.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Andrew Taylor, Kevin Freking, Matthew Daly and Stephen Ohlemacher contributed to this report.",
  "latent_27759": "Vulnerable indigenous communities across the world have long fallen victim to plundering “bioprospectors” who have raided and commercialised their biological resources and given them little or nothing in return.\n\nOne such community is the San people of southern Africa. On March 2 2017, however, the San launched their own code of conduct to put an end to more than a century of invasive and exploitative research.\n\nThe San call themselves the “first people”. They have the oldest DNA of any humans on the earth and are therefore of great interest to researchers for their genes, their knowledge and their culture. The San have been one of the most commonly researched peoples in the world but many things that have happened in the past have left the San feeling abused by researchers. A lack of respect for local traditions and culture, a lack of care for local needs, a lack of any benefit to the San themselves and a lack of transparency in the researchers’ dealings have been commonplace.\n\nIn their new code, the San describe how genomics research has been undertaken without consultation or respect for the wishes of the San leaders. Researchers have taken photographs of individuals in their homes, of breastfeeding mothers and of children – all the while ignoring their social customs and norms. Bribes or other advantages have been offered. Furthermore, the code describes how many companies in South Africa and globally are benefiting from San traditional knowledge in the sale of indigenous plant varieties without any of the benefits being shared with the indigenous people.\n\nAs part of an EU-funded TRUST project, three South African San groups – the Khomani, the !Xun and the Khwe – have developed their Code of Research Ethics with the assistance of the South African San Institute. Importantly, this code has been written by the San and is closely aligned with their own values.\n\nFrom now on, researchers who wish to undertake studies with the San will have to abide by the San values of respect, fairness, justice, honesty and care. No longer will researchers be able to rely solely upon ethical approval granted by an institution on the other side of the world which knows nothing of San traditions.\n\nIt appears that the San Code of Research Ethics may be the first code of conduct for research to be developed by a vulnerable indigenous group in Africa. But the San hope that it will empower other groups and communities who are also at risk of exploitation.\n\nLocally developed codes cannot replace the existing global codes for research ethics such as the Declaration of Helsinki, but they can help to ensure a more equitable relationship between researchers and participants at a local level.\n\nEthics dumping\n\nThis development is one part of the ambitious TRUST project. TRUST aims to put an end to the exploitation of people in low and middle income countries for research purposes. When researchers from countries where regulation is well developed (such as those in the EU) choose to conduct ethically dubious research in countries where regulation is not as strict, it is known as “ethics dumping”. The actions needed to prevent ethics dumping and put an end to exploitation in research are considerable. The San people have taken action to protect themselves but there are many other people and communities who are vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nThrough the TRUST project, partners from 13 institutions around the world are working together to help stop the practice of ethics dumping. By September 2018 these partners will have developed three new tools to achieve this goal.\n\n1) A global code of conduct for collaborative research in low and middle income countries will be available for funders. Research that does not comply with this code should not be funded.\n\n2) An online tool for fair research contracting will be available for vulnerable populations with no access to legal advice. This will help communities and groups to draw up contracts for their own protection in research.\n\n3) A follow-up tool will be available to ensure that ethical standards are maintained during the research. This will help to make sure that agreements and approvals are honoured.\n\nThe groundwork for development of these tools has involved broad consultation. The next step will be the development of the tools themselves for testing.\n\nAmy Dean , Author provided\n\nTogether these actions will help to raise ethical standards in collaborative research. But researchers still need to be educated about local needs and values. The development of codes like the ones the San have produced can help to do this. And they can also empower local communities to take an active role in steering all of the research that they engage with.",
  "latent_28028": "Some of you who have followed me in the past may know about this wonderful little zoo called The Wildlife Learning Center. WLC cares for a few dozen wild and exotic animals and treats them as \"ambassadors\" to help teach the public about wildlife conservation. What is so wonderful about WLC, is that many of the animals in there care are rescues. Many were illegally kept as pets and were either turned over or turned in to WLC for proper care. Others were animals born in the wild, but injury or acclimation to humans kept them from being able to survive in their natural habitats. Still others were exotic pets who grew too large or otherwise difficult to care for by their original owners. Without WLC, all of these rescued animals would be seriously ill or dead.Besides offering animals topnotch care, WLC is an amazing place to visit. This zoo is small, so visitors get to see the animals more up close and intimately than larger zoos. Even better, many of their animals are trained to interact with people, so they are able to offer visitors one-on-one interactions with the animals! Everyone I know who has been to WLC loves it!WLC is a nonprofit organization, and they rely on the public to raise the money they need to care for their animals and offer education to children and adults alike. This year, they find themselves struggling because of the economy. They need to raise $48,000 to get through 2013, so they are reaching out with an IndieGogo campaign. Please check out their IndieGogo page and consider helping them out. Each donation level offers perks for anyone who can come to visit, such as free passes for you and guests and free \"animal encounters\" with creatures such as owls, sloths, porcupines, fennec foxes or even their great, big, beautiful Siberian Lynx, Boomer!!If you donate, you'll be helping all these guys:Cleo the Fennec Fox was kept illegally as a pet. He became extremely ill from improper veterinary care and suffered permanent neurological damage which still causes him to have seizures. Now that he lives at WLC, he has the special care he needs and his life is enriched by the other fennec foxes he gets to live with.Eddie the Spider Monkey was born in a laboratory. He was destined to be used for research but luckily for him (ironically) his mother rejected him at birth and the lab did not want to care for a newborn, so Eddie was taken in by WLC. Now instead of enduring a life of small cages and medical testing, he gets to live happily in trees with other spider monkeys.Danali the Bald Eagle was born in the wild. She was found with an injured wing that never healed properly despite rehabilitation. There is no way she could survive in the wild without being able to fly, so she now lives at WLC. I had never seen a bald eagle up close until I met her!Nanuk the Arctic Fox once lived a neglected, sad life in a FUR FARM! Now instead of being someone's coat, he lives in a large pen with plenty of enriching, natural elements with several other foxes to keep him company.Fluffy the Alligator and his 2 siblings were purchased illegally as babies and raised in a bath tub with not much else to eat than hot dogs -- hardly a healthy diet. As a result, their growth has been stunted, and no one quite knows how old they are. They remain small but live happily now at WLC in a proper enclosure and offer visitors a rare close look at these magnificent predators!To find out more about WLC and the animals they care for, visit them at www.wildlifelearningcenter.com To donate to their IndieGogo campaign, please visit www.indiegogo.com/projects/wildlife-learning-center-needs-your-support-to-care-for-animals As little as $15 really helps!Thank you!!Lauren*************************************************************************************Join the Solar Sisterhood!!Check out the MILKY WAY AND THE GALAXY GIRLS web site!! *************************************",
  "latent_28077": "Hello, people from Secret Santa!\n\nI must say that this has been an incredible experience thanks to my most thoughtful Secret Santa!\n\nI am not accostumed to receiving gifts at this time of the year. It has never been a tradition in my family, so I was really excited to participate in this exchange. I didn't really raised my hopes up because I didn't had a positive experience in the past exchanges, but I was happy at the opportunity nevertheless, because in any case, preparing a gift for a stranger is one of the most fulfilling experiences one can have.\n\nLittle did I know that I had been matched with such a great person.\n\nShe made me a two parts gift!\n\nThe first part consisted in a Zoo Parentship to the dingoes of the Zoo of Taronga, or as in my SS words, an Aussie version of your red wolf. After checking my Reddit history I couldn't find anything related to red wolves so the fact that she actually found out that red wolves are my favourite animal is evidence of the effort she had put into making the perfect gift that I received.\n\nWith the mail containing the parentship information there were several documents about the dingo itself, about their history and the problems their currently facing. As with red wolves, there is a great problem with hybridization that's reducing the pure dingo population and pushing them into danger of extinction. :(\n\nI will leave you guys a link if you want to support these cool guys from the Taronga Zoo :) http://taronga.org.au/\n\nAnd this one if you want to know more about or help with the cause of the red wolves (there's about or little more than 100 of them left) http://redwolves.com/rwc/index.html\n\nContinuing with the gifts, today I finally received the package from my SS which is the second part of the gift.\n\nCorreo Argentino were experience problems because of a strike and they didn't delivered it until today. Totally not SS's fault, those guys are always delivering mail and packages weeks or even months overdue.\n\nIt must have been of the most exciting experience that I ever had and I'm not exagerating. When I opened I found the most adorable Koala that I have ever seen and immediately fell in love with it. He had a bag with chocolate balls around his neck that I thoroughly enjoy (only had two, the rest I saved them to share). I still have to name it and as of now is resting with Montblanc, my polar bear, and Remy, my red wolf.\n\nThere was also a lovely Holiday Card with a drawing of Santa Claus with a personal message written inside by my SS herself. :)\n\nAlong with the Koala and the card there were six other packages wrapped with Christmas themed paper.\n\nI started with the three little ones. They contained more candy! Milky bar buttons! Or so they were. They melted, haha, but it made it all the more fun to eat them (or it)! I received Jaffas and Tim Tams but I still have to try those (and update when I do so).\n\nThen I proceeded to open the three bigger packages!\n\nThe first one contained four postcard with delightful illustrations by Lynn Naistmith and a holder! If anyone is wondering they are fairy penguins, brushtail lemurs, wallabies and koalas! It's a shame I couldn't find more about the artist but I'll keep looking and see if I can update with some more information since I really liked her work!\n\nThe second package contianed a cloth wallposter with a tribal themed painting called 'The Ceremonial Hunt'. It came with a short tale that I really enjoyed. It seems that it's part of something called 'Tales of my Grandmother's Dreamtime' by Naiura, and I'll definitely have to check that out since it really piqued my interest.\n\nAnd last, but by no means least, a set of Derwent Sketching materials! With very high quality pencils, charcoal and graphite! It seems that my SS found the drawings I posted on Reddit. These are going to come in handy and I'll definitely have to try them out. I will now be able to sketch the dingoes of Taronga. :)\n\nThose were the wonderful gifts my SS prepared with the help of her lovely husband! I hope you guys had a wonderful Christmas and that you had a Secret Santa experience as great as the one you made for me!\n\nEdit: (for some reason the text editor didn't save all that I had written).",
  "latent_28166": "It can be a long road to recovery for some of the victims of ukuthwalwa\n\nBy Pumza Fihlani\n\nBBC News, Lusikisiki\n\nAt the age of 14, Nolizwi Sinama set off from her aunt's home to a neighbouring village. She thought she had been sent on a routine chore. In fact, she was on her way to be married to a 42-year-old man. Her aunt and brother had arranged the marriage, taking three cows as a bride price, or ilobolo as it is known in South Africa. Three years later, Ms Sinama says the experience left her feeling worthless. \"They stole my innocence and my childhood,\" she says. Her husband forced her to sleep with him, and she became pregnant a month after she was abducted. I think that men are evil\n\nNangamso Gezana \"I begged them to not to take me. I told them I wanted to continue with my studies that I wasn't ready to be a wife but they wouldn't let me go,\" she says. \"They told me that I didn't have a say in the matter - one of them said all the arrangements were made with my family's consent.\" Ms Sinama says she told her aunt that her husband forced her into having sex, but was told that a failed marriage would disgrace the family. She finally fled after discovering her husband was HIV positive. Ms Sinama, like numerous other girls in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province, was a victim of ukuthwalwa - a cultural practice among people from the Xhosa ethnic group to abduct girls for marriage.\n\nPrince Xhanti Sigcawu, a member of the Xhosa royal family, defends the custom. \"Ukuthwalwa like all our other customs was and remains an important part of who we are as people,\" he says. AFRICA HAVE YOUR SAY It is an abuse for a girl below the age of 18 to get married Adenrele in Ibadan, Nigeria \"There is nothing wrong with the practice when it is done in the right way - which is when the girl is at the right age and the parents are involved and agree.\" But girls as young as 11 years old are being forced into marriage, and calls are growing for the practice to be banned. 'Like a slave' Ms Sinama and her two-year-old son are now being cared for by the Palmerton Children's Care Centre, near Lusikisiki, 200km south of Durban. I knew that if I stayed I would get sick and die\n\nNolizwi Sinama The centre used to be solely for orphans and abused children but opened its doors to abduction victims after pleas from various communities. Twelve of the 100 children at the centre are recent victims of abduction. They have been living at centre since early this year. Nangamso Gezana, 15, says she was abducted in May in Lusikisiki and taken to Rustenburg, where she and her new husband lived in shack for one month. \"I don't know how many times I thought of killing myself,\" she says. \"I was like a slave, cooking and cleaning for a man I did not even want. A man who did bad things to me and would not stop even when I cried. \"I think that men are evil.\" Both Ms Sinama and Ms Gezana escaped their abductors with the help of the Palmerton centre and the police. \"One of my teachers got word that I had been abducted, she contacted me while I was in Rustenburg and asked me if I wanted to come back home,\" says Ms Gezana. Communities where the practice is rife protect each other\n\nMzukisi Fatyela\n\nEastern Cape police \"She contacted the centre; they made arrangements for the Eastern Cape police to fetch me up at a police station in Rustenburg. \"The man I married had gone to work, I left without any of my clothes. I have not seen that him since that day.\" Ms Sinama says she knew she had to leave when she learned that her husband was suffering from HIV. \"I saw his medical certificate in the house, it was written HIV positive. I knew that if I stayed I would get sick and die,\" she says. Police's problem The custom remains strong in some areas, but it divides opinion. Although Xhosa royals defend it, Chief Pathekile Holomisa, of the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa, says the practice should be discouraged. \"It has been corrupted by greed for material purposes. It has no place in today's society,\" he says. Asanda Masina, of the Palmerton centre, says the practice is still strong in rural areas. \"The mindset has not changed - people do not see anything wrong with abducting girls,\" she says. Despite efforts by government, police and child welfare organisations, she says ukuthwalwa is still condoned as a necessary part of a woman's life by some traditional societies. Which is a problem for the police. Supt Mzukisi Fatyela of the Eastern Cape force says detection of such crimes is difficult. \"Communities where the practice is rife protect each other, so it is not easy to make arrests,\" he says.\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

The Times’s man has jumped the moose with this one. As it turns out, Brooks, like yours truly, was born in Toronto. I think we can all agree that the only thing worse than a Canadian is a self-loathing Canadian: It’s bad enough that the first Canadian president of America has to run around pretending he’ll be the first Hispanic president, but it’s outrageous that the New York Times’s only Canuck columnist should be the Roy Cohn of Canadians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, as NR readers know, my position, as the presumptive senator from New Hampshire, is that, given the mess you Americans have made of the GOP, I’m in favor (actually, I’m in favour) of an all-Canadian ticket next time round. But in the meantime I don’t see why we Canadians have to skulk around in a state of shame to the point where effete maple-scented Timesmen are forced to be more good-ol’-boy-than-thou and jump the first Canuck in the Senate parking lot.

  "latent_28479": "Santa Rosa’s switch to district elections clouds political future for council members\n\nSanta Rosa’s move from at-large to district-based elections, a switch the city is making in response to a threat of a voting rights lawsuit, stands to reshape the local political landscape and potentially put some council members out of a job.\n\nThe seven-member City Council on Tuesday set in motion an electoral overhaul that could very well leave some of them outside the district their seat will soon represent, or, like in musical chairs, leave some council members standing awkwardly without an empty seat to claim.\n\nAmong the trio of council members likely to be affected first is Santa Rosa’s mayor, Chris Coursey.\n\n“I don’t know whether I’m going to be eligible for re-election next election cycle,” said Coursey, who until last week was pretty sure he’d be running next year for a second four-year term on the council. Councilmen John Sawyer and Tom Schwedhelm also are up for re-election and face similar uncertainty about their future in city office.\n\nThe electoral reform — one long sought by activists to give underrepresented neighborhoods greater influence over makeup of the City Council — has unleashed innumerable legal, logistical and political questions, not the least of which is whether some political careers get cut short in the process.\n\n“If I lose re-election in 2020 as a result of this change, I am OK with that,” said Jack Tibbetts who just bought a house in southeast Santa Rosa and at 27 is the youngest council member. “There’s a lot to do outside of elected office.”\n\nThe uncertainty created by the transition to district elections is one of the reasons, in addition to legal timelines, that council members voted to move forward swiftly. Current council members, future candidates and voters would all be well served by a quick resolution of the issue, Coursey said.\n\n“The community needs to know what elections are going to look like next year sooner rather than later,” he said.\n\nThe speed of the transition — the council agreed to try to get it done in 90 days — has current council members pondering their political futures.\n\nTwo questions could prove pivotal. The first is how district boundaries are drawn. The city plans to hire a demographer to analyze voting patterns in the city and, with public input, draw up maps of the districts.\n\nIt’s still unclear how many districts would be formed. In 2012, when a measure to create district elections was rejected by voters, supporters had pushed for a format with seven districts and a mayor picked from among them. But that doesn’t have to be the case. Some council members, including Tibbetts, say they support six individual districts with the mayor being picked for the seventh seat by citywide election.\n\nOnce the council settles on a number of districts and delineates their boundaries, the city will need to outline a transition to the new electoral system.\n\nSanta Rosa City Schools, which is switching to district elections in response to the same legal threat, has said it plans to have three seats elected by districts next year, and four the following year. It’s possible the city could follow a similar plan.\n\nIt’s also possible all seven seats could come open at once, or that those seats to be shifted to districts in 2018 could be picked at random.",
  "latent_28492": "When Hillary Clinton’s blue-tinged 737 touched down in Ohio on Monday morning for the first time in 29 days, locals greeted a changed Democratic nominee in a much changed race.\n\nThe last time she campaigned in the battleground state, Clinton was days away from a pneumonia diagnosis and derailed by a coughing fit at a Cleveland Labor Day rally, fueling a fusillade of conspiracy theories about her health.\n\nNow Clinton has rebounded in a fine fettle, just in time to make the case for her candidacy as Ohio wraps up its voter-registration period.\n\nClinton will campaign in the former world’s rubber capital of Akron for a voter-registration event and deliver a speech on the economy in the aging industrial hub of Toledo. Her return to the Rust Belt on Monday comes a week before voter registration ends and early voting begins a day later.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nMail-in voting is up in Ohio compared with 2012, which gives some comfort to Clinton aides who are watching tight polls. A bonus came on the eve of Clinton’s trip, when Cleveland’s NBA giant LeBron James announced he was endorsing her. Clinton’s visit on Monday is meant to usher a final wave of registrations before the Oct. 11 deadline.\n\nClinton’s return is a nod to a state that has long been at the center of presidential politics, but one that is in transition. For perhaps the first presidential election in decades, Ohio is a state that Democrats can afford to lose and might break for the first time with the national winner. The state’s unofficial motto is “As goes Ohio, so goes the nation,” a recognition that the last Democrat to win the White House without Ohio was John Kennedy in 1960; no Republican has ever done so.\n\nDonald Trump — who has suffered a slow-motion collapse after he struggled at the first debate, feuded with a Latina model and lashed out after the New York Times showed he lost nearly $1 billion in personal income in 1995 — almost certainly must win in Ohio in order to win the White House.\n\nAn internal memo circulated by Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook and obtained by TIME showed that her strategists see the state as a must-win for Trump — but not for her. She can handily win 270 electoral votes without winning Ohio, Mook said in the memo; Trump almost certainly must win Ohio if he is to have a viable path to the White House.\n\nClinton officials are keenly aware that blocking Trump in Ohio will likely end his White House bid.\n\n“If we get results in early on Ohio on election night, and we win, I don’t know what other states Trump will be waiting for,” said Harrell Kirstein, communications director for the Clinton campaign in the state. “There are a couple of ways that we can stop him in his tracks, and [Ohio] is one of them.”\n\nOhio is less the bellwether state it once was, and its large contingent of white working-class voters and aging Rust Belt factory towns are making it look more like Trump territory. Swing states like Florida, Nevada and Colorado have fast-growing Hispanic populations, but Ohio’s nonwhite population rose just 1.1% compared with 2.2% for the rest of the country since 2012. The days when a Democratic candidate needed to win Ohio in order to win the White House may be over. “This is about a speed bump, not a roadblock,” a Clinton ally with Ohio experience said. “She can get to 270 without Ohio. He cannot.”\n\nClinton will give a populist speech on Monday, calling for a revamp of the corporate tax code and raising the minimum wage, according to a preview provided by an aide. She’ll attack Trump’s business practices, which have sparked numerous lawsuits by contractors who said they were never paid for their work. It’s the kind of speech designed to counteract Trump’s support in the Rust Belt.\n\nBut Clinton’s campaigning priorities have been a concern for local officials in Ohio. Ohioans, in some advisers’ estimation, could slip from Clinton’s grasp. Polls have consistently given Trump a hair’s-edge advantage, fueled by promises of a trade war that economists predict would be ruinous for a global economy but could provide comfort for voters angry that their way of life has changed. Disengaged millennial voters on and near college campuses separately have local party leaders nauseous, and there are the constant worries about having enough election machines in the cities, where Democrats have their strongest numbers.\n\nClinton’s aides brush off suggestions that her 29-day absence shows she is writing off the state. While Clinton herself has been away, her campaign has filled in for her in absentia. Her surrogates from Elizabeth Warren to the cast of The West Wing blanketed the state in numerous campaign trips. Clinton’s campaign is spending many multiples what Trump has doled out on television advertisements.\n\n“Why send her to Ohio when voting doesn’t start for a month? Any enthusiasm from that trip goes away,” explained one senior aide. “Ohio’s voter-registration deadline is Oct. 11. Early voting in Ohio starts on Oct. 12. Now is when it makes sense for her to make the ask.”\n\nClinton’s aides billed September as a month for nonpolitical outreach, including high-profile supporters like America Ferrera, Sean Astin of Lord of the Rings fame, Sean Patrick Thomas and John Lithgow, among others.\n\nBut Clinton’s Democratic Party allies joined the tour as well. Running mate Tim Kaine, husband and former President Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea Clinton and her opponent-turned-surrogate Bernie Sanders all have been in the state too.\n\nOne Clinton ally pooh-poohs the nervousness and points to ad tallies in Ohio’s three major broadcast markets as proof that she isn’t abandoning the state. Between now and Election Day, Clinton’s campaign has booked almost $6 million in TV ads for the traditionally Democratic Cleveland-Akron media markets. Trump has about $270,000 on the books. In Columbus, a swing city whose suburban counties were a major focus for Republican nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, the spending is just as lopsided; Clinton’s campaign has booked almost $4 million to Trump’s $288,000. And in the Cincinnati market, where Republicans typically do well, Clinton has more than $4 million to Trump’s $394,000.That’s a lot of money to spend on a cause deemed completely lost.\n\nBut without Clinton on the ground, it’s tough for them to build the enthusiasm for Clinton, a former Secretary of State, Senator and First Lady who already has made history as the first woman to lead a major-party ticket. On Monday, Clinton will aim to set that straight.\n\nWrite to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com.",

They have had some successes and many failures with bringing through kids to the first team, although Nathan Ake is the latest to come through the ranks. A statement on the academy section of the club's website reads: 'To produce home-grown professional footballers capable of competing with Europe's elite players. A talented young footballer wanting to play for Chelsea needs to strive to be among the best in the world. 'Producing a core of our own young talent has never been more challenging; nor has it ever been more worthwhile. The development of young players is vital to the long-term success of any football club.\n\n'Therefore the production of home grown players through the Academy system, who can progress to first team level is a key area of Chelsea Football Club. The financial gains are undisputed; a successful Academy has the potential to save the club millions of pounds in the transfer market. The benefits however, go deeper still.\n\n'A world class youth development programme can also promote long-term loyalty and commitment to the club among those players who eventually make it into the 'big time'. Whether these boys are plucked from the local talent pool or brought in from abroad, Chelsea's drive towards self-sufficiency is crucially dependant on the creation of a successful Academy structure, capable of nurturing players of the highest quality.'\n\nBeckham Snr has since left the US side and is currently considering his next move after leaving LA Galaxy at the end of the MLS season in December.\n\nAn insider said: ‘Brooklyn is like any teenager with an ambition to be a footballer. He has just returned to England and wanted to see how he fared.\n\n'Chelsea are one of the strongest academies in the country. The difference is that he is the son of the former England captain and this will draw attention.’\n\nBeckham has spoken in the past about the difficulties of Brooklyn being a football-mad son of one of the most famous footballers on the planet.\n\n'They've got a great life set up for them,' he told The Times. 'Obviously our boys and little girl are very lucky.\n\n'But I think, as a parent, you always worry: \"Have they got the hunger that I had as a kid?\"'\n\nHe added: 'I'm as hard on my boys as my dad was. They always ask, \"Did I play well?\" I'll say, \"You did all right, could have done better...\"'\n\nBeckham is a free agent after leaving LA Galaxy and has attracted interest from QPR and West Ham in the Premier League, and Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain in France.\n\nThere is also interest from the UAE, where former England boss Sven Eriksson himself is now technical director at Al Nasr in Dubai, and the Swede says he would welcome the Manchester United legend to the Middle East with open arms.\n\nThe Beckhams are in London after moving back to the UK following the end of his contract with Galaxy.\n\nThe family are currently renting a lavish £20million property in London from Touker Suleyman, boss of Ghost and Hawes & Curtis, while the Beckham brood will be educated at London schools.\n\nA source recently told MailOnline: 'It's time for a new London life, they are all very excited.'\n\nSo, can Brooklyn Bend it like Beckham (Snr)...?\n\nAs these pictures show, it looks like Brooklyn has been copying his dad's famous technique for taking those free-kicks...\n\nSpot the difference: It looks like Brooklyn has been copying his dad's way of curling those set-pieces\n\nBond: Beckham with son Brooklyn at an LA Galaxy kids match in 2011\n\nOn the ball: Brooklyn loves football and has spent a lot of time at the training ground with his dad\n\nPS And there aren't many kids who can say they've already scored at Old Trafford!\n\nWatch this footage of Brooklyn, who had only recently turned two, score at the Theatre of Dreams.

  "latent_28956": "For the past few months I've been working on an open source software project aimed at improving life in a city called Bratislava in Slovakia. It's an Open Source Bike Share system that I, along with creator Michal Maly and a few others, have been developing for Bratislava's Cyklokuchyna (Bike Kitchen). It's community bike share system we call WhiteBikes.\n\nThe idea of a bike share system is nothing new. It stems from a 1960s experiment in the Netherlands in which white bicycles were placed unlocked in the streets to be used by anyone and everyone. The experiment didn't last long—the bikes were either stolen or, ironically, confiscated by the police because it was illegal to leave a bike unlocked.\n\nSend a message, get a bike\n\nThe Bike Kitchen started WhiteBikes in Bratislava after a failed attempt by the city to finance a similar program.

They needed a system that would work somewhat automatically without the need for manual rentals (e.g. somebody giving out bicycles).\n\nFrom there, smsBikeShare was born. Users registered with a mobile phone number and could send basic SMS commands (RENT, RETURN, FREE, WHERE, etc.). The system used an inexpensive SMS gateway API and a local message-back number to receive and respond to messages. Shared bicycles have a coded U-lock with a four-digit number, and upon renting a bike, users receive a code to unlock the bicycle and another to reset it to once they are done.\n\nSend a message, receive the answer, unlock the bike, reset the lock, and you're off pedaling.\n\nThe next stage for open bikes\n\nIn three months, WhiteBikes had a working system with more than 30 daily users. I immediately saw we had something really interesting on our hands and got to work developing a web application. We already had a primitive Google map available showing the locations of the stands, but you didn't know if there were free bicycles until you used the FREE command (in a text message). So, I created a map with a better user experience and the ability to log in through a phone (or PC), find a nearby stand, and rent a bicycle with the press of a button.\n\nUpon reaching a destination and finding a nearby bike stand, users lock the bicycle with the new (pre-selected) code, click on the appropriate stand on the map, and press the \"return\" button. Around this time, we renamed the software Open Source Bike Share on GitHub to WhiteBikes because it had expanded beyond the original SMS messaging.\n\nBigger and better features\n\nGeolocation was next, showing the nearest bike stands and giving users walking directions to them. The app refreshes every 30 seconds, so if anyone rents or returns a bicycle, it's reflected on the map.\n\nWe are able to track users' phones (and therefore the bicycle’s movements) to some extent. Unfortunately, HTML5 GEO API is usually paused by Android and iOS mobiles when in the background. So once the phone display is off, tracking stops until the web app is turned on again.\n\nBecause some of the admin functions were already available via SMS, we added them to the web application too. We also got some simple and colorful pathmaps showing how the bicycle is used, i.e. how it has moved from one stand to another. Administrators can also see current network usage and stand occupation, etc.\n\nOpen source software behind it\n\nRunning on a PHP/JS combination, Open Source Bike Share is custom developed, but built on Bootstrap, Bootstrap validator, and JQuery. It uses MariaDB for its database and is open to accommodate a connection to any SMS API gateway you can find (you will probably have to develop the HTTP connector first, as we currently have just one).\n\nI have written a short installation manual, but the most important requirement here is the real-life bicycles and at least one stand (but I am sure there are lots of stands available in your city, right?). However, feel free to install and test ride it using virtual bicycles you create in the database.\n\nCommunity at the core\n\nThe community plays an important role in the system. Volunteers of all kinds—repairmen, developers, and even users—are working toward improving WhiteBikes. Servicemen take bicycles with reported issues off the streets to repair them, developers improve the web app and its features, and users help us with their real-world experiences and keep bikes moving between the stands.\n\nEvery new user needs two recommendations from existing users and is then trained by one of the experienced users at the Bike Kitchen. This way there is responsibility placed on the recommending users as well as on the new user. Only one bicycle has been stolen since the system's launch. A user left it unlocked in front of a shop while grabbing a quick snack.\n\nOur administrators also receive a notification every 24 hours when someone has stretched their rental period over 24 hours. In addition to the 24 hour check, admins can get notified if somebody rents too many bicycles in a short time.\n\nToday, WhiteBikes manages more than 50 community-serviced bicycles through the web and text messaging. Still in its pilot phase, the system has 70 users (67% active ones, with at least one rental in the past few months) and will expand to more in spring of 2015.\n\nWe want to see the Open Source Bike Share appear in other communities!

  "latent_29041": "Tania/A3/Contrasto/eyevine\n\nIt isn’t a scam, as neuroscientist Elena Cattaneo had first assumed. A total stranger really has left the prominent Italian, who is also a senator and a relentless campaigner against the misuse of science, his entire fortune to distribute for research. The sum is likely to be upwards of €1.5 million (US$1.7 million).\n\nThe short, handwritten will of Franco Fiorini, an accountant from the small town of Molinella near Bologna, was officially made public on 21 June.\n\n“I’ll never know for sure why he decided to do this,” says Cattaneo, who adds that she has wept with regret that she cannot thank Fiorini. “But it gives a hopeful message that there are some people like Franco who are able to work out on their own the importance of science and research for Italy’s future.”\n\nShe intends to make the money available for fellowships for young scientists in Italy, where funds for research are notoriously scarce.\n\nCattaneo, who is based at the University of Milan, is no ordinary researcher. In 2013, then-president Giorgio Napolitano appointed her a senator-for-life in recognition of her activities in promoting science. One of her most famous achievements, made with a handful of colleagues, was a successful two-year battle to stop the Stamina Foundation in Brescia from administering unproven stem-cell therapies.\n\nCourtesy of Elena Catteneo\n\nFiorini died on 21 May at the age of 64. A wheelchair user since a bout of childhood polio left him partially paralysed, he had been director of a construction company in Molinella before taking early retirement 15 years ago.\n\nOne-sentence testament\n\nEarlier this year, he developed a serious infection that eventually led to his death. On 29 March, while ill, he wrote a new, one-sentence will: “I leave all my movable and fixed possessions to Dr Elena Cattaneo, senator for life, for her to use in scientific research as best she sees fit.”\n\nHis lawyer and confidant Paolo Ghedini told Nature that Fiorini had no immediate family and few friends, and rarely went out. “He was a closed person, who never spoke about personal things,” he says. “But he was constantly reading — books and online — and would speak to me about history, medicine, politics, everything.” Fiorini loved to order and reorder his collection of 5,000 or so books, many on philosophy and science.\n\nCourtesy of Elena Catteneo\n\nReading is probably how he came to know about Cattaneo, whose campaigning for science made her a regular presence in the media in the months before Fiorini rewrote his will. During this time, she raised concerns about possible data manipulation in papers presented in parliamentary debates on genetically modified crops, submitted a complaint to parliament about appropriate transparency and competition in the establishment of a major research centre in Milan and promoted the responsible use of animals in research.\n\nOn 28 May, a notary sent an e-mail to her office in the Senate informing Cattaneo of the bequest. She thought it was a joke. But two days later, her Senate assistant, having checked things out, called her in her lab. “I’ve got news,” he said. “You’d better sit down.”\n\nMany anonymous donors give significant amounts of money to medical-research foundations, notes Tullio Pozzan, director of the CNR Institute for Neuroscience at the University of Padua. “But giving money to an individual — someone you only know through the press — is unusual,” he says. “It shows the importance of publicizing research in the press.”",

Despite the popularity of this training method, the physiological determinants of CrossFit performance have not yet been reported. The purpose of this study was to determine whether physiological and/or muscle strength measures could predict performance on three common CrossFit \"Workouts of the Day\" (WODs).\n\nMaterials and methods: Fourteen CrossFit Open or Regional athletes completed, on separate days, the WODs \"Grace\" (30 clean and jerks for time), \"Fran\" (three rounds of thrusters and pull-ups for 21, 15, and nine repetitions), and \"Cindy\" (20 minutes of rounds of five pull-ups, ten push-ups, and 15 bodyweight squats), as well as the \"CrossFit Total\" (1 repetition max [1RM] back squat, overhead press, and deadlift), maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max), and Wingate anaerobic power/capacity testing.\n\nResults: Performance of Grace and Fran was related to whole-body strength (CrossFit Total) (r=-0.88 and -0.65, respectively) and anaerobic threshold (r=-0.61 and -0.53, respectively); however, whole-body strength was the only variable to survive the prediction regression for both of these WODs (R2=0.77 and 0.42, respectively). There were no significant associations or predictors for Cindy.\n\nConclusion: CrossFit benchmark WOD performance cannot be predicted by VO 2 max, Wingate power/capacity, or either respiratory compensation or anaerobic thresholds. Of the data measured, only whole-body strength can partially explain performance on Grace and Fran, although anaerobic threshold also exhibited association with performance. Along with their typical training, CrossFit athletes should likely ensure an adequate level of strength and aerobic endurance to optimize performance on at least some benchmark WODs.\n\nKeywords: strength, aerobic, anaerobic, high-intensity, training, exercise, functional",

The video can be viewed on the DNC's website and on YouTube.\n\n\"If there's one lesson we learned from the ferocity with which Republicans attacked their supposed 'ideas man' and the speed with which he caved, it's that dismantling Medicare is the new litmus test for any would-be Republican presidential nominee,\" says DNC spokesman Hari Sevugan.\n\nFor those of you out of the country the past few days, Gingrich sparked this firestorm on Sunday when talking about Ryan's Medicare proposal, saying, \"I don't think right-wing social engineering is any more desirable than left-wing social engineering. I don't think imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very good way for a free society to operate.\"\n\nSince then Gingrich has apologized to Ryan and conducted interviews with conservative commentators in what appears to be an attempt of damage control.\n\nThe House GOP 2012 budget, authored by Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican, passed the House last month without a single Democratic vote and included a proposal to overhaul Medicare. Under the plan, the government would no longer directly pay medical costs for those 55 and older, but instead would offer subsidies for seniors to use to get private health insurance coverage. A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll indicated that 49 percent of Americans prefer President Obama's approach on Medicare, with four in ten favoring the GOP proposals on Medicare.\n\nWhite House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer is also weighing in on the Gingrich controversy, saying on Twitter Wednesday that the \"biggest takeaway from the Gingrich flap – ending Medicare as we know it is the new GOP litmus test.\"",
  "latent_29819": "Reposted from Union City Patch\n\nhttp://unioncity.patch.com/articles/occupy-protesters-cause-stir-at-licorice-strike\n\nTensions flared at the American Licorice factory Monday as protesters associated with the Occupy Oakland movement joined the month-old factory workers’ strike, blocking entrances and turning away delivery trucks.\n\nAccording to protesters, about 100 protesters were onsite between 5 and 6 a.m. and had helped turn away three freight delivery trucks in the morning before local police were sent to escort vehicles into the factory lot. Many of the protesters had dispersed by noon, when only a dozen remained on scene.\n\nProtesters also said that the owner of the company, as well as the head of security and several employees, were forced to use a rear entrance to get into the facilities.\n\n“We’re forcing the people who consider this to be their domain to sneak through the back door, which I think is shameful,” said Occupy protester Shon Kay, 32, of Oakland.\n\nKay, a musician and former farmer, said he’d been coming to the American Licorice picket line for the last couple of weeks but that the Occupy Oakland Labor Solidarity Council agreed last weekend to hold a more organized and concentrated effort Monday in Union City.\n\n“Occupy Oakland has evolved,” Kay said. “We see any situation in our area where people are being scared by the One Percent, and if we have time for it, we’re going to help.”\n\nMonday’s Occupy action was not officially endorsed by the Bakery Workers Union Local 125, which represents American Licorice’s employees, said union vice president Rene Castillo.\n\nThose blocking the entrances and shouting at drivers, employees and security were primarily Occupy protesters. According to Union City police, several protesters had also attempted to crawl under incoming trucks and climb onto the hoods.\n\n“We have no problem if they’re supporting us, but it’s not endorsed by us,” Castillo said. “We can’t hold them back or stop what they do.”\n\nMonday also marked the first negotiation meeting between the local union and licorice company.\n\nA meeting began at 10 a.m. Monday morning at the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service office in Oakland and lasted until the afternoon. The details of those discussions have not yet been released.\n\nCastillo could not comment on the day’s discussion but said that all American Licorice employees would join union leaders and the company at 11:30 a.m. Tuesday at the same location.\n\nThe strike began at midnight Dec. 5 when all 178 employees left the factory in protest of what they say are unfair medical benefits. The Union City factory manufactures their popular Red Vines candy. Factory workers have since remained on the picket line 24/7, through cold weather, rain and what they say are rude and disrespectful security guards.\n\nAccording to factory workers, security at the factory has become increasingly hostile as the strike has progressed.\n\nWorkers said that a guard shoved two elderly women and shouted racist slurs, calling one woman a derogatory term for a Mexican immigrant.\n\nWhile the strike has remained peaceful, Monday’s actions by Occupy protesters resulted in several police officers being called to the scene.\n\n“It was a little tense in the morning,” said Cmdr. Ben Horner of the Union City Police Department. “The workers know what they can and can’t do.”\n\nHorner said police were brought in to ensure safety. “We didn’t want anyone getting hurt,” he said.\n\n“Prior to today, there hasn’t been any threat of violence,” Horner said. “This is a Union City issue. There are a lot of families that work there, and they’re doing their best to negotiate. Hopefully it will work out.”\n\nBut factory workers said they’re grateful that their issue is receiving greater attention and support from the Occupy Movement.\n\n“We’re happy. We want more Occupy people to come,” said Victor Nguyen, 47, who has worked at the factory for 14 years.\n\nOccupy protesters came in and out throughout the day, with popular Occupy video blogger OakFoSho live streaming the protest.\n\nUnion leaders said they didn’t feel that the day’s actions were counterproductive to the federal mediation held that day.\n\n“You’re seeing the American public, the working class who are tired of corporate America. They’re just tired of being attacked,” said Oscar Hernandez, a business agent for the Bakery Workers Union Local 24 in Redwood City, who were holding the line for the local union. “Whether we support it or don’t support it, it’s just a reality of life.”\n\nCalls to the company for comment were not immediately returned Monday.",

  "latent_30034": "(CNN) Protests broke out in Rotterdam and in front of Dutch diplomatic missions in Turkey on Saturday after the Netherlands barred a plane carrying Turkey's foreign minister from landing to stop him from addressing a political rally in the port city.\n\nThe Dutch government announced that Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu's flight permit was revoked amid concerns over public order at the expected large gathering of Turkish expatriates.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reacted angrily to the news, comparing the Dutch government to Nazis.\n\nAddressing crowds at an opening ceremony in Istanbul, Erdogan said: \"They are timid and coward. They are Nazi remnants and fascists.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Erdogan angered German Chancellor Angela Merkel by making similar remarks about Nazism in her country.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said they will not take it lightly.\n\n\"We protested that situation heavily and we told our Dutch counterparts that we will respond in the heaviest way,\" he said in a statement.\n\nTurkish referendum\n\nCavusoglu was due to address Turkish expatriates in Rotterdam to win support for an April 16 referendum vote on the Turkish Constitution.\n\nPushed by Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, these sweeping constitutional changes would grant new powers to Turkey's President and transform the way the country is governed.\n\nTurkish politicians have sought to address rallies in European cities and towns that have large populations of Turkish expatriates -- around 1.5 million Turkish nationals living in Germany are eligible to vote in the referendum, according to Turkish news agency Anadolu.\n\nBut the authorities in several countries have blocked their plans.\n\nSaturday, the Turkish family affairs minister was prevented by Dutch police from entering the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam. Minister Fatima Betul Sayan Kaya tweeted: \"Netherlands is violating all international laws, conventions and human rights.\"\n\nCavusoglu told Turkish broadcaster TRT that Turkey would respond strongly.\n\n\"Which steps they take, we will take 10 times more action. We are not afraid of this, but their doings are really inhuman,\" he said, according to Anadolu.\n\nThe Dutch ambassador who is home was asked not to return to Turkey \"for a while,\" Anadolu reported.\n\nLarge protests broke out Saturday night in Rotterdam and in the major Turkish cities of Ankara and Istanbul. Demonstrators waved Turkish flags and blocked the entrances to the diplomatic buildings.\n\nIncreased tensions\n\nIn the latest twist in the row, Cavusoglu angered the Dutch by threatening \"severe sanctions\" if he were banned from traveling to the Rotterdam rally.\n\n\"If the Netherlands cancels my flight, we will impose severe sanctions on them that will affect it economically and politically,\" the foreign minister said in remarks in a TV interview on CNN Turk.\n\nHe added, \"If tension will increase (between the two countries) because of my visit, then let it increase.\"\n\nDutch leader Mark Rutte says Turkish threats of sanctions made a \"reasonable solution\" impossible.\n\nIn a statement posted on his Facebook page, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said: \"Many Dutch people with Turkish heritage are voting in the referendum on the Turkish constitution. The Dutch government has no objection to meetings in our country in order to inform them about that.\n\n\"But these meetings cannot contribute to tensions in our society and everyone who wants to contribute to an event must comply with instructions from the authorities so that public order and security can be guaranteed. It should be noted that, in this respect, the Turkish government does not want to respect those rules.\"\n\nElection concerns\n\nThe Dutch will vote Wednesday in national elections in a campaign that has focused heavily on the issue of immigration from Muslim countries.\n\nFar-right politician Geert Wilders praised the decision to bar the Turkish minister from speaking in Rotterdam, taking credit due to the influence of his party, the Party For Freedom, or PVV.\n\n\"Great! Thanks to heavy PVV- pressure a few days before the Dutch elections our government did NOT allow the Turkish minister to land here,\" Wilders wrote.\n\nFar-right politician Geert Wilders said his party pressured the Dutch government to act.\n\nThe decision by the Netherlands was driven by concerns that Wilders might win next week's election, according to Enes Bayrakli, an assistant professor of political science at the Turkish-German University in Istanbul.\n\nBayrakli told CNN: \"I think it is a quite a serious diplomatic scandal because Turkey and Holland are allies in NATO and the EU. They have very good relations, and I think the Dutch government took this decision in order to give a message to Geert Wilders in the election. It's a right-wing populist message. The government is quite concerned it will lose to Geert Wilders, but I think this is a wrong step.\"\n\nBayrakli said: \"This shows how ridiculous the action of the Dutch government is. In the EU there are no borders between countries. You cannot prevent people traveling from one country to another.\"\n\nWilders later tweeted that Turkish people \"have no business\" in the Netherlands.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated the nature of Dutch far-right Freedom Party leader Geert Wilders' campaign. He is campaigning in the Netherlands' general election for greater party representation in the House of Representatives.",
  "latent_30071": "NEW YORK (JTA) — Over 100 years ago, Barnett Levine was greeted by the New York skyline and the Statue of Liberty as he arrived in the United States, having fled anti-Semitism and pogroms in his native Poland.\n\nOn Sunday, his grandson saw those very same sights when he joined about 700 others in this city’s Battery Park downtown at a rally protesting President Donald Trump’s executive order banning all refugees from the country for 120 days.\n\n“I am the grandchild of four immigrants who came here when the gates of the United States were wide open and they made a life here,” Harold Levine, a 60-year-old marketing consultant, told JTA. He added: “I think that it is the duty of the Jewish community to pay this forward to other immigrants who are trying to come to the United States.”\n\nThe rally was organized by HIAS, formerly known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, part of an initiative by the immigrant resettlement group called the National Day of Jewish Action for Refugees.\n\nThe president issued his order last month, which also banned citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days. On Thursday, a federal appeals court ruling upheld a stay on the ban, a move praised by Jewish groups, including HIAS.\n\nThousands attended rallies on Sunday as part of the HIAS initiative, including in Boston, Washington, D.C, and other major cities, a representative for the group told JTA. The demonstrations had more than 20 co-sponsors, including the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee, American Jewish World Service, the Union for Reform Judaism and the Conservative movement’s Rabbinical Assembly.\n\nMark Hetfield, the CEO of HIAS, said the rallies were a rare moment of joining together in support of refugees.\n\n“I haven’t seen anything like this since I got my start [with HIAS] in 1989, which was at the height of the Soviet Jewry movement,” he said. “This is a galvanizing moment like that, but the difference is that then we were standing up for Jews, and now we are standing up as Jews.”\n\nAt the New York rally, participants braved icy wind, hail and rain to join in chants of “When refugees are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back” and “Never again means never again for everyone” between speeches by rabbis and clergy members, politicians and leaders of Jewish groups. Among the speakers were Mayor Bill de Blasio; Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn.; Jonathan Greenblatt, national director of the ADL, and Sana Mustafa, a Syrian refugee.\n\nIn Boston, speakers at a rally with several hundred participants included City Councilor Josh Zakim, whose father, the late Lenny Zakim, was the longtime director of the New England Anti-Defamation League; Imam Faisal Khan, director of religious affairs at the Islamic Center of Wayland, and Fred Manasse, a child Holocaust survivor who was brought to the U.S. by HIAS.\n\nSpeeches — even those given by non-Jewish speakers — were peppered with references to Jewish history and traditions.\n\n“In this city we believe we can live in harmony,” de Blasio said in New York.” It’s not perfect, but we believe we can do something that the whole world is struggling to do, that we can all be together … people of all religions and backgrounds, that is what we’re fighting for — doesn’t that fit beautifully the profound Jewish concept of tikkun olam, of healing the world?”\n\nEllison, who told JTA that the rally was “one of the main reasons” for his visit to New York, talked in his speech about the MS St. Louis, a ship with 900 Jewish refugees from Germany that tried to enter the United States and other countries but was turned away. He called the incident “a shameful time in our country.”\n\n“All of our officials who worked with this stuff knew about it. We can’t say we didn’t know — we knew,” said Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress and a front-runner to lead the Democratic National Committee. “We didn’t want to get involved, we wanted to just mind our own business, we just kind of thought, ‘Oh, this is not our issue.'”\n\nJewish ritual featured prominently. At one point during the New York rally, representatives of 10 of the co-sponsoring groups went on stage and tore pieces of cloth, mimicking a Jewish ritual in which mourners rend their clothing. The tearing was done to remind attendees of refugees who had died before being able to reach safety, as well as those who are now facing dangerous circumstances.\n\nIn addition to co-sponsoring the New York event, the ADL on Sunday also launched a campaign to rally opposition to Trump’s executive order urging people to share on social media their family stories of coming to the U.S. and tagging posts with #ThisIsARefugee.\n\n“We remember that we were once strangers, too, that Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany and oppression during the Holocaust were often denied entry with claims eerily similar to some of the claims that are being made today to deny entrance to refugees, and we think that’s wrong,” Greenblatt told JTA on the phone before the rally.\n\nParticipants at the rally said they were compelled to attend for a variety of reasons, both personal and historical.\n\nLisa Davidson, a 41-year-old professor who attended the New York event, said she saw historic parallels between the Holocaust and the civil war in Syria.\n\n“What’s going on in Syria right now is criminal, and it is sort of reminiscent of what happened in the Holocaust in the ’30s and ’40s, and I think that we don’t want to repeat that again, and we don’t want to sit and say that we did nothing,” Davidson said.\n\nFor some the motivation came from their family history. Levine, the marketing consultant whose grandfather immigrated to the U.S. over a century ago, brought with him a poster saying”This is personal” and showing a photograph of his grandfather and his immigration paperwork.\n\n“I couldn’t not come here. The minute I heard about it, I thought I had to come,” he said.\n\nElianna Kan shared similar reasons for coming. The 28-year-old translator and journalist said her family came to the U.S. in the 1970s as refugees from the Soviet Union, receiving financial and logistical help from HIAS.\n\n“I’m here and have the privilege of being born in a free country because people who were concerned with the plight of my family, whether or not they had a personal connection, were out there, and this seems like an even more extreme case,” she said. “It’s a different case, but the parallels are far too obvious to me.”\n\n(JTA correspondent Penny Schwartz contributed reporting from Boston.)",
  "latent_30108": "A dirty dead-end in London’s Kings Cross is nobody’s idea of sanctuary. But on November 9, hours after Donald Trump’s victory was confirmed, escape lies at the end of this dark alleyway. In an upstairs rehearsal room, the xx are practicing for an imminent BBC performance; in a fortnight, they’ll travel to Croatia to kick off their first tour in more than two years. The group’s reemergence comes along with their third album, I See You, a record that knows something about surviving dark times. This evening, the outside world is well and truly banished.\n\nThey run a closed rehearsal, where producer Jamie Smith’s hulking crescent of synths are only audible through headphones. A single serene candle atop Romy Madley Croft’s guitar amp seems to mock the discarded cups littering the low-ceilinged room, bringing calm to a day of disbelief. “I try not to check my phone first thing, but…” Madley Croft trails off, looking down at her Siouxsie and the Banshees hoodie. “I thought it was a joke. I’m speechless.”\n\nNot that the xx are an explicitly political band. Co-leads Oliver Sim and Madley Croft are both gay, and there’s an argument to be made for the xx providing a rare portrait of queer intimacy, though they prefer to see it as universal. In the rehearsal room, it’s easy to imagine them as teenagers in a South London garage: Sim the leader, Madley Croft the guide, Smith the silent sage.\n\n“Let’s power through, and if something goes wrong, just let it happen,” says Sim. From his synth battalion, Smith triggers the vocal samples from “Gosh,” a single from his 2015 solo album, In Colour, which turned the band’s shyest member into its unlikely breakout star. Over the track’s chomping rhythm, Madley Croft starts singing “Shelter,” from the xx’s self-titled debut. The mash-up shouldn’t work. “Gosh” clatters, while an airy synth seems to trace the London skyline; “Shelter” quietly anguishes over vanishing sensations. But more than 16 years of friendship has led to a certain mind-meld, and the tracks fuse perfectly, Smith’s song heightening the desperation in Madley Croft’s lyrics. As the synths wind skyward, she sets down her guitar. Sim spontaneously extends a hand, and the singers turn a hug into a sway, spinning slowly until they return to their microphones for the song’s final lines.\n\n“I like our slow dance for ‘Gosh’—let’s slow dance!” he tells her afterwards. She’s less convinced. They run through the song again, the pair dancing more purposefully this time, their clasped hands pointing out as her head rests in the crook of his neck. When they pull away, they hold on until their fingertips brush apart. “We’re gonna do that!” says Sim excitedly, poking Madley Croft’s middle with one finger and pointing at the floor with another.\n\nIt’s not Miley Cyrus’ inflatable hotdog, but this kind of showmanship—any kind of showmanship—doesn’t come easy to the xx. Before they attempt “Lips,” a downright lustful new song built around big drums and a haunting modern classical sample, Madley Croft asks Sim, “Should we face forward?” She then turns to me to apologize; I’m watching from a couch six feet away from their microphones. “We have to get used to facing forward and not looking at Jamie. I’ll look past you.” Faced with a painfully intimate audience, Madley Croft winces and recoils from the high notes.",
  "latent_30166": "All through September, Syria Direct has published a series of interviews and reports on the state of southern Syria, by reporters there, in collaboration with the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. [Read our primer on southern Syria here.]\n\nFive journalists—two from Suwayda province, two from Daraa and one from Quneitra—completed an online journalism training and worked one-on-one with Syria Direct’s full-time reporting and editing staff in Amman.\n\nThe reports and interviews comprising the month-long series provide a ground-level view of the country’s southern provinces. In their conversations with local residents, leaders, activists and authorities, these five reporters capture how large-scale developments in Syria—peace talks, ceasefires, economic policy and even the odd sight of Russian soldiers wandering through villages—impact the daily lives of citizens.\n\nAs the series approaches its end, we decided to turn the microphone around and spotlight the five reporters, all of whom work clandestinely and at great personal risk. Here, the journalists tell us why they do it.\n\nNoura al-Basha, Suwayda\n\nNoura al-Basha, 27, is a longtime source of Syria Direct who lives in Suwayda province. She has an eye for a story and a talent for getting people to open up. Al-Basha was a natural candidate for the month-long training, and subsequently produced a trove of insightful reporting.\n\nOne of her interviews this month was with a Suwayda village resident who was kidnapped and released after his family paid a ransom. In a conversation with the kidnapped man and his father, al-Basha profiles a village in the province’s rural outskirts, where kidnappers regularly exploit the lack of security and military officials to extort the local populace.\n\nSuwayda city, September 2017. Photo by Noura al-Basha.\n\n“I had always dreamed of becoming a journalist,” al-Basha says. “Suwayda was among the areas that suffer from inadequate media coverage, and the events happening there were not being highlighted.”\n\nQ: Suwayda province is largely controlled by the Syrian regime. Could you talk about some of the challenges this creates for you and your fellow journalists?\n\nThe regime controls large parts of Suwayda, so journalists struggle with the fear of being investigated [by security officials] or the thought of being detained just for raising a camera when something happens. That is why people publish works under different names—so that no one will know their true identity.\n\nBut since I’m a woman and living in an area where the regime maintains a minimal presence, I’ve been able to continue my work, despite my fears.\n\nQ: Do you find that being a woman in a field largely dominated by men in Suwayda province provides some advantages? I would imagine it also creates difficulties.\n\nI can move more freely. I am not wanted for military service, which is a challenge for many young men. In terms of negatives, eastern cultures put limits on young women and the way they live their lives, even though I find that that is less the case in Suwayda society. I am often worried about my family and their reputation.\n\nQ: You spoke with a Druze sheikh for a previous report. Did you feel that being a woman affected the conversation?\n\nI felt that he had a very strong personality—a man of his standing, experience and social ties—so I felt somewhat shy. But after the first question, I gained my footing, especially because I felt as though he were proud of me, which gave me a lot of moral support.\n\nQ: Where do you see yourself moving forward?\n\nI really want to work with an international news agency and become a well-known journalist in my field.\n\nQ: Do you have any message that you’d like to pass on to Syria Direct’s readership?\n\nMy message would be about my experience with Syria Direct. It has taught me how to confidently put together credible reports without leaving any holes and without contradictions.\n\n**\n\nSamer al-Halabi, Suwayda\n\n“I must remember that there is a large group of people in my province who support Bashar al-Assad or who refuse to pick a side,” says Samer al-Halabi, 29. “It is my duty as a reporter to maintain professionalism.”\n\nAl-Halabi is a pseudonym. He is wanted in Suwayda province for military service, but instead works as a journalist for an underground local news page in what he calls a “neutral style.”\n\n“I moved away from terms like ‘regime forces,’ using ‘the Syrian army’ instead,” he says. “I avoid using any sectarian phrasing and also highlight violations by all sides.”\n\nToday, al-Halabi’s page has more than 80,000 followers.\n\nOne example of al-Halabi’s prolific work this month is a series of interviews with residents from across the political spectrum in his home province commenting on the deployment of Russian personnel there as part of an international ceasefire in southern Syria. The varied reactions of residents embody the tensions between pro-regime and pro-opposition supporters in a province united by the desire to survive the war in one piece.\n\nQ: Suwayda province is controlled by the Syrian regime. Could you talk about some of the difficulties you face as a pro-opposition journalist?\n\nSuwayda is a regime-held area, so any official journalistic work is monopolized by the regime and local media sources. My work, and the work of my colleagues, is difficult and done in secret.\n\nMost residents in the province are neutral. They have lost trust in official media and local media networks play a much larger role for residents.\n\nTo be clear, the opposition media and its methods have largely failed in Suwayda from the beginning of the revolution until today.\n\nQ: Could you tell us a bit more about what you see as the failure of opposition media in the province?\n\nIt is no secret that the majority of people in Suwayda are neutral, with the next largest group being those who support the regime.\n\nOpposition media has a policy of using phrases such as “regime forces,” “shabiha casualties” and so on. It left a bad impression on followers in the province, especially since a portion of Suwayda’s men have served, fought and died in the regime’s ranks. Opposition media adopts very confrontational methods, describing regime support and anyone neutral as collaborators who stay silent about the truth. This makes people cautious and anxious when it comes to opposition media.\n\nThe media must play a role in sending out a larger message. I hate Bashar al-Assad. I am opposed to the regime. But I must remember that there is a large group of people in my province who support him or who refuse to pick a side. It is my duty as a reporter to maintain professionalism.\n\nQ: Has your commitment to providing neutral coverage created difficulties for you with news agencies or colleagues in the provinces?\n\nCertainly. If my identity or where I work were discovered, I would be surely be killed.\n\nI founded a news page last year with a group of activists using this new, neutral style. I moved away from terms like “regime forces,” using “the Syrian army” instead. I call “the Free Syrian Army” an “opposition faction.” I avoid using any sectarian phrasing and also highlight violations by all sides. I tried to be as impartial as I could.\n\nIn just one year of work, I was able to gain 80,000 followers, with [articles] reaching 300,000 people—half of the province’s population—at times. I am now convinced that media can have a powerful role in society.\n\nFor example, I recently published a report on detainees from Suwayda. How many detainees have died from torture? The report reached a high viewership among neutral and pro-regime audiences. This is not a new topic, but the people of Suwayda do not follow opposition media.\n\nThe biggest difficulty is that I cannot reveal my identity to anyone. I’ve received numerous threats from the mukhabarat and militias. But I am happy with the work that I’ve done.\n\nQ: Have you received any threats from the opposition?\n\nYes I have. For instance, I’ve been accused of working for Daesh [the Islamic State], even though I’m Druze.\n\nIn all honesty, if we shed light on the practices of any armed group in the south, they’ll threaten us. For me, the biggest danger right now is posed by the regime and its militias, as I am in territory under their control.\n\nQ: Do you have any message you’d like to pass on to Syria Direct’s readership?\n\nMy message would be that I wish every human being in the word would support Syrians to any extent possible, even if it were just through words. The suffering we’ve lived through for seven years has been very painful, and most Syrians have nothing to do with what is happening. All we want today is to live in peace, away from war, killing and displacement.\n\n**\n\nSamir a-Sa’adi, Daraa\n\nSamir a-Sa’adi, 32, is a journalism student and reporter in Syria’s southern Daraa province. “I work for a cause and an oppressed people who have suffered,” he says, admitting that he struggles with the journalistic concept of neutrality. “In a situation like this, I cannot be neutral and stripped of my humanity. I convey reality as it is, but there is a bias for the oppressed.”\n\nThe Roman amphitheatre of Bosra a-Sham in Daraa province, May 2017. Photo by Mohamad Abazeed/AFP.\n\nOne of a-Sa’adi’s reports this month looks at the beginnings of reconstruction in towns and villages across rebel-held Daraa province. He speaks with a construction worker in the province, as well as several residents about why they are investing now to rebuild homes damaged by years of war.\n\nQ: Could you tell us about some of the obstacles faced by you and your fellow journalists in Daraa province?\n\nTo work as a journalist at this point in time—a time of war, instability and chaos—is like working in a minefield. Journalists can be killed or tortured at any moment, and by any side if he wants to cover violations or inhumane practices carried out by a particular party.\n\nIt is a dangerous profession, and journalists provide a humanitarian service because that profession requires sacrifice.\n\nQ: Where do you see yourself moving forward?\n\nIf possible, I will work as an editor or managing editor of a media outlet in a new Syria, where voices are not silenced and freedoms are not suppressed.\n\nQ: Do you have any message that you’d like to pass on to Syria Direct’s readership?\n\nMy message to those following the site is that Syrians are a civilized people seeking freedom and striving to build a state of institutions. The terrorist ideology of some militant factions is completely foreign to our society.\n\n**\n\nJawad Abu Hamza, Daraa\n\nAlready a working journalist in Daraa, Jawad Abu Hamza, 27, has earned bylines with the BBC Arabic, the pan-Arab daily Al-Quds al-Araby and Orient News.\n\n“The one thing that drives me to journalism, to stay in this dangerous profession,” Abu Hamza says, “is what Assad’s regime did at the onset of the revolution.” Balanced journalism was not allowed, he says, and a large part of what he calls the human side of the story was “wiped away.”\n\nEarlier this month, Abu Hamza conducted an interview with Wilaa, a young woman risking punishment at the hands of an Islamic State affiliate in order to get her education. The 20-year-old economics student is from the Yarmouk Basin, in the southwest corner of Syria. When she leaves home to attend university, she describes how she must first pass through checkpoints controlled by the Jaish Khaled bin al-Waleed faction.\n\nQ: Could you talk to us about the obstacles faced by you and your fellow journalists in Daraa province? Do you face pressure from the regime or local opposition factions?\n\nThere are people who oppose our work and target us. There is the Islamic State which sends us a number of threats because of our coverage of their battles with rebel factions.\n\nJournalists also struggle with being exploited by media sites or news stations that distort their reporting or pay poorly for material.\n\nQ: Where do you see yourself moving forward?\n\nWith everything I’ve said, I don’t see a future in Syria if the war and/or constant conflict continue. The regime has retaken opposition-controlled areas.\n\nPersonally, I see no future for us, and no future under the rule of Assad and his regime.\n\nQ: Do you have any message that you want to send to Syria Direct’s readership?\n\nYou are in a country that has the freedom to call for the necessary protections of the press in Syria…to demand an end to the killing of the Syrian people, actual accountability, and the removal of Assad from power so that the Syrian people can live in peace.\n\n**\n\nMuath al-Asaad, Quneitra\n\nMuath al-Asaad, 27, was working in computer repair and had a background in editing design at the time of the Syrian uprising in 2011. A few years into the war, he decided to become an opposition journalist.\n\n“I like to make short, journalistic films,” says al-Asaad. \"I produced a short documentary entitled ‘No Friends in Refugee Land,’ and I am now working on a film about treating the wounded in southern Syria.”\n\nA make-shift refugee camp in Quneitra province. December 2016. Photo courtesy of Mohamad Abazeed/AFP/Getty Images.\n\nOne of al-Asaad’s reports this month looked at harvest season in his home province of Quneitra. Al-Asaad spoke with local farmers and the head of the opposition-run Agriculture Directorate about how tariffs are halting exports of their crops into government-held territories, disrupting the fragile economic balance in the southwestern Syrian province.\n\nQ: Syria is one of the world’s most dangerous countries for journalists. The Syrian regime, the Islamic State and rebel factions can pressure or even threaten journalists. What keeps you going despite these risks?\n\nIn the beginning we were afraid, but now, after everything we’ve lost, we’re no longer scared.\n\nQ: The nature of your work in Syria’s south requires that you ask hard questions to find the truth. Could you speak about some of the obstacles you face in your work, for example censorship or threats?\n\nI have never been threatened, to tell you the truth, as my work right now is focused on humanitarian issues first and foremost.\n\nIt is difficult work, especially considering that the south is a conservative place. There are issues I cannot bring up; however, we try to address issues in a way that allows people to respect and have faith in us.\n\nQ: What are some issues that you can’t bring up?\n\nWomen’s issues are challenging, in addition to topics such as unemployment or certain groups’ stances towards the Islamic State, for example. I’m not afraid to cover these things, but people are quite hesitant to speak about them.\n\nQ: Where do you see yourself heading in the future? What do you see yourself doing down the road?\n\nRight now my focus is on producing written and visual works. We’re in the age of the viral video, after all.\n\nQ: Do you have any message you’d like to pass on to Syria Direct’s readership?\n\nMany foreigners consider us an extremist opposition, which we are not. We believe in freedom and community. We also believe that all people in the world should be able to determine their own fate.\n\nThis report is part of Syria Direct's month-long coverage of the state of the south in partnership with the Konrad Adenauer Foundation and reporters on the ground in Syria.

  "latent_30294": "FARMINGTON HILLS, MICH. -- Not too long ago, Rahaf Khatib was just another face in the land of American suburbia. The 33-year-old running enthusiast and mother of three was happily living out her life in the northern Detroit suburb of Farmington Hills.\n\nNow, Khatib is a cover girl.\n\nHer face is everywhere and her name is traveling the globe. She gets tagged in photos on Facebook with her posing right next to Hollywood starlet Jessica Alba -- on opposite magazine covers, to be specific.\n\nKhatib's bright smile on the cover of the October issue of Women's Running. The cover has created a stir because she's was a cover girl before she was on a cover. According to the magazine, Khatib is the first Muslim Hijabi runner to appear on a fitness magazine.\n\nA hijab, the modest head covering of a Muslim woman's head, is part of a practice that involves making sure the body, except the face, is modestly covered. Hijabs have not been seen much in the world of fitness and athletics.\n\nSince the cover of Khatib wearing her hijab was released in late September, the impact has been far-reaching.\n\n\"It's been awesome,\" Khatib said. \"I feel honored and humbled with all of the positive messages I've been getting, the feedback from both the Muslim and non-Muslim communities. I feel like everyone has been reaching out to me saying, 'Oh, hey, I can relate to her. I'm a covered runner too.' Or, 'Hey, that's awesome. I'm a mommy runner as well. I'm just getting so many amazing, amazing messages from across the globe.\"\n\nKhaitb says she has gotten messages of support from Malaysia, Africa, Australia and Europe. Basically, Khatib is the current \"It Girl\" in both the running and Muslim communities and her life has turned into a whirlwind of various interviews.\n\nThe New York Times has picked up the story and Khatib recently did an interview with ESPN.\n\n\"It's still slowly sinking in,\" Khatib said. \"Yeah, you need to get used to it. I'm not used to getting that much attention at all. It is, like I've said, welcomed attention. I welcome it with open arms.\"\n\nHaving only started her journey into the sport of running as recent as 2012, Khatib got into running simply because she \"wanted to get out there more.\" Now, she's completed six marathons -- all while wearing a hijab and covering her body.\n\nHOOKED FROM THE FIRST FINISH LINE\n\nKhatib was born in Damascus, Syria, but grew up in Dearborn, Mich., a Detroit suburb that is home to a large population of Arab Americans. She went to Dearborn Fordson High School, where she \"hated running\" and could not run more than two miles.\n\nYet, after marrying while in college at Wayne State and eventually embracing motherhood, she was trying to find a way to stay active and, hopefully, find some brief moments of alone time. Khatib's husband found a gym that had daycare and, although Khatib appreciated the alone time, she did not feel like she was challenging herself enough.\n\nThen, Khatib heard of the \"Martian Invasion of Races\" in Dearborn that was connected to her son's school. With distances ranging from a 5-kilometer race to a full marathon, Khatib signed up for the 10-kilometer race.\n\nInstead of paying for just a 5K race, Khatib thought she would get her money's worth and pay for a 10K.\n\n\"I didn't know at the time but 5Ks are pretty serious,\" Khatib said. \"You've really got to train for that really hard, but at the time I didn't know. I was just like, 'OK, I will just pay to run six miles instead of three. So, I did that and I trained as much as I could with no training plan.\"\n\nAs much of a novice that Khatib was, she made it to the finish line. When she crossed the line, Khatib realized that she enjoyed herself more than she expected to.\n\n\"I've never felt more like I was on top of the world than ever before,\" she said. \"Just going out there for a run and crossing the first finish line for the first race of my life -- I felt euphoric. I felt like I just won the race.\"\n\nAfter that, Khatib could not stop. By the time 2014 came around, Khatib had graduated to the marathon distance for races, 26.2 miles. Why? Khatib loves to challenge herself.\n\n\"I just love to kick my own behind,\" Khatib said with a laugh. \"I love that feeling that I accomplished something after working so hard for it.\"\n\nWith her six marathons and two triathlons under her belt, Khatib has gotten in plenty of traveling as well. For marathons, she has competed in Chicago, Indianapolis, Paris, Berlin and, of course, Detroit.\n\nMAKING THE WARDROBE WORK\n\nThe sport of competitive running isn't easy with Khatib's choice of wardrobe. \"Less is more\" is a common theme when it comes to race clothing so runners can stay cool enough.\n\n\"Don't you get hot? That's the number one question that I get,\" Khatib said. \"I also get, 'How do you run in all of that?\"\n\nAlthough Khatib does get hot, especially when her outfit gives her no choice to layer, all of the shopping and experimenting to get the most comfortable outfit can be more difficult to deal with than the heat.\n\n\"You really have to dig deep,\" Khatib said, referring to her clothes shopping adventures. \"You have to do a lot of shopping. You have to see what fits and what is long enough to cover my behind and what is one sleeved. Sometimes, you have to layer and I hate layering. I absolutely despise layering but sometimes you have to if you need that extra coverage. You need something that's light and thin, which you can find easily, especially with long sleeves.\n\nIn terms of the length, you don't find that a lot. You have to always cover and look for things that could make up for that.\n\nKhatib has found websites to order athletic hijabs from. The company called Captsers sells athletic hijab wear to women across the world, including Khatib. Made from more breathable material, Khatib does not have to worry about wearing cotton or other heavier, heat-trapping materials. As she says, \"cotton is rotten\" when it comes to running.\n\nAN ICON TO AN IMAGE\n\nKhatib's cover shoot process got started when Khatib was on Facebook and saw that the July cover runner for Women's Running was a transgender woman. Khatib had noticed that the magazine had past covers featuring Latina runners, plus-sized runners and, now, a transgender runner. However, she was hoping the magazine would include one group that she did not notice.\n\n\"I just wrote a comment under the picture -- just a comment -- saying that it was amazing and I'm so happy for all of these cover runners,\" Khatib said. \"They represent diversity but you're missing one community who is an essential part of this American society as a whole.\"\n\nOf course, Khatib was referring to Muslim Americans. Almost immediately, the publication responded and, suddenly, Khatib was chosen to be one of the magazines's feature called \"20 Women Who Are Changing The Sport Of Running (And The World)\".\n\nSoon after that, she was given the cover.\n\nYet, despite the outpouring of support that Khatib has received since the Women's Running cover was released, she has seen her share of negative remarks aimed toward her.\n\n\"I just woke up one day and my Twitter was just blasting with comments directed at me and Women's Running magazine,\" Khatib said. \"They were just negative, insults and, really, stuff I can't even repeat. Some things had to be reported even and deleted by Twitter.\"\n\nThen, there are those who try to defend her when she does not need it, saying that she wears her hijab because she is oppressed and that it is too bad that she has to cover herself because her husband makes her.\n\nFor Khatib, wearing a hijab because of oppression is something that could not be further from the truth.\n\n\"It's my choice to wear it,\" Khatib said. \"How is it that I'm oppressed? If it's your choice to wear whatever you want to wear, how does that make you oppressed? Don't think I'm wearing it for my husband or whatnot.\n\n\"Ultimately, I'm wearing it for modesty. It's not just about a piece of fabric on my head. It's about the outward -- my attitude, the way I carry myself, the way I guard my speech. It's about the outward as well as the inward.\"\n\nKhatib does not like to dwell on the negativity.\n\n\"I feel like love trumps hate,\" Khatib said. \"People recognize that. People want that. They know that there is love and that there is humanity. We have been getting more positive messages than negative.\"\n\nKhatib's magazine cover is more than just an image; it is becoming an icon. Khatib hopes that others get more out of her magazine cover than she did. In fact, her motives are two-fold.\n\n\"My whole message is that, if I can do it, anyone can,\" Khatib said. \"Sign up for a race and go out there and do it for yourself and make time for yourself, especially if you're a stay-at-home mom like I am for 12 years now. You need that boost in your self confidence. You need to go out there and meet fellow runners and bond and feel like you're a part of a community.\n\n\"My other message is for those who see people who look like me, who dress like me. To them, I just say smile and offer them a nice word. Or, if you're really curious, ask. Just simply ask. Do not rely on stereotypes that you've heard from the media or certain political candidates and whatnot. Just ask a question and we would love to answer.\"",
  "latent_30318": "Alleged OSCE Observers Held in Slavyansk by Pro-Russian Forces Are Active Duty NATO Military Officers Out of Uniform, Many from Geilenkirchen Intelligence Base Where Awacs Are Flown; Visit Was Sponsored by German Defense Ministry, Which Is Pressuring Osce To Keep Up Attempted Camouflage of Possible Spy Mission-or Worse\n\nWebster G. Tarpley, Ph.D.\n\nPressTV\n\nApril 27, 2014\n\n[download video] [download audio]\n\nPress TV: Now looking at the current events with OSCE observers, it goes to show the level of mistrust people in eastern and southern Ukraine have with regards to anything connected with Europe. How do you see the role they are playing?\n\nTarpley: I would have to say first of all, we should stop calling them OSCE observers because all indications are that they are not. That is what the OSCE has been saying continuously since this started and you can see it on their website. There are basically two versions. The Western media say OSCE observers, but the mayor Mr. [Vyacheslav] Ponomaryov, the pro-Russian mayor of Slavyansk, knows them as spies. I’m afraid reality seems to be going in the direction of Mr. Ponomareyov.\n\nThese are active-duty NATO military officers. They are four from Germany, one from Sweden, the Czech Republic, Denmark, and Poland. All NATO or European Union (EU).\n\nThe German officers come from a place called Geilenkirchen, which is a very important NATO base. This is where the AWACS planes are flown from. It’s one of the big NATO reconnaissance centers and they particularly belong to a unit of the German army, the Bundeswehr, which is called the center for enforcement or verification tasks. In other words, it’s military intelligence. What seems also to be the case, is that they were accompanied by five active-duty Ukrainian officers of the pro-Kiev forces, the ones that are controlled by the regime.\n\nThe complicating factor is they were riding around in OSCE vehicles. They were in a bus that seems to have been displaying OSCE markings. Now, when they were captured, there was obviously tremendous pressure exercised by the German Defense Ministry and the whole NATO apparatus on the OSCE to play along with this charade, pretending that they were sent by the OSCE, but it hasn’t worked.\n\nOn Friday evening in Vienna, on the first program of the Austrian television, Claus Neukirch, a high-ranking official of the OSCE, said this was not our group, not our visit, we were not the ones who did it. This is also admitted on the Deutsche Welle. Deutsche Welle is the international TV and radio of the German Foreign Ministry.\n\nAll of this exists really only in German, so today, the Ukrainian foreign minister struggling to keep up this fakery to maintain the camouflage, the Ukrainian foreign minister said, “oh, the Secretary General of the OSCE will be arriving here in order to begin negotiations or to take them over.” Very wisely the secretary general of the OSCE, an Italian diplomat named Lamberto Zannier, said “no, I’m not going.” He was very well advised not to go. Who knows what would happen to him if he got there?\n\nThe fact is that for the first couple of days, negotiations were conducted exclusively by the German Defense Ministry, who were the people that made the deal with Kiev to send these people in. This was embarrassing that the German Defense Ministry leaned on the OSCE to say “why don’t you go in and negotiate,” which the OSCE I think unwisely did.\n\nI would say to Mr. Zannier, don’t go to Ukraine, rather you should denounce the abuse and perversion of an OSCE vehicle in the name of the OSCE by what is in fact NATO military intelligence, and if you’re caught behind military lines with no uniform, that’s sometimes called espionage, whether that’s the current situation or not, it’s not clear, but I would urge everyone to stop referring to them as OSCE observers, they are NATO military officers.",
  "latent_30606": "It is common ground among the younger members of my family that the greatest actor of this (and possibly any) epoch is the 49-year-old Hollywood veteran Nicolas Cage, whose set-piece freak-outs are studied with cultish devotion – as brilliant and unintentionally comical masterclasses in how to lose your rag on screen.\n\nIn case you have not yet enjoyed Cage’s displays of yowling, bug-eyed, wild-maned overacting, I can direct you to any number of splendid YouTube compilations, including “Nicolas Cage Freaks Out” and “Nicolas Cage Loses His S---”. He excels himself in Con Air, where he freaks out and kills someone for the minor offence of playing with his fluffy toy (“Put the bunny back in the box,” he says, several times and with increasing hysteria).\n\nAnd yet, of all his many glorious roles, I would single out Face/Off (1997), in which he somehow contrives to have his face surgically removed and swapped with that of one of the world’s nastiest super-criminals, played by John Travolta. The enemy looks like he does, sounds like he does. Worse, the gangster takes his job and takes his car; takes his whole life. He sleeps with his wife! Aaaargh!\n\nNicolas Cage does what he does best. He freaks out. He knows that there is an impostor at work – making his daughter laugh, earning popularity in the office. He wants to expose the fraud – but no one will listen to him. He wants to tell the world that he’s the nice one, he’s the real deal – but it’s no use; they have turned against him.\n\nAnd that is the problem we Tories face when confronted with these chaps from Ukip. Take Nigel Farage, whom I met years ago and who has always struck me as a rather engaging geezer. He’s anti-pomposity, he’s anti-political correctness, he’s anti-loony Brussels regulation. He’s in favour of low tax, and sticking up for small business, and sticking up for Britain.\n\nWe Tories look at him – with his pint and cigar and sense of humour – and we instinctively recognise someone who is fundamentally indistinguishable from us. He’s a blooming Conservative, for heaven’s sake; and yet he’s in our constituencies, wooing our audiences, nicking our votes, and threatening to put our councillors out of office. We feel the panic of a man confronted by his Doppelgänger. Omigaaaad, we say to ourselves: they’re stealing our schtick! And we are tempted to do a Nicolas Cage – to overreact, to freak out, to denounce them all as frauds or worse. I think there may have been a few ill-advised insults flying around in the past couple of days.\n\nWell, I would humbly submit that there are better ways of tackling the Ukip problem, if indeed it is really a problem at all. The rise of Farage and Ukip tells us some interesting and important things about what the electorate wants – and it is by no means bad news for the Conservatives. It tells us that the voters are fed up with over-regulation of all kinds, and especially from Brussels. Well, who is going to offer a referendum on the EU? Only the Conservatives – and the trouble with voting Ukip is that it is likely to produce the exact opposite: another Labour government and another five years of spineless and unexamined servitude to the EU.\n\nOr take the Human Rights Act, and yesterday’s astonishing story about a fellow who has been here illegally since 2000, and has just tried to persuade a court that he may not be returned to Iraq – in spite of repeated convictions for drug dealing – because he has tattoos. These tattoos apparently include one of a naked lady, of a kind that may allegedly cause offence in a Muslim country.\n\nAs it happens, there is no evidence whatever of anyone being persecuted in Iraq because of his tattoos – even in the Islamist chaos that has followed the removal of Saddam. Why shouldn’t he wear a T-shirt? Why can’t he get the tattoo changed to look like a porpoise or something inoffensive? Why are British courts sitting through this kind of drivel? Why are British taxpayers paying hundreds of millions for the whole carry-on? You read that kind of story, and you can see exactly why people are tempted to go for Ukip – just to give the whole cosy and complacent political establishment a kick in the pants.\n\nIt is tempting, but there is only one party that has the remotest chance of getting a grip on this sort of politically correct nonsense, and that is the Conservatives. If you want the party that finally got a grip on mass illegal immigration – after Labour deliberately let the brakes off – it is the Tories. If you want to cut the burdens on small business, it is only the Tories who have a hope of governing and actually doing something about the problem.\n\nRather than bashing Ukip, I reckon Tories should be comforted by their rise – because the real story is surely that these voters are not turning to the one party that is meant to be providing the official opposition. The rise of Ukip confirms a) that a Tory approach is broadly popular and b) that in the middle of a parliament, after long years of recession, and with growth more or less flat, the Labour Party is going precisely nowhere.\n\nEd Miliband and Ed Balls were the people who advised Gordon Brown most intimately throughout his profligate reign. It was they who said they had taken Britain “beyond boom and bust” and then produced a spectacular bust.\n\nThey have absolutely nothing to say or to offer except to take the Labour Party far to the Left of where it was even under Gordon Brown. Their lead has been cut to single figures in the past few weeks, and if – as I strongly suspect – the economy starts to recover well next year (and perhaps as early as this summer), then that lead will be obliterated.\n\nNow is not the time to do a Nicolas Cage and freak out at our Doppelgängers, or to slag them off just for appearing to think, in large part, what many Conservatives think. Now is the time to keep calm and carry on being Conservative.",

The Blues also see around 15 million pounds knocked off their overall loss in add backs, which includes infrastructure costs, youth development costs and charitable donations amongst other outgoings.\n\nThat brings Chelsea's losses for the period to approximately 34 million pounds, falling under the FFP threshold of 45 million euros (37.5 million pounds).\n\n\"From the very beginning of the current ownership of Chelsea Football Club, a long-term objective was financial sustainability, and the subsequent implementation of Financial Fair Play by UEFA and by the Premier League has brought that to the top of the agenda for football clubs,\" Blues chairman Bruce Buck said.\n\n\"We are pleased therefore that we will meet the stipulations set down by UEFA in their first assessment period, and by our own analysis we are progressing from a commercial viewpoint as well as continuing to add trophies to our collection, which we never lose sight of as our most important goal.\"\n\nThe next financial year's results will be boosted by, amongst other things, a new 10-year kit deal with Adidas.

  "latent_30976": "The government has been accused of dishonesty over arms sales as new figures reveal that the value of British weapons sales to “countries of concern” has already hit £60m this year. Former Tory defence minister Sir John Stanley, who chairs the Commons committees on arms export controls, says ministers failed to come clean on a “significant change in policy” that makes it easier to export arms to countries with a poor human rights record.\n\nHe said in a recent parliamentary debate that the government has not acknowledged that such a change has taken place, and it “should consider most carefully whether they should now offer an apology to the committees”.\n\nThe government used to reject arms export licences where there was concern they might be used for “internal repression”, but now a licence will be refused only if there is a “clear risk” that military equipment might be used in violation of international law.\n\nFormer Foreign Office minister Peter Hain, who established the strict criteria on arms sales, last night demanded that the government be transparent about the change and called for parliament to be allowed a vote. He said: “The present government has run a coach and horses through our arms export controls, circumventing the legislation we put in place by putting a particular spin on it. It has enabled them to sell arms to countries and for purposes that should not be allowed under the legislation.\n\n“There is a clear policy in the legislation that arms should only be sold to countries for defensive purposes and not for internal suppression or external aggression. In the case of Gaza over the summer, that has clearly been flouted. Bahrain is another example.”\n\nData from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills reveals that in the first six months of 2014 the UK granted licences worth £63.2m of arms sales to 18 of the 28 states on its official blacklist, countries about which the Foreign Office has the “most serious wide-ranging human rights concerns”. Israel, Saudi Arabia, the Central African Republic, Sri Lanka and Russia were among the countries that Britain approved military equipment for.\n\nSaudi Arabia was the biggest beneficiary, with licences approved for more than £20m of military equipment, including hand grenades, sniper rifles, weapon nightsights and components for combat vehicles. More than £8m of arms were approved for export to Sri Lanka, including shotguns, assault rifles and ammunition. The island’s security forces have been accused of the rape and torture of detainees, and there are reports of intimidation of journalists, activists and opposition politicians, pressure on the judiciary and sectarian violence.\n\nBy the end of June, licences for £9.1m of equipment were granted to Russia, including small arms ammunition and sniper rifles, although a number are on hold because of the Ukraine crisis.\n\nAndrew Smith from Campaign Against Arms Trade said: ​“By the government’s own admission, it has sold over £60m of weapons into some of the most authoritarian and war-torn countries in the world. Arms sales like these don’t just facilitate human rights abuses, they also give political support to the regimes that are carrying them out. It is totally inconsistent for the government to be talking about human rights and democracy at the same time as it is actively promoting arms sales to authoritarian regimes like Saudi Arabia.”\n\nThe consequences of the coalition’s support for British arms exports have been highlighted this year, with British-made teargas recently used in Hong Kong against pro-democracy protesters.\n\nA review overseen by business secretary Vince Cable identified 12 licences for ordnance that was likely to have been used in the bombing of Gaza, but the government has refused to suspend any licences unless there is “a resumption of significant hostilities”.\n\nThe new data shows that £7m of military equipment for Israel was approved by Cable’s department in the first half of the year, including and surface-to-air missiles.\n\nOther countries which are officially “of concern” but are still highly controversial destinations for British arms include Bahrain, which has increased its purchases of UK-approved military equipment despite a worsening of its human rights situation.\n\nArms sales to Egypt have also resumed, with £2.7m of sales approved during a period that saw the controversial detainment of al-Jazeera journalists. The United Arab Emirates has bought £37m of arms from the UK in 2014, including machine guns, shotguns, ammunition and weapon sights. Cable’s department recently encouraged British security and defence firms to attend a sales exhibition in the UAE that was sponsored by the Dubai police force, which is accused of torture.\n\nActivists say Britain’s export of arms is unlikely to decline. When foreign secretary Philip Hammond was asked about British arms being used in Hong Kong, he said: “CS gas is available from large numbers of sources around the world. I think that is a rather immaterial point. They could buy CS gas from the US.”\n\nDavid Lowry, independent policy consultant, said: “Surely ministers should recognise that promoting the interests of international arms dealers over regional security is counterproductive.”",

  "latent_31246": "The only possible explanation is that Ridley Scott has a Duke Brothers–style bet running with George Lucas: Who can produce the most crushingly disappointing prequel to a beloved classic of late-70s science fiction cinema? There’s no other way to account for the tedious, incoherent two hour train wreck that is Prometheus—a film whose powerhouse ensemble cast and stunning visuals ultimately fail to rescue it from a script that feels like it was fished from a dumpster of rejected SyFy Original Movie treatments.\n\nHow bad is it? The one and only character who doesn’t feel like a robot is, in fact, a robot. The protagonists are so flat and irritating that you end up rooting for the aliens to wipe out humanity—just as long as these guys die first. Nothing about this movie makes sense—not in the cool David Lynchian “makes you think” way, but rather in a “you didn’t think very much about this script, did you?” way. It’s what happens when nobody tells you your apres-bong dorm conversations were not, in fact, super deep. A partial list of plot holes and problems, which will contain many, many spoilers, just in case you’re still planning on throwing away your hard earned money. If you’re really that intrigued by the premise, though, I’d recommend just watching Stargate again.\n\nThe movie opens with an alien “Engineer” preparing to seed a primordial planet—presumably Earth—with life. He accomplishes this by drinking a black goop which causes him to die in agony, disintegrating at the cellular level. It looks cool, but forces you to wonder: Is this really the best means available for this incredibly advanced species to introduce genetic material to a planet? It’s a little like finding out that Prometheus brought fire to humanity by setting himself on fire despite the ready availability of kindling. As with many, many other bizarre moments in this movie, this makes sense at a thematic and allegorical level, but fails at the level of elementary plot logic. This is why doing allegory well is hard: Your story actually has to work at a second level without shattering the viewer’s suspension of disbelief on the first level. Throughout the movie, you get the sense that the authors have decided that if it works symbolically, it doesn’t need to make sense narratively.\n\nThe movie proper begins with the discovery of a glyph that appears in the art of many human civilizations separated by vast distances in time and space. Apparently the configuration of five stars, depicted at the resolution of cave paintings, is sufficient to uniquely identify one area of space 35 light years away. Noomi Rapace concludes that this is an invitation from the aforementioned aliens, who not only visited earth in ancient times, but actually created the human species. Not one shred of evidence for this hypothesis is ever provided, but it’s what Noomi “chooses to believe,” even though this is in fairly obvious tension with Christian doctrine, which she also “chooses to believe.”(She later suggests that maybe God made the aliens, without any acknowledgement that this would rescue deism, not Christianity.) Nevertheless, this is all it takes to persuade the Weyland Corporation to spend a trillion dollars sending not an unmanned probe but a ship full of human scientists on a two-year voyage in cryostasis to see if Erich von Daniken was right after all.\n\nA big chunk of this tedious exposition is delivered by a hologram of CEO Peter Weyland, who is inexplicably played by Guy Pearce in bad latex makeup rather than an actual old person, even though no younger version of the character is ever seen. Weyland claims he will have died by the time they see this recording, but this turns out to be a deception: He’s actually also in cryostasis on the ship. Since Weyland’s plan involves him being revived once they’ve made contact with the aliens, he must know that this will be exposed as a deception within a day or two, making the whole elaborate ruse completely pointless, except as a setup for a lame third-act reveal.\n\nDitto the fact that Charlize Theron is Weyland’s daughter: This is kept secret for no reason beyond setting up a meh-inducing late reveal. Her motives are even more opaque. She believes the entire mission is just a hazardous wild goose chase, and only wants to inherit her father’s empire. She joins them on this 4-year-plus mission because she doesn’t want to hang around squabbling over who runs the company… even though her best-case scenario would appear to involve doing this when she gets back from the perilous mission, having given her rivals 5 years to scheme in her absence.\n\nWeyland’s primary motive, we eventually learn, is the hope of learning from the aliens some means of further prolonging his life, as he has hit the limits of artificial extension and is near death. Except he can apparently remain alive in cryostasis indefinitely. So instead of funding a probe and further medical research while he waits on ice for the next breakthrough, he has packed himself on this unprecedented and incredibly hazardous voyage.\n\nWeyland also takes off on a forced and clunky tangent about how his Android “son” David can’t appreciate his own immortality because he lacks a soul. There’s no hint that scientific supergenius Weyland detects any tension between this quaint notion and his apparent conviction that humans, too, have been “engineered” by an advanced biological race.\n\nUpon arriving at their destination, we see that the team has incredibly sophisticated mapping probes, but charge into an alien facility themselves without waiting for the probes to finish scanning the structure. Immediately upon discovering that there’s a breathable atmosphere within the facility, one Dr. Holloway brazenly pulls off his helmet—chiding his colleague and lover to not “be a skeptic,” because apparently skepticism is anathema to good scientists. Though it’s later confirmed they have no way of being sure the air isn’t full of strange pathogens, and everyone else points out that this is insane, the rest of the team nevertheless immediately follows suit when it doesn’t result in his instant death.\n\nA hologram recording showing the apparent deaths of many of the aliens millennia earlier is triggered. The supposedly superintelligent android shines a flashlight on the holograms in an effort to see them better.\n\nThe Shaggy and Scooby of the film—a biologist and a geologist—freak out at the sight of dead alien bodies, despite having been willing to truck 35 light years on a perilous exploratory mission, and hasten to head back to the ship in a panic. They get lost, despite the fact that the geologist is the one with mapping expertise. This fear then evaporates as quickly as it appeared, as the biologist decides he should recklessly cozy up to a terrifying alien serpent creature. To nobody’s surprise, it quickly kills the biologist, while his geologist colleague is dissolved in black goop, only to later reappear as a zombie in a completely pointless fight scene. This is a pattern. In almost every scene, members of this handpicked group of top scientists for a trillion-dollar mission routinely make the kind of wildly irrational blunders that we strain to accept when it’s half-drunk teenagers in slasher pics. Nobody, at any time, acts remotely like a scientist\n\nThe DNA of the alien Engineers is apparently a perfect match for human DNA, despite the fact that they’re like 8-feet tall with grey skin, no body hair, and completely black eyes. Just how this could actually be true so many millions of years later remains a puzzle for the viewer.\n\nAndroid David indicates that he thinks he can read the alien language. Nobody follows up with him on this or suggests that deciphering their records might be urgent, especially when it’s clear they’ve got a lethal contagion on the loose.\n\nWith half the team out exploring the hazardous alien facility, Space Captain Stringer Bell decides to abandon his post at the comms station to bang Charlize Theron. Which, at some level, fair enough… but nobody ever suggests this is a gross dereliction of duty.\n\nAndroid David infects one of the scientists with the black alien slime for no apparent reason, despite the obvious danger this poses. (Oddly, David’s actions do make sense if you assume he has the same goal as the treacherous android Ash in Alien—to preserve the xenomorph as a biological weapon—though there’s no indication of this, and it would seem to require knowledge none of the characters could possibly have.)\n\nThe aforementioned infected scientist can see there’s something obviously wrong with him, but instead of immediately seeking medical attention, decides to risk himself and the entire crew—including the love of his life—by pretending he’s just hunky dory until he literally collapses.\n\nAndroid David tells Noomi she seems to be about “three months pregnant” (about ten minutes after we awkwardly introduce the idea that she’s infertile for the first time)—then immediately reveals that the “fetus” is an alien squid thing. Maybe he read something about the normal gestational cycle of alien squid things in the hieroglyphs? Because… how the hell does he know what “three months” looks like? When she pleads with him to cut it out, he attempt to knock her out and put her in stasis, again for reasons unclear. She then neglects to mention this unsporting behavior to anyone, and nobody seems at all curious when she shows up bloodied and bedraggled after performing an emergency auto-caesarian. David, who was previously so keen to retrieve squid-fetus for whatever reason, exhibits no interest in what might have happened to it.\n\nAt one point, Space Captain Stringer Bell abruptly intuits that they’ve landed at a WMD manufacturing plant wisely situated far from the Engineers’ home world, though it’s not remotely clear that his explanation is anything more than a wild guess. Maybe it’s just what he “chooses to believe”? This raises the additional question: Why did the aliens leave us with an invitation to their weapons depot?\n\nThe sophisticated alien computer has a sort of flute-like control mechanism, apparently used exclusively to turn the system on, at which point it’s operated by buttons. Which is like having a remote control for your TV, except for the power button, which takes the form of a flute. Why don’t they just have an on button? Or an entirely flute-based control system? Because space, shut up.\n\nA member of this incredibly advanced species that created humanity is found in stasis and awakened. Confronted by a group of humans, including an android that speaks its language, and obviously lacking any knowledge of how many others there might be, or what weaponry they might have, this advanced being makes no effort to gather any information. It roars and begins acting like a space monster, attacking the party with its bare hands.\n\nWhen Space Captain Stringer Bell decides he must sacrifice himself to stop the Engineer from returning to earth and destroying humanity, his crew almost gleefully volunteer to join him, on the grounds that he is a bad pilot and will need their help… to ram a spaceship the size of a city block. (As a commenter suggests, it’s possible that this is said sarcastically, and they’re actually just needlessly throwing their lives away in a gesture of solidarity. Hey, what are buddies for?)\n\nCharlize Theron is crushed to death when said ship topples because she runs along its falling length instead of, you know, going sideways. (In an apparent repudiation of Newton along with Darwin, the fast-moving ship basically drops out of the sky in a straight line rather than falling in an arc to crash miles away.) Noomi survives because the gazillion ton space ship that has just fallen out of the sky in flames hits… a rock or something. So the ship halts a few inches above her head.\n\nThe Engineer survives this crash and almost instantly locates Noomi Rapace in order to continue the effort to kill her, again with his bare hands. The rationale for this is, again, totally opaque, especially given that we then learn there are dozens of other ships—possibly including other Engineers in stasis, though nobody exhibits any curiosity about this possibility either.\n\nNoomi’s squid-fetus, meanwhile, has grown to monstrous proportions despite being locked in a small room with no sources of food or other places for the additional mass to have come from.\n\nWe end with Noomi heading for the homeworld of the creatures who we’ve just learned are determined to immediately kill any human they see.\n\nThere’s more, of course. More excruciating, formulaic dialogue. More emotionally flat scenes tacked on in a desperate, failed attempt to flesh out the characters enough that we might care what happens to any of them. The ham-fisted gestures in the direction of deep questions about which, ultimately, nothing interesting is said or even implied. But this should give you a rough idea of what we’re dealing with. In fairness to the Engineers, my experience of human culture consisted of this movie, I’d probably want to wipe the species out too.\n\nAddendum: The folks at Red Letter Media have a more charitable video review that pokes at some of the same holes. Like these guys, I didn’t want to harp on everything that’s not explicitly and laboriously explained, because there are plenty of things that are left deliberately ambiguous or merely implied and left for the reader to puzzle out, and that’s all to the good. It’s fine that they don’t spell out exactly why the Engineers changed their mind about humanity (there’s a strong hint in the allusion to some catastrophe “about 2000 years ago”), or detail the precise nature of the Black Goo. It’s good to leave a few mysteries, and a smart audience doesn’t need everything handed to it on a silver platter. But there’s a difference between a cosmic conundrum or an implicit motive and a simple plot gap or character inconsistency, especially when they’re piled atop each other in such quantity. That starts looking less like deliberate mystery and more like simple bad writing.",

  "latent_31812": "The Turkish government on Tuesday escalated its wide-ranging crackdown against people it claims have ties to plotters of last week's attempted coup, firing tens of thousands of public employees across the country.\n\nThe dismissals touched every aspect of government life.\n\nTurkish media, in rapid-fire reports, said the Ministry of Education fired 15,200 people across the country; the Interior Ministry 8,777 employees; and Turkey's Board of Higher Education requested the resignation of 1,577 university deans -- akin to dismissing them.\n\nIn addition, 257 people working at the office of the prime minister were dismissed and the Directorate of Religious Affairs announced it had sacked 492 staff including clerics, preachers and religious teachers. Turkey's Family and Social Policy Ministry said it dismissed 393 personnel.\n\nThe firings come on top of the roughly 9,000 people who have been detained by the government, including security personnel, judges, prosecutors, religious figures and others. Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency said courts have ordered 85 generals and admirals jailed pending trial over their suspected roles in the coup attempt. Dozens of others were still being questioned.\n\nThe violence surrounding the Friday night coup attempt claimed the lives of 208 government supporters and 24 coup plotters, according to the government. Turkey says Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric, was behind the coup and has demanded his extradition. Gulen has denied any knowledge.\n\nIbrahim Kalin, a spokesman for Erdogan, blamed a \"Gulenist clique within the Turkish army\" for the attempted coup.\n\n\"There will be legal evidence collected in this investigation and we will present all of this to the Americans as part of our extradition request,\" he said.\n\n\"On the grounds of suspicion, he can be easily extradited. We would like to see cooperation from the U.S. authorities on this issue.\n\nAnadolu Agency said Tuesday those formally arrested include former air force commander Gen. Akin Ozturk, alleged to be the ringleader of the July 15 uprising, and Gen. Adem Hududi, commander of Turkey's 2nd Army, which is in charge of countering possible threats to Turkey from Syria, Iran and Iraq.\n\nOzturk has denied the allegation, saying he neither planned nor directed the failed military coup, according to the Anadolu Agency.\n\nThe agency said Erdogan's Air Force adviser, Lt. Col. Erkan Kivrak, had been detained at a hotel where he was vacationing in Turkey's southern province of Antalya. No reason was given for the detention.\n\nA thousand pro-government demonstrators gathered for a rally in Istanbul Tuesday, waving flags and chanting slogans and songs praising President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The demonstrators amassed in the conservative district of Fatih and demanded the death penalty for those responsible for the failed coup.\n\n\"We are not leaving these squares,\" said Durhan Yilmiz, an Istanbul municipality worker. \"(The) Turkish flag cannot be lowered.\"\n\nPro-democracy meetings and rallies have been held in all of the major cities of Turkey.\n\nIn a bid to calm markets roiled by the coup attempt, Turkey's central bank cut a key interest rate Tuesday to shore up liquidity in the economy. The bank's Monetary Policy Committee said it has reduced its overnight marginal funding rate from 9 percent to 8.75 percent.\n\nErdogan, meanwhile, made a series of televised appearances in which he disclosed dramatic details of his survival on the night of a failed coup and raised the specter of reintroducing the death penalty to punish conspirators.\n\nHe told U.S. broadcaster CNN that he narrowly escaped death after coup plotters stormed the resort town of Marmaris where he was vacationing.\n\n\"Had I stayed 10, 15 additional minutes, I would have been killed or I would have been taken,\" he said in the interview late Monday.\n\nThe president and other officials have strongly suggested the government is considering reinstating the death penalty, a practice abolished in 2004 as part of Turkey's bid to join the European Union. Several European officials have said such a move would be the end of Turkey's attempts to join.\n\nAddressing hundreds of supporters outside his Istanbul residence early Tuesday, Erdogan responded to calls for the reintroduction of the death penalty with the simple statement: \"You cannot put aside the people's demands.\"\n\n\"In a country where our youths are killed with tanks and bombs, if we stay silent, as political people we will be held responsible in the afterlife,\" Erdogan said, pointing out that capital punishment exists around the world, including in the United States and China.\n\nTurkey's deputy prime minister said dossiers containing details of Gulen's activities have been sent to the U.S. Numan Kurtulmus would not provide details about the files but said they include the past actions of the group that Gulen leads. They may also include new evidence that has emerged from the current investigation. Kurtulmus said an extradition request will follow.\n\nSpeaking to parliament, the chairman of the opposition Nationalist Movement Party, Devlet Bahceli, said his party would back legislation to reintroduce the death penalty if it was put forward by the ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP.\n\n\"If the AKP is ready, we are in for the death penalty,\" Bahceli said.\n\nPrime Minister Binali Yildirim, meanwhile, reflected the triumphant mood of authorities. He said the July 15 victory over the plotters was \"epic\" and that no coup in the history of Turkey had been as brutal as the one that this government survived.\n\n\"The force of the tanks could not beat the force of the people,\" he said.\n\nYildirim also lashed out at Europe, whose leaders have expressed concerns over the purges underway across Turkey's key state institutions.\n\n\"We thank our European friends for their support against the coup, however their sentences starting with `but' did not please us at all,\" he said.",
  "latent_31826": "THE Uighurs have never been particularly comfortable in China. Xinjiang, the region where these Turkic Muslims once formed the vast majority, came unwillingly into the Chinese empire. Rebels in parts of it even set up independent republics; a short-lived one was snuffed out by the Communist Party in 1949. Since then the regime in Beijing, 1,000 miles (1,600km) to the east, has sought to keep Xinjiang quiet. The policy is not working. The presidency of Xi Jinping risks sinking into a quagmire of ethnic strife. This could be China’s Chechnya.\n\nOver the past few decades the party has used several tactics to assert control. First it encouraged massive migration of Han Chinese into Xinjiang from other parts of China. Later it poured money into infrastructure and beefing up industry; the jobs thus created have gone overwhelmingly to Hans, who now make up more than 40% of the province’s 22m people. In tandem the party has adopted a hard line towards the merest hint of dissatisfaction on the part of the Uighurs.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nDiscontent is spilling into the open, nonetheless. The past few days have been the bloodiest in Xinjiang since clashes in the provincial capital, Urumqi, left around 200 dead in 2009. It appears that nearly 100 people died in the violence. The dead include 59 alleged terrorists gunned down by police near Kashgar, the main city in southern Xinjiang, where the Uighurs are concentrated (and where the economy is weakest). These Uighurs had apparently attacked police stations and Han Chinese. Two days later a pro-government imam was stabbed to death outside the city’s main mosque (see article).\n\nWhenever violence flares up, the government’s rhetoric is uncompromising and usually focused on the dangers of jihadism. In May, following a spate of attacks by Uighurs on government and civilian targets in Xinjiang and in other parts of China, Mr Xi demanded “walls made of copper and steel” and “nets spread from the earth to the sky” to catch the “terrorists”. The party blames such attacks on Islamist militancy seeping across the border from Central and South Asia—notably from Afghanistan and Pakistan. It likes to claim that Uighurs live in harmony with the Han Chinese (“tightly bound together like the seeds of a pomegranate”, as Mr Xi puts it).\n\nThe tragedy is that the government could end up proving itself right—by making jihadism the core of the Uighurs’ militancy. For now the violence is fuelled principally by a welter of home-grown grievances and is strikingly amateurish: rarely are the perpetrators armed with anything more than knives. But in recent months the violence has been morphing, spreading beyond the region itself and taking on some of the hues of jihadism elsewhere—through suicide-attacks and indiscriminate killing of civilians.\n\nSuch acts are unspeakable. But there is evidence that China’s heavy-handed approach in Xinjiang is radicalising a once-tolerant culture. Uighur activists abroad say the latest violence near Kashgar had nothing to do with terrorism, for instance; instead it was sparked by police efforts to enforce government bans against fasting during Ramadan.\n\nFrom Sudan to the West Bank, the evidence is clear: once religion enters any conflict, it becomes harder to settle. The parallel with Chechnya should scare Mr Xi. What started out as a nationalist uprising in Russia’s north Caucasus region in the 1990s was met by a brutal clampdown, which in turn spawned a violent Islamist movement. Since then Chechnya has been both a jihadist breeding-ground and a running sore for Russia.\n\nAbout turn\n\nThere are hints that Mr Xi understands the problem. In May he convened a rare meeting of party bosses to discuss Xinjiang. That gathering recognised the need to boost employment among Uighurs, especially in southern Xinjiang. After the meeting state-owned enterprises in Xinjiang were told they had to hire at least a quarter of all staff from Uighur and other minorities. Education for Uighurs is another priority: work has just begun on Kashgar’s first full-scale university.\n\nSuch steps are necessary, but still not enough. Uighurs’ religious traditions should be respected, so that all Muslims are allowed to visit Mecca, not just those approved by the government. Education in the Uighur language could also be encouraged, as well as its use in workplaces. Mr Xi should disband the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, which runs a vast network of Han-dominated settlements.\n\nAnd China should give up persecuting moderate Uighurs, who hardly embrace jihadism but are still angry about the government’s repressive measures. Amid the carnage of the past few days, the authorities announced they had formally charged a prominent Uighur economist, Ilham Tohti, with separatism. “Fewer and fewer people dare to speak out” about ethnic policies in Xinjiang, Mr Tohti has lamented. If Xinjiang’s Uighurs are not to fall prey to extremists, Mr Xi must allow people like Mr Tohti to speak out, not lock them away.",

  "latent_31894": "Pedro Silva was startled one recent night to find three naked men in cowboy hats intruding on his property. Concerned for his family's safety, he thought to call 911 — but didn't.\n\nAt a community meeting Thursday night on bias and accountability among Boulder police, Silva, who is black, explained to the department's chief and top deputies why it is he hesitates to contact law enforcement even when facing danger.\n\n\"What happens if I get shot?\" he said. \"The police department doesn't exist for me, but I wish it did.\"\n\nThursday's meeting, which went two hours and was attended by about 50 people, was intended primarily as a public update on progress the department has made toward the dozen recommendations made since the February release an independent report on police bias in Boulder.\n\nBoulder police officer Edgar Torres questions a witness behind Moe's Bagels in Boulder. (Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer)\n\nThat report — done by a firm specializing in police evaluation — suggested that Silva may have reason to worry about unfair treatment by cops; a black person in Boulder is more than twice as likely — compared with the city's overall demographics — to be cited for misdemeanor and traffic offenses.\n\nBlack people, who comprise about 1 percent of the city, have also accounted for at least 5 percent of all felony arrests in Boulder every year since 2011, the report found — though it argued the disproportion was weaker proof of \"evident\" bias than the citation figures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the report's 12 recommendations, the one police are working hardest to address concerns a lack of data. The department's policy on routine stops that do not result in citation or arrest has called for no data to be collected on contacted subjects' race and gender, nor on the length of the individual interactions.\n\nBy gathering more data, police say, they can better understand and address issues of bias.\n\n\"This is the direction of policing. It's needed so that information is no longer anecdotal,\" Chief Greg Testa said at the meeting. \"It's important to gather the demographic information so that we have a complete picture of who we're contacting, why we're stopping somebody, how long they've been stopped and detained for, whether there was a search involved.\"\n\nBoulder is far from alone in its past failure to collect the data needed for complete and accurate probes into bias. In fact, only two law enforcement agencies in Colorado do so presently.\n\n\"This is difficult,\" Testa said. \"We're struggling with this. When we look at best practices — there is no best practice.\"\n\nTesta told the audience that his office is developing a new procedure on data collection and implementing a new records management system. The department has also surveyed people stopped by its officers to ask how they felt they were treated, and has expressed interest in continuing to participate in forums similar to Thursday's.\n\nIt seems likely — based on numerous public comments made at the meeting — that future opportunities for such dialogue may require reformatting.\n\nThe meeting was held at the police department and centered on what police are doing to limit the consequences of racial bias, which some perceived as uneven parameters.\n\n\"I appreciated all the efforts, but I did notice they were primarily, 'Here's what I want you to know' or 'Here's what I want to hear from you,'\" said Taishya Adams, a black woman. \"There's not too much about community building.\"\n\nRenee Morgan, a white woman seated nearby, chimed in moments later.\n\n\"I hear what you're saying, and it's all about you,\" she said.\n\nMorgan continued by telling police how she perceives them.\n\n\"You all are terrifying. I just want to be clear about that,\" she said. \"Those uniforms are terrifying. Community outreach is not about us coming to understand what you do. I think we're all profoundly aware.\"\n\nTesta said that Boulder police hope to make it easier to accept feedback — even when it's uncomfortable, as with Silva, Adams and Morgan — from the community it serves. The department is more active than ever on social media, has a redesigned website that includes electronic complaint forms in multiple languages and is looking into creating a citizens advisory panel.\n\nThe panel, which the independent report recommended, would be separate from an existing professional standards review board that local advocates against police brutality have long held slants in favor of the state. Testa hopes it forms and begins meeting before the end of the year.\n\n\"The vision for this is community members will be a part of a panel ... who will talk to me directly, and the police department of other city staff as appropriate,\" he said. \"We'll meet regularly and kind of let the group decide the direction we want to go in.\"\n\nMorgan, for one, hopes that future dialogue is less like the \"PR campaign\" she felt she heard on Thursday, and more like a conversation among equals.\n\n\"We all know what you do,\" she said. \"Making a cooler website or access to information — that's not it. It's actually about you becoming more like us.\"\n\nAlex Burness: 303-473-1389, burnessa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/alex_burness",
  "latent_32016": "As I was working on The Bible Tells Me So , I became conscious on a more present level of the debt I owe Judaism in my own reading of the Bible, a process that began while in graduate school.\n\nOne day I was eating lunch with a Jewish classmate who grew up in Israel. We were both in our first year, and somehow the topic turned to the story of Adam and Eve.\n\nMany Christians understand this story’s meaning not only to be quite obvious, but absolutely foundational to the Christian faith. Even the slightest movement one degree to the left or right threatened to shrivel the gospel like cotton candy when it hits your tongue.\n\nEvery Christian just “knows” the Adam and Eve story is about the “fall” of humanity from a blissful state of perfection into a state of sin subsequently passed down from parents to children, the root cause of every conceivable ill on earth, from tyranny to taxes to the fine print in your cell phone contract.\n\nSo my classmate and I were having lunch talking about this story and I mentioned casually the “fall” of humanity.\n\n“The what?”\n\n“The fall of humanity. You know, Adam and Eve’s sin plunged all subsequent humanity into a state of alienation from God.”\n\n“Never heard of it.”\n\n“Really? That’s odd, since it’s so obvious.”\n\n“No it’s not. The story nowhere says what you just said it says.”\n\n“Well then what do you make of Satan tempting Eve with the forbidden fruit….”\n\n“Who?”\n\n“What do you mean ‘who?’”\n\n“Satan? There’s no Satan in the story. There’s a serpent, just a serpent. He’s called the most ‘crafty’ of the creatures that God had put into the garden. He’s a serpent. A crafty creature. That’s what the text says.”\n\n“But the serpent is talking.”\n\n“Because it’s a story.”\n\nIt came as a bit of a shock to me that what I thought I “knew” the story of Adam and Eve was about wasn’t really “in” the story itself, but how I had been taught to interpret the story. The dominant Christian reading is rooted in the apostle Paul, in the book of Romans, where Paul seems to place at Adam’s feet (not Eve’s, curiously) the blame for human misery.\n\nMany Christians have understood Paul this way, and by “many” I mean more or less the entire tradition of western Christianity, especially as it has been steered through the influence of Augustine, the fourth century CE Church Father and his rather disastrous reading of Romans 5:12. (You can get the gist of Augustine’s mistake here .)\n\nAugustine concluded that all humanity sinned “in” Adam, and that state of sinfulness was passed on biologically (through sex) to their children (which is why Cain killed Abel), and so on and so on. (See more here .)\n\nThis post isn’t about original sin. It’s just happened to be the topic of our lunch conversation. My point here is that my Jewish classmate–who knew his Bible, in Hebrew, backwards and forwards–didn’t get.\n\nJewish theology doesn’t depend on Augustine (or Paul), and so they read the story differently. Rather than being born in sin because of something Adam did, humanity has an “evil inclination,” meaning humans are, for whatever reason, prone to disobey God.\n\nThat’s why Adam and Eve disobeyed God in the first place (before there was a “fall”), Cain followed his father’s pattern, and on and on all the way to story of the Flood, which is where the problem is explained and the reason for the Flood is given: The Lord saw that the wickedness of humankind was great on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually. (Gen 6:5)\n\nIn the years that followed, I’ve come back to that moment and perceived its importance.\n\nAll it took to rock my certainty about what what I “knew” the Bible “says” was one lunch with someone who, like me, was committed to understanding his scripture but who didn’t think like me and took a moment to point out what the Bible says.\n\nIt got me thinking: I wonder how much else I think I know about the Bible might be less what I actually read in the Bible and more what I bring to it?\n\nA key factor in my own growth as a Christian is something that wasn’t even on my radar screen during seminary or when I began my doctoral work: hearing Jewish voices talk about their Bible.",
  "latent_32021": "Some short-sighted individuals will point out that these programming techniques, while certainly laudable for their increased clarity and efficiency, would fail on compiled code. Sadly, this is true. At least two of the above techniques will send most compilers into an infinite loop.

This is but another case of the compiler failing to preserve semantic correctness.

Their debates reflect the best of our democracy with its encouragement of a respectful exchange of ideas.\n\nWe cannot say the same about the Republicans.\n\nThe GOP candidates’ anti-immigrant hysteria, religious zealotry, sexism and misogyny, saber rattling, authoritarianism, support of tax breaks for the wealthy and crude personal attacks are a big turnoffs. We feel the election of billionaire Donald Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz would be a disaster at home and abroad.\n\nOur national union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and DC 37 have worked closely with Clinton for decades. When she was first lady in Washington, D.C., Clinton welcomed AFSCME’s input as she led the effort to develop the Clinton administration’s health-care plan.\n\nAs senator, Clinton supported key issues of concern to DC 37 members and poor and middle-class New Yorkers.\n\nAfter the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, Clinton pressed the Bush administration to commit $20 billion to rebuild Ground Zero and the surrounding area. She made sure the federal government provided the necessary funds for the health care of the first responders and workers assigned to the cleanup.\n\nClinton has championed children’s and women’s issues since she finished her higher education at Wellesley College and Yale Law School. After her graduation from Yale, she chose not to go to work at an elite law firm but instead sought a job at the Children’s Defense Fund.\n\nShe later served as a lawyer on a Congressional subcommittee investigating President Richard Nixon’s involvement in the Watergate scandal, which forced him to resign from office.\n\nAs the first lady in Arkansas, she worked on improving health care and education. Before her husband became governor, she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people.\n\nAfter the 2008 financial meltdown, Clinton supported reforms to curb banking practices that were at the root of the financial and housing crises. The reforms require banks to hold more assets as a cushion against failure, allow the government to break up big banks that pose a risk to the financial system, and provide consumer protections, including steps against predatory mortgage lending.\n\nClinton is a progressive on economic issues and public policies that are important to union members. She is in favor of:\n\n● reducing the interest charged to college students and investing $350 billion so they do not have to pay tuition at public colleges in their states;\n\n● raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour while backing state and city efforts to boost the minimum wage to $15 an hour;\n\n● closing the “carried interest” tax loophole, which allows hedge fund managers to have investment earnings taxed at a lower rate than that of ordinary income, and\n\n● increasing government investment in infrastructure and scientific research.\n\nBelieving that raising the income of workers is the defining economic challenge facing the nation, Clinton will address the growing class divide in the United States. She believes in a government that dedicates its efforts to improve the lives of working families.\n\nA vote for the candidate who would be the first woman to lead our country is a vote for a better future. In the Democratic primary on April 19, we hope New York voters help secure Clinton’s nomination for president of the United States.\n\nThis editorial is from the April issue of Public Employee Press, DC 37 official publication.",
  "latent_32717": "Rove: GOP infighting 'a sad sight to see' David Edwards and Andrew McLemore\n\nPublished: Sunday October 26, 2008\n\nPrint This Email This Republican strategist Karl Rove bemoaned finger-pointing within the GOP as the McCain campaign continues to fall behind in the polls, calling it a \"sad sight to see.\"\n\nSpeaking with Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday, Rove said the problem lies with politicians who lose confidence \"before the decision is made.\"\n\n\"It is a sign of undisciplined people who do not have the loyalty they ought to have to the candidate whom they are serving,\" Rove said. \"Nobody makes themselves look good in this process.\"\n\nHe admitted when prodded by Matthews that infighting usually spells a losing campaign, but criticized an article in Sunday's New York Times Magazine, which detailed the dissidence among McCain aides that has drawn media attention.\n\nRove said he \"was appalled by the personal attacks\" he claimed the article made against McCain's chief campaign strategist Steve Schmidt.\n\nThe magazine depicted Schmidt, an acknowledged protégé of the Rove-style campaigning associated with the Swift Boat attacks against John Kerry in 2004, as largely responsible for the biggest gaffes of the McCain campaign.\n\nThe following is an excerpt from the article.\n\n###\n\nDiscussion carried on into the afternoon at the Morgan Library and Museum as McCain prepared for the first presidential debate. Schmidt pushed for going all in: suspending the campaign, recommending that the first debate be postponed, parachuting into Washington and forging a legislative solution to the financial crisis for which McCain could then claim credit. Exactly how McCain could convincingly play a sober bipartisan problem-solver after spending the previous few weeks garbed as a populist truth teller was anything but clear. But Schmidt and others convinced McCain that it was worth the gamble.\n\n###\n\nWhen asked by Wallace about recent accusations from McCain aides that Sarah Palin is a \"diva\" who has \"gone rogue,\" Rove said campaign aides have \"enormous respect for her abilities.\"\n\n\"We got two people that I know inside the McCain campaign who are not throwing in the towel,\" Rove said, referring to McCain and Palin. \"Both of them energetically out there on the campaign and this is what is going to really matter in the next ten days, not what staffers are trying to cover themselves with.\"\n\nThis video is from Fox's Fox News Sunday, broadcast October 26, 2008.\n\nDownload video via RawReplay.com"
