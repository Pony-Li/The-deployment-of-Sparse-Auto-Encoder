Were they an indication of a scary economic slowdown, or just that after more than 5Â½ straight years of monthly gains, there simply remains very little slack left in a jobs market that has 12.8 million new hires since the Great Recession ended?\n\nData on worker availability and supply going back to 1975 suggest that the employment situation is still a distance from topping, Goldman economist David Mericle said in a note to clients.\n\n\"Labor market tightening cannot explain away the weak May payrolls print, which instead appears to mostly reflect a month of weaker labor demand,\" Mericle wrote.\n\nAssessing the progress of the U.S. labor market is difficult because of cross currents: The headline unemployment rate that the government emphasizes fell in May to 4.7 percent, which Goldman considers a reflection of full employment.",
  "latent_110": "Announced on November 13 2013, the Moto G is the lower-cost variant of the Moto X. Do not make the mistake of benchmarking the Moto G in comparison to the Moto X, because the Moto G is one of the firmest performing mid-range smartphone on the market. I'd go so far as labelling the Moto G as 'the handset to beat' in 2014 for many manufacturers looking to ship a handset in the sub $200 price range. It's that good.\n\nAt the press launch, Motorola pitched the smartphone at developing markets. It was initially available in Latin America, with Central Europe and North America quickly following. The lower cost of this smartphone makes it attractive as a budget conscious pay monthly handset, and has many merits for Prepaid plans. I don't think it's fair to count the Moto G as a low-cost handset - with US pricing at $179 for the SIM free 8 GB handset the Moto G is better pitched as the lowest cost mid-range handset.\n\nWhen Motorola releases a Moto that hits the $99 mark, that's when the Google owned company will have a low-cost handset than can be compared to handsets such as Nokia's Lumia 520. I say this not to minimise the impact of the current price-tag (the Moto G undercuts Google's Nexus 5 and the pricing of the now discontinued Nexus 4), but to place the Moto G in the correct price banding in the smartphone.\n\nThat said, the Moto G passes the 'good enough' test for me with flying colours. The tasks and functions that I would consider core features of a smartphone (social media interaction, PIM functionality, connectivity, and peripheral support) are all achievable with ease on the Moto G's hardware. While a close examination of graphically intensive games (such as Real Racing 3) may not be as smooth as they are on high-end handsets such as the HTC One or the Samsung Galaxy S4, the majority of puzzle and action games that make up the bulk of the Google Play store all run happily without lagging or skipping frames.\n\nIf you are looking for a handset that has power without spending too much money (either buying it SIM free or keeping your monthly contract payments low) then the Moto G deserves to be at the top of your list. I'm about to go through the Moto G, pointing out omissions, compromises, and the occasional flaw, but every device that aims low in terms of price will have similar issues to deal with. How a manufacturer deals with these issues determines how good a device they have on sale.\n\nThe Moto G is one of the best devices I have used in this price range, and Motorola has balanced the required compromises very well. That said, let's looks at those compromises.\n\nThe handset does not support 4G LTE, so your mobile data transfer will be limited to 2G/3G. Given the focus on developing markets this makes sense for the design both from the capabilities required in the target market, but also to keep the bill of materials lower. While 4G is nice to have, email, IM, and web browsing are all still acceptable over 3G at the moment, but that might not be the case in a year's time if the Moto G is still on sale.\n\nThe lack of any microSD expansion is the biggest limiting factor of the Moto G. Available in both 8 GB and 16 GB storage variants, the memory you have in the box is all you'll ever have with this handset. Once you add your personal data and a few key apps, the 8 GB model (which I have been using for this review) has 3 GB available for storage. I'm using the streaming option of Google Play for my music and just adding in the occasional album for travelling, but if I was to download ten albums to the handset, that's almost half of my remaining storage gone.\n\nI would be comfortable with an 8 GB device if it had an SD card for extra storage. As it stands I would be wary of purchasing the 8 GB Moto G, and the increased capacity on the 16 GB model would need to be carefully managed. It's all well and good advertising cloud services (such as Google Music and Google Drive) as an alternative to on-device storage, but that means a big data pipe and consistent access. With the best will in the world that's not 3G, and I doubt that the data plans associated with the Moto G will be suitable for extensive use of the cloud over a cellular data connection.\n\nOtherwise the Moto G feels like a well specced handset from late 2012 that can still deliver when you ask it to. The 'off the shelf' Snapdragon 400 system on chip sports a 1.2 GHz quad-core CPU and an Adreno 305 as the GPU, both supported by 1 GB of RAM (although this is likely the last wave of mid-range devices where just a single gigabyte of RAM will be cool). The visible but not user-replaceable battery has a capacity of 2070 mAh and coupled with the latest version of Android (KitKat 4.4.2) the Moto G will easily last through a working day, and well into a second day. With careful use of connectivity, the Moto G will run for two days between charges if you need it to be stretched.\n\nOne of the main elements that makes the Moto G feel a more competent device than others in this price range is the screen. It's a 4.5 inch LCD screen, and running at 720p resolution gives a density of 326 pixels per inch. That would have been flagship territory just over a year ago. LCD requires constant backlighting so the blacks are not as black as you might see on other screen display types, dropping the contrast levels very slightly, but this is a well-engineered screen. I feel the screen is actually better than the price of the Moto G suggests it will be.\n\nBy going with a 4.5 inch screen, the extra tenths over the more expected 4.3 inch screen at this price give the Moto G a much more luxurious feel. This is helped by the narrower bezels all round the device. By sloping the sides of the device away from the screen the waist of the device is visibly wider when looking directly down on the screen, but the illusion is complete. It also makes the handset feel very comfortable in the hand with the soft blown curves of the back of the handset creating a pleasing shape.\n\nThe Moto G feels right and when you are in the lower price ranges that feel in your hand, especially in the first moments in the store when deciding on a device, is an important area to get right. I also love the dimple on the rear of the handset where the winged Motorola icon can be found - it's in just the right location for my index finger to rest in when using the Moto G one-handed, adding a feel of security when walking with the smartphone.\n\nThe Moto G is still a mostly plastic unit, with nothing fancy on the removable back cover beyond the dimple of the logo. While Motorola does not have the custom Moto Maker facility to fashion your own colour combination at the factory door as they do with the Moto X, there is a colourful range of back covers you can buy to customise your Moto G.\n\nThe impression of quality comes from the shape, not the materials used. It feels like every other plastic smartphone on the market, although the interaction with the screen is helped by a layer of Corning's Gorilla Glass 3, and a bright notification LED at the top of the smartphone has just the right level of intensity to alert you without being a distraction if you want to ignore it.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the two camera units on the Moto G are nowhere close to stunning. More than any other of a smartphones, picture quality seems directly tied to the price point. With 1.3 MP front facing camera, and a 5 MP camera to the rear, the Moto G delivers acceptable levels of image performance. You're not going to be looking for studio quality out of a sub $200 device, but be aware the Moto G images are not as sharp as some of the more advanced smartphones, and low light performance is good for memories, but not really for publication. Shot to shot time is slow, but it's on the right side of acceptable as well.\n\nWhat is fun in the Moto G is the camera interface. It brings over the same 'ring based' menu from the Moto X which slides in from the left side of the screen. Spin it around to see all the options, and tap them to bring up the options on-screen. It's very much one-handed (one-thumbed even) and it's both simple to understand and fast to use. With no camera button, a single tap on the screen sets the focus point and takes the picture. Hold your finger on the screen and you get a sequential capture mode, good for taking in a scene of action and allowing you to pick out the best picture at your leisure.\n\nVideo recording is at the same 720p resolution as the screen. Given the specs of the device 1080p might just be too many pixels to throw around the chipset, but even at 720p resolution that's more than enough to capture memories and shoot video for social media, YouTube and personal memories. I like the touch that tapping pin the screen while recording a video takes a picture of that moment without interrupting the video.\n\nMuch like the rest of the handset, the Moto G is as good as it gets in the Android world for this price, but if you're placing a premium on your photography, you might be better off looking at a handset like the Nokia Lumia 720 which has a far better optical output for a similar price.\n\nAudio quality on the external speaker is slightly better than normal for this price range of device. Just like the screen, the camera, and the processor, the Moto G is batting slightly ahead of the average audio quality. The 3.5 mm stereo jack is centrally located on the top of the device and I've no issues with sound reproduction (beyond the usual notes of MP3 compression on music). Sound quality during calls is helped with a dual-microphone layout, with the mic at the bottom of the handset taking your voice and the mic at the top used to aid noise cancellation. The slower processor probably contributes to the lower performance when compared to the Moto X, but again, it's well within expectations for a mid-range handset.\n\nMy review handset of the Moto G asked to update itself over-the-air to Android 4.4.2 as I unpacked it, which I was happy to let it do. Maybe a fifteen minute operation after the package was downloaded, the update was painless and the test data added to the Moto G before I started the process remained intact.\n\nThe Moto G is as close to stock Android as you will get outside of the Nexus devices. The UI is the usual mix of blue highlights, black dialog backgrounds and white text. Unlike the Nexus devices, even though Motorola is 'a Google company' it still has to follow the availability of Android to OEMs and parts suppliers. 4.4.2 should be rolling out to all Moto G units this month.\n\nSome applications have been added, and as noted above Motorola have replaced the stock camera app with their own app and interface. Also making an appearance in the app suite is Assist (a scheduling app so you can set up when alert profiles can be activated, so you get a quiet ring at night, silence during meetings, and very loud alerts during your commute if that's what you wish) and Motorola Migrate (to help you move data from another Android or iOS device into the Moto G).\n\nOtherwise Motorola has not loaded up the Moto G with any extra fluff to try and sell the device via software tweaks. That's not the point of this handset, the point is to deliver a great Android experience at a very affordable price. The Moto G easily meets that goal.\n\nThe only concern I might have is the Snapdragon 400 paired up with 1 GB of RAM. This combination works in the current ecosystem but as applications for Android improve over the next two years (a typical contract length), the specs of the Moto G will lead to memory and processor constraints on first and third-party apps. Having multiple tabs open in the current Chrome browser does result in the occasional black screen while the rendering engine works away in the background to update the pages. It's something that could be overlooked given the price, but I wonder where the specifications will leave the Moto G as 2015 draws to a close? The handset feels well placed in the market right now, but there does not seem to be much thought to future-proofing the device.\n\nMotorola has made the correct compromise in almost ever major area to build the Moto G. The only eyebrow raising moment I have is the decision to ship an 8 GB variant. The $20 saving to get an 8GB machine is false economy and will cause issues very quickly for all except the lightest Android user.\n\nNevertheless, I've no hesitation in recommending the 16 GB handset at $199 SIM free. Truth be told this feels like a $249 smartphone, so congratulations to Motorola on cutting the price by 20% on my expectation. It delivers a little bit more in every area than you would assume, it feels good in the hand, and it has enough style to stand up against the boring black box of many handsets at this price.",
  "latent_141": "A Louisiana police officer was fired on Wednesday after a photo of him giving a Nazi salute at a rally in North Carolina surfaced on Facebook, according to Acadiana news station KATC.\n\nThe Lake Arthur council on Wednesday voted unanimously to fire Raymond Mott, who is pictured on the far left wearing what appears to be KKK insignias.

  "latent_212": "Recognition of Women In Indie Music\n\nMollie Blocked Unblock Follow Following Sep 8, 2016\n\nSt. Vincent. Grimes. Courtney Barnett. FKA twigs. Lauren Mayberry (CHVRCHES). Mitski. Romy Madley Croft (the xx). Caroline Polachek (Chairlift). HAIM. Ellie Rowsell (Wolf Alice). Bat for Lashes. Megan James (Purity Ring). Empress Of. Frankie Cosmos. Beth Gibbons (Portishead).\n\nThese are just a select few of the many artists that come to mind when I think of âwomen in indie music.â Yet, when I do a simple Google search for âindie artists,â this is what I get:\n\nTogether, these band and artist names represent 76 band members in total (counting both current and past members, but not âcollaboratorsâ). Of those 76, 4 band members are women. The casual music listener may never know a single one of these groups features a woman.\n\nOf course, itâs important to remember that Google results are personalized based on who you are, what youâve searched for, etc. Yet, as someone who has a tattoo inspired by Grimes, a Spotify playlist dedicated to all of St. Vincentâs (solo) work, and a penchant for the music of all of the female artists listed above, you would think that Googleâs personalized results for my indie inquiry would be a little more, well, female. There are plenty of female indie artists who could have popped up in the results of that search, but they didnât. Even when I performed this same search on my work computer in addition to my personal, I received the same results in the same order.\n\nI listen to a lot of music â not as much as I want to, but still, I like to think that I listen to more music than the average person. My tastes vary, but generally my interests fall under the category of indie. What indie music means is a conversation for a different day, and one that I, frankly, donât care that much about. My approach to indie music is the same as Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewartâs approach to pornography â I know it when I sÌ¶eÌ¶eÌ¶hear it.\n\nI also happen to be a feminist who recognizes that, in a lot of industries, women are underrepresented. So, naturally, I unconsciously assumed that was the same for the indie music industry.\n\nExcept it canât be, because, as I recently realized, I can name so many female artists and women-fronted bands whose music qualifies as indie. After doing some research, it occurred to me that the major problem present in the indie community isnât necessarily about undervaluing or underrepresenting women in the industry, but rather, about under-recognizing women.\n\nFor example, music journalism website Pitchfork (which, despite its frequent poptimism and hip hop features, focuses primarily on indie music news and reviews) has no problem awarding female artists high honors for their contributions to indie music. Just this year, Pitchfork has awarded âBest New Musicâ to several women or women-fronted acts â Jamila Woods, Mitski, White Lung, Anohni, Beyonce, Frankie Cosmos, etc. Back in 2014, they also named Grimesâ âOblivionâ the best track of the decade so far; Grimesâ track beat out those of revered artists like Kanye West, M83, Kendrick Lamar, and Frank Ocean. When Pitchfork recognizes women, they have no reservations giving them high marks.\n\nBut thatâs only when Pitchfork recognizes women. Of the 36 albums that have been recognized as âBest New Musicâ this year, only 13 are the works of women or groups with women in them. And if you look at the siteâs â50 Best Albums of 20__â lists for the past five years, youâll see comparable results:\n\nFemale artists make up just 32% of the artists recognized in these lists over the past 5 years, and 0% of artists who make up the number one spot over the same time period (Grimesâ Art Angels and Fiona Appleâs The Idler Wheelâ¦ were 3rd in 2015 and 2012 respectively; FKA twigsâ LP1 was 2nd in 2014). In fact, Pitchfork last gave the #1 spot to a group with a woman in it in 2006, when they awarded it to The Knifeâs Silent Shout. The only other women to have ever seen the #1 spot were RÃ©gine Chassagne of Arcade Fire for Funeral in 2004 (Sarah Neufeld did not join the group until 2006) and Khaela Maricich and Jenn-Kliese of The Microphones for The Glow Pt. 2 in 2001. A solo female artist or female-fronted group has never been featured in the #1 spot.\n\nThe point of this is not to shit all over Pitchfork â though if youâre looking for a place on the internet to do that, I know of a few. Whatever you think of the self-proclaimed âMost Trusted Voice in Music,â it is certainly not the only place out there where women in indie lack recognition.\n\nYou may be thinking that this isnât necessarily a problem for women in indie music rather than simply a problem for women in the music industry as a whole. I wondered that too, so I consulted the Billboard Top 20 Alternative Songs list (the closest to an âindieâ list on Billboard) as well as the siteâs Hot 100. To see if there was a noticeable difference in recognition of female artists depending on the genre (the Hot 100 typically contains the biggest pop hits of the moment), I compared the presence of women in top 20 songs of the Hot 100 with the Top 20 Alternative Songs list. Because Billboardâs charts tend to be fairly repetitive from week-to-week, I decided to include one list every four months for the past 5 years.\n\nThe difference is staggering. In 9 of the 17 instances, songs by or featuring women were either half or more than half of the Hot 100âs top 20 songs, while songs by female artists or groups including women never even make up half of the Top 20 Alternative Songs list. Some of this could be attributed to the common trend of male producers like Calvin Harris and Pitbull partnering with female singers for huge hits (I Need Your Love ft. Ellie Goulding; Timber ft. Kesha), but it still means that you are far more likely to hear a womanâs voice when you turn on a pop station than if you did an alternative station.\n\nObviously this is not a conscious act on Billboardâs part â they simply organize the charts based on Nielsen Musicâs detection of the most popular songs according to radio airplay each week. But the fact that indie music with women in it receives less airplay and attention than music that doesnât include women, combined with the fact that Pitchforkâs year-end best albums so rarely feature women, communicates that the indie music community is primarily a space for men.\n\nWith this in mind, I headed to Spotifyâs âGenres & Moodsâ section and looked at the content included in the âIndieâ category. I first scrolled down to see who they listed as âIndie Kids: A mix of defining artists that create music meant for their moment.â Not to diss Spotify (though again, I know plenty of places on the internet where you can do that), but I donât think they could have made that description more vague. However, from their use of the term âdefining,â I will assume that they mean these are the quintessential indie artists to know if you have interest in expanding your knowledge of the genre. Who are these indie-defining artists?\n\nThe above screenshot does not show all of the artists included.\n\nOf Spotifyâs 33 âIndie Kids,â 12 are women or groups including women. As I previously alluded to, the casual listener may not realize that Arcade Fire includes RÃ©gine Chassagne or, at various points, Sarah Neufeld, or that Lisa Molinaro is a member of Modest Mouse. Based on this small sample size, however, I canât say that Spotify tends to see indie music as a manâs space â not yet, anyway. I next took a look at the presence of women within four Spotify playlists in the indie section: âUltimate Indie,â âAlternative Beats,â âEssential Indie,â and âTotally Alternative.â\n\nâUltimate Indieâ was the first playlist I looked at, and as such it raised my hopes that the other playlists would similarly represent female artists or groups including women. As you can see, this was not the case. Something that I found particularly interesting was the âEssential Indieâ list â such a name tells its listeners that these are the artists that they have to listen to if they want to get to know the indie music scene. In giving that name to a playlist where only 39% of the songs are by women or groups including women, is Spotify telling its users that female indie artists are simplyâ¦less essential?\n\nLastly, I decided to check out the gender makeup of performers at music festivals. I recognize that not all music festivals are for strictly âindieâ artists, but this past yearâs festival season has seen lineups that seem intended to draw an indie crowd, what with the return of LCD Soundsystem and prominence of headliners like Radiohead and Arcade Fire. Additionally, there tend to be a lot of smaller indie acts featured in the undercard of festival lineups, which serve to balance out more mainstream acts like Sia and Major Lazer. In any case, hereâs what I found:\n\nFrom this (admittedly pretty small and 100% American) sample, it seems that music festivals follow the same pattern as the rest of the sources I looked at. Firefly is particularly egregious, with only 23% of its acts being women or groups with women in them. Panorama proved to be the most inclusive, with 37% women.\n\nSo what does all of this mean? Maybe there simply arenât enough female indie acts out there to make up 50% of all Pitchfork best-of lists, festival lineups, or Spotify playlists. Given the subjectivity of the term âindieâ and the millions of obscure but viable groups and artists that exist, it would be near impossible to quantify the true female makeup of the indie genre â but still, I highly doubt there arenât enough female musicians to go around. Rather, I would argue that women in indie music are treated and regarded differently than their male counterparts.\n\nAnd itâs a problem. If an aspiring female musician Googles âindie artistsâ and sees none of the first results look like her, what is she to think? If she is a singer and listens to a Spotify playlist of âindie essentials,â then hears far less female voices than male, how is she to feel? If she has dreams of playing guitar or the drums on a big stage, but then attends a music festival and sees largely men in those roles, what does that say of her chances, of her place, of her worth?\n\nNow, keep in mind that I am not a statistician, data analyst, or feminist scholar (oh, but I can dream). I recognize that all of the above may not be statistically significant or that my sample sizes may not be adequate. I also understand that this lack of recognition for female artists is likely not only an indie music problem â I would not be surprised if I found similar results when doing a study on country music or hip hop. Additionally, I feel it important to mention that I assumed the gender identities of each musician based on a binary concept of gender unless I found a source that stated otherwise (the only case of this being that of Eliot Sumner).\n\nPotential flaws aside, I do believe these results demonstrate a noticeable disparity in the indie music communityâs recognition of female artists. I canât say with any certainty whether or not this is a conscious decision by outlets like Pitchfork and Spotify, but if I had to guess I would say itâs more likely a result of unconscious biases and implicit attitudes about female talent. But since such gender biases are rampant not just for female musicianship, but for arguably everything, I wouldnât get your pitchforks (heh) out at this point. Instead, itâs important to point out these kinds of disparities when we see them, and to work against our own implicit biases in the interest of inclusion and recognition for musicians, regardless of gender.",
  "latent_232": "What in the name of Zeus does the GOP think itâs going to achieve by bargaining with Barack Obama and his socialist posse? Instead of pretending we have much in common, why donât the Republicans get a clue and listen to the results of the last election, and heed Conservatismâand allow liberals to keep listening to Prozac ? It is time to use the ancient Roman act of Damnatio Memoriae, or public condemnation, to bury old Barack along with all his self-indulgent and imbecilic decisions. The following article explores this option.\n\nI. Roman Damnatio MemoriaeâAct of Permanent Political Removal\n\nThe phrase âDamnatio Memoriaeâ means âposthumous denigration.â It is a Latin phrase which loosely translates to historical censure, or to be blotted from the official record. The Romans did this punishment to the emperors they considered to be truly abysmal and worthy of the worst ends. This execration was more lowly than death because of the high esteem Romans paid to fame and immortality achieved through noble deeds. Egyptians also practiced a similar kind of posthumous denigration, as well as the Holy Roman Church. The USSR also practiced this art with great vigor.\n\nClassicist N.S. Gill writes about this practice,\n\nThe Latin term damnatio memoriae âcondemnation of the memoryâ is modern, but is used to describe a variety of ancient Roman processes dealing with individuals judged unfit to be members of a community. Such undesirables include traitors, would-be tyrants, and individuals who were enemies of Rome, according to Harriet I. Flowers. This posthumous dishonor was considered the worst that could be done to a former senator.\n\nThis act was done by an official vote of the senate, or also unofficially by another emperorâs whim, and then fulfilled through every manner available. For the person posthumously denigrated, their statues would be destroyed or defaced, their coinage melted down, paintings desecrated, inscriptions from across the Empire defiled, and their name blotted out of historical records.\n\nGill continues,\n\nActs subsumed under the rubric of âdamnatio memoriaeâ include scratching names and titles from inscriptions, defacing likenesses, banning the condemnedsâ wax masks from funerals, confiscation and destruction of the condemned man or womanâs writing, annulling of wills, marking the birthday of the condemned as a day of ill-omen, marking the anniversary of the condemnedâs death with thanksgiving, mutilation of corpses, and more. The condemnations could be started by the Senate, the emperor, or the army.\n\nEmperors who were historically blotted from the official record included Caligula and Nero.\n\nThis historical scrubbing of figures out of the public record was done by the USSR, not surprisingly. If a politician or military figure fell out with Stalin, or another leader, he could be totally removed from every photograph or official record. This then happened to Stalin himself, and Leninâwho had their statutes removed from many public places.\n\nA very recent example of this type of historical censure have been seen in Canada where the top Canadian military commander, Colonel Russell Williams, was found guilty of murdering two women, and abusing 88 others. The Canadian military decided not to simply recycle his old uniforms but to burn them so as to never be worn by any other member. His crimes were of a sexual fetishist nature, bringing great shame upon the military.\n\nII. Purpose of Historical Erasure\n\nWhy was this historical censure done upon Roman emperors, the most powerful men in the ancient world? Classical Rome was a place which took great pride in doing things the right way. Public service, and especially elected office, was considered the high point of Roman existence, before the Empire was established. But to do things the wrong way was shameful and society felt a need to publicly address these evil deeds. Damnatio Memoriae was officially established after the Republic ended, but the idea behind it was in keeping with republican principles. The theory was that no scoundrel or criminal should be honored by history who attacks the very country which gives him fame, honor and sustenance. So let it be for Obama.\n\nIII. Damnatio Memoriae of Obama: Ten Criteria\n\nPrincipled reasons for canceling and reversing Obama legislation ought be done on the following grounds:\n\nFirst, those decisions made against our Declaration and Constitution and laws.\n\nSecond, those choices made in opposition to the obvious will of the people, since our Declaration condemns this practice: âGovernments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governedâ¦â\n\nThird, acts which clearly go against the best interest of all Americans.\n\nFourth, choices aiding foreign governments at the cost of America or her allies.\n\nFifth, commands which elevate Islam over other religions. Letâs not forget we are at war with its radicals.\n\nSixth, acts which are simply unpatriotic.\n\nSeventh, legislation which undermines our capitalist form of economy.\n\nEighth, choices that harm our armed services.\n\nNinth, declarations or acts that denigrate America.\n\nTenth, legislation which weaken Americaâs sovereignty in the interest of world bodies.\n\nFollowing is a truncated list of laws and decisions by Obama & Administration that ought be stricken from the record. Plea feel free to add to this short number, as there are hundreds more.\n\nObamacare\n\nA large majority want this bill completely eviscerated. It is unconstitutional and will badly damage the quality and access of American healthcare. A shocking 74% of doctors may quit medicine because of it.\n\nTARP\n\nTARP was an unconstitutional taking of American funds, arbitrarily given to businesses without any accountability.\n\nDetroit Bailout\n\nDetroit car maker bailout was an illegal buying of private businesses with public funds which created de facto socialist results.\n\nStimulus\n\nThe Stimulus bill was wasted funds not even invested in infrastructure, but doled out as tasty pork medallions to countless Democratic constituents, while a trillion dollars drain from our money supply.\n\nGlobal Warming\n\nDespite the science behind this idea being utterly exposed as fraudulent, Obama resolutely still attempts to address it legally. He might as well demand laws to protect Little Bo Peep, while heâs at it.\n\nCap & Trade\n\nThis legislation would wildly prune Americaâs economy, done in the name of an already failed Global Warming theory.

Good Effects of Obamaâs Historical Public Damnation\n\nWe cannot wipe out anyoneâs existence in the US like was done in ancient Rome, or during the communist regime of the USSR. But we can decisively repudiate the lawless reign of tin-horn tyrant Barack Obama by canceling all of his horrible legislation.\n\nBut is this really necessary, anyway? Wasnât Obama chastened by the last election results? In a word, No! Contraâbecause, at some levelâto save the standards in this country, a public repudiation must be done in some manner, to reestablish democracy, capitalism, the Bill of Rights, and American sovereignty. In other words, teaching future would-be tyrants that America is the land of the free and home of the brave; not the place of brainless imposters who would be depots, is a lesson we desperately need to establish today.\n\nV. Condemning Obamaâs Particular Sins\n\nIn particular, the Obama legacy must be challenged, including running a campaign that received hundreds of millions in anonymous global funds over the Internet, a tawdry fact never investigated. Campaign irregularities involving ACORN were also observed across the US, some of which helped catapult Al Franken into office for Barackâs supermajority, used for Obamacare. Obama also employed a remarkable barrage of lies to help himself enter office, Chicago style.\n\nBarack must also be condemned for his insipid âCabinet,â a staff of leftist toadies nearly as incompetent as he. Elfish Tim Geithner is a prime example, as well as the rodent-like and spectacularly condescending David Axelgrease. Add ham-fisted media-bear spokesperson Bobby Gibbs, and Rahm âRam-Beauâ Emanuel, ballet student turned politician. All of these come to mind as outlandish misfits. Too bad town square stockades and public floggings are out of style.\n\nThree major flaws of Obamaâs present themselves when considering a need for public censure of this colossal misfit: Honesty, Competence and Orientation. First, Barack has such a problem telling the truth that at some point we must suspect he probably doesnât understand the concept, for starters. For this he needs psychiatric evaluation.\n\nSecond, in no possible universe does Barack even begin to measure up to the most basic level of competence for his role as leader. So the 900 pound donkey in the room isâWhy did Obama even decide to run for president? Even he admitted he was utterly unqualified by reason of education and experience. Not only was Obama unfit to lead when electedâdoesnât it seem like he has actually devolved since his ascension? Itâs time to put down the golf bag and basketball and start studying world history, economics, American constitutional development, and many other subjects for this lazy vagabond of a POTUS.\n\nThe most worrisome aspect of Obamaâs worldview, believe it or not, is not his dishonesty or incompetenceâbut his political orientation. Why does everything have to be leftism, socialism or communism to slake his avaricious leadership style? Heâs like a robot programmed by Marx, used to deliver pamphlets for the ACLU.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nLetâs throw Obama out of office and begin the enjoyable task of a total repudiation of his Marxist agenda. If anything will get the attention of progressive Americans who are bizarrely trying to torpedo their own ship, this action will do the trick.\n\nEvery one of the above bad laws and decisions was fomented by obdurate Obama, either through ignorance, ill-will, or red-eyed Marxist fervor. There are so many bad decisions by Barack, and so few good, he cannot simply be treated as another failed leftist president. He must be singled out as almost uniquely wicked, publicly condemned and shamed into permanent exile. Otherwise, how else will our children learn to oppose misuse of public offices and funds, while detesting smooth liars?\n\nPublicly condemning Obama is no different than any other kind of calling out wickedly unacceptable public behavior. Barack needs to be disciplined and put in his place just like the bully on the block collecting other kidâs lunch money. Unless the bad politicians of America see Obama put in his place decisively after his giant folly, it will only embolden them, and then we truly will have hell to pay.",
  "latent_425": "If you want to get rich in journalism, one wayâmaybe the only wayâis to host droning conferences and symposiums to debate the fate of the news industry. Thatâs where the fat money in the news business is. Just launch another roundtable and let the Cassandras, Thomas Malthus acolytes and Chicken Littles have at it.\n\nThen hold a panel discussion about how to monetize the news. To make sure you draw a crowd, bring Spiro Agnew back from the dead as your keynote speaker so the bribe-taking Nixon sycophant can explain why we need more happy news, and how itâs the investigative reporters, those ânattering nabobs of negativism,â who are driving the decline of the news business.\n\nThe fact is that nobody knows where the hell to find the profits to pay for increasingly rare kick-ass investigative reporting in a state as perpetually crooked and underreported as Texas.\n\nThe Texas Tribune has its model: Take donations from as many folks as possible and profess editorial independence from all of them. The Texas Observer scrambles from year to year relying on the wallets of liberals who like the magazineâs missionâor personally liked Molly Ivins enough to help keep the publication she once edited afloat. (You can tell from the magazine in your hands that it sure ainât relying on advertisers.)\n\nBut bless us all, no newspaper has experimented more, tinkered more, or thought about survival in a big, public way more than The Dallas Morning News. Dallasâ daily remains the agenda-setting news organization in the state, and repeatedly changes direction in an ongoing attempt to stay financially afloat in this age of News 2.0.\n\nHereâs more proof: The paper just quietly announced that it is abandoning a radical strategy it started in early 2011 with the erection of a paid firewall between customers and digital content. In that failed strategyâs place comes a new experiment; this one entails giving away the paperâs news for free, but charging customers extra for a âpremium digital experience.â\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nThe Dallas Morning News, which is studied by every newspaper executive in America (while its stories are read and aped by most mainstream reporters in Texas), will now charge extra for âpremiumâ content, which amounts to a multimedia-driven collage of extras including links and interactive material and advance notice of upcoming events. Itâs like charging only for dessert, if the dessert is eye candy: some infographic appetizers, a side of salted social media, a flight of multimedia âexperiences.â\n\nIn short, youâll be able to go to the paperâs site and choose the free news option, or the visually enhanced option for $11.96 a month. Itâs a model that The Washington Post has also been toying with.\n\nDallasâ daily has experimented before. The most horrific example was an abysmal failure called âThe CueCat.â Basically, the paper distributed scanners that readers were supposed to wave over the printed paper, ads and all, while staring at their computer screen as related content suddenly appeared online.\n\nIt was like being asked to drive a car with a horse attached to the front bumper. That multimillion-dollar experiment is now enshrined in the annals of American journalismâs truly dumb moves. Friends tell me some of the scanner devices were used for target practice in Dallas urinals.\n\nStill, that fiasco aside, no regional paper in America has been as aggressive in trying to map a route to its own survival. Whatâs happening now in Dallas will be monitored, and thereâs a good chance it will be replicated.\n\nThe Morning News was once run by Ted Dealey, who was so steadfast in his arrogant extremism that he called President Kennedy, to his face, a little childâand then ordered his reporters to investigate ridiculous, scurrilous, salacious rumors that Kennedy had once been secretly married to another woman. It was Dealeyâs version of the Obama âbirtherâ story.\n\nThe paper has clearly moved on from those dark days. And now theyâve owned up to their monetizing mistakes. The firewall didnât work, it didnât drive profits, and it didnât allow the paper to spend more on newsgathering.\n\nSo theyâre tweaking again, and betting that the market for bells and whistles is large enough to allow the paper to provide the hard news for free. Because one way or another, news isnât free.\n\nEditorâs Note: When this story was published we did not mention that Bill Minutaglio previously worked for the Dallas Morning News.\n\nPhoto via Emergency Dentists USA",

  "latent_512": "news Priced Out of Torontoâs Housing Market\n\nFor millennials, living in the GTAâs suburban stretches is often unappealing.\n\nThis article is brought to you by Friends of the Greenbelt Foundation\n\nRachel Lissner would never live in the suburbs as they are today. âNot in a million years,â she tells me. As the founder of the Facebook group Young Urbanists League, her sentiment comes as no surprise. Lissner has an avid interest in the urban geography of the GTA and cares deeply about an affordable, sustainable future for the city. But as a member of the younger generation, her future in Toronto looks grim.\n\nFor plenty of people in their 20s and 30sâthose who fall under the broad and ill-defined âmillennialâ categoryâthe prospect of buying a home in Torontoâs downtown has become a little less than a pipe dream. As home values skyrocket and foreign buyers invest rigorously in luxury real estate, young Torontonians have become increasingly shut out from whatâs now the least affordable housing market in the country. And while buying a home in Toronto is increasingly an impossibility for many young people, the prospect of turning to the outer-GTAâs suburban stretches is often unappealing.\n\nâHaving grown up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., I counted down the seconds until I could move to the city,â Lissner says. When asked where she would move should she be unable to afford a home in Toronto, Lissner says she would consider Hamilton, which is now boasting an up-and-coming arts scene and a more affordable housing market. âBut I donât really know where else I could go,â she says.\n\nA range of research indicates that, for many millennials, moving to commuter-oriented neighbourhood outside the downtown is unappealing.\n\nAt a local level, opinion polling on Ontarioâs 2006 Growth Plan finds that urban intensification is widely supported by post-secondary students and, more generally, younger people. On a larger scale, a University of Michigan study recently found that fewer young people are choosing to get a driverâs license, some opting instead for other forms of transportation while others say that owning a car is simply too expensive (Lissner herself notes that neither she nor her friends drive regularly, either). What this growing bulk of research points to is a generation that values complete communities: more urbanized, environmentally-friendly neighbourhoods, rather than single-car, commuter-oriented sprawl.\n\nThe push to curb sprawl in Ontario began most explicitly with the Places to Grow Act (2005), the Greenbelt Act and Plan (2005), and the Ontario Growth Plan (2006). The goal was to curb sprawl, encourage sustainable development, and maintain the regionâs competitiveness by guiding decisions on future growth while protecting farmland and natural heritage sites. Ideally, car-oriented communities beyond the boundaries of the old city of Toronto can access green spaces, amenities, transit services, and employment opportunities through the widespread promotion of intensification and complete communities.\n\nComplete Communities create vibrant neighhourhoods where jobs, a range and mix of homes, services, and green spaces are all accessible and connected. The benefits are:\n\nLess congestion\n\nBetter for the environment\n\nImproved physical & mental health\n\nSupports investment in transit\n\nReduces sprawl, protects farmland\n\nSafe, diverse neighbourhoods\n\nAging-in-neighbourhood\n\nCycling networks for active transportation\n\nFor Adam Nicklin, a Toronto-based landscape architect and co-founder of Public Work, these plans are âa courageous start.â The objectives of curbing sprawl are commendable; however, when it comes to the housing market, Nicklin believes there should be a more effective method of measuring success.\n\nâWe still focus on the benchmark being the price of a single family home or a detached single family home. Thatâs still seen as the currency of the family unit. The only way we can really have a good conversation about affordability is to expand a dialogue about how people can live in cities,â he says, referring to the incorporation of alternative forms of housing, such as condominiums and rentals.\n\nTorontoâs housing market, according to Lissner, excludes young people like herself from living in the downtown core.\n\nâWhen youâre building a bunch of luxury or above-standard quality one-bedroom apartments and theyâre at market rate, thatâs not a type of housing unit thatâs affordable or desirable for everybody. And itâs catering to a small population of people, and itâs effectively saying that if you canât playâif you canât afford thisâthen thereâs no place for you in Toronto.â\n\nLikewise, the challenges of living in the city loom large for young people like Lissner. âJobs are harder to come by and increasingly precarious. The competition to rent right now is cutthroat. I really canât imagine what kind of housing arrangement Iâll have in the future,â she says. But given the costs that accompany life in the suburbsâprimarily commuter costsâLissner says that she would ultimately choose an increasingly costly life in the city than one outside.\n\nLandscape architects like Nicklin say that the solution to this problem lies in the development of suburban regions as complete communities. One example of this transformation is occurring along Sheppard Avenue East.\n\nUntil somewhat recently, the stretch of Sheppard Avenue East on either side of the Don Valley Parkway was little more than a space destined for suburban sprawl. An area host to a maze of residential streets with detached and deep-lot homes, the avenue has been transforming incrementally since the completion of the Sheppard subway line in 2002. As of late, developers and purchasers have been drawn to this increasingly urbanized area, making way for a multitude of condominiums that are currently in different stages of development.\n\nFurther east along Sheppard, where the avenue pivots southbound past Highway 401 and becomes Port Union Road, the Cityâs chief urban planner, Jennifer Keesmaat, credits the implementation of âgentle densityââan urban planning strategy used to add a mixture of housing incrementally rather than all at onceâas a mechanism for gradually transforming this commuter-oriented area into an urban locale.\n\nâWhatâs interesting about this area is that itâs fundamentally suburban in its character,â says Keesmaat. âItâs fundamentally oriented towards cars, and it has quite a wide street right-of-way, [but] through the adding of a variety of mid-rise developments, the area is beginning to slowly transform, and one of the reasons why the mid-rise developments work so well in that context is because many of the lots along Sheppard avenue actually have quite an exceptional depth to them.â\n\nFor other younger people, like U of T student and soon-to-be Urban Studies M.A. candidate Ayla Shiblaq, living outside the downtown core is appealing so long as the outer-area is adequately developed for community-based, environmentally friendly living. âBetween depending on the TTC and itâs constantly increasing prices, I find that the transit infrastructure doesnât really allow for places outside of the downtown core to be attractive to students, especially with a student workload,â she says. â[But] after living in other cities, I noticed that there are ways that affordable rental apartments can coincide with convenience.â\n\nShiblaq points to infrastructure implemented in Scandinavian countries that provide access for suburb-dwellers commuting to local municipalities for work. âWhen I lived in Copenhagen, I initially lived pretty far from the city centre, but because I could bike and was connected by an efficient 24-hour metro, I didnât seem disconnected from the city at all.â\n\nGeneration Squeeze founder Paul Kershaw echoes this sentiment, arguing that the solution to the current housing crisis ultimately lies in strategic development of outer regions. âWe need complete communities that offer opportunities for us to grow food and have access to jobs,â Kershaw says. âWe canât compromise those things at the expense of or in order to solve our housing squeeze.â\n\nTo do this, Kershaw says, we must first commit to the notion of âhomes first, investments secondââan ideal that refutes housing as merely an opportunity for great return on investment that ultimately outpaces economic growth. By committing to this notion, he argues, âYou would really encourage density. Each [would] say, âLook, we already have land zoned for residential use, but weâre not using that land very effectivelyââespecially in places like the GTA where so much of the already-zoned land for residents is already single-detached zoned.â\n\nâBut the reality is now that entire neighbourhoods throughout the GTA are pricing out hard-working, well-educated, talented young adults from ever having the chance to live there,â Kershaw concludes. âIf people whoâve raised their kids in downtown neighbourhoods ever want the chance to visit their kids by hopping in a car or transit to go see their grandchildren, the only way thatâs ever going to happen is if we add density.â",

  "latent_633": "The following is a script from \"The Republican Ticket\" which aired on July 17, 2016. Lesley Stahl is the correspondent. Richard Bonin and Ruth Streeter, producers.\n\nThe Republican National Convention that begins tomorrow in Cleveland will star Donald Trump and his chosen running mate the governor of Indiana, Mike Pence.\n\nThe Republican leadership has praised Pence as a good choice to unite the party. He's known as a reliable conservative with close ties to the religious right and he also has good relations with Republicans in Congress, having served six terms in the House of Representatives.\n\nWhat kind of vice president would Mike Pence be?\n\nBut there are significant areas in terms of values and policy where he has differed with Mr. Trump in the past.\n\nWe had the chance to ask the two of them about that in their first and only interview together, yesterday afternoon in New York, in Trump's three-story penthouse apartment in the Trump Tower.\n\nLesley Stahl: First of all, Governor Pence, congratulations.\n\nMike Pence: Thank you.\n\n\"It's very, very humbling and I couldn't be more honored to have the opportunity to run with, and serve with, the next president of the United States.\"\n\nLesley Stahl: This has probably come as a huge, life-changing moment for you.\n\nMike Pence: It has. It's very, very humbling and I couldn't be more honored to have the opportunity to run with, and serve with, the next president of the United States.\n\nLesley Stahl: Before we actually talk about the politics, you know, there've been so many major world events very recently, in the last week. I don't know if you can remember the last time we have seen a world this much in chaos. You even said, \"It's spinning apart.\" Are you ready for this world that we are facing today?\n\nMike Pence on waging war against radical Islam\n\nDonald Trump: We're both ready. I've no doubt. We need toughness. We need strength. Obama's weak, Hillary's weak. And part of it is that, a big part of it. We need law and order. We need strong borders.\n\nLesley Stahl: But all reactions to what's been going on aren't muscular. For example, look what happened in Turkey. There was a military coup in a democratic country; a NATO ally. How would you respond to that?\n\nDonald Trump: Well, as a president, I'm going to be-- you know, they've been an ally and I stay with our allies. They have been an ally. But that was a quick coup. I was actually surprised to see how well it was handled. And you know who really handled it? The people. So, I mean, we can say what we want, but the people handled it. When they surrounded the army tanks and without the people, you would've never had it. The military would've taken over.\n\n\"We're both ready. I've no doubt. We need toughness. We need strength. Obama's weak, Hillary's weak.\"\n\nMike Pence: But I truly do believe that the larger issue here is declining American power in the world. I truly do believe that history teaches that weakness arouses evil and whether it be the horrific attack in France, the inspired attacks here in the United States, the instability in Turkey that led to a coup. I think that is all a result of a foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama that has led from behind and that has sent an inexact, unclear message about American resolve. One of the reasons why I said yes in a heartbeat to run with this man, is because he embodies American strength, and I know that he will provide that kind of broad-shouldered American strength on the global stage as well.\n\nLesley Stahl: Let's talk about what happened in Nice, horrendous, carnage, horrible--\n\nDonald Trump: Horrible.\n\nLesley Stahl: Horrible. You said you would declare war against ISIS. What exactly do you have--\n\nDonald Trump: It is war. By the way, it is war.\n\nLesley Stahl: No, but does that-- when you say, \"Declare war,\" do you want to send American troops in there? Is that what you mean?\n\nDonald Trump: Look, we have people that hate us. We have people that want to wipe us out. We're gonna declare war against ISIS. We have to wipe out ISIS. These are people that--\n\nDid Trump consider his daughter for vice president?\n\nLesley Stahl: With troops on the ground?\n\nDonald Trump: I am going to have very few troops on the ground. We're going to have unbelievable intelligence, which we need; which, right now, we don't have. We don't have the people over there. We are going to use--\n\nLesley Stahl: You want to send Americans--\n\nDonald Trump: Excuse me-- and we're going to have surrounding states and, very importantly, get NATO involved because we support NATO far more than we should, frankly, because you have a lot of countries that aren't doing what they're supposed to be doing. And we have to wipe out ISIS. And speaking of Turkey, Turkey is an ally. Turkey can do it by themselves. But they have to be incentivized. For whatever reason, they're not. So we have no choice.\n\nLesley Stahl: But I still don't know if you're going to send troops over--\n\nDonald Trump: Very little. I'm gonna--\n\nLesley Stahl: But declare war--\n\nDonald Trump: --get neighboring states and I'm going to get-- we are going to get NATO; we're going to wipe 'em out. We're gonna--\n\nLesley Stahl: But declare war?\n\nMike Pence: Lesley--\n\nLesley Stahl: What does that mean--\n\nMike Pence: This is-- this is the kind-- this is the kind of leadership that America needs and it--\n\nLesley Stahl: But what--\n\nMike Pence: -and it begins with deciding to destroy the enemies of our freedom.\n\nLesley Stahl: How?\n\nMike Pence: And how we do that? I have every confidence. You-- you remember I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee. And I'm very confident that when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, he'll give a directive to our military commanders, bring together other nations, and we will use the enormous resources of the United States to destroy that enemy.\n\nTrump and Pence's shared values\n\nDonald Trump: Now look, we are going to get rid of ISIS, big league. And we're going to get rid of 'em fast. And we're going to use surrounding states. We're going to use NATO, probably. And we're going to declare war. It is war. When the World Trade Center comes tumbling down, with thousands of people being killed, people are still-- I have friends that are still--\n\nLesley Stahl: But we did go to war, if you remember. We went to Iraq.\n\nDonald Trump: Yeah, you went to Iraq, but that was handled so badly. And that was a war-- by the way, that was a war that we shouldn't have entered because Iraq did not knock down--excuse me\n\nLesley Stahl: Your running mate--\n\nDonald Trump: Iraq did not--\n\nLesley Stahl: --voted for it.\n\nDonald Trump: I don't care.\n\nLesley Stahl: What do you mean you don't care that he voted for?\n\nDonald Trump: It's a long time ago. And he voted that way and they were also misled. A lot of information was given to people.\n\nLesley Stahl: But you've harped on this.\n\nDonald Trump: But I was against the war in Iraq from the beginning.\n\nLesley Stahl: Yeah, but you've used that vote of Hillary's that was the same as Governor Pence as the example of her bad judgment.\n\nTrump OK with Pence's vote for Iraq war, but not Clinton's\n\nDonald Trump: Many people have, and frankly, I'm one of the few that was right on Iraq.\n\nLesley Stahl: Yeah, but what about he--\n\nDonald Trump: He's entitled to make a mistake every once in a while.\n\nLesley Stahl: But she's not? OK, come on--\n\nDonald Trump: But she's not--\n\nLesley Stahl: She's not?\n\nDonald Trump: No. She's not.\n\nLesley Stahl: Got it.\n\nLesley Stahl: I have to move on or we're never gonna find out why he chose you. Why did you pick him? You had other candidates--\n\nDonald Trump: OK, I did. I had a lot of people that wanted it; a lot more people than anybody--\n\nLesley Stahl: That came to you and begged you for it?\n\nDonald Trump: That called me and came to me and wanted it badly. And you know, the press didn't report that. The press said, \"Well, maybe he's having hard time picking--\"\n\nLesley Stahl: Well, what about the governor? Did he want it like that?\n\nDonald Trump: I actually brought it up to him.\n\nLesley Stahl: OK.\n\nDonald Trump: I got to know him during the-- when I was in Indiana during the primaries, and I did very well in Indiana, like I did just about everywhere else in all fairness. But-- I got to know him very well and I gained great respect for him. And I looked at the numbers, meaning the financials, which we would say in business. But I looked at the numbers. Unemployment? What a great job he did. Jobs? What a great job he did. Triple-A rating on his bonds.\n\nLesley Stahl: --but you went to him and said--\n\nDonald Trump: I did--\n\nLesley Stahl: Would you want to be considered--\n\nDonald Trump: I broached it.\n\nLesley Stahl: He didn't -- And then he said, \"I-- I really want it.\" So why did you pick him?\n\nDonald Trump: I would say that he thought about it a little bit. And about two seconds later, he called me, with his incredible wife, and said--\n\nLesley Stahl: That I'd like to be-- but what--\n\nDonald Trump: Like many others.\n\nLesley Stahl: How does he help you? How does he help you win in terms of groups of people? And what is your weakness that he compensates for and so forth--\n\nDonald Trump: Well, I went for the quality individual rather than I'm gonna win a state, because I'm doing very well in Indiana, and I guess I'm a lot up. And I think I'm gonna win Indiana. I have a great relationship and Bobby Knight helped me so much with Indiana. Indiana's a great place; great state.\n\nLesley Stahl: Why didn't you pick him? No, I'm joking -- moving on.\n\nDonald Trump: He would've been very good. But he's a terrific guy. But-- but I really like him as an individual.\n\nLesley Stahl: So you must've considered, obviously, by the reaction to your choice, a lot of the conservatives are very happy.\n\nDonald Trump: Very happy.\n\nLesley Stahl: Was that part of the--\n\nDonald Trump: Yes, it was party unity. I'm an outsider. I am a person that used to be establishment when I'd give them hundreds of thousands of dollars. But when I decided to run, I became very anti-establishment because I understand the system--\n\nLesley Stahl: Is he establishment?\n\nDonald Trump: --than anybody else. He's very establishment, in many ways, and that's not a bad thing. But I will tell you--\n\nLesley Stahl: That's kind of interesting --\n\nDonald Trump: --I have seen more people that, frankly, did not like me so much, and now they're saying, \"What a great pick.\" You see the kinda reaction. He has helped bring the party together. I understand. Look, I got more votes than anybody, but I also understand there's a faction--\n\nLesley Stahl: Is it already unified, do you think?\n\nDonald Trump: I think it's very close to unified. And I will say--\n\nLesley Stahl: Just because of this pick?\n\nDonald Trump: No. I think it's be-- I think it was much more unified than people thought. You saw that with the recent vote where we won in a landslide. You saw that with the big vote, the primary vote. I think it's far more unified than the press lets on. But having Governor Mike Pence has really-- people that I wasn't necessarily liking or getting along are loving this pick, because they have such respect for him.\n\nLesley Stahl: And that was--\n\nDonald Trump: And the party unity is OK. You know, I think it's OK to say I picked somebody, because I-- as one of the things. But I really believe the main reason I picked him is the incredible job he's done. Just look at the economics of Indiana--\n\nLesley Stahl: Indiana--\n\nDonald Trump: --and what's going on.\n\nLesley Stahl: But what about the chemistry between you two? You don't really know each other that well. You're -- at least I've read, a very low-key, very religious, you're a brash New Yorker--\n\nDonald Trump: Religious.\n\nLesley Stahl: Religious?\n\nDonald Trump: Religious--\n\nLesley Stahl: Are you?\n\nDonald Trump: Yea, religious.\n\nLesley Stahl: --you wouldn't--\n\nDonald Trump: Hey, I won the evangelicals. The evangelicals--\n\nLesley Stahl: That doesn't--\n\nMike Pence: You know, nobody thought--\n\nDonald Trump: --well, I think it means a lot. I don't think they think I'm perfect, and they would get up and they would say, \"You know, he's not perfect,\" but--\n\nLesley Stahl: They'd point to the --\n\nDonald Trump: --they like me--\n\nLesley Stahl: --divorces--\n\nDonald Trump: --but I won-- I won states with evangelicals that nobody thought I'd even come close to--\n\nLesley Stahl: Well, that's true--\n\nDonald Trump:-and I won--\n\nLesley Stahl: --so you didn't (UNINTEL)--\n\nDonald Trump: --with landslides--\n\nLesley Stahl: --need him for the evangelicals?\n\nDonald Trump: I think it helps. But I don't think I needed him, no, because--I won with evangelicals.\n\nMike Pence: But I think we have more in common--\n\nLesley Stahl: Yeah, tell me--\n\nMike Pence: --than--\n\nLesley Stahl: --what you think you have in common.\n\nDonald Trump: --what might be immediately obvious.\n\nLesley Stahl: Besides issues. Values and things like that.\n\nDonald Trump: I think we will have very, very good chemistry. I feel that. And I can feel that pretty early on. I don't think you need to be with somebody for two years to find that out. My feeling is-\n\nLesley Stahl: Your gut feeling.\n\nDonald Trump: I knew him during the primaries, during many trips to Indiana, I'd be with him. I think we have a great chemistry.\n\nLesley Stahl: I want to ask you though about something you've said about negative campaigning.\n\nDonald Trump: Yeah.\n\nLesley Stahl: You said negative campaigning is wrong, and a campaign ought to demonstrate the basic decency of the candidate.\n\nMike Pence: Right.\n\nLesley Stahl: With that in mind, what do you think about your running mate's campaign and the tone and the negativity of it?\n\nMike Pence: I think this is a good man who's been talking about the issues the American people care about.\n\nLesley Stahl: But name-calling?\n\nMike Pence: In that--\n\nLesley Stahl: \"Lyin' Ted?\"\n\nMike Pence: --in the essay that I wrote a long time ago, I said campaigns oughta be about something more important than just one candidate's election. And-- and this campaign and Donald Trump's candidacy has been about the issues the American people care about.\n\nLesley Stahl: --but what about--\n\nDonald Trump: Lesley, Lesley--\n\nLesley Stahl: --the negative side? He apologized for being a negative--\n\nDonald Trump: We're different people. I understand that. I'll give you an example. Hillary Clinton is a liar. Hillary Clinton-- that was just proven--\n\nLesley Stahl: That's--\n\nDonald Trump: --last week.\n\nLesley Stahl: --that's negative--\n\nDonald Trump: Hillary Clinton--\n\nLesley Stahl: By the way --\n\nDonald Trump: --you better believe it. Hillary Clinton is a crook.\n\nLesley Stahl: That's negative--\n\nDonald Trump: I call her \"Crooked Hillary.\" She's crooked Hillary. He won't-- I-- I don't-- I didn't ask him to do it, but I don't think he should do it because it's different for him.\n\nLesley Stahl: But-- he--\n\nDonald Trump: He's not that kind of a--\n\nLesley Stahl: He probably--\n\nDonald Trump: --person. We're different people--\n\nLesley Stahl: --don't you think he--\n\nDonald Trump: --to me she's--\n\nLesley Stahl: --thinks that's--\n\nDonald Trump: --Crooked Hillary.\n\nLesley Stahl: --wrong?\n\nDonald Trump: I don't think he should use that term. I've never said one way or the other. But to him, I don't think it would sound right, but he will say how dishonest she is by going over the facts.\n\nLesley Stahl: But would you go to him-- let's say you won, you're the vice president, your office is, I assume, down the hall, and you go in and you say, \"You know, you shouldn't be saying-- name-calling.\" Would you do that? Would you go in and say, \"You crossed the line, I think you should apologize?\" Would you do something like that?\n\nMike Pence: Look, I--\n\nLesley Stahl: He's laughing.\n\nMike Pence: --it's probably-- it's-- it's probably--\n\nLesley Stahl: It's OK.\n\nMike Pence: --obvious to people that our styles are different. But I promise you, our vision is exactly the same.\n\nLesley Stahl: No, but would you--\n\nMike Pence: And let me be--\n\nLesley Stahl: --will--\n\nMike Pence: --clear--\n\nLesley Stahl: --will you answer that? Would you go in --\n\nMike Pence: Well the-- one of the things I found out about this man is he appreciates candor. And--\n\nLesley Stahl: So you would go in--\n\nMike Pence: --I-- I--\n\nDonald Trump: I'd like him to if he thinks I was doing something wrong--\n\nLesley Stahl: Would you listen--\n\nDonald Trump: --just say--\n\nLesley Stahl: --to him--\n\nMike Pence: Yeah.\n\nLesley Stahl: --if he said you--\n\nDonald Trump: Absolutely--\n\nLesley Stahl: --crossed the line.\n\nDonald Trump: --absolutely. I might not apologize. You know, you said apologize, but--\n\nLesley Stahl: I did say apologize.\n\nDonald Trump: But I might not do that, but I would absolutely want him to come in-- if he thinks I'm doing something wrong, Mike, I would want him to come in and say, really, you're doing, you gotta-- and that's OK. I accept that from my consultants and my people and if Mike came in and told me, you know, \"I think you should do this or that--\n\nLesley Stahl: Back off that.\n\nDonald Trump: I would listen and very likely listen to him.\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you think John McCain is not a hero because he was captured?\n\nMike Pence: I have a great deal of respect for John McCain, and--\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you think he went too far?\n\nDonald Trump: You could say yes. I-- that's OK.\n\nDonald Trump: That one, you could say yes, I mean, you're not--it's fine - hey, look, I like John McCain. But we have to take care of our vets.\n\nLesley Stahl: No, but I wanna know if--\n\nDonald Trump: OK, but I'm just--\n\nLesley Stahl:-Mr. Pence would go in and--\n\nDonald Trump:-I'm just saying, that's--\n\nLesley Stahl: --say to you--\n\nDonald Trump: --why not that many people are that upset--\n\nLesley Stahl: What are you -- what did you say? You know, would you do something like that?\n\nMike Pence: I promise you that when the circumstances arise where I have a difference on policy or on presentation, I have-- I can tell you in my heart, I know-- I would have no hesitation, were I privileged to be vice president, to walk into the president's office, close the door, and share my heart. And I also know this good man would listen, and has the leadership qualities to draw from the people around him.\n\nLesley Stahl: Let's talk about-- some of the issues. Because there seems to be some daylight between you two, and we can just tick-- go quickly through these. Immigration. Mr. Trump, you have called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Do you agree with that?\n\nMike Pence: I do. In fact, in Indiana we suspended the Syrian refugee program in the wake of the terrorist attack. We have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of this country, and Donald Trump--\n\nLesley Stahl: Now--\n\nMike Pence: --is right to--\n\nLesley Stahl: --in December--\n\nMike Pence: --articulate that view.\n\nLesley Stahl: --in December you tweeted, and I quote you, \"Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional.\"\n\nDonald Trump: So you call it territories. OK? We're gonna do territories. We're gonna not let people come in from Syria that nobody knows who they are. Hillary Clinton wants 550 percent more people to come in than Obama--\n\nLesley Stahl: So you--\n\nDonald Trump: --who doesn't know what he's--\n\nLesley Stahl: --so you're changing--\n\nDonald Trump: --so we're going to--\n\nLesley Stahl: --your position.\n\nDonald Trump: --no, I-- call it whatever you want. We'll call it territories, OK?\n\nLesley Stahl: So not Muslims?\n\nDonald Trump: You know-- the Constitution -- there's nothing like it. But it doesn't necessarily give us the right to commit suicide, as a country, OK? And I'll tell you this. Call it whatever you want, change territories, but there are territories and terror states and terror nations that we're not gonna allow the people to come into our country. And we're gonna have a thing called \"Extreme vetting.\" And if people wanna come in, there's gonna be extreme vetting. We're gonna have extreme vetting. They're gonna come in and we're gonna know where they came from and who they are.\n\nMike Pence: You just asked me--if I'm comfortable with that--\n\nMike Pence: --and I am. What-- what Donald--\n\nLesley Stahl: You're on the same--\n\nMike Pence: Which--\n\nLesley Stahl: --page on that?\n\nMike Pence: --clearly-- clearly this man is not a politician. He doesn't speak like a politician--\n\nLesley Stahl: He's done pretty well.\n\nMike Pence: --he-- he speaks from his--\n\nMike Pence: --heart--\n\nDonald Trump: Is that a good thing? I think that's a good thing.\n\nMike Pence: --he speaks from his heart. And--\n\nLesley Stahl: Well, I--\n\nDonald Trump: Well, I-- I speak from my heart and my brain. Just so we understand.\n\nMike Pence: Right.\n\nDonald Trump: This is (points to head) maybe more important.\n\nLesley Stahl: Let's go to trade. You have voted for every trade agreement when you were in Congress--\n\nMike Pence: I have.\n\nLesley Stahl: --that came before you. You're supporting the Trans-Pacific partnership that Mr. Trump says would rape this country. Now, are you gonna be able to go out and campaign in support of his protectionist positions?\n\nMike Pence: I support free trade, and so does Donald Trump.\n\nLesley Stahl: Not really--\n\nDonald Trump: I do. I'm free trade, but I wanna make good deals. No, no, I'm all for free--\n\nLesley Stahl: You've talked\n\nDonald Trump: --trade. You--\n\nLesley Stahl: --about--\n\nDonald Trump: --know I'm not an isolationist. A lot of people think because I wanna make good deals--\n\nLesley Stahl: You wanna undo--\n\nDonald Trump: --these are stupid people--\n\nLesley Stahl: --these--\n\nDonald Trump: --wait a minute Lesley, these are stupid people that think that. I wanna make great deals for our country. We have deals like the deal signed by Bill Clinton, NAFTA, one of the worst things that ever happened to this country in terms of trade, in terms of economics.\n\nLesley Stahl: What do you think about NAFTA?\n\nMike Pence: You're absolutely right. I've supported free trade throughout my career. But--\n\nLesley Stahl: OK.\n\nMike Pence: --the truth of the matter is NAFTA has provisions in that law that call for it to be reviewed, that have never been-- never been-- initiated. What-- what I hear Donald Trump saying is let's-- let's look at these trade agreements and reconsider them and renegotiate them. And--\n\nLesley Stahl: And you're OK with--\n\nMike Pence: --with regard to--\n\nLesley Stahl: --that?\n\nMike Pence: --and with regard to other trade agreements, we've talked about this. I-- I really do believe when the American people elect one of the best negotiators in the world as president of the United States, we would do well--\n\nDonald Trump: We're gonna bring back jobs--\n\nMike Pence: --to negotiate individually with countries.\n\nDonald Trump: We're gonna bring back our jobs, we're gonna bring back our wealth, we're gonna take care of our people. Very simple.\n\nLesley Stahl: OK. More issues. Waterboarding. Mr. Trump wants to bring back waterboarding, and quote, \"A hell of a lot more.\" Are you comfortable with bringing back waterboarding?\n\nMike Pence: I don't think we should ever tell our enemy what our tactics are.\n\nLesley Stahl: But what about that? What--\n\nMike Pence: I don't--\n\nLesley Stahl: --about-- he's publicly--\n\nDonald Trump: I like that answer.\n\nLesley Stahl: --said that--\n\nMike Pence: I don't think we should-- I-- I think--\n\nLesley Stahl: But are you OK with the idea of--\n\nMike Pence: --I think--\n\nLesley Stahl: --waterboarding?\n\nMike Pence: --I think enhanced interrogation saved lives.\n\nLesley Stahl: And you're OK with--\n\nMike Pence: I--\n\nLesley Stahl: --that?\n\nMike Pence: --what I'm OK with-- what I'm OK with is protecting the American people. What I'm OK with is when people have the intent to come to this country and take American lives, that-- that we are-- that we are prepared to do what's necessary to gain the information to protect the people of this country--\n\nDonald Trump: But Lesley, let's step further. We have an enemy, ISIS and others, who chop off heads, who drown people in steel cages and we can't do waterboarding--\n\nLesley Stahl: OK, but, but why--\n\nDonald Trump: OK, they're not playing--\n\nLesley Stahl: --would you use their--\n\nDonald Trump: --under -- because you know--\n\nLesley Stahl: --techniques?\n\nDonald Trump: --what, those techniques get information. I don't care what anyone says.\n\nLesley Stahl: Are you agreeing with him?\n\nMike Pence: I am--\n\nDonald Trump: And get information--\n\nMike Pence: --what I--\n\nDonald Trump: --using those things.\n\nMike Pence: --what I can tell you is enhanced information gleaned information that saved American lives and, I was informed, prevented incoming terrorist attacks on this country from being successful. The American people expect the president of the United States to be prepared to support action to protect the people of this nation, and I know Donald Trump will.\n\nLesley Stahl: Have you answered me?\n\nMike Pence: I have.\n\nLesley Stahl: Let's talk about the convention. You're a showman. What are you going to do to keep it from being a snooze-o-rama, as some have happened.\n\nDonald Trump: Well, I think we're gonna have an exciting time. We've got some wonderful speakers. We have some very talented people. My family's gonna speak.\n\nLesley Stahl: Worried about violence outside? This is an open-carry state. People can carry guns. There'll be demonstrators. They've already said they're going to carry assault rifles. Are you worried? And would you call on people not to carry their guns?\n\nDonald Trump: I have great faith in law enforcement. If they don't want to take their guns, I think that's fantastic. But I have great confidence in law enforcement. The police like Donald Trump. It's law and order. And I have great confidence that they will do a great job.\n\nLesley Stahl: There's no question in anybody's mind that you want to win this election. I don't think anyone would doubt that. But what about being president? Do you really want to be president of the United States?\n\nDonald Trump: I want to make America great again. Honestly. I want to make Am-- I'm not doing this because-- I'm sacrificing tremendous things. I could be doing other things. It's lovely to sit down with you and be grilled. That's okay. But I could be doing other things right now. And I have some of the greatest properties in the world. I could be out there--\n\nLesley Stahl: Would you rather be out there?\n\nDonald Trump: I tell you what. I've really enjoyed this process. I've gotten to know the people of this country. I've gotten to know places that I didn't know, that I read about, but I didn't know. I've also gotten to see the problems. And it's a movement.\n\nDonald Trump: Now, when you ask me the question, do I wanna be?\n\nLesley Stahl: Yeah.\n\nDonald Trump: I wanna be for one reason. I wanna make America safe again, and I wanna make America great again. That's why I'm doing this. And I love it.\n\nLesley Stahl: And you wanna govern? I mean it--\n\nDonald Trump: I do wanna govern.\n\nLesley Stahl: It is different--\n\nDonald Trump: I do--\n\nLesley Stahl: --building a movement--\n\nDonald Trump: I govern my-- I--\n\nLesley Stahl: -and than-- going in there with the nitty gritty and--\n\nLesley Stahl: --all that tough decision making.\n\nDonald Trump: Sure. No, no I wanna govern\n\nLesley Stahl: OK, this is my absolute final question.\n\nDonald Trump: OK.\n\nLesley Stahl: You're not known to be a humble man. But I wonder--\n\nDonald Trump: I think I am, actually humble. I think I'm much more humble than you would understand.\n\nLesley Stahl: As you think about-- prospect of running this country in these tough times where the world is spinning apart-- are you awed? Are you intimidated? Are you humbled by the enormity of this?\n\nDonald Trump: You just said it best.\n\nMike Pence: Mmm.\n\nDonald Trump: In a world that's spinning apart. That's what I'm thinking of. I'm not thinking of, \"Oh gee, isn't this wonderful? Isn't this great what I've done?\" I've had people that said, \"It doesn't matter if you win or lose, what you've done has never been done before. You're gonna go down in the history books.\" You know what I say to 'em?\" I say, \"You're wrong.\" I will consider it, 'cause I funded my own primaries, I'm funding now a lot of this campaign. I'm putting in, you know-- I've spent $55 million in the primaries. I'm spending a fortunate now. I'll tell you, it is spinning. Our world is spinning out of control. Our country's spinning out of control. That's what I think about. And I'll stop that.\n\nLesley Stahl: Not-- humbled or-- awe.\n\nMike Pence: I can say to 'ya-- what--\n\nLesley Stahl: Go ahead.\n\nMike Pence: Talking with him in private settings, I love the words you used because this man is awed with the American people, and he is not intimidated by the world. And Donald Trump, this good man, I believe, will be a great president of the United States.\n\nDonald Trump: I love what he just said.",

Welp, isn't this a lovely adventure I've found myself? I've managed to find a spot about 25 minute walk from my campus, which is really nice! The space is a bit smaller than I remembered but still big enough to more-than-justify the price I got for it. I've already made myself at home and I'm doing fairly well with eating healthy! Not sure how long that'll last but I'm optimistic. I'm going to check out the rec center tomorrow after class; going to need to keep running if I wanna slim down a little. I get exercise with my walk to and from school but I'm thinking I need a lil more than that!\n\nI think Bandit is also really comfortable in his new home. I forgot to mention in my last journal that shortly after Daisy passed away, I adopted another hedgehog who needed a loving home; he was 6 months at the time. I've heard that moving a hedgehog can be quite stressful, but he's a trooper! Hasn't shown any discomfort and seems quite curious of the space. I was a little worried about the air conditioning being too cool for him (it could elicit hibernation, and for hedgehogs it can be fatal) but the heater I brought is doing well to keep him warm. I'll just have to keep a close eye on him in the mornings in the upcoming chilly months. He's running at night as usual and still plays tug-o-war with me. He's doing really well in his new environment independently but it's still important to stand by and keep him warm and stimulated.\n\nFor one of my classes I have to fill out a page of my sketchbook every day. It sounds daunting, but I actually quite love it. It's mostly written stuff of what I did and what I saw, and then it asks me to draw something from observation. I usually dislike that stuff but I've found some joy in it. This sort of thing has me motivated and I hope to come up with some ideas for projects, either for myself or for school. I think I'll sketch tomorrow a few ideas for my first project in glass... might have some steampunk-related themes, who knows! It'll be my first time touching glass for realzies... Hopefully I don't fuck up too bad!\n\nSo all in all I'm having a decent first few days. My classmates and professors so far are all so chill and friendly, and I'll be looking forward to spending more time with them. Just wanted to let ya know what's going on, so I bid ya goodnight!!\n\n~Vixen\n\nRest in Peace\n\nJack (Aimee's brother) (December 7th, 2008)\n\nCiocza Kriszia (June 7th, 2009)\n\nPriest Stanislaw (August 31st, 2009)\n\nClassmate's father (November 13th, 2009)\n\nSteven Stewart (November 19th, 2009)\n\nMax [Desi's pet cockatiel] (December 27th, 2009)\n\nLech & Maria Kaczynski and others (April 10th, 2010)\n\nJacqueline Lynne Snavely (June 1st, 2010)\n\nDebbie's Father (December 21st, 2010)\n\nSunia (June 30th, 2011)\n\nMy grandmother, Stanislaw Bielicka (October 22nd, 2014)\n\nMy piano teacher, Piotr Blazejowski (November 7th, 2014)\n\nDaisy (December 9th, 2014)",
  "latent_967": "Out of nowhere, NVIDIA has revealed the NVIDIA Titan V today at the 2017 Neural Information Processing Systems conference, with CEO Jen-Hsun Huang flashing out the card on stage. A mere 7 months after Volta was announced with the Tesla V100 accelerator and the GV100 GPU inside it, NVIDIA continues its breakneck pace by releasing the GV100-powered Titan V, available for sale today. Aimed at a decidedly more compute-oriented market than ever before, the 815 mm2 behemoth die that is GV100 is now available to the broader public.\n\nNVIDIA Compute Accelerator Specification Comparison Titan V Tesla V100\n\n(PCIe) Tesla P100\n\n(PCIe) Titan Xp CUDA Cores 5120 5120 3584 3840 Tensor Cores 640 640 N/A N/A Core Clock 1200MHz ? ? 1485MHz Boost Clock 1455MHz 1370MHz 1300MHz 1582MHz Memory Clock 1.7Gbps HBM2 1.75Gbps HBM2 1.4Gbps HBM2 11.4Gbps GDDR5X Memory Bus Width 3072-bit 4096-bit 4096-bit 384-bit Memory Bandwidth 653GB/sec 900GB/sec 720GB/sec 547GB/sec VRAM 12GB 16GB 16GB 12GB L2 Cache 4.5MB 6MB 4MB 3MB Single Precision 13.8 TFLOPS 14 TFLOPS 9.3 TFLOPS 12.1 TFLOPS Double Precision 6.9 TFLOPS\n\n(1/2 rate) 7 TFLOPS\n\n(1/2 rate) 4.7 TFLOPS\n\n(1/2 rate) 0.38 TFLOPS\n\n(1/32 rate) Tensor Performance\n\n(Deep Learning) 110 TFLOPS 112 TFLOPS N/A N/A GPU GV100\n\n(815mm2) GV100\n\n(815mm2) GP100\n\n(610mm2) GP102\n\n(471mm2) Transistor Count 21.1B 21.1B 15.3B 12B TDP 250W 250W 250W 250W Form Factor PCIe PCIe PCIe PCIe Cooling Active Passive Passive Active Manufacturing Process TSMC 12nm FFN TSMC 12nm FFN TSMC 16nm FinFET TSMC 16nm FinFET Architecture Volta Volta Pascal Pascal Launch Date 12/07/2017 Q3'17 Q4'16 04/07/2017 Price $2999 ~$10000 ~$6000 $1299\n\nFor the spec sheet we've gone ahead and lined it up against NVIDA's other Pascal cards, and for good reason. While the Titan series of cards may have started life as a prosumer card in 2013, since then NVIDIA's GPU designs have become increasingly divergent between compute and graphics. And even though the previous Titan Xp was based on the more graphics-focused GP102 GPU, the card itself was primarily (but not solely) pitched as an entry-level compute card, for customers who needed a (relatively) cheap way to do FP32 compute and neural network inferencing in workstations and small clusters.\n\nThe Titan V, by extension, sees the Titan lineup finally switch loyalties and start using NVIDIAâs high-end compute-focused GPUs, in this case the Volta architecture based V100. The end result is that rather than being NVIDIAâs top prosumer card, the Titan V is decidedly more focused on compute, particularly due to the combination of the price tag and the unique feature set that comes from using the GV100 GPU. Which isnât to say that you canât do graphics on the card â this is still very much a video card, outputs and all â but NVIDIA is first and foremost promoting it as a workstation-level AI compute card, and by extension focusing on the GV100 GPUâs unique tensor cores and the massive neural networking performance advantages they offer over earlier NVIDIA cards.\n\nIn this sense the Titan V is a return to form of sorts to the professional side of prosumer for the Titan family. One of the original claims to fame for the original Titan was its high performance in specialized FP64 compute workloads, something that was lost on the later Titan X and Titan Xp. By switching to NVIDIAâs specialized high-end compute GPUs, the Titan V regains its formerly lost compute capabilities, all the while also gaining all of the compute capabilities NVIDIA has introduced since then. Itâs no mistake that Jen-Hsun introduced the card at a neural networking conference, as this is a big chunk of the professional computing audience that NVIDIA is targeting with the card.\n\nInterestingly, comparing it to the PCIe Tesla V100, Iâm surprised by just how close the cards are in features and performance. NVIDIA has confirmed that the Titan V gets the GV100 GPUâs full, unrestricted FP64 compute and tensor core performance. To the best of our knowledge (and from what NVIDIA will comment on) it doesnât appear that theyâve artificially disabled any of the GPUâs core features. What does separate the Titan from the Tesla then from a performance standpoint is quite simple: memory capacity, memory bandwidth, and the lack of NVLink functionality. There are also a number of smaller differences between the cards that help to differentiate them between server and workstation â such as passive versus active cooling, NVLink, and the support policies â but otherwise for customers who are running a small number of cards, the Titan Vâs feature set is remarkably close to the much more expensive Tesla V100âs, which is a very interesting development since it goes to show just how confident NVIDIA is that this wonât undermine Tesla sales.\n\nMoving on and diving into the numbers, Titan V features 80 streaming multiprocessors (SMs) and 5120 CUDA cores, the same amount as its Tesla V100 siblings. The differences come with the memory and ROPs. In what's clearly a salvage part for NVIDIA, one of the card's 4 memory partitions has been cut, leaving Titan V with 12GB of HBM2 attached via a 3072-bit memory bus. As each memory controller is associated with a ROP partition and 768 KB of L2 cache, this in turn brings L2 down to 4.5 MB, as well as cutting down the ROP count.\n\nIn terms of clockspeeds, the HBM2 has been downclocked slightly to 1.7GHz, while the 1455MHz boost clock actually matches the 300W SXM2 variant of the Tesla V100, though that accelerator is passively cooled. Notably, the number of tensor cores have not been touched, though the official 110 DL TFLOPS rating is lower than the 1370MHz PCIe Tesla V100, as it would appear that NVIDIA is using a clockspeed lower than their boost clock in these calculations.\n\nFor the card itself, it features a vapor chamber cooler with copper heatsink and 16 power phases, all for the 250W TDP that has become standard with the single GPU Titan models. Output-wise, the Titan V brings 3 DisplayPorts and 1 HDMI connector. And as for card-to-card communication, PCB itself appears to have NVLink connections on the top, but these look to have been intentionally blocked by the shroud to prevent their use and are presumably disabled.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, NVIDIA is unsurprisingly pushing this as a compute accelerator card, especially considering that Titan V features tensor cores and keeps the TITAN branding as opposed to GeForce TITAN. But there are those of us who know better than to assume people wonât drop $3000 to use the latest Titan card for gaming, and while gaming is not the primary (or even secondary) focus of the card, you also won't see NVIDIA denying it. In that sense the Titan V is going to be treated as a jack-of-all-trades card by the company.\n\nTo that end, no gaming performance information has been disclosed, but NVIDIA has confirmed that the card uses the standard GeForce driver stack. And on that note, yesterday NVIDIA released 388.59 bringing official Titan V support. Now, how much those drivers have actually been optimized for the GV100 is another matter entirely; Volta is a new architecture, markedly so at times. Speaklng solely off the cuff here, for graphics workloads the card has more resources than the Titan Xp in almost every meaningful metric, but it's also a smaller difference on paper than you might think.\n\nAs for NVIDIA's intended market of compute and AI users, the Titan V will be supported by NVIDIA GPU Cloud, which includes TensorRT, a number of deep learning frameworks, and HPC-related tools.\n\nIf the golden shroud didnât already suggest so, the Titan V is also carving out a new eye-watering price point, dropping in at $2999 and on sale now at the NVIDIA store. NVIDIA has, to date, been selling Tesla V100 products as fast as they can produce them, so I'm not going to be surprised if the Titan V sees a similar fate. The $3000 price tag is quite high, even by Titan standards, but with the rare Tesla V100 PCIe card going for around $10,000, the Titan V is markedly cheaper. In fact in some respects I'm surprised NVIDIA is selling a GV100 card for so little; these are GV100 salvage parts that don't make the cut for Tesla - so the alternative would be throwing them away - but it just goes to show how confident NVIDIA is that it won't undermine the Tesla family.\n\nAt any rate, for NVIDIA professional users who have been looking to dip their toes into Volta but didn't want a full-fledged Tesla card, the Titan V is clearly going to be a popular card. Over the last two years NVIDIA's AI efforts have been firing on all cylinders, and by bringing a GV100 card down to just $3000, expect to see them crack open the market that much further. I dare say the idea of the \"prosumer\" Titan has died with this card, but for the rapidly growing professional compute market, this looks to be exactly the kind of card that a lot of developers have been waiting for.\n\nUpdate (12/8/17): Yesterday, NVIDIA also released driver version 388.59 WHQL, bringing product support to the Titan V, along with Fallout 4 VR support. NVIDIA has noted that the Titan V currently suffers from TDR errors and display blanking during Blu-ray disc playback on high resolutions, as well as from G-Sync display blanking when repeatedly switching between different memory overclocks. Lastly, this minor update features one bug fix, resolving flickering on GTX 1080 equipped G-Sync notebooks.",

It becomes their crutch, their every thought. I have no right to say and judge or define. What is the difference between a habit and an addiction?\n\n'I don't classify alcohol as something that relieves my pain, it doesn't relieve my pain. I don't do it to make me feel better. It's just there. Maybe I'm doing it and I don't even realise it.'\n\nBobby, pictured in his TV heyday in the early 90s, says his focus on his career led to the breakdown of his marriage\n\nIt was while he was socialising with an older crowd that Bobby's teenage love affair began.\n\nBobby said: 'I had a relationship with an older married woman, it influenced me, let's put it this way, it influenced me.\n\n'However, I at the time believed I loved her, she was my first love.\n\n'Even after it had all gone and finished and dusted I had a conversation with this person and she said... the words that hurt me after all those years, she said ''you weren't the only one\". It hurt, it really hurt me. It was like someone sticking a knife in me. Goodness. It was her thing, I was naive and I was seduced.'\n\nBobby also blamed his drinking on the breakdown of his marriage to Trudi Jameson, with whom he has three daughters.\n\nTherapist Mandy Saligari encouraged Bobby to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting to confront his problem with booze\n\nBobby's wife Trudi had an affair, which Bobby blames on his determination to succeed on his TV career. They were married from 1993 to 2003\n\nThe marriage ended when Trudi had an affair, which Bobby blames himself for because he was busy working on his TV career.\n\nBobby also has a strained relationship with his 92-year-old father, the athlete Bill Nankeville, who he feels favoured his older brother over him.\n\nTherapist Mandy told him he is dependent on alcohol to cope with his problems, and asked him to attend an AA meeting, which Bobby initially refused to do.\n\nShe said: 'I think you've picked up alcohol... as one of the ways you compensate. You cope with this feeling and keep it in abeyance, just a little bit away. I think you people please, you make people laugh and you tell people you're happy.\n\nBobby admitted that his relationship with his father, athlete Bill Nankeville, wasn't perfect. He said he felt abandoned by him when he preferred to spend time with his older brother\n\n'You have a drink and you're really a happy drunk and all those things but I think you are on the run from some of those sadder feelings. Heaven help you if it catches up with you,' she said.\n\nBobby refused to go and became distressed when Mandy said she thought he was an alcoholic, firing back: 'I feel slightly miffed, in fact I'm really miffed. I don't want to give up drinking because I am not an alcoholic. I'm offended by that.\n\n'Drink problem to me equals unreliable, he might not turn up, he might be p****d. When it comes to my work I'm not a liability, I don't classify myself as a mess. Emotionally I'm probably a bit of a mess.\n\n'If you ask me to give up drink I could give it up - but that isn't the thing that's causing the problem.'\n\nBobby added: 'Okay, it might be getting in the way of me solving my problem.'\n\nThe comedian agreed to go to an AA meeting, saying he didn't want his reliance on alcohol to become a bigger problem\n\nMandy explained that using alcohol to solve problems was proof that he was suffering from alcoholism.\n\nBobby then had a breakthrough and tried to leave the therapist's office when he became visibly upset.\n\nEventually the TV star agreed he would attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.\n\nHe said: 'I have an alcohol dependency, however I won't take away that I'm an alcoholic and a drunk but I'm getting that way, if I'm honest.\n\n'That's me being honest, I'm getting that way.'\n\nBobby began crying, saying: 'I don't want to be seen as a weak man. A mess of a man. This is coming out of relief... this is coming out of actually realising it.'\n\nIn Therapy airs on Friday at 10pm on Channel 5.",

  "latent_1550": "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of GamasutraÂs community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\nShould politics be in games?\n\nThis odd but recurring controversy was covered extensively by Errant Signal, Cool Ghosts, Kotaku and others, usually following the line of thought that everything has political undertones - from Civilization's winning conditions to Sonic's eco-friendly tone - so there will always be implicit politics in games.\n\nBut I'm here to defend the inclusion of explicit politics, of actively debating issues that we face daily in our democratic coexistence. Especially in RPGs, where having an interesting setting that enables thoughtful choices is highly desirable.\n\nAnd let me tell you, after playing +200 RPGs for my CRPG Book Project - most of which I simply BATTLE EVIL! or make color-coded binary choices - I am desperate for games with a better (or SOME!) sense of economics & politics.\n\nSadly, when people think about \"Politics in Gaming\", what comes into mind aren't open debates, but rather political messages ill-disguised as choices... which leads to this poorly articulated controversy.\n\nBecause propaganda usually sucks.\n\nFable III (2010)\n\nFable III does politics in the dumbest, most binary way.\n\nBy the end-game your kingdom will soon be attacked by Ancient Evilâ¢, so you must raise money and build defenses. As King, you pick policies which result in more or less money and in literal Good & Evil points.\n\nHere's one: Should children work at factories or go to school?\n\nWow, such nuances...\n\nThey even have a ridiculously evil-looking rich man going against a strong black woman, as to leave you no doubt to what they think is the right answer. Choosing otherwise means you're an asshole.\n\nFurthermore, every single EVIL choice wields you money, while all the GOOD choices reduces your money. It doesn't matter that there's Ancient Evilâ¢ coming to kill & destroy everything in a few months, Lionhead has decided that dead children inside a school are better than living ones working.\n\nThis isn't a moral choice, it's propaganda. And a very stupid propaganda, because it has no real-world value. What moral lessons should I learn here? Schools > Child Labor? MONEY = EVIL?\n\nFable III is a PEGI-16 / ESRB-M title, yet a 5-year-old child would feel patronized... let's see if we can find something better.\n\nUltima V: Warriors of Destiny (1988)\n\nIn Ultima V, Lord Blackthorn takes over Britannia and transforms the pseudo-religious Virtues into strict, draconian laws - such as \"Thou shalt donate half thy income to charity, or thou shalt have no income\" or \"Thou shalt enforce the laws of virtue, or thou shalt die as a heretic.\"\n\nYet, Ultima V wasn't a game about marching to the castle and deposing the villain (which would be a guerrilla coup d' Ã©tat, BTW - not that games ever explore that). Unlike 95% of games that thread this path, Blackthorn is not EVIL INCARNATE, but rather a confused, well-intended man, who thought \"if the Virtues are so good, why not make them mandatory?\"\n\nMost importantly, a lot of people support that. Obviously. We see this everyday, from \"a good criminal is a dead criminal\" to \"ban this ethnic group/religion/sexuality/speech!\", there are many \"good people\" who wish for harsher punishment for \"bad people\" - often via a more acting, controlling government.\n\nDuring the last year here in Brazil, for example, amidst a massive political and economical crisis there were those who thought the best course of action was a military intervention (aka coup) - like the one we had in 1964 and resulted in a military dictatorship which lasted 21 years:\n\nYou may think these people are stupid, but these are *real* people, who are out there living in the same world as we are. They aren't demons, mindless husks, zombies, terrorists, Nazis or whatever other tag magically transforms them into evil-people-you-can-shoot.\n\nIt's 2016, and Donald Trump is raising millions of votes, with his nomination for the general elections all but guaranteed. And on the other side, Hillary & Sanders are no less of an odd pair, representing very different world views. This is an unpredictable political & cultural event that eludes the world. If games want to be socially relevant, it's a great time to examine this, to question our morality and beliefs.\n\nSadly, Ultima V has a disappointing outcome - it reveals that Blackthorn and the rest of the world are under the influence of the Shadowlords - three Ancient Evilâ¢ figures who stole the land's Love, Truth and Courage. Destroy them, and Blackthorn and the others will see the error of their ways.\n\nThis is a lazy, cheap cop-out. Any moral debate the game had became this:\n\nThere's no Ancient Evilâ¢ behind any US candidate, neither of them will be defeated by the power of Love, and any shallow \"Good vs. Evil\" dichotomy will only serve to burry debate under a shallow, useless bickery.\n\nYet, Ultima V remains one of the most interesting \"political\" RPGs ever made. Not only it shows how good \"virtues\" can turn bad, but because - even if for a moment - it showed players \"hey, some 'good' people approve this 'EVIL' government\".\n\nA novel idea in 1988, that now only showcases how politically stale RPGs have been in the past 28 years.\n\nSo, for a change, let's take a look at a game which does handle this masterfully:\n\nDivinity: Dragon Commander (2013)\n\nDragon Commander is a unique RTS / Board Game / Political Simulator hybrid where you are a half-dragon emperor who leads armies into the field against Ancient Evilâ¢ and also rules the kingdom.\n\nWhile the RTS part is rather unfinished (sorry Larian), the game is incredibly interesting for its political debate. Your kingdom contains five races: Undead, Elves, Imps, Dwarf and Lizards. They assemble at a council, and regularly present policies for you to enforce or discard.\n\nFar from the stupidity of Fable III, here each of the 60 policies presented are representative of real-world issues - Public Health Care, Gun Ownership, Piracy, Torture, Deporting Criminals, Press Freedom, Same-Sex Marriage and even Breastfeeding in Public:\n\nThese policies are argued for or against by the five council members. While each is rather archetypal, they aren't GOOD nor EVIL, just different; making points you often hear in real-world's debates.\n\nI.e., should there be Government Healthcare?\n\nElves demand it, for there's a huge income gap;\n\nImps approve, for they are often injured;\n\nLizards think it's good for the people (and will piss off Dwarves);\n\nUndead say nay, for that would interfere with the work of the Gods;\n\nDwarves are outraged, for it would cost a fortune and \"lead to laziness\".\n\nWhat do YOU think?\n\nThere's no GOOD OR EVIL choice here, no moral judgment from the developers. The consequences of your choice are nothing but logical - some factions will like you more, other dislike you more. Approving Public Healthcare makes the population happier, but also increases your expenses.\n\nThis isn't propaganda, there's no agenda being pushed here - it only presents a very real issue, show some contrasting views and ask you to reflect on that. Then deal with the consequences of your choice.\n\nHere's an amusing video showcasing some of those choices and how players voted:\n\nMore than that, Larian actually released the Excel file on player votes!\n\n75% of players were in favor of Public Health Care, but 51% rejected Conscription.\n\n53% offered wage increase for workers, but 63% were against Unions.\n\n62% belived people should be able to kill burglars, but only 42% would deport foreign criminals.\n\n56% were in favor of same-sex couples, but 56% also chose to teach religion in schools.\n\nThis is the boiling pot of politics & ideas that developers should explore. These are questions that have no clear answer, that lead to interesting debates. That we have such a diverse audience yet still choose to address politics by color-coded GOOD & EVIL choices is nothing but shameful.\n\nSadly, when not awkwardly asking for \"politics to be removed\", gaming audiences (and many journalists) still praise \"moral choices\" like \"PUNCH REPORTER - Y/N\", \"NUKE TOWN - Y/N\" or \"SAVE DROWNING KID - Y/N\". Those aren't interesting choices - they aren't even interesting as evil choices, but rather \"LOL, I'M AN ASSHOLE!\" moments.\n\nFinally, let's take a look into a game that not only presents interesting politics, but also combines them with economy in its world-building & questing - leading to one of the most interesting settings in RPGs:\n\nArcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura (2001)\n\nArcanum's world was a cookie-cutter Tolkien-ish realm. Elves in forests, Dwarfs in mines, Orcs in the wild, humans lock in power struggles, mages casting fireballs, knights in armor, etc...\n\nYet, instead of an Ancient Evilâ¢, it got a steam engine.\n\nIts creator, Gilbert Bates, didn't use it to create an army of steam-punk robots to take over the world or anything - he started an industrial revolution. And the developers went crazy figuring out how one of the biggest events in human history would change a fantasy world.\n\nPlagued by roaming tribes of barbarian, Orcs and Lizards, Arcanum is a dangerous and large land, so mercenaries escorted trade caravans while mages offered safe teleportation at a high cost. The technological progress and creation of railroads have since put mercenaries out of work and undermined the Mage's influence - after all, who will study Fireball when any idiot can throw a grenade?\n\nThe revolution began in Tarant and was embraced by its King. But the rising bourgeoisie soon overthrew him and turned Tarant into a democracy, capital of the newly formed Unified Kingdom; The King of Cumbria rejected technology as blasphemy and saw his kingdom crumble economically, while the Kingdom of Arland embraced it and it's now petitioning to be a part of the UK - all these events are explored in interesting side-quests.\n\nRacial relations also changed - Gnomes, the weakest race around, began investing in this new technology and found themselves enriching and rising in power... which upset other races and lead to one of the best side-quest in RPG history (and believe me, I've played A LOT of them) - the Gnome Conspiracy.\n\nI won't spoil it here, just tease it a bit:\n\nThis is the kind of well-thought world-building you rarely see in RPGs. It's part of why so many games devolve into lazy \"collect 10/10 fangs\" or \"kill 5/5 Orcs\" bullshit - their settings are too shallow and stale.\n\nArcanum's setting has enough depth and verisimilitude to form what we call in R'lyehian marketing-speech \"Macro Environment\" - major external and uncontrollable factors that influence organizations:\n\nThis is vital for a living, interconnected world - otherwise quests, characters, factions, events and choices exist in a vacuum. Sadly, the only major external force in 95% of RPGs is the Ancient Evilâ¢ du jour.\n\nDragon Age: Origins, for example, is full of lore and conflicts... but they are mostly stagnant and isolated. The Dwarven xenophobia, the Mages vs Templars, the City Elves's ostracization and even the goddamn Elves vs Werewolves drama have all been going for literal CENTURIES! (Yup, check the wiki)\n\nAnd it's not even the Blight which change things, but rather THE PLAYER, this messianic figure that solves centuries-old conflicts by making color-coded choices and killing stuff. Compared to Arcanum, Dragon Age's folk have no agency - they are idiots standing around waiting for change to come.\n\n(BTW, RPGs rely so much on their lore & Ancient Evilâ¢ to produce quests and conflicts precisely because lore is way easier to create than a living, breathing world with believable power relations - vide Skyrim.)\n\nBut more than \"just\" an active, changing world, Arcanum's depth leads to unique moral dilemmas.\n\nIn our own Industrial Revolution we had people being employed under cruel work conditions, sleeping piled-up in factories, child labor and all that. In a Tolkien-ish world, we have labor cheaper & more efficient than human children: Orcs, as Saruman and Sauron can attest.\n\nSo here we have Bates' factories employing Orcs - taken from the wilds and offered a chance to join civilization. Yet, secluded in slums and overworked, they don't seem so happy with how that played out:\n\nThe screenshots don't give the full nuance of this conflict - Orcs are a savage race, which were raiding towns before being integrated into society. And all of Arcanum's enjoying the benefits of an Industrial era, but someone needs to work - cheaply - at the factories for that to happen...\n\n(Compare this to how DA:O's city elves live in slums simply because RACISM!, which is EVIL!!!!11)\n\nOh, but you know which fantasy workforce is cheaper than Orcs? Zombies! Lo and behold, Arcanum has a family of necromancers whom \"employs\" undead dwarfs:\n\nIn an 1988 interview, author Isaac Asimov had this to say about the role of Science Fiction in the world:\n\n\"It [Science Fiction] works up an artificial society, one which doesnât exist, or one that may possibly exist in the future, but not necessarily. And it portrays events against the background of this society in the hope that you will be able to see yourself in relation to the present societyâ¦ Thatâs why I write science fiction â because itâs a way of writing fiction in a style that enables me to make points I canât make otherwise.\"\n\nWell, here's Arcanum doing just that, but with an artificial past & magical society that can't possibly exist - what some would call \"Science Fantasy\". And it ask questions that our society never had to answer, but say a lot about ourselves regardless. For example:\n\nIf to this day humans still enslave humans, what would happen if we had an \"inferior\" race like the Orcs around? Would YOU enslave them? If not, would YOU pay them the same as a human worker?\n\nIf we could raise the dead to do brute, mindless jobs, would YOU do it? What about the dead's family & religion? And what would happen with the now-unemployed living workers?\n\nIncome inequality is a huge issue in our world - the old 99% vs 1% debacle. What if it span multiple races? What if the 1% were all Gnomes? What would YOU do?\n\nYou may look at these and think the \"right\" answers are obvious. If so, STOP .\n\nThis is the mindset that leads to people ignorantly asking devs to \"remove politics from gaming\" - because you're not adding politics, you're adding propaganda - a false Good and Evil dichotomy.\n\nThere's no \"right\" answer, that's the point - it's an exercise, a debate players should have with their own morality & beliefs. And (if your game is good), live with the consequences of their choices.\n\nTo illustrate, I'll leave you with one final statistic from Dragon Commander:\n\n57% of players were in favor of holding open elections for president, but only 12% agreed to resign for said democratically elected president.\n\n\"For my friends, everything. For my enemies, nothing. For all others, the law\".\n\n----\n\nPS:There's nothing wrong in and of itself with propagandising or pushing forward a message - you do you.\n\nJust don't be suprised when people push back.",

Doing good around this region is at the heart of what we do together.\n\nâStandard Chartered are the force behind our arrival here as the tour sponsor for our first ever visit to Indonesia.â\n\nThe bank's name has appeared on the Reds' shirts since July 2010 with Standard Chartered and Liverpool FC working together on a number of high profile global campaigns including 'Seeing Is Believing' which helps to tackle avoidable blindness.\n\nPeter Sands, group chief executive of Standard Chartered, said: âOur sponsorship of Liverpool FC has proved successful for both parties and we are delighted to be extending our partnership.\n\nâLiverpool are hugely popular in the markets where we do business, and we are excited about the opportunity to continue to work with this fantastic club and their passionate fans.â",

Two layers of foam are designed to take both âhigh and low energy shotsâ and, unlike traditional helmets, be soft and flexible yet durable.\n\nThe helmet features eight vents and a removable goggle retainer. It complies with CE EC 1077, a safety standard.\n\nCost will be $120 when the Combyn comes available in August.\n\nâSean McCoy",

He'll be sitting on a white chair, feet dangling, while he assembles an old computer with spare parts.\n\nHiesl has previously staged the event in Europe and South America.\n\n\"For me, it is a light twist of a daily life situation. It is as if we would have picked up people from the street and put them on chairs,\" she told CBC News.\n\nIn casting 10 performers aged 63 to 83, Hiesl says part of her purpose is to get passersby to stop and think, especially about the history represented by seniors.\n\n\"It's really up to everybody to think about life, to think about something that is different, challenging, maybe something that is shifted to another level or a little bit out of place,\" she said.\n\n\"So yes, maybe with a twinkle in an eye.\"\n\nHer performers, each of whom sits for an hour, will take up various pastimes, from reading to cleaning soccer cleats. Britton said he found the experience quite amusing.\n\n\"It is surprising and very refreshing, especially because of the remarks that I can hear.

  "latent_2103": "If I could go back in time and show 12 year-old me that Iâd be able to play what is arguably the Nintendo 64âs best title (and perhaps one of the best video games of all time), The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, on my smartphone, I guarantee I wouldnât believe it.\n\nIt sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie.\n\nBut in 2015, this is actually possible. I spent hours last weekend playing games like Perfect Dark, Goldeneye 007, Mario Kart and Super Mario 64 on my Nexus 5. To my surprise, most Nintendo 64 games ran relatively smoothly on my smartphone, with very few graphical glitches and only the occasional bout of frame rate issues.\n\nOf the most popular releases for the Nintendo 64, the only title that wouldnât run at all on the two N64 emulators I tried, Mupen 64 Plus AE and MegaN64, the top N64 emulators on the Google Play Store, was Rareâs classic offbeat comedy game, Conkerâs Bad Fur Day.\n\nThereâs a slew of other similar Nintendo 64 emulators available for Android devices, but each one is based on the same source code as Mupen 64 Plus AE, and often introduce additional compatibility issues when it comes to what games actually run solidly on the emulator. Sometimes having extra features in an emulator really isnât a good thing.\n\nMupen 64 Plus AE is also available for free, but thereâs a $0.99 donation version that helps the appâs developers continue to update it.\n\nJust like other emulators, PPSSPP, a PSP Android emulator and SNES9x EX+, the top Super Nintendo emulator on the Android platform, controlling any Nintendo 64 game with a touchscreen is far from ideal, especially given the strange layout of the consoleâs wacky-looking controller.\n\nYou can shift the emulatorâs buttons around to your liking, but no layout feels comfortable, especially given how frequently N64 games use the âZâ trigger button on the controller. I constantly found myself contorting my hand to strange angles in order to reach the Z button, especially when playing Goldeneye 007 and Super Mario 64.\n\nUsing an Android controller, or rooting your smartphone and using a PlayStation 3 Dualshock 3 or PlayStation 4 Dualshock 4 gamepad, is a much better option for playing N64 games on your Android device, maybe more so than any other retro console emulator available for Android.\n\nConkerâs Bad Fur Day was the one title I encountered that didnât run properly at all, resulting in a mess of polygons, weird colours and pixelated graphics. Perfect Dark and Goldeneye 007 ran great with a few slow down issues, and in general the dozen games I tried on the emulator, mostly the consoleâs most popular titles like Mario Kart 64 and a few oddities such as Harvest Moon 64, worked great.\n\nHowever, every title suffered from some sort of sound glitch, either distorting sound effects in a minor way or causing random popping noises intermittently showing up during gameplay. To avoid this issue I simply played most games with the sound turned down, or completely off. Messing around with Mupen64 Plus AEâs settings fixed many of the audio issues, but they never completely disappeared.\n\nSimilar to PPSSPP, in order to play games at a solid frame rate with Mupen64 Plus AE, you need a relatively modern Android smartphone, preferably one with a fast processor and a significant amount of RAM. On the plus side, every title is also upscaled to higher resolutions, so the trademark blurriness many Nintendo 64 games experienced isnât an issue with Mupen 64 Plus AE.\n\nItâs important to keep in mind that emulators generally fall into a legal gray area, and are often considered illegal and ethically wrong. But thereâs also a positive side to the emulator argument.\n\nEmulators give extremely rare, expensive and difficult to find games a new audience, and allow people to relive games they enjoyed as a children.\n\nWhenever possible purchase old school games on services like Nintendoâs eShop, Sonyâs PlayStation Network or on Microsoftâs Xbox Live.",
  "latent_2361": "Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nâWe do not rejoice in victories. We rejoice when a new kind of cotton is grown and when strawberries bloom in Israelâ â Golda Meir\n\nIsraelis tend to think the United Nations preoccupies itself with classic political issues, but the reality is different. On taking office, Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, declared his priority would be promoting worldwide sustainable development.\n\nLast month, in Brazil, the Rio+20 Conference met to discuss sustainable development. The conference attracted over 100 heads of state and 50,000 participants. For Israel the conference was a considerable success.âSustainable developmentâ is economic growth in which resource use aims to meet human needs, while preserving the environment so these needs can be met for generations to come.Israelâs success at Rio+20 was not guaranteed. The Syrian government tried to ban two Israeli environmental organizations from participating â the JNF and Life and Environment (an organization representing 130 Israeli environmental NGOs). At the very time the Syrian regime is slaughtering its own people, it has time to launch a diplomatic attack on Israel. A worldwide Israeli diplomatic campaign ensured that the Syrian ploy failed.The Palestinians failed to have their status upgraded at the conference to that of a full-state member. Unfortunately Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki chose to use his speech as a platform to attack Israel rather than talking about cooperation and the environment.The Israeli delegation came to Rio+20 with a vision of sustainable development for the world. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, in his greetings, said that Israel is a country that manages to âdo more with less,â and in the future expects to do even more with much less.Israelâs ability to do more with less and successes in sustainable development have brought international recognition, causing a number of UN and international figures to describe Israel as a âsustainability superpower.âDr. Daniel Hillel from Israel was recently awarded the World Food Prize for pioneering an innovative way of bringing water to crops in arid and dry-land regions. CNN selected Yosef Abramowitz, founder of the Arava Power Company, as one of six world leading âgreen pioneers.âIn 2008, Time magazine named Shai Agassi, the founder of Better Place, the company responsible for introducing the electric car, as one of the âenvironmental heroesâ of the year.In a further sign of international recognition, the head of the Israeli delegation to Rio +20, Environmental Protection Minister Gilad Erdan, was elected vice chairman of the Conference.In his meetings with colleagues from around the world, many expressed a desire to increase partnership with Israel, mainly in water management.This is hardly surprising: Israel is the worldâs leader in water re-use and recycling. Israel treats and recycles 80 percent of effluent water for agriculture. There are 35 desalination facilities in Israel. The Ashkelon desalination plant is the worldâs second largest.Israel is a world leader in desalination and by 2015, 75% of Israelâs water supply will come from water desalination. The UN General Assembly recently adopted an Israeli proposed resolution calling for international investment in agricultural technology.Israel is also a world leader in forestry as we implement Ben-Gurionâs dream of making the desert bloom â and one of the only countries that had more trees at the end of the 20th century than at the start.Thousands of experts flock to Israel every two years to attend WATEC: The Israel Water Technologies, Renewable Energies and Environmental Control exhibition. This November, Eilat- Eilot, the largest renewable energy conference of its kind will be held in Eilat.Since 1958, MASHAV (Israelâs agency for international development cooperation at the Foreign Ministry) has brought to Israel over 270,000 professionals from across the globe to take courses, learn from experts and see sustainable development in practice. Israeli experts have also been sent to the developing world to run courses there.During the Rio+20 conference the Israeli government, for the first time, invested in an international campaign on CNN branding Israel as a world leader in green technology. The Foreign Ministry launched a Facebook Page called âGREEN ISRAELâ and an environmental YouTube channel.Many places around the world suffer severe drought. Millions in Africa face life-threatening hunger. Israel is willing and able to continue to share its technology and know-how with the world and be a âlight unto the nationsâ of sustainable development.In the words of the prophet Isaiah: âI will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.â (Chapter 41, verse 18) The writer is the coordinator for Sustainable Development in Israelâs Foreign Ministry and was a member of the delegation to the Rio+20 Conference.Previously he was the Minister for Congressional Affairs at the Israeli Embassy in Washington.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_2507": "Texas is close to passing a law that will help preserve the federal governmentâs policy of detaining immigrant families by licensing detention centres as childcare facilities.\n\nTexas immigration law 'more dangerous' than infamous Arizona bill, critics say Read more\n\nThe move would allow the government to sidestep a 2015 federal court order that immigrant children must not be held in unlicensed detention centres for more than a few days.\n\nCritics fear it will pave the way for asylum-seeking mothers and children to be kept in traumatising, prison-like conditions for weeks and months while their claims are assessed.\n\nTexas is home to two of the countryâs three family detention centres â the other is in Pennsylvania. With their future in doubt because of the courtâs 2015 ruling, the stateâs department of family and protective services decided to license them a year ago.\n\nA judge in Austin blocked the move amid concerns that the agency was overstepping its remit and that the nature of the facilities means they should not qualify as childcare centres.\n\nSome detainees have alleged they endured inadequate medical care, poor conditions and sexual abuse, while the American Academy of Pediatrics is among the groups to have expressed concern about the health impacts of detaining children and recommends only âlimited exposure of any child to current Department of Homeland Security facilitiesâ.\n\nBut Texasâs Republican-dominated legislature is now poised to loosen the regulatory requirements so that the agency can license the centres.\n\nâ[Texas has] just taken a step to help private prison corporations circumvent these court rulings that are meant to protect children, and weâre greatly disappointed,â said Laura Guerra-Cardus of the Childrenâs Defense Fund of Texas, an advocacy group.\n\nâThey are going through the proper processes and our reaction is apparently to jail them, to detain women and children despite the knowledge that it is causing further harm to these already traumatised children.â\n\nThe facilities, Dilley and Karnes, are near San Antonio and together can hold more than 3,000 people. Run by private companies, they opened in 2014 as part of the Obama administrationâs response to the surge of young people fleeing violence and hardship in central America and crossing at the Texas-Mexico border to seek asylum.\n\nâTheyâre coming because theyâve been abused, theyâve been neglected,â said Sylvia Garcia, a Democratic state senator, during a debate before the bill passed in a vote along party lines on Tuesday. âAnd now, to add insult to injury, weâre going to put them in âbaby jailsâ?â\n\nAfter final passage from the state senate, the measure, SB 1018, must be approved by the house and signed by the governor before becoming law. Its advocates argue that the licensing process will allow for more oversight of the centres, helping to correct deficiencies.\n\nBryan Hughes, a Republican state senator who is the billâs co-author, told the chamber thatâwe want to make sure that if theyâre in Texas theyâre meeting Texas standardsâ.\n\nCritics are unconvinced that Texasâs already stretched child welfare system will provide meaningful regulation of the buildings and point out the bill allows the state agency to âexempt a family residential centre from any minimum standard or rule applicable to a general residential operationâ.\n\nHughes told senators that this clause would make it easier for operators to house families together, rather than acting as an invitation to lower the quality of care.\n\nImmigrant advocates contend that asylum-seekers should not be detained, but released to stay with relatives, friends or supportive organisations while their cases wind their way through the legal process.\n\nA state representative who introduced another version of the bill told the Associated Press last month that it came from GEO Group, the company that runs Karnes. âIâve known the lady whoâs their lobbyist for a long time. Thatâs where the legislation came from,â John Raney said.",

You know, I've got to change my life somehow.\"\n\nHe said \"a lot of us fall out of the closet\", and the catalyst to his divorce was his wife reading a journal entry about his attraction to another man.\n\n\"I wrote about somebody I had fallen for at my work and my then wife read my journal, and that was Christmas and we had sort of separated by Easter,\" he said.\n\nHe is still close friends with his wife, who he rings several times a week. He said his two sons and daughter find it quite fashionable to have a gay dad.\n\nWebsite provides safe space\n\nMr O'Hanlon said he sought out a Commonwealth-funded support group for gay and married men years before coming out, but could not make the leap.\n\n\"I thought 'hmm, that's what it looks like, these are other people in my situation', then I ran back and hid in the closet for another six years. It's a long process,\" he said.\n\nUltimately the forces keeping his sexuality a secret, such as a lack of gay role models and a strict Catholic mother, were overpowered by the need to be honest to himself and others.\n\nMr O'Hanlon is just one of many Australian men who have struggled to come out to their wife. He is now in his 60s and has left the corporate world to become a visual artist.\n\nHe used to help run a successful Melbourne support group for such men, but it was eventually shut down due to dwindling numbers.\n\nNow to fill the gap, a website has been created called DALE (Digital Acceptance Learning and Empowerment) to give men like Mr O'Hanlon a safe place to share their feelings and get help from others, particularly those from regional areas or ethnic minorities.\n\n'A pretty big population'\n\nCaleb Hawk from the Victorian AIDS Council, which helps run the DALE project, said so far the site had attracted about 70 registered users and 10,000 unique visitors.\n\n\"One of the researchers that was looking at this population has done some modelling to actually suggest that there might be up to 17,000 men in Australia who are same-sex attracted and living in a heterosexual relationship or lifestyle,\" he said.\n\n\"When you think about that in the grand scheme of things that's actually a pretty big population for no service provision whatsoever targeting them.\"\n\nBeyond Blue is leading the project with $200,000 of funding over two years from the annual Movember fundraising campaign to improve men's health.\n\nWebsite visitors are being surveyed about their experience of anxiety and depression, as part of a broader research project at the University of New South Wales.\n\nMr Hawk said there was a knowledge gap when it came to same-sex attracted men living with wives or girlfriends.\n\n\"They've been very, very difficult to reach traditionally, and very few services have kept going really,\" he said.\n\n\"The only one standing is GAMMA [Gay and Married Men's Association] NSW providing face-to-face services.\"\n\nHe said about half of the men accessing the site had identified as bisexual, with an even mix of people from right across Australia.\n\nBut funding for the website will eventually run out, and Mr Hawk is hopeful governments will come on board and support its continued development.\n\nTopics: lgbt, community-and-society, sexuality, melbourne-3000, vic\n\nFirst posted",
  "latent_2604": "Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn\n\n(This piece also appears on My Kid Is Gay and HuffPost Parents.)\n\nI ran into a friend recently who I hadnât seen since high school. After catching up on our lives, she wanted some advice. âDo you have any ideas on what I can send my gender non-conforming nephew for Christmas?â she asked. âI know he likes My Little Pony, but Iâm not so sure I should give that to a boy.â\n\nHer comment after the question threw me for a nanosecond. But then I went back to the question and decided it was really a non-question. Because when it comes to gift buying for kids â at Hanukkah, Christmas or birthdays â Iâm an advocate for giving a child something they really want. In other words, gifts are supposed to add to a childâs happiness. And my emphasis here is on the stand-alone word âchildâsâ, with no gender-labeling modifiers.\n\nSo, regardless of her nephewâs preference for playthings that may not fit the over-gender-stereotyped marketing of toys, my friend had answered her own question. Bottom line: Heâs a kid, and she knows what he likes. And whether or not heâs gender non-conforming neednât be part of the equation. I also suggested she check in with her sister. Maybe he already has a dozen My Little Pony toys. Perhaps heâs hoping Santa will bring him a scooter, a Barbie, Legos or some FurReal Friends this year.\n\nShopping for kids you donât see often can be daunting. So, whether you live in town or out of town, here are a few tips to take the pressure off you aunts, uncles, grandparents or family friends who arenât sure what to get a certain child this holiday season.\n\n1. ASK THE PARENTS.\n\nThis really is as easy as it sounds. Chances are parents know exactly what their child wants most. Just be prepared for the answer; it might not be what you expect.\n\nMy son grew up in the Midwest, and one of their* favorite aunts lived in Phoenix. Sheâd call every year before Christmas and their birthday to find out what they wanted more than anything else. âThat would be the Barbie Pink Convertible,â I told her the year they were three.\n\nShe hesitated. âReally?â\n\nâNo doubt about it,â I said.\n\nâWell then thatâs what Iâm getting him!â\n\nTheir uncle asked the same question the year Harry was eight and ended up putting an Easy-Bake Oven under the tree.\n\nOn the other hand, if you know your nephew is into Barbie or your granddaughter is obsessed with Star Wars and arenât sure how their parents feel about a toy that crosses stereotype boundaries, youâll find out by asking. If theyâre not okay with it, I suggest you send them a link to MyKidIsGay.com, get them a copy of Diane Ehrensaftâs Gender Born, Gender Made and opt for my next tip.\n\n2. BUY A GENDER-NEUTRAL TOY.\n\nToys shape the way a child sees the world, so it follows that stereotyping play limits a childâs growth. There are plenty of gender-neutral toys that encourage the development of kids as whole people. So consider a toy that stimulates creativity, hands-on learning, teamwork, social skills, problem-solving or motor skills.\n\nGender-neutral toys empower.\n\nThey give kids room to explore, broaden their view of whatâs possible for them, and defy the stereotypes linked to their assigned sex. In fact itâs a custom on the last day of Kwanzaa to give a gift thatâs educational or artistic in nature. I think thatâs an awesome tradition worth spreading across all December holidays.\n\nHere are some ideas for you in this important category: building toys, puzzles, board games, science kits, musical toys, stuffed animals. Challenge yourself to think beyond gender to a range of aptitudes.\n\n3. THINK WORLD OF BOOKS.\n\nYou just canât go wrong with a gift of books. Reading stimulates the imagination and opens kids up to new worlds, ideas and understanding.\n\nIn my opinion, every child deserves the treasure of a well-stocked library.\n\nA childâs collection of books creates memories of favorite characters and holds stories they can relate to and learn from. I heard my sonâs great aunt Sister Benet, a kindergarten teacher no longer with us, say years ago that books are the gifts that get opened over and over. Books were her default gift, and theyâve become mine, too. And because the price of books adds up quickly, any parent will appreciate you expanding their childâs world with a gift of books.\n\nYou can do an Internet search for âbest books for children by age,â best books for children 2014â or âbest books for children about gender identity.â And your local bookseller will have some great ideas for you, too.\n\n4. BEWARE THE GENDERED MARKETING OF TOYS.\n\nAt most of the big toy stores, youâll find âboysââ toys and âgirlsââ toys divided by pink and blue aisles. So think about browsing outside of the blue and pink boxes of toy suitability for kids. Check out a local shop where toys are more likely to be grouped by play category. And the same caveat applies to online shopping, where many retailers separate toy searches by sex.\n\nLook for online stores that let you browse gift options simply by age group.\n\nIdeally the toy conditioning by gender will soon be a thing of the past, right along with the tendency to label children for their gender expression or preferred choices of play.\n\nMay your holiday shopping for the youngest generation be as merry and bright as the smiles on happy childrenâs faces.\n\n*My offspring Harryâs preferred gender pronoun is they. I know it takes some getting used to, as I occasionally still mess up.\n\nIF YOU LIKED THIS POST YOUâLL PROBABLY ALSO LIKE THESE:\n\nâGender issues at the North Pole.â\n\nâBaby gifts: My double whammy of gender stereotyping.â\n\nâPope rhymes with hope, and gay rhymes with yea.â",
  "latent_2614": "From left, Sen. Mitch McConnell, Sen. Orrin Hatch, Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn speak with reporters Thursday as work gets underway on the Senate's version of the GOP tax reform bill. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Senate GOPâs tax bill points to nasty fight ahead There are dramatic differences between the House and Senate versions of the tax overhaul, imperiling Trump's desire to sign legislation by year end.\n\nYawning divisions have emerged between the House, Senate and White House over tax reform, raising doubts about whether Republicans will be able to achieve their most important political and policy priority before the end of the year.\n\nThe Senate and House are split on some key issues, including the top tax rate and the timing of the corporate tax cut, and also at odds with President Donald Trump in many areas. Hard bargaining, battles between GOP factions and an onslaught of lobbying are the gauntlets Republicans will have to run to get legislation to Trump's desk by the end of the year â and into their mailers and ads for the 2018 elections.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIf one thing unifies Republicans and makes the job easier than it might appear, it's the fear that they will have nothing to take into those contests after the failure of another marquee effort, repealing and replacing Obamacare. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other GOP leaders used the drubbing the party took in Tuesday's election in Virginia as a warning to the rank and file: Pass tax reform or face the wrath of Republican voters.\n\n\"We are going to conference,\" Ryan told reporters Thursday, after the Senate unveiled its long-awaited plan and House tax writers advanced theirs to the House floor. \"Yes, the Senate bill is going to be different than the House bill because that's the legislative process.\"\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee approved its bill on a party-line 24-16 vote, and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the full House would vote on it next week. The Senate Finance Committee will start working on its bill next week, maybe as early as Monday.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nOne of the first differences to emerge was the Senate's plan to delay slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent until 2019. The House wants to cut the tax immediately, and has the White House on its side.\n\nCutting the corporate rate is the centerpiece of the GOP plan to lower tax rates and spur faster economic growth. But the Senate is trying to limit the revenue impact to allow a bill to pass with just 51 votes and avoid a possible Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn another break with Trump, neither the Senate bill or the House bill includes a repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate requiring Americans to have health insurance. But Senate Republicans are still considering a repeal to help cover the cost of making some tax cuts permanent.\n\nGOP leaders are talking with rank-and-file members to assess whether they have the necessary 50 votes to scrap the least popular part of Obamacare.\n\n\"I'd sure like to do that,\" said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) \"I think we're counting votes. It sure gives us a lot more flexibility.\"\n\nTrump has pushed for repealing the mandate, along with conservative senators and House members. But many lawmakers said reopening the health care debate would just make passing the tax bill harder.\n\nThe Senate plan would set a top individual tax rate of 38.5 percent, compared to the House's 39.6 percent for annual income above $1 million, and keep deductions for people with high medical bills and for student loan interest that the House wants to discard.\n\nIt would completely eliminate a federal deduction for state and local taxes, while the House had to mollify a group of GOP lawmakers from high-tax blue states by keeping the deduction for property taxes, up to $10,000.\n\nThe Senate kept the maximum mortgage deduction at the interest on loans up to $1 million. The House would cut it to $500,000.\n\nThe House targeted the estate tax â a favorite foil of conservative Republicans â for elimination in 2025, after doubling the current exemptions to about $11 million for individuals and $22 million for married couples. The Senate is proposing only to double the exemptions.\n\nThe House proposed expanding the child tax credit to $1,600 per child from $1,000. The Senate set the increase at $1,650.\n\nBut that is still too low for some senators who want a $2,000-per-child credit because they worry some middle-income people could otherwise see their taxes go up under the plan â and they have an ally in Ivanka Trump. \"While we are glad to see an increase to the child tax credit, like the House bill, it is simply not enough for working families,\" Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah), the main champions of the issue in the Senate, said in a joint statement.\n\nOn another hot-button issue, the treatment of \"pass-through\" businesses that pay individual tax rates, the Senate would set a top rate of 30 percent, while owners of those businesses have been clamoring for parity with corporations. The House is offering a super-low 9 percent rate on the first $75,000 those businesses earn, which attracted praise from the powerful National Federation of Independent Business, which had panned the House bill last week.\n\nBoth bills would shift the U.S. to a \"territorial\" tax system that would largely shield offshore corporate income from U.S. taxation. But they parted ways on a mechanism to discourage more companies from moving abroad to take advantage of the change.\n\nAs the first details were trickling out about the Senate plan, Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) unveiled a new round of changes to the House GOP's plan.\n\nTheir tax plan had ballooned beyond their budget, allowing them to cut taxes by no more than $1.5 trillion, after Republicans earlier this week gutted a plan to crack down on international tax avoidance hated by the Koch brothers and a number of multinational corporations.\n\nThe revisions include hundreds of billions of dollars in new revenue aimed at filling that budget hole. Republicans did it in part by taking back much of the money â $87 billion â they had lost when they watered down those overseas tax avoidance provisions.\n\nAnother $70 billion would come from charging companies more in a one-time tax on their overseas earnings. Under the new plan, they'd pay 14 percent on their liquid assets and 7 percent on illiquid ones like factories overseas. That's up from 12 percent and 5 percent, respectively, under the previous proposal.\n\nHouse lawmakers want to raise another $20 billion by requiring people claiming the popular child tax credit to provide a Social Security number for their child, a provision long sought by Republicans aimed at preventing undocumented immigrants from taking the break.\n\nDelaying their plans to repeal the estate tax by another year saved them $21.5 billion. They'd raise another $109 billion from companies tapping a long-standing break for research and development expenses.\n\nOther House provisions would expand a tax on private university endowments and impose a surtax on life insurance companies.\n\nThe plan also would allow organizations such as charities and churches to engage in political speech without risking their tax-exempt status, and it restored a tax break for adopting children that had been on the chopping block.\n\nSenate Finance Committee aides said the panel was still working to make its bill compliant with the chamber's budget rules, which don't allow the tax bill to add to deficits outside the 10-year budget window.\n\nGiven the GOP's slim majority in the Senate and the danger of a repeat of their Obamacare fiasco, some House Republicans were resigned to more or less having to defer to the Senate.\n\n\"I look at it more as a priority of process and procedure over substance,\" said Rep. Dennis Ross (R-Fla.). \"While there are some very good things, don't get me wrong, substantively in our bill, I think the canvas will probably be painted in its final stage in the Senate once we give them the vehicle.\"\n\nBen White, Josh Dawsey, Colin Wilhelm, Seung Min Kim, Elana Schor and Jennifer Haberkorn contributed to this report.",

Sometimes, I use all of those things to\n\nprep a single meal.\n\nBut\n\nthen two things happened that changed my perspective on what was truly\n\nessential: Our house was flooded, and I\n\nread a fantastic book about tidying up.\n\nLongtime\n\nblog readers know that several years ago, in the middle of the night, a pipe\n\nburst under the kitchen sink and covered the entire house with a couple of inches\n\nof water. While the water damage was being repaired, we were displaced to a cramped\n\nresidence inn for several months and I learned that we could get by in life\n\nwith much, much less. And this includes kitchen tools. I wonât lie â there are\n\nplenty of ânice-to-haveâ items that\n\ngreatly streamline and enhance my cooking. Iâll admit it: theyâre great\n\ntime-savers. But when push comes to shove, people only need a few items to cook\n\nup nourishing and tasty meals.\n\nMore\n\nrecently, I started reading Marie Kondoâs bestselling book, The Life-Changing\n\nMagic of Tidying Upâand itâs totally reinforced the need to purge stuff I\n\ndonât really need or that donât spark joy anymore. With this in mind, I consulted\n\nmy favorite review sites and came up with a pared down list of indispensible\n\ncooking tools.\n\nChefâs Knife: The best rated inexpensive\n\none is the Victorinox\n\nForschner Fibrox, which costs under $40. If youâre considering a\n\ncarbon-steel chefâs knife and money is no object, this $300 one by\n\nJ.A. Henckels designed by Bob Kramer, an American Master\n\nBladesmith, is considered one of the best. Americaâs Test Kitchen also\n\nrecommends a $100\n\nJapanese knife by Togiharu that is\n\nconsidered a best-buy. But if youâre going to spend this kind of money, you\n\nshould really try out these knives yourself. If youâre in NYC, go visit Korin in Lower\n\nManhattan, which is home to one of the most amazing and extensive collection of\n\nJapanese chefâs knives (a.k.a. gyuto) in the world.\n\nParing Knife: The one I use at home is\n\nthe J.A.\n\nHenckels International Classic 4-inch paring knife, but\n\nCookâs Illustrated recommends\n\none from Victorinox that only costs about $7.\n\nKnife Sharpener: The best manual\n\nsharpener is a cheap-o Accu-Sharp\n\nKnife & Tool Sharpener. For less\n\nthan ten dollars, you can sharpen your own knives in just a few strokes. Recently, Iâve been tempted to buy an electric knife sharpener, and the one\n\nrecommended by everybody is The Chefâs\n\nChoice Trizor XV ($160). It sharpens European, American, and\n\nJapanese knivesâboth serrated and straight!âand it can convert a 20\n\ndegree factory edge to a 15 degree edge, which means youâre getting an even\n\nsharper edge.\n\nPeelers: I keep three vegetable peelers\n\nin the kitchen: One with a regular blade (an OXO Good\n\nGrips Pro Swivel Peeler), one with a serrated edge for grabbing onto\n\nsmooth-skinned ripe fruits and vegetables (a Kuhn Rikon\n\nPiranha Serrated Peeler), and one that makes quick work of julienning\n\nzucchini into âzoodlesâ (a Kuhn Rikon\n\nJulienne Peeler).\n\nKitchen Shears: To be perfectly honest,\n\nyou donât really need shears if youâve got a great knife, but a sharp pair of scissors\n\ncan help handle a host of tasks in the kitchen, from trimming herbs to spatchcocking\n\na chicken. Iâve tried a bunch of shears and my new favorite pair is the Kershaw\n\nTaskmaster, which I learned about from Americaâs Test\n\nKitchen. Iâve used them to debone my Cracklinâ\n\nChicken for a couple of years now, and they havenât\n\ndulled on me yet!\n\nCutting Board: If you want a great\n\nwooden board, a John Boos\n\nMaple Cutting Board is a fantastic option. Plastic is also a much\n\nmore cost-friendly option, and some folks like it better because you can toss\n\nplastic cutting boards in the dishwasher. The Oxo Good\n\nGrips Cutting Board is a polypropylene board with rubber strips on\n\nboth sides. Itâs lightweight, non-slip, and fabulous.\n\nCast iron skillets: In our kitchen, I have a Lodge Logic pre-seasoned 12-inch cast iron skillet, as well as an 8-inch version (the one I use to fry crispy eggs). I love âem, but donât presume that the companyâs âpre-seasoningâ is sufficient. Youâll still need to season the skillets, so follow the instructions in this post. To maintain\n\nyour cast iron skillets, just make sure you clean them after each use,\n\nwipe them dry and also put them on a hot burner to dry, before rubbing a bit of\n\nmelted fat onto all surfaces. I used to think you couldnât use soap to clean\n\nthem, but J. Kenji Lopez-Alt of Serious Eats debunked this myth a few months\n\nago in an article titled, âThe Truth\n\nAbout Cast Iron: 7 Myths That Need to Go Away.\n\nHeat-Resistant Oven Mitts: Choose a\n\nglove made of Kevlar or Nomex â theyâll allow you to handle items that are hundreds\n\nof degrees in temperature. I used to have Ove Glove branded gloves, but a lot\n\nof reviewers on Amazon say that the new ones donât work as well. As a result,\n\nIâve done some digging, and my newest recommendation is to buy gloves from the\n\nbrand Grill Heat\n\nAid. Theyâve gotten over A THOUSAND great\n\nreviews on Amazon, and it has a no-hassle 100% money back guarantee.\n\nTongs: You donât need anything fancy\n\nhere; just get a basic pair of locking tongs with wide-scalloped pincers, and\n\nyouâll be all set. I have a few pairs of OXO Good\n\nGrips locking tongs of differing lengths in the kitchen,\n\nbut when weâre doing high-heat grilling in the backyard, we use a set of 16-inch\n\ntongs by Progressive International. And yes, I am aware that many famous chefs (e.g. David Chang and Thomas Keller) hate tongs with a searing passion, but who cares? (Not this home cook.)\n\nInstant-Read, In-Oven Thermometer: These\n\nthermometers arenât super pricey, so donât be penny-wise and pound-foolish:\n\nInvest in a good one so you donât screw up your expensive meat. I have a ChefAlarm by ThermoWorks and it works like a charm. I also have a Thermapen which is\n\nsuper accurate, but more expensive and you have to keep opening the oven to\n\ncheck the temperature.\n\nRimmed Baking Sheet: Even though most\n\npeople use them as cookie sheets, you donât have to use them to bake cookies. I\n\nuse them instead to roast meats and vegetables or to crisp up batches of kale\n\nchips. A kitchen supply store is a great place to stock up on rimmed\n\nbaking sheets, but you can also find them online.\n\nPersonally, I recommend getting sheets that are no smaller than 13â by 18â â otherwise\n\nknown as half-sheets. You might be tempted to get a full baking sheet, but\n\ntheyâre too big for most home ovens.\n\nWire Cooling Racks: I use wire racks to keep my roasted meats from sitting in a\n\npuddle of grease in the oven, to elevate the proteins Iâm about to set ablaze\n\nwith my kitchen torch, or to keep my crispy sweet potato fries from going limp and\n\nsoggy. Trust me â\n\nwire racks will come in handy in a number of kitchen situations. My favorite\n\nracks are made of stainless steel âcause\n\ntheyâre practically indestructible, unlike the chrome-lined ones that can flake\n\noff with use.\n\n(If youâre curious about how I came up with my recommendations, I pored over these trusted resources: The Cookâs Illustrated website, Consumer Search, and The Sweet Home. I also have an older post about my essential cooking tools that you can read here.)\n\nCrush of the Week:\n\nI\n\nchat about how much I love Marie Kondoâs book, The Life-Changing Magic of\n\nTidying Up, Big-O tells us how toothpicks arenât just for stabbing food, and\n\nLil-O fills us in on the awesomness of stainless steel drinking straws.\n\n(FYI: The other books on my nightstand include a review copy of Tess Mastersâs The Blender Girl Smoothies, Jenny Castanedaâs One-Pot Paleo, and Russ Crandallâs Paleo Takeout.)\n\nQuestion of the week:\n\nCynthia\n\nasked in an email: I have to ask you if you can talk about cheat days when\n\nyou do Paleo. I eat Paleo-, Whole30-approved foods everyday, but sometimes I\n\nschedule a cheat day on the weekend. I would appreciate it if you can have\n\nan episode about cheat days.

  "latent_2908": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian government forces used newly arrived Russian warplanes to bombard Islamic State insurgents in Aleppo province in northern Syria, a group monitoring the civil war said on Thursday, in an attempt to break a siege on a nearby air base.\n\nRussia is bolstering its ally Damascus against rebels with military aid that U.S. officials say has included fighter jets, helicopter gunships, artillery and ground forces.\n\nThe air strikes, which began earlier this week, were accompanied by ground attacks near the Kweiris air base in the east of Aleppo province, where government troops have long been surrounded by Islamist militants, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.\n\nThe Russian jets arrived only ârecentlyâ in Syria but were being flown by Syrian pilots, said the Observatory, which tracks Syriaâs conflict via a network of sources on the ground.\n\nMany Western countries have reacted with alarm to Moscowâs increased military support for President Bashar al-Assad, whom they oppose. But the rise of a common enemy, Islamic State, has rendered divisions less clear.\n\nThe United States is waging its own aerial campaign against the militants in Syria and Iraq. Stronger Russian involvement in Syria means that forces of the former Cold War foes could encounter each other as they battle the same enemy.\n\nRussia says Assad, its closest Middle East ally, should be part of international efforts to fight Islamic State, while the United States believes he is part of the problem.\n\nSyrian government forces have stepped up air strikes against Islamic State in areas it controls since the arrival of fresh Russian military hardware, including in Raqqa, the jihadist groupâs de facto capital in Syria.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition that is operating out of neighboring Turkey has also hit IS targets in Raqqa. The United States has warned Syria not to interfere in its air campaign.\n\nA mosque preacher in Raqqa spoke on Thursday about the Russian âinterventionâ, the Observatory said, welcoming it as a chance for IS militants to fight against Russian forces.\n\nRussia has confirmed it has âexpertsâ on the ground, but has declined to comment on the exact scale and scope of its military presence in Syria.\n\nMoscowâs increased support also comes after advances against Assadâs forces this year by non-Islamic State insurgents, including the governmentâs recent loss of a major air base and last bastion in the northwestern province of Idlib.",
  "latent_3003": "It's recently been revealed that the U.S. government contracted HBGary Federal for the development of software which could create multiple fake social media profiles to manipulate and sway public opinion on controversial issues by promoting propaganda. It could also be used as surveillance to find public opinions with points of view the powers-that-be didn't like. It could then potentially have their \"fake\" people run smear campaigns against those \"real\" people. As disturbing as this is, it's not really new for U.S. intelligence or private intelligence firms to do the dirty work behind closed doors.\n\nEFF previously warned that Big Brother wants to be your friend for social media surveillance. While the FBI Intelligence Information Report Handbook (PDF) mentioned using \"covert accounts\" to access protected information, other government agencies endorsed using security exploits to access protected information.\n\nIt's not a big surprise that the U.S. military also wants to use social media to its benefit. Last year, Public Intelligence published the U.S. Air Force social media guide which gave 10 tips for social media such as, \"The enemy is engaged in this battlespace and you must engage there as well.\" Number three was \"DON'T LIE. Credibility is critical, without it, no one cares what you have to say...it's also punishable by the UCMJ to give a false statement.\" The Air Force used the chart below to show how social media influences public opinion.\n\nThe 6th Contracting Squadron at MacDill Air Force Base sought the development of Persona Management Software which could be used for creating and managing fake profiles on social media sites to distort the truth and make it appear as if there was a generally accepted agreement on controversial issues. \"Personas must be able to appear to originate in nearly any part of the world and can interact through conventional online services and social media platforms.\" What happened to don't lie and the Uniform Code of Military Justice?\n\nEverything revealed after Anonymous leaked emails from private security firm HBGary Federal is disturbing on many levels. However, the Daily Kos said with the Persona Management Software it would take very few people to create \"an army of sockpuppets\" which could distort the truth while appearing to be \"an entire Brooks Brothers riot online.\"\n\nSo again I ask, what happened to number three . . . the rule about not lying that was also \"punishable by the UCMJ to give a false statement\"?\n\nPresident and CEO of Plessas Experts Network, Inc, Kirby Plessas pointed out some of the unethical and potentially illegal activities that Aaron Barr's leaked emails suggested like \"Chumming and baiting\" which sounded like \"entrapment of some sort.\" There would be no warrant for the data collected on individuals which could then be stored for how long? \"THIS is the entire reason Intelligence Oversight was created -- to avoid this sort of thing from ever happening again.\"\n\nAccording to Redacted News, the leaked emails showed how names can be cross-referenced across social media sites to collect information on people and then used to gain access to those social ciricles. The emails also talked of how Facebook could be used to spread government messages:\n\nEven the most restrictive and security conscious of persons can be exploited. Through the targeting and information reconnaissance phase, a person's hometown and high school will be revealed. An adversary can create a classmates.com account at the same high school and year and find out people you went to high school with that do not have Facebook accounts, then create the account and send a friend request. Under the mutual friend decision, which is where most people can be exploited, an adversary can look at a targets friend list if it is exposed and find a targets most socially promiscuous friends, the ones that have over 300-500 friends, friend them to develop mutual friends before sending a friend request to the target. To that end friend's accounts can be compromised and used to post malicious material to a targets wall. When choosing to participate in social media an individual is only as protected as his/her weakest friend.\n\nLots of people have multiple online aliases, Facebook or Twitter accounts for both business and private life. What most bothers me is the lying and seemingly unethical means to an end. Although the government says it doesn't approve of censorship, etc, when its secrets come to light, it seems to be Okay with recommending underhanded tactics.\n\nSecretary Clinton delivered a speech called, \"Internet Rights and Wrongs: Choices and Challenges In A Networked World.\" To help promote and support Internet freedom, the State Department intends to award $25 million in grants. While that is great news, the EFF reported, \"For every strong statement about preserving liberty, freedom of expression, and privacy on the global Internet, there exists a countervailing example of the United States attempting to undermine those same values.\"\n\nSecretary Clinton later told \"This Week\" anchor Christiane Amanpou that most Americans \"are in favor of human rights, freedom, democracy. We know that ultimately the most progress that can be made on behalf of human beings anywhere is when those individuals are empowered, when they have governments that are responsive.\" Clinton added, \"At the same time, we recognize that this process can be hijacked. It can be hijacked by both outside and inside elements within any country.\"\n\nSo while the U.S. government can talk a good talk, what it does and what it says often doesn't seem to jive. Gasp, I know, it's not a big shocker but sometimes I find that utterly frustrating. The President wanted an Internet Kill Switch, the FBI keeps pushing for backdoors on all-things-Net. What happened to a code of ethics? Does it disappear behind closed doors, dirty deeds done in the dark and used against the American people who are supposed to be free to express themselves?\n\nThis story, \"Army of Fake Social Media Friends to Promote Propaganda\" was originally published by Computerworld .",
  "latent_3087": "Protesters gathered in front of Verizon stores around the US on Thursday in a last-ditch effort to save the rules governing net neutrality.\n\nEnlarge Image Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nThe protests were organized by several advocacy groups, including Fight for the Future, in the hope of pressuring Republicans in Congress to stop the FCC from rolling back the controversial rules adopted in 2015 under President Barack Obama.\n\nThe FCC is expected to vote next week on a proposal that would repeal regulations prohibiting broadband and wireless companies from slowing or blocking access to the internet and banning them from charging internet companies fees to access their customers faster than competitors. The proposal will also strip the FCC of authority to regulate broadband networks, leaving policing of the internet to another federal agency, the Federal Trade Commission. (Our FAQ explaining what Net Neutrality means can be found here.)\n\nProtesters at a rally in New York City held signs outside the Verizon store near Bryant Park stating \"Net Neutrality is Freedom of Speech\" and \"Keep the Internet Free.\" There were also posts to social media using the hashtag #StoptheFCC.\n\nIn Washington, DC, protesters gathered outside the annual FCC chairman's dinner and were joined by Democratic FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, who tweeted a picture of herself speaking to the crowd.\n\nThe protests are the latest sign of the public support for net neutrality, which is the principle that all internet traffic should be treated equally. Democrats and consumer advocacy groups argue the rules are necessary to ensure the internet service providers don't abuse their power, favoring some traffic -- like their own services -- over the competition.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Protesters gather to raise net neutrality awareness\n\nBut broadband companies support FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to dismantle the rules, arguing the regulation is heavy-handed and has hurt investment. Verizon was the target of the protest because Pai worked as a lawyer for the carrier before his appointment to the FCC. The company has said it has no plans to block or slow access to the internet. But Verizon has opposed the reclassification of broadband, which imposes stricter regulation on its networks.\n\n\"Like those expressing their views today, Verizon fully supports an open Internet and believe consumers should be able to use it to access lawful content when, where, and how they want,\" the company said in a statement. \"We've publicly committed to that before and we stand by that commitment today.\"\n\nPai, who was appointed chairman by President Donald Trump earlier this year, says the agency is returning to the same light touch regulatory regime of previous administrations including under Democrat Bill Clinton.\n\nBut supporters of net neutrality say that without rules, broadband providers will have too much control over consumers' access to the internet and will shut out competitors in favor of their own services, leading to less innovation and higher prices.\n\nThe issue has become starkly partisan in Congress with Democrats united in their calls to keep the regulations in place. Earlier this week, more than two dozen Democratic senators sent a letter to the FCC asking the agency to delay the vote.\n\nIn recent weeks, it's been discovered that millions of comments on the net neutrality repeal proposal were from fake accounts and using stolen identities. Democratic FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel along with New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Democrats in the US Senate have urged the FCC to postpone its vote until the comments can be examined.\n\n\"When the @FCC #NetNeutrality record is corrupted by a million comments with identity theft & half a million comments from Russia we need to stop & ask what went wrong,\" Rosenworcel said in a tweet Thursday. \"Public integrity matters.\"\n\nTech Culture: From film and television to social media and games, here's your place for the lighter side of tech.\n\n'Alexa, be more human': Inside Amazon's effort to make its voice assistant smarter, chattier and more like you.",

  "latent_3315": "Andre Ward was able to witness Gennady Golovkin's destruction of Gabe Rosado first-hand this past Saturday as Ward was a member of the broadcast team in place of the absent Roy Jones Jr. Afterwards, Ward was able to share his thought on Golovkin and the potential of a fight between himself and the rising middleweight contender.\n\nHere is what he had to say, via Boxing Scene:\n\n\"Golovkin is a strong kid, \" Ward said. \"Physically, he looks like he hits pretty hard, he's got some heavy hands. He looks like he's getting a push from media and fans. I think he's got potential, but I think he's got work to do. He's gotta beat some upper-echelon guys. \"Right now, it doesn't look like those guys want to fight him, so it's not his fault. But I definitely feel like that could be a big fight (between he and Golovkin) down the road.\"\n\nI think Ward is being honest here. It would be nice to see Golovkin fight some more top-tier type of opponents, but it doesn't appear as if they are excited about fighting him. As for Ward saying Golovkin needs to \"beat some upper-echelon guys\" well, Kelly Pavlik certainly had not achieved that for a while and he was able to sign a contract for a fight with Ward.\n\nWard also claimed Golovkin is \"getting a push from media and fans\", and I think that's pretty obvious. And it's easy to see why. Golovkin is always coming forward, trying to knock his opponent out with seemingly every punch. Boxing fans like that kind of stuff. Probably the only other boxer I can think of at the moment that gets close to as much #BoxingHead intimacy is Lucas Matthysse.\n\nAnyways, a fight between Ward and Golovkin is certainly one that I would not mind to see. It would be interesting to see if GGG could take SOG out of his comfort zone. Twenty-six have tried and 26 have failed. Is that trademarked?",

Let it guide you into the pit of despair where my master awaits.â\n\nThose were the words the hateful thing had spoken to him. And so the priest had a new path to follow, the path to his daughter. At the time, he knew very little of vampires, and that which he did know came mostly from his reading of Bram Stoker, and from mainstream television. He had presumed that the vampire that had taken her, had surely turned her. Or if not it, surely this âmasterâ had done the deed. Therefore, it was his fatherly duty to hunt her down and free her of her curse before she could pass the curse on to others.\n\nHis searching was for naught. Every possible lead ended in disappointment, and a bloody trail of corpses left in his wake. His reputation as a vampire slayer began to spread through the underground circuit, and he soon found himself to be constantly under attack as soon as darkness fell upon the the city. He turned to smoking to calm his fleeting nerves, and when a pack of Marlboros was no longer enough, he turned to strong drink to force himself to sleep. It wasnât long after this that his reputation as a dangerous hunter of the damned, was replaced with that of a booze sodden drunk. The attacks became fewer, and soon the priest was spending more nights in the county jailâs drunk tank, than he was out on the hunt.",

How does the winter of 2013-14 stack up for counts of minimum temperatures at or below zero in the Twin Cities? As of February 8, there have been 41 minimum temperatures of zero or colder: 13 in December, 20 in January and 8 so far in February. This is the most number of minimums at or below zero in a winter since the winter of 1981-82 when the total was 46.

Iâve been tracking a potential warm up for about two weeks now. I think I can finally stop using words like âpotential.â Itâs going to warm up this week, and it looks like our February thaw may kick into high gear next week.\n\nWe endure one more sub-zero start Tuesday morning, then temps start to budge into the 20s on stiff southerly winds Wednesday. But Thursday you may be doing a double-take as your local bank thermometer flashes 32 degrees or higher.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâs Global Forecast System and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts models are insisting at a major pattern change that brings sustained southerly winds, and much warmer temps.\n\nBoth models at this point crank out a string of days in the 30s, and even 40s by the middle of next week.\n\nRâ¦.Rain?\n\nYes, that was hard to type. I had to think about it for a minute. Remember rain?\n\nThe GFS is winding up a storm system toward the middle of next week. Hereâs the surface map for next Wednesday with a strong low pressure center in North Dakota, and a warm southerly push into Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\nIf this map verifies, temps could surge well into the 40s with rain, and maybe even a clap of thunder in parts of southern Minnesota and Wisconsin. That would be truly weird in this winter. But, hey, why not?\n\nHereâs a look at the longer range 16-day GFS output. Temps as high as 47 next week? Who knows? But it looks like winter may return after temps run a good +10 to +15 degrees vs. average next week for a change.\n\nNote the absence of any sub-zero temps.\n\nHereâs a map you havenât seen in a long time.

  "latent_3796": "Aging cripples the production of new immune cells, decreasing the immune systemâs response to vaccines and putting the elderly at risk of infection, but antioxidants in the diet may slow this damaging process.\n\nThatâs a new finding by scientists from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), published in an open-access paper in the journal Cell Reports.\n\nThe problem is focused on an organ called the thymus, which produces T lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) â critical immune cells that must be continuously replenished so they can respond to new infections.\n\nâThe thymus begins to atrophy rapidly in very early adulthood, simultaneously losing its function,â said TSRI Professor Howard Petrie.\n\nâThis new study shows for the first time a mechanism for the long-suspected connection between normal immune function and antioxidants.â\n\nHow antioxidant enzyme deficiency leads to metabolic damage\n\nScientists have been hampered in their efforts to develop specific immune therapies for the elderly by a lack of knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of this process.\n\nTo explore these mechanisms, Petrie and his team developed a computational approach for analyzing the activity of genes in two major cell types in the thymus â stromal cells and lymphoid cells â in mouse tissues, which are similar to human tissues in terms of function and age-related atrophy.\n\nThe team found that stromal cells were specifically deficient in an antioxidant enzyme called catalase. That resulted in elevated levels of the reactive oxygen byproducts of metabolism, which cause accelerated metabolic damage.*\n\nNew support for the âfree-radical theoryâ of aging\n\nTaken together, the findings provide support for the âfree-radical theoryâ of aging, which proposes that reactive oxygen species (such as hydrogen peroxide), produced during normal metabolism (and from other sources) cause cellular damage that contributes to aging and age-related diseases.\n\nFree radicals are especially reactive atoms or groups of atoms that have one or more unpaired electrons. Besides those produced in the body as a by-product of normal metabolism, they can also be introduced from an outside source, such as tobacco smoke or other toxins.\n\nOther studies have suggested that sex hormones, particularly androgens such as testosterone, play a major role in the aging process. But according to the researchers, those studies have failed to answer the key question: why does the thymus atrophy so much more rapidly than other body tissues?\n\nâThereâs no question that the thymus is remarkably responsive to androgens,â Petrie noted, âbut our study shows that the fundamental mechanism of aging in the thymus, namely accumulated metabolic damage, is the same as in other body tissues. However, the process is accelerated in the thymus by a deficiency in the essential protective effects of catalase, which is found at higher levels in almost all other body tissues.â\n\nItâs complicated\n\nHowever, lowering free radicals with antioxidants has not always conferred the expected benefits, according to Senior scientist and Buck Institute professor Judith Campisi, PhD.\n\nIn a study published August 3 online in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists in her lab bred mice that produced excess free radicals that damaged the mitochondria in their skin. Based on the free-radical theory, the scientists expected to see accelerated aging across the mouse lifespan.\n\nInstead, they saw a surprising benefit in young animals: accelerated wound healing due to increased epidermal (skin) differentiation and re-epithelialization.\n\nHowever, the mice paid a price over time. Campisi said mitochondrial damage from excess free radicals caused some of the skin cells to go into senescence â they stopped dividing and started accumulating. Campisi said that over time, the energy available to the epidermal stems cells was depleted â the stem cells simply became too scarce and the mice showed expected signs of aging: thin skin and poor wound healing.\n\nâIt may be that nature used free radicals to optimize skin health, but because this process is not deleterious to the organism until later in life, past its reproductive age, there was no [evolutionary benefit from evolving] ways to alter this mechanism,â suggested Michael Velarde, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Campisi lab.\n\n* To confirm the central role of catalase, the scientists increased levels of this enzyme in genetically altered animal models, resulting in preservation of thymus size for a much longer period. In addition, animals that were given two common dietary antioxidants, including vitamin C, were also protected from the effects of aging on the thymus.\n\nAbstract of Metabolic Damage and Premature Thymus Aging Caused by Stromal Catalase Deficiency\n\nT lymphocytes are essential mediators of immunity that are produced by the thymus in proportion to its size. The thymus atrophies rapidly with age, resulting in progressive diminution of new T cell production. This decreased output is compensated by duplication of existing T cells, but it results in gradual dominance by memory T cells and decreased ability to respond to new pathogens or vaccines. Here, we show that accelerated and irreversible thymic atrophy results from stromal deficiency in the reducing enzyme catalase, leading to increased damage by hydrogen peroxide generated by aerobic metabolism. Genetic complementation of catalase in stromal cells diminished atrophy, as did chemical antioxidants, thus providing a mechanistic link between antioxidants, metabolism, and normal immune function. We propose that irreversible thymic atrophy represents a conventional aging process that is accelerated by stromal catalase deficiency in the context of an intensely anabolic (lymphoid) environment.\n\nAbstract of Pleiotropic age-dependent effects of mitochondrial dysfunction on epidermal stem cells\n\nTissue homeostasis declines with age partly because stem/progenitor cells fail to self-renew or differentiate. Because mitochondrial damage can accelerate aging, we tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction impairs stem cell renewal or function. We developed a mouse model, Tg(KRT14-cre/Esr1)20Efu/J Ã Sod2tm1Smel, that generates mitochondrial oxidative stress in keratin 14-expressing epidermal stem/progenitor cells in a temporally controlled manner owing to deletion of Sod2, a nuclear gene that encodes the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2). Epidermal Sod2 loss induced cellular senescence, which irreversibly arrested proliferation in a fraction of keratinocytes. Surprisingly, in young mice, Sod2 deficiency accelerated wound closure, increasing epidermal differentiation and reepithelialization, despite the reduced proliferation. In contrast, at older ages, Sod2 deficiency delayed wound closure and reduced epidermal thickness, accompanied by epidermal stem cell exhaustion. In young mice, Sod2 deficiency accelerated epidermal thinning in response to the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, phenocopying the reduced regeneration of older Sod2-deficient skin. Our results show a surprising beneficial effect of mitochondrial dysfunction at young ages, provide a potential mechanism for the decline in epidermal regeneration at older ages, and identify a previously unidentified age-dependent role for mitochondria in skin quality and wound closure.",

The asset sales programme produced only $3.9 billion worth of proceeds to the Crown to date, even before sales costs are deducted.\n\nâNational isnât selling our assets to pay for schools and hospitals; theyâre flogging them off to fill a hole left in the budget by the tax cuts that they gave the top 10%,â said Dr Norman.\n\nâJohn Keyâs assets sales are part of a money go round. The well-off got tax cuts from National, they then bought shares in Nationalâs asset sales, and the sale proceeds are going towards covering the cost of those tax cuts.\n\nâNational says its asset sales are necessary to maintain its capital spending programme without borrowing more. The truth is, they wouldnât need to borrow the money if they hadnât given massive tax cuts to the well-off in the first place. In the past, new capital spending has been funded from ordinary tax, not through desperate asset sales.\n\nâAll this privatisation of public wealth does no good for New Zealand as a whole and it leaves a permanent hole in the Governmentâs books, which will still be there once the asset sales end.\n\nâNew Zealanders donât want their assets sold to the wealthy to pay for John Keyâs tax cuts for the top 10%. Thatâs why weâve seen such strong turnout in the referendum with nearly 700,000 votes returned so far,â said Dr Norman.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nEstimated fiscal cost of the reductions in the top income tax rate received by the top 10% of earners\n\nOctober years Cost of cut to top income tax rate received by top 10% of earners $m 2009 $79 Cut from 39% to 38% as of April 1 2010 $159 Cut from 38% to 33% as of October 1 2011 $976 2012 $1,067 2013 $1,114 2014 $1,161 Total by Election 2014 $4,557 Sources: IRD taxpayer data and Household Economic Survey\n\nContent Sourced from scoop.co.nz\n\nOriginal url",
  "latent_3842": "Mr. Obamaâs Republican rival in the presidential campaign, Senator John McCain, has placed a sizable electoral bet that he can sweep predominantly white, working-class Beaver County and a dozen more Pennsylvania counties like it. Last week, Mr. McCain spoke before thousands in Moon Township, and two days later his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, drew more than 2,000 fans to a rally in Beaver.\n\nBut to walk the back streets of the Beaver River mill cities â the biggest mills were long ago shuttered â and to visit rural hamlets like Economy and Hookstown is to hear more than a few Democrats saying they intend, however reluctantly, to support their partyâs standard-bearer, particularly as the world economy cracks and heaves. Many Democrats, and a few independents, wonder if Mr. McCain is too old and Ms. Palin too unsophisticated to take his place.\n\nPhoto\n\nSuch sentiments could bode ill for Mr. McCain, who hopes for a surprise victory in Pennsylvania to rescue his presidential bid. And they dovetail with poll findings that show a gravitation of white voters, female and male, toward Mr. Obamaâs camp. To try to stanch that flow and tap into doubts about Mr. Obama, Mr. McCain will return to the state on Monday for the second time in a week and then appear on Tuesday with Ms. Palin as they try to sway voters like Mr. Piroli.\n\nMr. McCain may have an opening: 35 interviews over three days offer up a conversation about race and presidential choices, and that is where the greatest uncertainty lies for Mr. Obama. Sometimes race talk runs like a subterranean river. Sometimes it floats right on the surface.\n\nIn Ambridge, an Ohio River factory town named after the company that gave it fame â American Bridge â Olga Permon, a 71-year-old steelworkerâs widow and a lifelong Democrat, climbs the stoop of her yellow-brick home. She considers the field: Mr. McCain? A grouchy old man. Ms. Palin? Please. No way. What about Mr. Obama?\n\nHer pause goes on and on. âHe scares me,â Mrs. Permon said. âThe coloreds are excited, but my friends and I plan to write in Hillaryâs name.â\n\nThese are not gentle lands for Mr. Obama. A visit here in August found even deeper suspicions of him in Beaver County, where Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton beat him by 40 percentage points in the Democratic primary. Democrats outnumber Republicans, but voters here tilt either way in presidential elections.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, a worsening economy has worked to the Democratsâ advantage. Mr. Obama and his running mate, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., drew 8,000 to a rally in Beaver a month ago; John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, stumped on Saturday in Beaver; and many dozens of union members go door to door each weekend, rounding up votes. They remind their fellow workers that Mr. McCain had supported privatization of Social Security, a move they say could have left worker retirement accounts trapped in a plummeting stock market.\n\nâThis is McCainâs Hail Mary; they looked at the huge margin here for Hillary Clinton in the primary and figured, âHmm, we have a shot,â â said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College, in Lancaster. âBut itâs going to be very difficult here for him to get the margins needed to offset the cities and the eastern suburbs.â\n\nIn Ambridge, Vince Pisano, 47, a union plumber, reflects that challenge. As he sits on his porch, he considers collapses â of the economy and his retirement account. He is firm for Mr. Obama, but he is in a small club.\n\nPhoto\n\nâClose friends, real close, tell me they canât get past his race,â said Mr. Pisano, flashing his give-me-a-break look. âIf Obama were white, this would be a landslide around here.â\n\nBeaver was known as the cake-eaterâs town. Steel management lived here, and its elegant Edwardian and Victorian homes, with oak and mahogany beams, lend a grace to the streets.\n\nMs. Palin has taken a lead role in wooing culturally conservative counties like Beaver. She held a rally here and obtained the endorsement of the Beaver High School football coach, who paraded his players and cheerleaders onto the field for her, and the crowds cheered when she spoke of her opposition to abortion. This is a theologically conservative province â Catholic churches vie with conservative Protestant and evangelical churches.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Over at Sheffield Lanes, mention of her name summons no glint from older bowlers, or from Jeremy and Joe Long, in their 20s, tipping Buds. They liked Mrs. Clinton but pass on Ms. Palin.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nâSheâs always talking about the âAverage Joe,â â Jeremy Long said. âAverage me! I donât want myself in the Oval Office. I want someone smarter.â\n\nThe next day, just up the street on Linden Avenue, Grace Ruscitti, a retired schoolteacher, stood on her porch on a block of modest steel-worker bungalows. She was still upset about Mr. McCainâs choice of Ms. Palin. âThat was an insult to our intelligence,â Ms. Ruscitti said. âThis barracuda nonsense. Tell me, whereâd they find her?â\n\nPhoto\n\nNone of which is to suggest that Mr. McCain does not have deep reservoirs of support. The Rev. Chris Noyes, a Presbyterian minister in Beaver Falls, a city with broad avenues and storefronts that are more vacant than not, estimates that two-thirds of his congregation supports the Republican ticket.\n\nTalk to Derek Wood, 28, as his Dalmatian tugs at a leash, and he says he is voting for Mr. McCain. He likes the tax cuts.\n\nPeople here have voted for Democrats since the 1930s, Mr. Wood said, and what is left? Ghosts hang from oaks and pumpkins sit on porches, but there are no children to demand trick or treat. If you are 28, you rent a U-Haul truck and leave.\n\nâItâs a great place to live from 45 and up,â Mr. Wood said.\n\nThe Republicans have also poured money into advertising. Until early October, the McCain campaign had outspent the Obama campaign in Pennsylvania. And commercials and e-mail messages from unaffiliated groups have sown doubt: about Mr. Obamaâs ties to William Ayers, the former member of the 1960s-era Weather Underground radical group; about his connection to Acorn, an organizing group being accused of voter-registration fraud; about his religion. The rumors and charges form a subliminal closed loop.\n\nThe white-haired Judy Miller, âMiss Judyâ to customers, slaps together a turkey hoagie in Hookstown, near the West Virginia border. Mention of Mr. Obama brings a frown. âWho is he? Whoâs behind him?â she said. âThis radical at the university thing, the Muslim stuff.â\n\nA union distributes a leaflet here titled âThe Truth About Barack Obama,â which says: âIs he a Christian? Yes. Was he sworn in on a Bible? Yes. Was he born in America? Yes.â\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, doubts about Mr. Obama persist. Mrs. Permon, the steelworkerâs widow, plans to write in Mrs. Clintonâs name. Rita Ratjer, another steel widow, plans to sit it out altogether.\n\nBut in between sits the housebound Peggy Doffin. Her knees are gone and she takes groceries, mail deliveries and interviews through her first-floor window. At 79, with her fat tabby cat in her arms, she has lived through the Great Depression and fears another coming. Once she was a confirmed âHillary womanâ and not a fan of Mr. Obama. Then she listened to his convention speech and, she said, âchills ran down my back.â\n\nâRace just donât matter to me any more,â she said. âBut a lot of Democrats out thereâ â she shrugged â âweâll find out on Election Day, wonât we?â",

Then I remember reading a post...so I uninstalled Precision, removed the directory...and did a clean install of my video drivers. Then re-installed Precision XOC 6.1.1 and tried again. What I learned was use the default custom fan curves that came with Precision. Make sure to enable auto fan control...the \"auto\" under the fan tach will light up blue...see if that helps. I actually have both fans spinning now and they do follow the curve.\n\nI had some issues where the fans only spun at 40%.

They have the card but it's it's not showing up as received or shipped or anything. Anybody else have this lack of communication during their upgrade?\n\nI am curious on when you requested the icx upgrade?\n\nEVGA says there is a queue, but after speaking to different individuals on multiple forums there doesn't seem to be any organization to the supposed queue. Some of the people that requested it days after myself have already been through the processes with their new cards in transit/delivered.\n\nWith the Ti announcement, I am in no huge rush to get my icx upgrade and start the 90 day step up, but I certainly would like to understand how this queuing up process actually works, because it almost seems like they are randomly approving upgrades from the request pile. I have been waiting approval since shortly after the upgrade process was announced...\n\nHi,The queue is always processed in order, but please keep in mind that each part number has it's own queue and each region has their own queue.I assure you that you will receive the card as soon as it is available to assist and thank you for your patience.\n\n#493\n\nCozmo85 New Member Total Posts : 79\n\nReward points : 0\n\nJoined:\n\nStatus: offline\n\nRibbons : 0 Re: EVGA GeForce GTX 10 Series Cards with iCX Technology! permalink) EVGATech_ChrisB\n\ncrazyg0od33,\n\nI can confirm that the price used for the Step-up value on the ICX upgrade cards is the M.S.R.P. price originally listed on EVGA.com and not the newly updated price.

But really I'm not worried, being in Canada we always have to wait longer than the US customers.

I am a little disconcerted that I haven't heard anything yet. . .\n\nThere is many queues and many regions. It takes time. There is no teeling how many people were ahead of you in your queue line.\n\nI think part of the frustration you see people having is because they do see people with the same cards getting theirs taken care of first even though they entered the queue later. Now we (well I do) know that there are separate queues, but it still sucks to see others get it done sooner. Heck I know, I have 2 1080FTW cards and entered the queue (well first one did) on Feb 10th in the evening. And I have seen a few people get their FTW's already and I mean get the email and ship their cards and get the ICX already, where I have gotten nothing. But really I'm not worried, being in Canada we always have to wait longer than the US customers. Ok, that does annoy me a bit, but at least I'm used to it.\n\nYes. Canada.

  "latent_3994": "Peacetime-Wartime; Inflation-Deflation; the Trump Era Begins\n\nDavid R Kotok\n\nCumberland, November 14, 2016\n\nShilling is a well-known name in the circles of economics and financial markets. Iâve had the pleasure of fishing with him and tasting his superb honey â he is a beekeeping hobbyist. Gary and his team are deeply thoughtful and often provocative.\n\nIn his latest monthly missive he reiterates a position that warrants reflection. He concludes one section of his report with this observation: âIf peace is the norm in the years ahead, history implies deflation.â That strategic assumption is profound with regard to the outlook for interest rates and for markets. And it must give some pause to central bank policymakers.\n\nGary is thinking strategically and not about month-to-month data fluctuations. He supports his argument with over two and a half centuries of US data. He notes that there were 96 years of wartime in that period. He lists all of them. During wartime, the average change in annualized wholesale price inflation was 5.85%.\n\nGary points to about 170 years of peacetime. The average annualized wholesale inflation was a negative 1.14%.\n\nSome of this data is ancient, like that for the Revolutionary War and the French and Indian War. So someone might well say there is a question about data gathering and that the world is quite different now. Maybe so, but the pattern is the same if we look at just the last century.\n\nThe two years of World War I inflation (1917â18) averaged about 24% annualized. The peacetime period between the two world wars (1919â1940) averaged a negative 2.3%. Garyâs conclusion is validated in the first half of the last century.\n\nFive years of World War II (1941â5) averaged 6% annualized wholesale price inflation. The ensuing Cold War period (1946â1992) lasted 47 years and averaged a 4.2% annualized wholesale price change.\n\nGary calls the 8-year period from 1993 to 2000 period a peacetime era. Inflation averaged 1.4%. He notes that the War on Terror began in 2001 and lasted 13 years, to 2014. Annualized wholesale price inflation averaged 2.8%.\n\nAre we in peacetime now? Gary would argue that we may be.\n\nSure, the world looks dangerous and threatening today, but in the United States defense expenditures as a percentage of GDP are shrinking, and we are acting more like we are in a peacetime era than a wartime era. I know I will get emails about this, and emailersâ fingers will be pointing at ISIS and the South China Sea and North Korea. All true. But how much defense spending has been deployed versus past wartime periods? The aggregate data says very little. Gary supports this view by noting that over the last two years we have averaged an annualized wholesale price level change of 1.2%.\n\nWhat will the outcome of the election and the new composition of the Senate and House mean for the wartime versus peacetime macroeconomics of the United States? Set aside the political rhetoric. One can make an interesting case for the continuation of a peacetime level of defense spending relative to the nationâs GDP.\n\nThe old political adage regarding guns and butter applies. When it is just butter and the guns are quiet, the inflation rate is low.\n\nWe looked at another source independent of Gary to see if we could find a similar pattern. The book is Prices, by George Warren and Frank Pearson, two distinguished giants of the economics profession who published their magnificent work in 1933. It was the ultimate reference for its time and went through six printings by Wiley. Imagine writing a book about prices when your research period started in the year 1720 and ended during the Great Depression era.\n\nWhat the Warren-Pearson treatise does is validate Gary Shillingâs view and his numbers. The implications for growth rates and interest rates and the worldâs economic recovery are profound.\n\nWill we have the economic characteristics of a peacetime in the United States for the next four years? We shall see what unfolds in this dangerous world. But if we do have peacetime, reflation is destined to be mild. That implies the uptrend in interest rates will be mild, too. Gradually rising rates â but no jarring spike â may lie ahead. For now we agree with this forecast.\n\n~~~~\n\nDavid R Kotok, Chairman and Chief Investment Officer, Cumberland Advisors",

  "latent_4196": "An indictment is a formal accusation of a felony, issued by a grand jury based upon a proposed charge, witnesses' testimony and other evidence presented by the public prosecutor (District Attorney). It is the grand jury's determination that there is enough evidence that the defendant committed the crime to justify having a trial voted by a grand jury. In order to issue an indictment, the grand jury doesn't make a determination of guilt, but only the probability that a crime was committed, that the accused person did it and that he/she should be tried. District Attorneys do not present a full case to the grand jury, but often only introduce key facts sufficient to show the probability that the accused committed a crime.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on presentment of a Grand Juryâ¦.\" . Therefore grand juries are often used in charging federal crimes. However, states often use a \"preliminary hearing\" held by a lower court judge or other magistrate in place of a grand jury to determine whether the prosecutor has presented sufficient evidence that the accused has committed a felony. If the judge finds enough evidence that the accused committed a crime, the case will be ordered to be sent to the appropriate court for trial.\n\nA sealed indictment an indictment that is sealed so that it stays non-public until it is unsealed. This can be done for a number of reasons. It may be unsealed, for example, once the named person is arrested.\n\nThe following is an example of a federal rule dealing with sealed indictments:\n\nThe magistrate judge to whom an indictment is returned may direct that the indictment be kept secret until the defendant is in custody or has been released pending trial. The clerk must then seal the indictment, and no person may disclose the indictmentâs existence except as necessary to issue or execute a warrant or summons.",
  "latent_4337": "Clinton has a solid base of African American support but many voters see Sanders as embodying of Obamaâs message of hope and change before Saturdayâs primary\n\nIn many ways Marnie Robinsonâs office in the Brookland Baptist church in Columbia, South Carolina, is just your typical office â a computer, a desk, incessant phone calls. But she also keeps some things there you wouldnât necessarily expect to find in a church PR coordinatorâs office, like a framed photo of the first family, featuring all four Obamas encircled by a presidential seal. And just beside them, a series of enlarged laminated pages from the local paper dated 5 November 2008, heralding the election of the first black president with headlines like: âHistoryâ and âHis storyâ.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One of the laminated pages Marnie Robinson keeps in her office. Photograph: Lucia Graves for the Guardian\n\nRobinson can still recall the first time Barack Obama entered her consciousness. It was 2004 and he was giving his speech at the Democratic National Convention. âI was just amazed,â recalls Robinson, who was home watching the speech with her family. She remembers saying aloud: âThat man is going to be president.â What Robinson didnât predict was that Obama would come to visit Brookland Baptist multiple times as he campaigned for higher office â and that on 19 May 2007, Michelle Obama, on one such visit, would invite Robinson to come work for the campaign, as Obamaâs faith coordinator for the state of South Carolina. In June of that year Robinson joined the campaign, and she still keeps the business cards memorializing her stint in her desk.\n\nThis election, though, the choice is less obvious to Robinson. Days before the Saturday primary here, she remains undecided, telling me: âWe have to have someone in office whoâs going to be able to carry the mantle.â Whether that person is Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, though, she canât say â or wonât anyway. I speak with Robinson on Tuesday, just days after the church was visited by Sanders, and one day before his fellow Democratic presidential candidate is expected to stop by, and the question, to her mind, âis whether theyâre going to do what they say theyâre going to. Theyâre saying in the first 100 days theyâre going to do all this,â she says of candidates generically. âThatâs not how it works.â\n\nIn a state where Obama crushed Clinton in 2008, winning 44 of 46 counties, this yearâs election in South Carolina is very much a question of determining who is the best heir to Obamaâs legacy. And while Clinton, with her repeated promises to build on the Obama administrationâs tenure, might seem like the obvious pick, in more than a dozen interviews many South Carolinians were attracted to the idealism of Sanders, whose message of revolution echoes Obamaâs rhetoric of hope and change.\n\nIt may not do much to help Sanders in the state, where he has not spent much time on the ground this week and where polls show him continuing to trail Clinton. But it is a message his campaign is counting on to resonate nationally.\n\nThat was certainly the case for Lashonda Nesmith, 42, who can still recall what resonated for her most about Obamaâs message. âIt was the hope and the change because that was something we didnât have too much of at the time. And thatâs whatâs happening now with Bernie,â she adds. âItâs the same momentum happening all over again.â\n\nGesturing at her 10-year-old son, Dreshon Jackson, she talks about looking after her childâs future, and says in particular that Sandersâ promises to end mass incarceration go beyond anything any other candidate has promised. Sanders has been criticized for such promises, and particularly for his vow to end mass incarceration by the end of his first term, with skeptics calling his policies naive or impossible.\n\nBut donât try telling that to Nesmith, a county chair of the Democratic party in Florence, South Carolina. âWhat, you mean itâs hard work? Iâm not scared of hard work,â she says when asked if Sandersâ grand visions are possible. Turning to her son, she asks: âDreshon, you scared of hard work?â\n\nHe shakes his head and clutches his Bernie sign a little harder: âNo.â\n\nNesmith was at a community center gathering in Columbia on Tuesday, headed up by a smattering of Sanders surrogates including his wife Jane and Gus Newport, the former mayor of Berkeley, California. The focus of the night was education â a natural topic for Sandersâ wife, a former college administrator and the only white person on the panel. But Jane Sanders did very little talking, mostly letting community members tell their stories about why her husbandâs candidacy spoke to them.\n\nMark Compton, a 52-year-old adjunct professor, born and raised in Sumpter, said he was supporting Sanders because he thought the country needed someone with visions as grand as a socialistâs. âI look at the capitalist system, and truly the reason I support Sanders is Wall Street is corrupt,â he said. Compton teaches art history at Midlands Tech, a local community college, and though heâs a full-time professor, he tells me: âI donât make a month what my student loans are supposed to be.â\n\nBefore moving back to South Carolina, he taught in Tennessee for two years but was only allowed to teach two classes so that the school did not have to give him benefits. To make ends meet, he would drive across state lines to teach a third class in North Carolina. âThey donât want to pay us,â he said. âThey require us to have all these credentials that cost up the yin-yang but they donât want to give us health insurance.â Compton thinks Obamacare is a good start, and he thinks Sanders is the only candidate bold enough to really build on it.\n\nI just believe heâs not going to get us into war for no reason Jordan McLendon, 19\n\nJordan McLendon, a 19-year-old from Lexington, also happily waxed enthusiastic about Obamaâs policies. âI trust him,â he said of the president. âI definitely think heâs been a great president with all heâs had to endure.â Now McLendon, who has plans to join the military, says the person he trusts most â with his life even â is Sanders: âI just believe heâs not going to get us into war for no reason.â\n\nOf course, Sanders supporters are not the only ones making the case that their candidate should inherit Obamaâs legacy.\n\nAt a field office in a drab plaza across the street from a Dunkinâ Donuts in Columbia, a handful of Clinton volunteers are working the phones. With the primary just days away, volunteers are making a final push to ensure that voters who have committed to supporting Clinton on Saturday actually turn up.\n\nIn the corner of the field office, formerly Kikiâs Chicken and Waffles, a cardboard cut-out of Clinton wearing an American flag scarf smiles at volunteers while they work. The walls are covered with handmade posters and campaign signs. A mountain of campaign signs lie in a pile in the back room.\n\nWith each call, volunteers ask first if the voter still intends to support Clinton on Saturday.\n\nâI believe that Hillary Clinton is going to build on the progress of President Obama,â said Jacqueline DeBose. And that message seems to be carrying some weight with more than a few voters.\n\nLafaye Cooper, of Columbia, said she and her friends are passionately divided over who to support in the primary. She too went back and forth, torn between Clinton and Sanders, but was ultimately drawn to the prospect of making history, again.\n\nâI would like to see a woman president,â said Cooper, who supported Obama in 2008.\n\nâI was all for Obama, both times. I brought my daughter to the polling booth with me that day. I told her: âBack in the day we couldnât vote so we have to take advantage,ââ said Cooper, who is black.\n\nThough she is supporting Clinton, the mother of two wishes Clinton would adopt some of Sandersâ ideas, especially his plan to make college free. âI wish theyâd run on the same ticket,â she said. âMaybe he could be her vice-president.â\n\nMeanwhile Beverly Jivers of Hopkins, South Carolina, said since she wanted a president who would continue Obamaâs policies, it never occurred to her to support anyone other than Clinton. âI never really followed Bernie,â Jivers said after Clinton spoke at Central Baptist church in Columbia. âI never really followed anyone else. Iâm satisfied with Hillary.â\n\nJivers said most of her family and neighbors intend to vote for Clinton because they believe she will expand on Obamaâs progress at home and abroad. Still, Jivers said she has learned to have realistic expectations about what a president can achieve. âCandidates make a whole lot of promises to us when theyâre running for office,â she said. âThen afterward whoâs left hanging but the African American communities.â\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Justin Graves, 24, at the University of South Carolina campus. Photograph: Lucia Graves for the Guardian\n\nOthers, like Justin Graves, a 24-year-old chemistry major at the University of South Carolina, simply cannot make up their mind one way or the other. In a Tuesday interview on the USC campus, Graves â an Obama supporter in 2012 â explained that while he liked Clintonâs tenacity and fighting spirit, he also admired Sandersâ idealism and his drive to accomplish the seemingly impossible. His only concern with Sanders was whether he could really do it. âRevolution is like, youâre doing a big thing,â Graves says. âAre you sure you can do it? If you can do it, Iâll be impressed.â\n\nHamilton Grant, a 27-year-old financial consultant from Columbia, is convinced Sanders can. âI think anybody who says his platform or ideas or notions are impossible or unrealistic is hypocritical,â Grant, who also serves a co-chair of South Carolinaâs Young Leaders for Bernie, says. âAnd we can trace that back to every movement across history.â Abolishing slavery once seemed unrealistic or impossible, he noted, as did having an African American president. âBringing it back to South Carolina, my grandparents never thought theyâd see that Confederate flag come off of that state house capitol but we did.â\n\nI love Hillary Clinton, I just like Sandersâ ideas more Bryanta Brooker Maxwell\n\nHe adds: âI donât understand whatâs so unrealistic about healthcare for everybody or reforming our prison system or coming out of college not being thousands of dollars in debt â I donât see how thatâs not realistic.\n\nâIf you want to go back to Obamaâs phrase of âYes we can,â then itâs possible â¦ and to say that these things canât happen or wonât happen, it almost kills the optimism of America.â\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bryanta Booker Maxwell of Young Leaders for Bernie. Photograph: Lucia Graves for the Guardian\n\nBryanta Booker Maxwell, Grantâs fellow co-chair of Young Leaders for Bernie, agrees, even as sheâs somewhat protective of Clinton. âI love Hillary Clinton, I just like Sandersâ ideas more,â she says, when pressed to differentiate between the two. âI think he has more of a movement than people give him credit for.â\n\nAt a press conference at a DoubleTree hotel in Columbia on Wednesday, Sanders implored reporters to remember how far his campaign had come and not to read too much into any one state, foreshadowing, perhaps, his coming loss in South Carolina. âWhat I would ask of the media is not to look at it state by state,â he told the assembled reporters. âWeâre going to have good days and weâre going to have bad days.â\n\nOne of the men flanking Sanders at Wednesdayâs event was South Carolina state representative Justin Bamberg, the lawyer who defended police shooting victim Walter Scott.\n\nBamberg has become a vocal advocate for Sanders and a much-needed one, as Sanders has struggled to make inroads with voters of color. Earlier this week, for instance, Clinton held a press event with the mother of Eric Garner, and four other mothers whose children were victims of gun violence or died in police custody. Until recently, Bamberg too was in Clintonâs corner, but a conversation he had with Sanders about criminal justice reform when Sanders visited on Martin Luther Kingâs birthday changed his mind.\n\nâIt said a lot to me that he was getting ready to speak to hundreds of people and without hesitation he sat down to have a discussion to me,â Bamberg said in an interview. âThe conversation we had â¦ it wasnât a presidential candidate talking to a state representative, it was two people talking about things they care about, what theyâre passionate about, and what theyâd like to see happen for citizens.â\n\nBack at the Brookland Baptist church, however, Robinson still canât make up her mind, except to say she wonât tell anyone else how to vote. Some of the churchgoers having lunch there are not so conflicted.\n\nMary L Johnson, a 68-year-old from Columbia, says over a fruit plate that she was an Obama voter in 2008 and 2012, and now she is counting on Clinton to expand his legacy. âHillary will expand on Obamacare,â she began, before her friend, Judy Irvin, 61, interjected: âPromised to!â\n\nThe stateâs governor has turned down money for Medicaid expansion, and that is something both women say they expect will change under a President Hillary Clinton.\n\nJohnson adds that she is âjust as excitedâ for Clinton as she was for Obama. âI feel like what Obama has started, she will improve on.â\n\nâI am too!â says Irvin, cutting in again. âSheâs going to kick butt.â\n\nâSheâs very intelligent,â adds 71-year-old Mahasin Madyun, leaning across the table. âI canât wait for Saturday.â\n\nBack in her office, just around the corner, Robinson says no matter who is elected, her collection of Obama paraphernalia stays put.\n\nâI just save the stuff, I donât look at it,â she explains. âI just know itâs historic and I want it to be around for my five-year-old nephew. I want him to understand.â",

  "latent_4453": "AUSTIN, TX â A United Methodist Bishop for the San Antonio area has reinstated the candidacy of a lesbian woman who is seeking to be ordained in the denomination as a deacon.\n\nMary Ann Kaiser serves as the youth director at University United Methodist Church in Austin. She initially became a candidate for ordination in the Alabama-West Florida Annual Conference in 2008, during which time she not living as a homosexual.\n\nKaiser later moved to Texas, where she obtained a Master of Divinity at Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary and became active in the district chapter of the denomination.\n\nIn April of this year, Kaiser revealed at a district meeting that she was involved in a lesbian relationship. She has since traveled to Maryland to âwedâ her partner Annanda Barclay.\n\nFollowing the initial meeting, the district committee voted 6-2 to allow her candidacy to proceed, but this summer, a church board recommended that it she be removed from the list. The United Methodist Book of Discipline prohibits âself-avowed practicing homosexualsâ from becoming ordained as ministers in the denomination.\n\nKaiserâs pastor, John Elford, then made a motion to reinstate her candidacy, but was rejected. Elford continued pressing the matter, stating that Kaiser had not been fully evaluated as required by the denomination.\n\nSouthwest Texas Conference Bishop James A. Dorff originally ruled the issue as moot, but the matter was sent back to him this fall for response. On Thursday, Dorff reinstated Kaiserâs candidacy, agreeing with Elford that she had not been fully examined.\n\nConnect with Christian News\n\nFollow @4christiannews\n\nâThe Austin District Committee, following BOD (Book of Discipline) processes, certified Ms. Kaiser and recommended her to the Board of Ordained Ministry for Commissioning,â he wrote. âIt then became the boardâs responsibility to fully examine her fitness for ministry, including written materials and interview â¦ This was not done in this case. â\n\nâThe Board of Ordained Ministry rendered a judgment but did not follow the process,â Dorff stated. âTherefore, the candidate is entitled to full examination by the Board.â\n\nKaiser issued a statement following the decision expressing her approval of her reinstatement.\n\nâI find hope in the fact that this wrong is being corrected and I am eager to continue on this relational, Spirit driven process with the Board,â she wrote. âI rely on the voice of the Holy Spirit to illuminate my understanding of faith, my call, and my place in The United Methodist Church.â\n\nReaction to Kaiserâs reinstatement has been mixed.\n\nâGod bless the bishop! He made the right decision in allowing this faithful woman to continue her call to candidacy,â one commenter wrote. âI think this is a sign that the United Methodist church is changing and that the 15 conferences that voted for gay marriage are indeed making a difference.â\n\nâNo, No, No! She mustnât be ordained,â another wrote. âThe Bible, which is the Word of God, on which the church was founded and is itself the foundation of the Christian church, clearly forbids homosexuality.

  "latent_4490": "Jimi Hendrixâs Guitars and Gear\n\nJames Marshall âJimiâ Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 â September 18, 1970) was an American musician, singer, and songwriter. Despite a relatively brief mainstream career spanning four years, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as âarguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock musicâ.\n\nIn the early years, Hendrix played mostly cheaper guitar like the Epiphone Wilshire and Supro Ozark. Towards the mid-1960s he started using Fenders, starting with a 1959 Fender Duo-sonic which he played with Isley Brothers. In the summer of 1966, he bought his first Stratocaster with the help of his girlfriend, and it quickly became his signature guitar. His favorite guitar was a black 1968 Stratocaster with a maple neck. Towards the later part of his career, Hendrix started using different guitars, including some Gibson Flying Vs and Les Paul Customs.\n\nHendrix played mostly right-handed models, even though he was left-handed â which played a role in the way his guitars ended up sounding and left an overall impression on the listeners. Important to note is that the string placement was correct for a left-hand player with the low E on top. This of course reversed the length of the strings behind the nut, affected the tone on the slanted bridge pickup, and affected the tone of each string since the single-coil pickups usually had staggered pole-pieces â each of them set to a different height in order to balance the inconsistencies in individual string volume on guitars.\n\nHere on the hub page everything is listed in a chronological order, starting with the first known piece of gear acquired.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nJan. 13, 2016, 5:51 PM GMT / Updated Jan. 13, 2016, 5:51 PM GMT By Maggie Fox\n\nIt just might be the right time for President Barack Obamaâs ambitious âmoon shotâ to cure cancer, according to experts.\n\nObama announced the initiative Tuesday night in his State of the Union address and put Vice President Joe Biden in charge.\n\n\"Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources they've had in over a decade,\" Obama said. \"Tonight, I'm announcing a new national effort to get it done.\"\n\nItâs a good time to do it, says the American Cancer Societyâs Dr. Otis Brawley.\n\nFor starters, Biden has a proven track record of being able to get Congress to stand with him on this issue: He helped get Congress to add $264 million to the National Cancer Instituteâs budget in the 2016 spending bill, part of a $2 billion raise for the National Institutes of Health.\n\nâHe may actually be able to get Republican and Democratic support for this,â Brawley said.\n\nâThe field has obtained such a critical mass of knowledge that now we are ready.â\n\nBut even more important, the research is advancing more quickly than ever, says Dr. Jose Baselga, Physician-in-Chief and Chief Medical Officer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and president of the American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nâThe field has obtained such a critical mass of knowledge that now we are ready,â Baselga told NBC News.\n\nâThis is the golden era of cancer research,â agreed Dr. Ronald DePinho, president of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nMoney wasnât enough to do it in 1971, when president Richard Nixon declared a war on cancer. Experts didnât even know then that cancer is entirely caused by genetic mutations, and that the place it starts tells a doctor very little about the tumor itself.\n\nBut money will help a great deal now, Baselga said.\n\nâI do think in a great part itâs a money issue,â he said. âThe amount of discoveries that are occurring are many. We see them at a speed that we have never seen before. I think money could go a long, long way.â\n\nIt will take coordination, too, said Brawley. Biden notes this in his comments on the new initiative.\n\nâSeveral cutting-edge areas of research and care â including cancer immunotherapy, genomics, and combination therapies â could be revolutionary,â Biden, whose son, Beau, died of brain cancer last year, wrote.\n\nâBut the science, data, and research results are trapped in silos, preventing faster progress and greater reach to patients. Itâs not just about developing game-changing treatments â itâs about delivering them to those who need them,â Biden added.\n\nâRight now, only 5 percent of cancer patients in the U.S. end up in a clinical trial. Most arenât given access to their own data. At the same time, community oncologists â who treat more than 75 percent of cancer patients â have more limited access to cutting-edge research and advances.â\n\nThis is precisely whatâs needed, said Brawley.\n\nâWe have tremendous difficulty collecting patient data because of privacy laws or the perception that privacy laws are preventing them from doing so,â Brawley said.\n\nâThat is something the vice president can fix in six months.â\n\nâNobody is going to cure cancer in a year.\"\n\nBaselga said cancer centers like his own have huge amounts of data that they can share with one another about what genetic changes are involved in cancer. Sharing this information with other centers and with the companies that actually end up making new treatments is critical, he said.\n\nâSince every tumor is different, you need to have thousands and thousands of tumors to be able to get a good representation of what is going on.â Right now, there is little incentive for anyone to do that.\n\nAnd then there are the disparities. No breakthrough can save lives if people donât get access to it, Brawley noted.\n\nâWe need to figure out why we have had a 40 percent decline in breast cancer deaths over the last 25 years, but not in nine states,â Brawley said. âWe have got good data to show that 20 percent or more of women who get a breast cancer diagnosis right now do not get the fruits of the research that has already been done. They get less than optimal treatment.â\n\nOne study found an equally horrifying pattern with ovarian cancer.\n\nIt found just 41 percent of eligible women are getting chemotherapy delivered directly to the affected area, even though the benefits are so strong that the National Cancer Institute made a rare recommendation for doctors to use it.\n\nAnd itâs better treatment, in the form of drugs such as tamoxifen that can not only treat but also prevent breast cancer, that is responsible for half the decrease in breast cancer deaths, Brawley said. Screening in the form of mammograms is probably a distant third factor, after the increased willingness of women to seek treatment in the first place.\n\nBringing down costs will be a huge part of this, also.\n\nThe average price of new cancer drugs was more than $100,000 a year in 2012. Cancer experts have started to rebel, but they also point out that the promise of profits can attract drug makers into a field where drug development relies on the private sector.\n\nCancer's still the No. 2 killer in the U.S. But the American Cancer Society just reported that 1.7 million people escaped death from cancer since 1991.\n\nHere are just a few of the new approaches that have cancer experts thinking itâs a good time to double down:\n\nNew immune therapies\n\nFormer president Jimmy Carter tried out the new cancer drug Keytruda, which helps the immune system take on brain tumors. He says the drug shrank the tumors; doctors note he got pretty good targeted radiation, also.\n\nTargeted treatments\n\nTargeted treatments such as Imbruvica, known generically as ibrutinib, help patients with a hard-to-treat form of leukemia live longer and healthier lives, and free them from unpleasant drug infusions at the same time.\n\nPersonalized immune therapies involve finding immune cells in patientsâ own bodies that recognize and attack the tumors, and growing more of them in the lab. They have remarkable results in a few lucky patients.\n\nLifestyle insights\n\nOther advances include studies that show just how diet and obesity affect cancer risk. And, of course, the sharp decrease in the number of people who smoke has helped.\n\nInformation sharing\n\nNot least, sharing information can save lives. One cancer registry linked a womanâs rare childhood ovarian tumor with a genetic mutation that caused her baby boyâs seemingly unrelated lung tumor years later, and pointed them to ways to treat it.\n\nAnother found that more than 8 percent of children with cancer have unsuspected genetic mutations that could run in their families.\n\nNo single approach is going to wipe out a disease that experts now know is in fact dozens, if not hundreds of different diseases.\n\nâNobody is going to cure cancer in a year,â Brawley said. âI donât think anybody going to cure cancer in a decade. We can decrease a lot of pain and suffering due to cancer.â",

But in the reality that is the NBA, overlapping skill sets are often a recipe for disaster.\n\nWhen the Heat formed their super team in the summer of 2010, many speculated that LeBron James and Dwyane Wade would find a life of coexistence more turbulent than they had originally thought. Their style of play was too similar, many argued, and unfortunately, thereâs only one basketball to go around. And those fears werenât unfounded. It wasnât until both LeBron and Wade made adjustments to their individual games that their collective goal of winning a championship was satisfied.\n\nIn todayâs NBA, the superstars are the players with the ball in their hands. And while it is unfortunate that the towering big men of todayâs game often go unnoticed, the reality is that guards run todayâs game. And fortunately for the Lakers, they have two of the very best in the game: Steve Nash and Kobe Bryant. The question remains however: Will the fact that both Nash and Bryant need the ball in their hands dictate an overlapping of skill sets?\n\nSpatial Analytics and Comfort Zones:\n\nDr. Kirk Goldsberry, a Harvard professor and geographic analyst, offered some very insightful arguments at last yearâs Sloan Sports Conference about the use of space in basketball and how we define out best shooters. He defined two terms; âSpreadâ and âRangeâ, that should come into play when we decide who are the gameâs best shooters, not merely field goal percentage.\n\nSpread, according to Dr. Goldsberryâs definition, is âthe overall size of a playerâs shooting territory. League leaders in FG% generally have a small Spread value since they tend to only shoot near the basket. For example, since centers generally thrive in limited areas near the hoop they tend to have lower Spread values than shooting guards.â\n\nRange, within that spread metric, âaccounts for spatial influences on shooting effectiveness. It is essentially a count of the number of shooting cells in which a player averages more than 1 PPA.â\n\nIn essence, spread is qualified as the area of court space that a player feels comfortable shooting from. In the NBA, no one feels more comfortable shooting from more places on the floor than Kobe Bryant. Range, on the other hand, is how good a player is at converting on those shot attempts from those different areas on the court. Where did Kobe place? Third. Steve Nash? Good oleâ numero uno. If youâre searching for the best shooters in the NBA according to who makes the most shots from the most places, here is the short answer: Steve Nash, Ray Allen, Kobe Bryant. Way to represent, class of â96.\n\nThese charts demonstrate that these four shooters, the four best in the NBA, are capable of being efficient from multiple spots on the floor. If any two players are capable of adapting to each otherâs games, Steve Nash and Kobe Bryant are at the top of the list. They donât have to face the limitations that Dwyane Wade and LeBron James experienced. Here are some graphs, designed by Dr. Goldsberry, that illustrate the proficiency of the Lakersâ prolific guards.\n\nAfter observing these statistics, one can see that Kobe Bryant excels particularly in three areas on the court, near both elbows and on the left block. While it is clear that Kobe is comfortable shooting from many areas on the court, those three areas are strong points for Bryant. Steve Nash, on the other hand, is much more comfortable further out. He leads the league from that top left spot on the court. And another notable Laker, Pau Gasol, hits a very good percentage of his shots from the right low post.\n\nIf fans are concerned about Nash and Bryant stepping on each otherâs toes, they wonât have much reason to worry. Nash is most effective beyond the arc or near it, and Kobeâs sweet spots are completely midrange, in the areas surrounding the free throw line. One can imagine that with Pau operating in the high post as a screener, Kobe will be able to find easier shots in his sweet spots, without Nash cluttering the space.\n\nIf the Lakers are able to find a more suitable shooter at the small forward position (sorry World Peace), they will be deadly indeed. Whereas Sessionsâ skill sets overlapped an already clogged paint area, Steve Nashâs versatile shooting abilities allow current Lakers such as Kobe and Pau to operate where they are most comfortable.",
  "latent_4585": "Last season, Pittsburgh finished first in the Atlantic Division, ahead of the New York Rangers, the New York Islanders, Philadelphia and New Jersey. This upcoming season, the Penguins will be looking to defend that title against those same teams plus three new ones â Carolina, Columbus and Washington â in the Metropolitan Division.\n\nAs part of the NHLâs realignment plan that will be implemented for the 2013-14 campaign, the league will be in a more geographically appropriate two-conference, four-division format with 16 teams in the Eastern Conference and 14 teams in the Western Conference.\n\nThe Eastern Conference divisions (Metropolitan and Atlantic â which will now consist of Boston, Buffalo, Detroit, Florida, Montreal, Ottawa, Tampa Bay, and Toronto) have eight teams in each while the Western Conference divisions (Central and Pacific) have seven teams in each.\n\nHereâs how realignment affects Pittsburghâs scheduleâ¦\n\nâ¢ In total, the Penguins will play 82 regular-season games this season â 30 against their seven fellow Metropolitan Division foes; 24 games against the eight teams from the Atlantic Division; and 28 games against the 14 teams from the Western Conference.\n\nâ¢ Pittsburgh will play five games against the Philadelphia Flyers (3 home; 2 away) and Columbus Blue Jackets (2 home; 3 away); and four games (2 home; 2 away) against the other five Metropolitan Division teams.\n\nâ¢ The Penguins will play three games each against the eight teams in the Atlantic division â either two at home and one away or once at home and twice away. Teams that the Penguins will play twice at home and once away are Buffalo, Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto. Pittsburgh will play Boston, Detroit, Florida and Tampa Bay just once at home.\n\nâ¢ And finally, for the first time since the 1997-98 season, the Penguins will play each of the 14 Western Conference teams once at home and once on the road.\n\nThe pre-realignment Atlantic Division was known for being one of toughest and most competitive divisions in the NHL, as it was not uncommon to see all five teams battling until the very end of the regular season to make the playoffs every year (and usually at least three advancing). Plus, the gap between the first-place team and the last-place team tended to be relatively small â especially compared to the gaps in other divisions.\n\nIt also had some of the most intense rivalries, starting with the legendary, hate-filled and bitter one between cross-state teams Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. And there was no love lost between the Penguins and any of the other teams in the division, either.\n\nIt doesnât look like the new Metropolitan Division will be any friendlier. All of the rivalries from the former Atlantic Division, of course, will stay intact. The Capitals are already a current rival of Pittsburgh with all of the star power and history, and now that theyâll see more of each other we can only speculate as to how much more intense that will become. And thereâs also more juicy potential for dislike to build between the Penguins and both the Hurricanes and Blue Jackets. More on that below...\n\nThe main reason Pittsburgh and Columbus could develop an exciting rivalry is the short distance between them. All seven of the Penguinsâ Metropolitan Division opponents are within driving distance (Carolina is the farthest at about 7-and-a-half hours), but Columbus is by far the closest at just under three hours away.\n\nA lot of Penguins fans made the trip to Columbus the last time Pittsburgh played there on Dec. 4, 2010, as there was an influx of black and gold jerseys in the stands at the game. And with five games between the teams (three in Columbus, two in Pittsburgh) this season â including a home-and-home series on Nov. 1-2 â fans from both teams will probably venture into enemy territory to support their clubs. Call the Penguins and the Blue Jackets destination rivals, if you will, with that added element of fan travel.\n\nThe Penguins and the Capitals already have one of the NHLâs marquee rivalries. They clashed in the 2011 Winter Classic at Heinz Field, on a few Super Bowl Sundays and had an epic playoff battle in 2009 when Pittsburgh defeated Washington in seven games during the conference semifinals on its way to winning the Stanley Cup. Now that the two teams (just a four-hour drive apart) are in the same division and will play each other four times this season â including a home-and-home series on March 10-11 â it could become even more heated.\n\nPittsburgh and Washington developed such a strong rivalry the last few years because of star power. The Penguins have Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, while the Capitals have Alex Ovechkin. They are the three biggest superstars in the league and have been battling for individual honors (in addition to team glory in their playoff series) starting when Crosby and Ovechkin broke into the NHL during the 2005-06 season. Itâs always exciting to watch when they all go head-to-head.\n\nThe Penguins-Capitals rivalry flared up in the '90s when the two teams met seven times in 11 years â with Pittsburgh winning in six of those series. That hatred has been carried over during the Ovechkin-Crosby/Malkin era. And it should only get hotter as the teams enter the same division.\n\nPittsburghâs rivalry with Carolina may not be as developed as it is with Washington, but it could get there. If it does, weâd bet itâs because of the Jordan Staal â Brandon Sutter trade.\n\nStaal, who played his first six NHL seasons with Pittsburgh, was a key member of the Penguinsâ 2009 Stanley Cup championship team and was part of the successful three-center model with Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. But Staal wanted to play with his brother Eric, so the Penguins traded Jordan to Carolina at the 2012 NHL Draft for Sutter and prospects Brian Dumoulin and Derrick Pouliot. Staal signed a 10-year, $60-million deal with the Hurricanes a few days later.\n\nStaal came to Pittsburgh just once in his first season with Pittsburgh, in the final game of the regular season. The sellout crowd at CONSOL Energy Center gave him an extended standing ovation as a tribute played on the video board, and Staal was emotional as he stood up and acknowledged the fans he had played in front of for his first six seasons. But now that thatâs over and done with, donât expect things to remain as friendly and cordial as they are now. Staal is an important part of Penguins history, but not their present or future. Heâs a competitive guy, and the Hurricanes expect a lot from him. Heâll want to do everything he can to lead his team to success in the future, including beating his former team whenever possible.\n\nRealignment doesnât just affect the regular season; it affects the postseason as well. The playoffs are now division-based and with an added wild-card system.\n\nThe number of total playoff spots, 16, remains the same â eight for each conference. That means the Western Conference will have 14 teams competing for eight playoff spots, while the Eastern Conference will have 16 teams competing for eight playoff spots. It will likely end up being a tighter race for Pittsburgh and the rest of the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe top three teams in the Metropolitan Division and the top three teams from the Atlantic Division will fill the first six spots. The remaining two spots (Nos. 7 and 8) will be filled by the wild-card teams, who are the next two highest-placed finishers in each conference based on regular-season points and regardless of division.\n\nThat means the Metropolitan Division could send five teams to the playoffs while the Atlantic sends three; or vice versa. Or they could each send four. Regardless, the playoffs are now heavily based on divisional standings while before, only the division winner got a guaranteed spot in the playoffs.\n\nNHL.com explained the seeding bestâ¦\n\nâThe seeding of the wild-card teams within each divisional playoff will be determined on the basis of regular-season points. The division winner with the most points in the conference will be matched against the wild-card team with the fewest points; the division winner with the second-most points in the conference will play the wild-card team with the second fewest points.. The teams finishing second and third in each division will play in the first round of the playoffs. The winners of each series will play for berths in the conference championship series.â\n\nSo while the wildcard system makes it possible to play a team in the opening round of the playoffs outside of the division, itâs more likely that teams will be playing the first two rounds against divisional foes â and weâve seen first-hand the last few years just how intense that can be.",

  "latent_4652": "The Federal Open Market Committee delivered on its long-signaled quarter-point hike in the target range for the federal funds rate. Markets will now focus on the committee's next move. There are two questions to be answered. First, will there be another rate hike this year? Second, how will the anticipated shrinkage of the Fed's balance sheet proceed? Thus far, markets seem calm.\n\nThis was the fourth rate hike since December 2015. The FOMC has signaled one more rate hike this year, but markets give it only about a 50/50 probability. Certainly, inflation gives no reason for the Fed to move aggressively on rates. Inflation remains below 2 percent.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has persistently over-estimated the inflation threat and today's FOMC statement seems to recognize that. The yield curve has flattened despite the anticipated rate hike at this meeting. In short, financial markets are not signaling further Fed rate hikes. The Fed is inclined to adjust its actions to the market's expectations. That suggests there will be no further rate hikes this year.\n\nThe labor market is the central bank's other key concern. The May jobs report once again sent mixed signals. Job creation was weak at 138,000. Yet the unemployment rate declined to 4.3 percent, the lowest in 16 years. These are mixed signals that can, however, be reconciled. We are in a historically long, but subpar economic recovery. Slow job growth accompanies slow economic growth.\n\nThe historically low unemployment rate is the seeming anomaly. That figure is misleading on at least two counts. First, the decline in unemployment is a consequence of the length of the recovery rather than its strength. Second, the fall in the unemployment rate has been affected by the decline in the labor-force participation rate.",

And held him up, naked, singing The Circle Of Life. Obviously.\n\nAs per usual, their lives completely changed. Matt discovered you can actually be so tired your balls hurt. He also learnt about breast pumps. These are really exciting times.\n\nHe posted a big long status in December to share some of his experiences, wit and tips on the topic of parenting. Itâs a little sweary, but mostly just brutally honest. The internet got a hold of it, and it has now been shared over 8,000 times.\n\nNo pressure, Matt.\n\nHis post read:\n\nâI was congratulating myself today on how Iâve got nappy changing down to a precision art. Iâm basically like a Formula One pit crew.. in fact, in many ways, Iâm better, because when youâre speed-changing the tyres on Lewis Hamiltonâs car heâs probably less likely to piss in your eyes and projectile shit up your arms.\n\nso, this is what else Iâve learnt so far..\n\nThe Birth.\n\nâ I used to think that the theory that the moon landing was a hoax was total bollocks, just because it required a huge amount of people to share a secret. I now think itâs a distinct possibility given the conspiracy of silence about how horrendous labour is.. The labour suite is like being in âNam.. It is nothing like you see in sitcoms or film.. unless that film is Saw IV, combined with the chest bursting scene from Alien. So, to those who told me that the birth would be a magical experience.. youâre a bunch of f*cking liars. ..Labour is like magic.. but only in that its best when you donât know how itâs done.\n\n(In truth, the hardest thing about labour is seeing someone you love in such excruciating pain. But then Lyns did once make me sit through an episode of Downton Abbey so .. six of one, half a doz..)\n\nThe first week.\n\nâ I never knew this.. but babies breath in a jazz syncopated rhythm.. There is no set pattern to it and they stop breathing roughly every 40 seconds just long enough for you to think theyâve died.. Of all the dick moves your baby can pull, pretending that theyâve died is by far the most dickish and they do it all the time.\n\nâ A baby crying is a weird thing. During the daytime you can listen to it and think that itâs endearing and cute. â¦At 3am itâs like having the inside of your skull sandpapered by an angry viking.\n\nâ Baby piss in the eye really is only funny the first time and every single shit really is comically timed. The worst thing is when they do a âlure-shitâ, then wait till youâve got the nappy off mid-change to bring the real thunder.. Itâs the same thing terrorists do when they time bombs to go off just as the emergency services arrive.\n\nâ Every item of clothing is held together with f*cking press-studs. There are three or four more press-studs than necessary just to make you look like a moron in front of your child.. who shows their disapproval by endlessly windmilling.. Dressing a windmilling baby is like trying to put a rabbit in a f*cking balloon. when you tell them to stay still they ignore you or scratch their own face. theyâre mental.\n\n(Iâm thinking of launching a range of baby clothing that is all velcro, based on strippers trousers. You should be able to just hold a baby in one hand, the clothes theyâre wearing in the other and just separate the two with a satisfying rip.. )\n\nâ Babies at this age donât look like anyone.. every one sits around drinking a f*ckload of tea and says he looks like you, or he looks like his grandad or whatever.. In truth they all look like Ross Kemp.\n\n( well, they look like one of the Mitchell brothers anyway.. if youâve got an ugly baby.. its Phil)\n\nThe first month.\n\nâ Throughout my adult life Iâve tried to read a book a week or so. Iâm not naive I knew that Iâd have less time so I thought Iâd promise myself that Iâd try and read a book a month.. Itâs now been a couple of months and the only thing Iâve read is a pamphlet on Breast pumps. (and Iâve still not got to the end of that, I keep falling asleep during the paragraph on ânipple confusionâ..)\n\nâ It is possible to have so little sleep that your balls hurt.\n\nâ Does anyone remember the show âTouch the Truckâ with Dale Winton (before he had his face retro-fitted).?. It was on Channel 5 and basically 8 contestants put their hands on a truck and the last one to keep their hands on it and stay awake won the thing. Having a baby is like being on Touch the Truck.. the only difference is that on Touch the Truck you were allowed to have a piss and something to eat every 3 hours. ..and you won a truck.\n\nâ Whether Lyns likes it or not holding the baby above your head when its naked, and singing âThe Circle of Lifeâ is funny.\n\nâ Its only when youâve just got a baby to sleep that you realise how loud your house is.. I thought our home was pretty quiet and sedate but it turns out we have a bathroom tap that sounds like Godzilla f*cking a tank.\n\nâ Trying to walk round a supermarket takes ages because old women reeeally like babies and lock onto a pram with the dead-eyed tenacity of a predator drone. Dodging them is like playing Frogger. Theyâre wily, if thereâs more than one of them youâre screwed, theyâll split up and hunt in packs like f*cking raptors.\n\nAfter 3 monthsâ¦Now..\n\nâ The most important thing ive learnt so far is that Charlie is supremely lucky to have Lyns as his mum. Sheâs tough, smart, funny and in love ..and she will make sure I donât fuck up too much. Hopefully, her DNA will also batter my genetic predisposition towards big nostrils and man-tits.\n\nHe is without reservation the greatest thing that has ever happened to us both.. (Better than completing the world cup panini sticker album which, i did in both 86 and 90). He has already removed enough of my cynicism to include this paragraph.. and I feel pretty sure that Iâm going to be good at this .. because as shit, disorganised and pathetically inept as I am.. it is beyond important to me that Charlie comes to no harm. and that, as far as I can make out, is not a bad measure.â\n\nHis post has received almost four thousand comments, with a lot of other parents congratulating him on summing up parenting so well, or giving him some handy parenting tips for the future.\n\nGood luck, Matt.

File photo: Todd Gill, Flyer staff\n\nOpponents of Fayettevilleâs Uniform Civil Rights Protection ordinance have lost another battle in an ongoing lawsuit challenging the new law.\n\nWashington County Circuit Judge Doug Martin on Tuesday denied a motion to stay that wouldâve prevented the ordinance from taking effect on Saturday, Nov. 7.\n\nThe voter-approved measure prohibits business owners and landlords from firing or evicting someone because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Churches, religious schools and daycare facilities, and religious organizations are exempt from the new law.\n\nProtect Fayetteville, a group that has fought the ordinance since its inception, filed the lawsuit on Aug. 31, the day before early voting began in the Sept. 8 special election.\n\nJudge Martin denied the groupâs motion to prevent the public vote, but their complaints in the case still stood.\n\nTravis Story, general counsel for Protect Fayetteville, reiterated those broader arguments in Tuesdayâs hearing in an attempt to convince Martin that there was reasonable probability of winning the lawsuit on its merits, which is one test for issuing an injunction.\n\nStory made several arguments, including a claim that the City Council didnât properly refer the ordinance to voters when it allowed Mayor Lioneld Jordan to cast the sixth vote needed to suspend the councilâs rules and move the ordinance to a third and final reading on June 16. Story said Arkansas mayors arenât allowed to vote unless there is a tie, and since the vote to suspend was 5-3, Jordanâs vote shouldnât have counted.\n\nFayetteville City Attorney Kit Williams disagreed and said state law âcouldnât be more clearâ on the matter. Citing Arkansas Code Annotated 14-43-501, Williams said mayors may vote âwhen his or her vote is needed to pass any ordinance, bylaw, resolution, order or motion.â\n\nStory also claimed the ordinance is a violation of a recently passed state law, called the Intrastate Commerce Improvement Act (Act 137), which bans cities and counties from enacting or enforcing âan ordinance, resolution, rule or policy that creates a protected classification or prohibits discrimination on a basis not contained in state law.â\n\nWilliams disagreed and cited portions of several state laws, including Title 6, Chapter 18 of Arkansas Code, which prohibits bullying in public schools on the basis of several classes, including sexual orientation and gender identity. Because those protected classes already exist, Williams said, a municipality would not be in violation of Act 137 by adopting nondiscrimination policies based on those classes.\n\nHe also said if Act 137 is interpreted to prevent cities from passing anti-discrimination ordinances, it would be a violation of the U.S. Supreme Courtâs 1196 Romer v. Evans decision, which concluded that states may not ban protections for LGBT residents.\n\nFinally, Story told Martin he believed the new law would cause âirreparable harmâ to anyone who was found guilty of violating the ordinance by exercising their religious right to deny services to a same-sex couple.\n\nWilliams also disputed that point and said unless a plaintiff testifies that they intend to violate the law, there is no proof that any irreparable harm will occur, thus failing the second test for issuing a stay.\n\nMartin eventually sided with Williams and said with no proof the law would cause irreparable harm and no convincing argument that the case would be won on its merits, he would rule to deny the motion.\n\nThe lawsuit will continue when Williams argues for a motion to dismiss the case on Dec. 1.",

Most have attempted to enter the U.S. at the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.\n\nAfter being apprehended, they are transported to an immigration station in McAllen, Texas. But because of the recent influx, DHS and Customs and Border Protection have had to send thousands to outside facilities. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is coordinating the effort, while the Department of Health and Human Services is working to provide housing and other amenities to the UACs while they are under federal watch.\n\nUp to 1,200 UACs will be housed at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio. Another 600 will be kept at both Ventura County Naval Base in Oxnard, Calif. and at Fort Sill Army Base in Lawton, Okla. Facilities in Virginia and Maryland will also reportedly be used to house the minors. Nearly 100 non-profit grantees throughout the U.S. will house nearly 6,000 of the youth.\n\nThough U.S. officials have not provided clarification on the deportation process â including how long the process will take and how many of the UACs will end up staying in the U.S. â HHS will attempt to identify relatives or sponsors for the UACs.

The study measured the amount of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (hphc) released by both e-cigarettes, and traditional cigarettes, while using normal room air as a control.\n\nThe data found that âthe deliveries of HPHCs tested for these e-cigarette products were similar to the study air blanks rather than to deliveries from conventional cigarettesâ.\n\nMore importantly, the study also found that traditional cigarettes contain 1500 times more hphcâs than popular e-cig products. The electronic cigarette devices that were used in the study were the popular Blu e-cig and the U.K. based Sky brand.\n\nEight kinds of harmful toxins were measured including carbon monoxide and heavy metals. Even though there have been many claims vapor devices give off heavy metal toxins, the data found vapor to be relatively equal with normal air quality.\n\nThe study only focused on measuring data on the vapor emitted by devices themselves.

He ordered a prefatory medium-dry Martini of American vermouth and Beefeater gin, with lemon peel, and so did we.\n\nâIâm here to see my publishers and assorted crooks,â he said. âNot other assorted crooks, mind you. By âcrooks,â I donât mean crooks at all; I mean former Secret Service men. There are one or two of them here, you know.â\n\nâWho?â we asked.\n\nâOh, men like the boss of James Bond, the operative whoâs the chief character in all my books,â said our host. âWhen I wrote the first one, in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be the blunt instrument. One of the bibles of my youth was âBirds of the West Indies,â by James Bond, a well-known ornithologist, and when I was casting about for a name for my protagonist I thought, My God, thatâs the dullest name Iâve ever heard, so I appropriated it. Now the dullest name in the world has become an exciting one. Mrs. Bond once wrote me a letter thanking me for using it.â\n\nMr. Fleming, a sunburned, tall, curly-haired, blue-eyed man of fifty-three in a dark-blue suit, blue shirt, and blue-dotted bow tie, ordered another Martini, and so did we. âIâve spent the morning in Central Park,â he said. âI went there to see if Iâd get murdered, but I didnât. The only person who accosted me was a man who asked me how to get out. I love the Park; it was so wonderful to see the brown turning to green. I went to the Wollman skating rink and saw all those enchanting girls skating around, and then I thought, This is the place to meet a spy. What a wonderful place to meet a spy! A spy with a child. A child is the most wonderful cover for a spy, like a dog for a tart. Do tarts here have dogs? I was interested to see that in the bird reservation in the Park there was not a single bird. There are no people thereâItâs fenced in, you know, with a signâbut no birds, either. Birds canât read.â\n\nMr. Fleming lit a Senior Service cigarette and, in answer to some questions from us, said that he was a Scot, that he had been brought up in a hunting-and-fishing world where you shot or caught your lunch, and that he was a graduate of Eton and Sandhurst. âI shot against West Point,â he said. âWhen I got my commission, they were mechanizing the Army, and a lot of us decided we didnât want to be garage hands running those bloody tanks. My poor mamma, in despair, suggested that I try for the diplomatic. My father was killed in the â14-â18 war. Well, I went to the Universities of Geneva and Munich and learned extremely good French and German, but I got fed up with the exams, so in 1929 I joined Reuters as a foreign correspondent and had a hell of a time. Wonderful! I went to Moscow for Reuters. My God, it was fun! It was like a tremendous ball game.â\n\nHe ordered a dozen cherrystones and a Miller High Life, and we followed suit. âI like the name âHigh Life,â â he said. âThatâs why I order it. And American vermouth is the best in the world.â\n\nHe added that he had been with Reuters for four years, and we asked what happened next.\n\nâI decided I ought to make some money, and went into the banking and stock-brokerage businessâfirst with Cull & Company and then with Rowe & Pitman,â he said. âSix years altogether, until the war came along. Those financial firms are tremendous clubs, and great fun, but I never could figure out what a sixty-fourth of a point was. We used to spend our whole time throwing telephones at each other. Iâm afraid we ragged far too much.â\n\nWe inquired about the war, from which, according to the British Whoâs Who, Mr. Fleming emerged a naval commander, and he said, âI was personal assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence, so I went everywhere.â\n\nWe asked what heâd done after the war.\n\nâI joined the editorial board of the London Times,â he said. âI still write articles for it, and Iâm a stockholder. And in 1952, when I was in Jamaica, Cyril Connolly asked me to write an article about Jamaica for his magazine, Horizon. It was rather a euphoric piece, about Jamaica as an island for you and me to go to.â\n\nWe promised to go, and he said, âHow about some domestic Camembert? Itâs better here than the French.â\n\nDuring this and the coffee, he reverted to the non-ornithological James Bond. âI think the reason for his success is that people are lacking in heroes in real life today,â he said. âHeroes are always getting knockedâPhilip and Mountbatten are examples of thisâand I think people absolutely long for heroes. The thing thatâs wrong with the new anticolonialism is that no one has yet found a Negro hero. Theyâre scratching around with Tshombe, but ... Well, I donât regard James Bond precisely as a hero, but at least he does get on and do his duty, in an extremely corny way, and in the end, after giant despair, he wins the girl or the jackpot or whatever it may be. My books have no social significance, except a deleterious one; theyâre considered to have too much violence and too much sex. But all history has that. I finished the last one, my tenth James Bond story, in Jamaica the other day; itâs long and tremendously dull. Itâs called âThe Spy Who Loved Me,â and itâs written, supposedly, by a girl. I think itâs an absolute miracle that an elderly person like me can go on turning out these books with such zest. Itâs really a terrible indictment of my own characterâtheyâre so adolescent. But theyâre fun. I think people like them because theyâre fun. A couple of years ago, when I was in Washington, and was driving to lunch with a friend of mine, Margaret Leiter, she spotted a young couple coming out of church, and she stopped our cab. âYou must meet them,â she said. âTheyâre great fans of yours.â And she introduced me to Jack and Jackie Kennedy. âNot the Ian Fleming!â they said. What could be more gratifying than that? They asked me to dinner that night, with Joe Alsop and some other characters. I think the President likes my books because he enjoys the combination of physical violence, effort, and winning in the endâlike his PT-boat experiences. I think James Bond may be good for him after the dry pack of the day.â\n\nMr. Fleming is married to a former wife of Lord Rothermere and has a nine-year-old son, Caspar, who is away at boarding school. âHe doesnât read me, but he sells my autographs for seven shillings a time,â his father said. â¦",
  "latent_5161": "The rallying call comes a week after a similar invitation posted on the overseas Chinese website Boxun.com, ended in near farce with journalists, curious onlookers and police far outnumbering any potential protestors.\n\nDespite this apparent initial failure, which was openly scorned by China's state media as \"performance art\", the boxun.com blog site asked again for what it called \"strolling protests\" against the ruling Communist Party at 2pm on Sunday.\n\n\"We invite every participant to stroll, watch, or even just pretend to pass by. As long as you are present, the authoritarian government will be shaking with fear,\" it said.\n\nChina's soaring economic growth in the last few decades, which has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty, is often said to have dulled any appetite among ordinary Chinese for the kind of revolutionary chaos seen in the Middle East in recent weeks.\n\nHowever despite the apparent solidity of its powerbase, China's ruling Communist Party has shown signs of growing nervousness in recent weeks as street protests sweep away autocratic regimes across the Middle East.\n\nAs well as the massive deployment of uniformed police, China's pervasive state security apparatus has worked to neuter the spread of dissent online as well as placing as many as 100 activists and potential organisers under house arrest.\n\nHu Jintao, the Chinese president, in a highly unusual public intervention into the realm of social policy, made a speech to Party bosses urging tighter controls of the \"virtual society\" and greater efforts to guide public opinion in \"healthy directions\" or risk greater \"social conflicts\".\n\nThat speech was followed in successive days by public warnings from senior Party figures for better management of the tensions and social grievances arising out of China's rapid economic transformation.\n\n\"Many believe that China will emerge from its period of social transformation in a steady and peaceful manner,\" added an editorial in the party mouthpiece People's Daily, \"But... it is not totally unfeasible that the nation could fall into social turmoil should its public governance fail.\" The call for the fresh Jasmine rallies was cast as an open letter to China's a rubber-stamp parliament, National People's Congress, which opens its annual meeting on March 5 and is always considered a sensitive moment in the Chinese political calendar.\n\nThe activists, signing themselves anonymously as \"organizers of China's Jasmine gatherings\" urged people to shout, \"We want food! We want work! We want housing! We want fairness!\".\n\nThe slogans aim at key issues in China at a time of rising inflation, a growing rich-poor divide and frequent outbursts of anger at the levels of official corruption and cronyism.\n\n\"What we need to do now is to put pressure on the Chinese ruling (Communist) party,\" said the renewed appeal which listed locations in 18 cities across China for the protests.\n\n\"If the party does not conscientiously fight corruption and accept the supervision of the people, then will it please exit the stage of history.\" Although the boxun.com website is blocked in China, news of the call did appear to be leaking onto some corners of the Chinese internet where some tech-savvy users employ special software to circumvent web controls.\n\nAttempts to search China's most popular microblog site, Sina Weibo for the word \"jasmine\" were blocked but Twitter users were discussing the Jasmine protest call under the generic prefix \"Â£CN227\" â a reference to Sunday's date, February 27.\n\n\"I am planning to wander around Wangfujing [the designated protest site in Beijing] on Sunday,\" wrote one contributor, \"Shall I bring light jasmine tea or honey jasmine tea?\"",
  "latent_5164": "NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ â When protesters took to the city's downtown last week, their message was clear: It's time to give President Donald Trump the boot.\n\nA few dozen people attended the rally to impeach Trump on the evening of Sept. 6, outside Rep. Frank Pallone Jr.'s office on Church Street. There, a handful of speakers urged the congressman and other leaders to push for Trump's removal from office, in between chants and the beating of a drum.\n\nâI've been really depressed about what's going on, and I've been trying to convince people that we need to impeach the president,â Charlie Kratovil, the activist and newspaper publisher who organized the demonstration, told the crowd, âbecause that won't solve all our problems. But we won't be able to solve any problems with President Trump.â\n\nSign Up for E-News\n\nThe event drew a number of key figures from local and state left-wing political circles. That included Seth Kaper-Dale, who's running for governor with the Green Party; Bill Brennan, the North Jersey man who failed to nab the Democratic gubernatorial nomination after filing a complaint against Gov. Chris Christie; Larry Hamm, the head of the People's Organization for Progress; and Junior Romero, the Central New Jersey organizer for Food and Water Watch.\n\nAfter a rainy afternoon, the weather held as protesters stood and listened, signs in hand.\n\nMost of the lights in Pallone's office, meanwhile, were turned off. No staffers could be seen inside.\n\nWhile Pallone drew some praise from the demonstrators, they also said he must work to remove Trump from office.\n\nâNow, I like Congressman Pallone,â Brennan said. âHe's definitely voted the way I want him to vote. But we need more than that from leadership right now.â\n\nNeither Pallone nor his staff attended the rally. But his office sent a statement to Kratovilâwhich he sent, with email receipts, to TAPinto New Brunswick, confirming that it did indeed come from a Pallone staffer.\n\nIn the statement, Pallone said he supports special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the president's âmany inappropriate and potentially unlawful actionsâ and Russia's involvement in the 2016 election.\n\nâI have great concerns about the Trump administration's interactions with Russia and its disregard for the law,â Pallone said. âWe need to gain all available information on the president's misconduct, which I believe could very well lead to impeachment.â\n\nEven so, the New Brunswick demonstrators argued that now is the time to push forth impeachment proceedings. They noted that at least two congresspeople have already moved to make that happen.\n\nKaper-Dale said bureaucratic and technical issues related to Trump's campaign and business dealings might be the avenue through which impeachment can succeed.\n\nâThey are dramatic. They are big-deal things,â he said. âBut they're small deal compared to what is happening to immigrant families when wives and husbands and children get separated by an ocean because somebody is trying to carry out racial and ethnic cleansing under the guise of immigration reform.â\n\nThe activists claimed that any number of Trump's prior actions have already made him susceptible to impeachment. His firing of James Comey, the former head of the FBI, on the basis that he was investigating Russian interference in the election could prove fatal to Trump's presidency, they said.\n\nImpeachment doesn't hinge on the conviction of a crime, they said. Other presidents and officials in smaller offices have also undergone the processâsome within the past couple of years, they said.\n\nâThe change has to start somewhere,â Kratovil, who has publicly advocated for Trump's impeachment for months, said. âWhy not here in New Brunswick, New Jersey?â",

Even if they did lose two tons of the drug on the way home. The bust was carried out by the California-based Coast Guard cutter Stratton after a Navy aircraft spotted the suspicious vessel about 200 miles south of Mexico. Coast Guard crew members boarded the sub and arrested four suspected smugglers.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times describes a semi-submersible vessel as a low-tech submarine that travels with only its cockpit and exhaust pipe above water. They are reportedly hard to detect and dangerous to operate. Mashable reports that a quarter of the seized cocaine was lost after the crew of the Stratton left it aboard the semi-submersible for stabilization while towing the vessel to shore. It didn't work: The vessel, and the drugs, sank. Though it gave 4,000 pounds of coke a watery grave, the Stratton has seized more than 33,000 pounds of narcotics since May, says the Coast Guard.

But the route across the Mediterranean is also far more deadly.\n\nThe International Organisation for Migration (IOM) estimates at least one in 50 die in the attempt, compared to one in 90 one year ago, as the EU-trained Libyan coastguard become more aggressive in their tactics against NGO rescue boats.\n\nIn August, Doctors Without Borders (MSF), Save the Children and Germany's Sea Eye suspended rescue operations given the hostility met by Libyan guards.\n\nThe EU's naval force Sophia has also been sinking boats, forcing people onto less seaworthy rubber dinghies, amid moves by EU states to ban their sale to Libya.\n\nOxfam International's deputy director, Natalia Alonso, said the drop in arrivals to Europe \"only means people in need of help are stuck in Libya, without any improvement of their situation.\"\n\nGreece, which is often touted as a success in terms of flows, has also seen over 5,000 arrive on the islands from Turkey last month alone.\n\nYet conditions remain deplorable on the ground in the lead up to the winter months, with NGOs fearing a 2016 repeat when people awoke to deep snow at the Moria camp on Lesbos island. Temperatures at the time had plummeted to -18 degrees Celsius.\n\nBut EU leaders insist the deal is working, noting that some â¬883 million has been dispersed for refugee projects inside Turkey as of this month and that around 10,000 Syrians have been resettled from the country.\n\nIn parallel, misgivings about Turkey's government crackdown on journalists, human rights activists and others, have done little to curtail Ankara.\n\nDublin asylum reforms\n\nEfforts to revamp the EU's Dublin regulation, an EU law that determines which member state is responsible for processing an asylum claim, has been broadly sidelined.\n\nTusk on Thursday announced plans to reach a consensus in the first half of 2018.

  "latent_5957": "Interim principal Denise L. Bloomer directs children to their classrooms at Greater Grace Charter Academy in Vacherie, La., in late March. (Max Becherer/Polaris Images for The Washington Post)\n\nâ At the new public charter school in this Mississippi River town, nearly all the students are African American. Parents seem unconcerned about that. They just hope their children will get a better education.\n\nâI wanted my girls to soar higher,â said Alfreda Cooper, who is black and has two daughters at Greater Grace Charter Academy.\n\nThree hours up the road, students at Delta Charter School in Concordia Parish are overwhelmingly white, even though the surrounding community is far more mixed.\n\nAs the charter school movement accelerates across the country, a critical question remains unanswered: whether the creation of charters is accelerating school segregation. Federal judges who oversee desegregation plans in Louisiana are wrestling with that issue at a time when President Trump wants to spend billions of dollars on charter schools, vouchers and other âschool choiceâ initiatives.\n\n[Trump seeks to slash Education Department but make big push for school choice]\n\nIn February, a judge found that Delta Charter had violated the terms of the parishâs court-ordered desegregation plan and asked the parties to submit proposals for how to move forward. The local school board in Concordia not only is seeking reimbursement of millions of dollars, but also wants the judge to require the charter school to cancel its enrollment and start over with the aim of creating a more diverse student body. That would include offering transportation to the school â something that could make it possible for more black students to attend.\n\nThe nationâs schools have become more segregated by race and class over the past two decades, according to federal data, and some research indicates that charter schools are more likely to be segregated than traditional public schools. Some charter advocates say they are more interested in creating good schools for marginalized children as quickly as possible â no matter the consequences for the racial makeup of enrollment.\n\nâI ainât got time for people talking about integration when weâre trying to meet the needs of these children,â said Howard L. Fuller, an education professor at Marquette University who supports charter schools, private-school vouchers and other efforts to give parents more say in education.\n\nMore than 60 years after âseparateâ was declared unequal in the landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education, research shows that schools serving mostly poor children of color have fewer resources, more inexperienced teachers and limited access to rigorous coursework.\n\nâNo one is saying that charter schools are bad,â said Deuel Ross, an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund involved in one of the Louisiana cases. âBut research and hundreds of years of history have shown that segregated schools are not whatâs best for black children.â\n\nChoice vs. integration\n\nThe first charter schools â taxpayer-funded and privately run â were founded a quarter-century ago as an experiment to give teachers more freedom to innovate. Today, advocates say the institutions provide disadvantaged students with a high-quality education, while critics say they siphon money out of traditional public schools, at least partially privatizing an essential government function.\n\nCharters account for a small share of public school enrollment â about 5 percent in 2014, federal data shows. Trumpâs interest in expanding charters could accelerate their growth, forcing state and local leaders to make difficult decisions about how and whether to balance the ideals of parent choice and integrated schools.\n\nConcordia Parish, which stretches for 70 miles along the Mississippi border, has been trying to desegregate its schools for decades, under the eye of the federal government. In 2013, a federal judge allowed Delta Charter School to open there on the condition that its student body reflect the demographics of the school district.\n\nAt the time, the district was split almost evenly between black and white students. But the charter, in the predominantly African American town of Ferriday, has never enrolled a proportionate share of black students. Seventeen percent of Delta Charterâs students were black at the start of the 2016-2017 school year, court records show.\n\n[On the anniversary of Brown v. Board, new evidence that U.S. schools are resegregating]\n\nThe local school board also contends in court documents that the charter school has siphoned $11.6 million from district schools in the past four years, making it harder for the parish to carry out its desegregation plan, which includes a districtwide magnet program.\n\nThe charter school opened in a building that once housed a âsegregation academyâ â one of the all-white private schools that emerged decades ago in the South to resist court-ordered integration. That symbolism is not lost on the community. Adding to the tension, a veteran teacher in the school district said many of the areaâs high-performing students and involved parents have decamped for the charter.\n\nâItâs kind of looked down upon if you go to a public school,â said teacher DâShay Oaks, referring to the traditional public schools.\n\nThe students left behind have lost academic role models, she said. And the school has lost fundraising and volunteer power, delaying an effort to update its computer lab and make other needed improvements.\n\nA lawyer for Delta Charter declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. But Sheena Mize, whose son and daughter attend the charter, says the school is succeeding academically and should not be penalized for the communityâs long-standing racial divide.\n\nâIt is the way it is in this area,â said Mize, who is white. âThe community separated themselves on their own. I donât think itâs anyoneâs fault the way it ended up.â\n\nCaroline Roemer, executive director of the Louisiana Association of Public Charter Schools, defended the school. Delta Charter should not be asked to bear the burden of solving âsocietyâs complex racial struggles and history,â she said. The school â which is rated a B on the stateâs A-to-F scale â âhas done more to create a high-quality public school that is open to all residents than the district has achieved in the past 60 years,â she said.\n\nCharter schools do not use neighborhood boundaries to determine enrollment. Theoretically, that gives them the potential to create more student diversity than traditional schools. But for most charters, desegregation has not been the primary goal.\n\nOf the states that allow charter schools, about a third require affirmative steps toward diversity. Even then, most have no mechanisms for enforcing such provisions, according to Erica Frankenberg, a Pennsylvania State University professor and expert on school segregation.\n\nAnd there is mounting evidence that charters contribute to the broader resegregation of the nationâs classrooms. Researchers with the Civil Rights Project at the University of California at Los Angeles found in 2010 that black students in charter schools are far more likely than their counterparts in traditional public schools to be educated in an intensely segregated setting.\n\nOther studies in California, North Carolina, Minnesota and the District have reached similar conclusions. But some experts caution that many factors, including housing patterns and geography, can influence the racial distribution of students at any given school.\n\nNationally, evidence on charter school performance is mixed. Some are mired in financial difficulty and academic mediocrity. But there are clear examples of charter schools that provide poor and minority children with stronger educational opportunities.\n\n[Five myths about charter schools]\n\nThe KIPP charter network says its students graduate from high school at a rate 20 percentage points higher than their low-income peers across the country do. At the all-male Urban Prep Charter Academy in Chicago, 100 percent of graduates have been accepted to college, including to Ivy League universities, over the past eight years.\n\nAnother option\n\nPeople in Vacherie hope Greater Grace Charter Academy will be one of these beat-the-odds schools.\n\nTeacher Lynette James leads students in an interactive learning exercise with the help of a touchable video screen at Greater Grace Charter Academy. (Max Becherer/Polaris Images for The Washington Post)\n\nHoused in a cinder block building leased from a local church, Greater Grace is located in a town situated amid sugar cane fields on the west bank of the Mississippi. Each morning, students clad in maroon uniforms stream inside as flatbed trucks whiz by on the highway out front.\n\nDuring the day, the children learn in trailers in the back, and at dismissal, they board the charter schoolâs yellow bus, bound for all corners of 260-square-mile St. James Parish, where the school is located.\n\nBut Greater Grace does not reflect the demographics of a parish school system that also has been trying to diversify its classrooms for decades under a court-ordered desegregation plan. Of the 3,800 students in St. James Parish, roughly two-thirds are black, and a third are white. At Greater Grace, more than 90 percent of students are black, giving rise to concerns that the new school has created yet another racially isolated setting.\n\n[As D.C. gentrifies, some charter schools aim to reach broader spectrum]\n\nWhen a federal judge allowed Greater Grace to open, he emphasized the value of parental choice. But black parents and the NAACP have appealed, arguing that Greater Grace should be closed until it can reopen with a more integrated approach. Oral arguments are scheduled for June at a federal appeals court in New Orleans.\n\nRhoda Johnson, a black plaintiff in the case, said she is troubled by the segregated nature of the new charter. As a child, she attended an all-black district school not far from where Greater Grace now stands.\n\nâWe used hand-me-down books from the white school,â recalled Johnson, 56, whose son and grandsons attend schools in the St. James public district.\n\nLocals say that in this parish, dotted with antebellum plantations once powered by slave labor and now dependent on tourist dollars, one side always has been predominantly black and the other predominantly white. Even after decades of desegregation efforts, traditional public schools within the parish also remain intensely segregated, according to court records.\n\nClaudette Aubert, the charter schoolâs founder, said it was time to give families in her rural community another option.\n\nShe opened Greater Grace last fall after learning that many students were falling years behind in reading and math at traditional public schools. The charter school offers small class sizes and computer-based instruction to help meet students at their level, Aubert said.\n\nA pastor in St. James Parish and former special-education teacher, Aubert says she spent years educating residents about the possibilities a charter school could bring to their community.\n\nIt is still too early to tell whether Greater Grace will make good on its promise of a better education. But when the school opened its doors last year, 85 students enrolled.\n\nâThey showed up,â Aubert said. âThey wanted another choice.â\n\nEmma Brown contributed to this report, which was produced in partnership with the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University, where McLaren is a student.",
  "latent_6048": "The Clinton campaign has repeatedly pushed an article linking Donald Trump with a Russian bank, even though multiple outlets â including the New York Times â have disputed the claims.\n\nOn Monday, Slateâs Franklin Foer published an article with an explosive revelation. According to Foer, a number of cybersecurity experts claim that a private computer server in Trump Tower appeared to be directly connected to Alfa Bank, a commercial institution in Russia. This was the latest in an ongoing mainstream media narrative that the Republican nominee is secretly a Kremlin puppet.\n\nThe legitimacy of Foerâs article was immediately called into question. A number of outlets, including the Daily Beast and the New York Times, said they had looked into the story as well, but found it lacking.\n\n\"[FBI] agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead â which they ultimately came to doubt â about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank,â the Times reported.\n\n\"FBI officials spent weeks examining computer data showing an odd stream of activity to a Trump Organization server and Alfa Bank,\" the Times continued. \"But the FBI ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts.\"\n\nFoer claimed that the server activity \"appeared to follow the contours of political happenings in the United States.\" Writing for Vox, Timothy Lee pointed out that \"If anything, the chart shows the opposite of that.\"\n\n\"In short, this chart seems to be totally unrelated to the political calendar. It provides no support for the idea that the Kremlin was using it as a back channel before and during the Republican National Convention in mid-July,\" Lee writes.\n\nDespite the fact that the Slate story was debunked almost as soon as it was published, the Clinton campaign has seized it as part of its arsenal of Russophobic tactics to defeat Trump.\n\n\"The Washington Post piled on, attacking the Foer report, saying 'For all of Foerâs exegesis of the situation â culminating, he admits, with a lack of certainty about what it all means â it seems likely that the simplest answer isnât that someone affiliated with Trump or his campaign set up a backchannel method for contacting someone at Alfa Bank in Russia,'\" says Sam Sacks of Radio Sputnikâs Unanimous Dissent.\n\n\"The Intercept also has a pretty thorough takedown of the Foer piece, published on Tuesday. So too do a number of computer researchers, including people who were cited in the Foer piece, coming out and saying that the Foer piece is garbage.\"\n\nUnfortunately, these grand Russian conspiracy theories distract from the legitimate issues of Trumpâs campaign, including his proposals to ban Muslims from the country and his frightening insinuations that nuclear weapons could be used in the Middle East to combat terrorists.",
  "latent_6078": "(CNN) -- The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit against Wal-Mart for the termination of a Michigan employee whose doctor verified his illness qualified for medical marijuana use.\n\nWal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, fired Joseph Casias in November 2009 after he failed an on-the-job injury-related drug test. Casias suffers from a rare form of cancer in his nasal cavity and brain, and he relied on his doctor's medical marijuana prescription to alleviate the daily pain. Casias is one of about 20,000 legal medical marijuana users in Michigan.\n\n\"Medical marijuana has had a life-changing positive effect for Joseph, but Wal-Mart made him pay a stiff and unfair price for his medicine,\" said Scott Michelman, staff attorney with the ACLU Drug Law Reform Project.\n\n\"No patient should be forced to choose between adequate pain relief and gainful employment, and no employer should be allowed to intrude upon private medical choices made by employees in consultation with their doctors,\" Michelman said.\n\nWal-Mart officials say they are sympathetic to Casias' condition, but the company needed to put the safety of its customers and associates first.\n\n\"As more states allow this treatment, employers are left without any guidelines except the federal standard,\" wrote Lorenzo Lopez, a director of media relations at Wal-Mart, in an e-mail to CNN. \"In these cases, until further guidance is available, we will always default to what we believe is the safest environment for our associates and customers.\"\n\nThe ACLU's lawsuit, filed in Calhoun County Circuit Court in Michigan, comes at a time when the controversy over medical marijuana is still being debated in many states. To date, 14 states have laws allowing the use of medical marijuana, which protect legal users from criminalization. But the laws are murky when it comes to protecting users from termination by their employers in some states.\n\nCasias told CNN in March that he never arrived at work high and used the medical marijuana only outside of his work hours.\n\nMichigan is an at-will employment state, which means employers can terminate a worker for any reason except for being in a federally protected class such as race, gender and religion. The ACLU is arguing legal medical marijuana users should also be protected under a Michigan law.\n\n\"I was angry they did this to me because I always tried my best,\" Casias said to CNN in March. He had worked for Wal-Mart for nearly five years to support his wife and two young children. He started at the company as a grocery store stocker in 2004 before moving up to become an inventory control manager. He earned an Associate of the Year Award at Wal-Mart in 2008, a year before his termination.\n\nHe has battled with his cancer for more than a decade. The lawsuit says the medical marijuana was able to provide him with pain relief.",

Jesse Jackson on Friday called for a massive \"multiracial, multicutural\" demonstration in the Pacific Northwest to help Portland heal from the deadly MAX train attack and urged people to \"turn this minus into a plus and not allow violence to be the brand of Portland.\"\n\nA week after race-fueled stabbings caused the deaths of two men and serious injuries to a third, Jackson stood inside Northeast Portland's Augustana Lutheran Church with Multnomah County Commissioner Loretta Smith and head pastor, the Rev. Mark Knutson, to denounce the attack.\n\nThe men stabbed while intervening on behalf of two teenage girls deserve a statue for their actions, Jackson said. He called them the \"real definition of Portland\" and said that the girls who were the subject of another train passenger's tirade shouldn't feel any guilt. One of the girls was wearing a hijab.\n\n\"This is a great city with such great people and we must not surrender the hope that's here,\" Jackson said. \"But silence would be betrayal, some people must express themselves. We must not be silent as if all hope is lost.\"\n\nWatch Rev. Jesse Jackson live\n\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive Editorial Board will host Rev. Jesse Jackson at 2 p.m. today to discuss how Portland can heal after the race-fueled stabbings on MAX last week. Tune in at our\n\n.\n\nJackson's speech at the church kicked off a day in Portland with a schedule that included a breakfast with Portland-area faith leaders, a meeting with Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, a meeting with The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board, and a banquet to honor county officials from across the country before catching a red-eye flight back to Chicago. He was attending a conference of the National Organization of Black County Officials.\n\nJackson arrived at the church with Smith around 7:45 a.m. in a small motorcade of two Chevy Suburbans and a Chevy Caprice and greeted people with handshakes, hugs and smiles as he made his way inside.\n\nHe said he hopes President Donald Trump reaches out to the families of all the victims and considers hosting them at the White House, saying it would be a good gesture to help in the healing process.\n\nThe attack in Portland could have happened anywhere, Jackson said, and it's up to everyone to work together to promote love, peace and co-existence.\n\n\"None of us are safe and secure until all of us are safe and secure,\" he said.\n\nWhile later speaking to a crowd of about 50 in the church and with more than two dozen Portland-area leaders behind him, Jackson urged people to keep fighting for a version of Portland that \"shows us living together as brothers and sisters, not dying apart as fools.\"\n\nJackson asked the crowd to pray for the girls who were targeted on the MAX train, the men who were stabbed and their families. He said the presidential election has fueled an undercurrent of fear throughout the country, and people can help to quell it by choosing inclusion over segregation. He again urged a mass march of people in the Pacific Northwest to illustrate love over hate, and he praised Oregon for its automatic voter registration system and said he hopes to see it implemented across the nation.\n\nJackson led everyone in a prayer after his speech and mingled among the crowd afterwards for several minutes as someone sang \"Stand By Me.\"\n\nJackson later met with Micah Fletcher, who survived being stabbed in the MAX attack, at the Marriott Hotel in downtown Portland. Fletcher arrived around 4:40 p.m., in a hat and scarf around his neck, and was accompanied out by Jackson nearly an hour and a half later.\n\nDuring a conversation with The Oregonian/OregonLive after Fletcher left, Jackson said he still hoped to speak to the two girls in person before leaving for Chicago later Friday night.\n\nJackson said they talked about how Fletcher was stabbed, and Jackson said he still found it remarkable Fletcher survived to tell his story.\n\nJackson said Fletcher felt guilty that he appears to be receiving more attention than the girls who were targeted and said he has been the subject of threats since being stabbed.\n\nJackson described Fletcher as caring, sensitive to racial injustice in Portland and worried about the lasting trauma the girls may endure. Jackson said he encouraged Fletcher to continue standing up for what he believed in and said he gave Fletcher his number to keep in touch.\n\n-- Everton Bailey Jr.\n\nebailey@oregonian.com\n\n503-221-8343; @EvertonBailey",

  "latent_6338": "According to a report form The Washington Post, the Donald Trump campaign intervened during the drafting of the Republican platform to try to remove an anti-Russia and anti-Vladimir Putin amendment.\n\nDuring last weekâs national security committee platform meeting, committee member Diana Denman introduced an amendment in support of Ukrainian opposition to Putinâs invasion of Crimea and backing military aid to the country. âToday, the post-Cold War ideal of a âEurope whole and freeâ is being severely tested by Russiaâs ongoing military aggression in Ukraine,â the amendment read. âThe Ukrainian people deserve our admiration and support in their struggle.â\n\nBut Trump staffers in the room intervened. With the support of the pro-Trump delegates, they tabled the amendment to try to and block it later. Eventually they amended the amendment to remove Republican support for sending military aid, replacing it with language calling for âappropriate assistance.â The end result of the watered down language, the Post reports, is that âthe official Republican party position on arms for Ukraine will be at odds with almost all the partyâs national security leaders.â\n\nDuring the Republican primary race, Trump raised eyebrows for being the only candidate to express admiration of Putin; âI think our country does plenty of killing also,â he said in defense of Putinâs assassination of journalists.

  "latent_6352": "There are few stories as celebrated as the artistâs return from the brink of their own destruction. In the case of Canadian pop-punk outfit Sum 41 â or, more specifically, frontman Deryck Whibley â this timeless narrative rings as true as ever, forming the core of the bandâs sixth studio album, 13 Voices. Itâs impossible to talk about the bandâs journey and the resulting critically acclaimed work without exploring Whibleyâs widely publicised battle with alcohol â a battle he almost lost in 2014. But right now, speaking with us ahead of his return to Singapore, with co-founding guitarist Dave âBrownsoundâ Baksh reunited with the band, Whibley is on top of the world: âEverything is amazing and I canât complain.â\n\nFor a band that has entered its 21st year of peddling heart-on-sleeve lyrics, power chord progressions and double-time drums, and continues to pull crowds in 2017 in the midst of an all-time high for pop music, there canât be too much to complain about. Whatâs more, itâs no easy feat to rally enough fans to successfully finance an album, in an age in which music is often a perceived right, rather than a privilege.\n\nEmploying a crowdfunding campaign for 13 Voices â a first time for the band, and a somewhat desperate measure for one that has seen widespread success â even Whibley had doubts over whether the world wanted another Sum 41 album. âI think thereâs always self-doubt when making an album. You never really know where itâs going to end up. You just do the work and hope for the best, really.â Taking a leap of faith and leaving it in the hands of the fans ultimately paid off, producing what critics seem to agree is one of the bandâs most honest and accomplished albums to date.\n\nMarking Bakshâs return following a nine-year absence, and the first album to feature drummer Frank Zummo following Steve Joczâs departure, 13 Voices is inextricably tied to Whibleyâs personal turmoil in overcoming alcohol addiction â one that doctors warned would kill him if he were to have had just one more drink. It therefore comes as no surprise that the album asserts a sense of urgency and despair from beginning to end, while seeing Whibley emerge from the ashes of personal destruction with renewed vigor and vitriol.\n\nâWe have a stronger relationship now with the fans than ever before. It feels more like a family.â\n\nâIt felt like a new beginning and a new band,â says Whibley on the new five-member formation, adding, âWe sounded stronger than ever. It was really exciting starting back up.â Trading a bottle for pen and paper following the 37-year-oldâs discharge from hospital care in 2014 â an age far younger than most would envision for the debilitating effects of alcohol abuse â Whibleyâs struggle to regain his motor skills and the emotional ruin brought upon by addiction are translated through anthemic prose on each of the albumâs 12 tracks.\n\nOn some, Whibley plays the role of a martyr, acknowledging the errors of his ways and accepting crucifixion â by the hand of a higher power, the media, the public, loved ones, or perhaps even his own. On others, Whibley plays the crucifier, returning from beyond the veil to hand down violent reprisal and judgment. It is, without a doubt, some of Whibleyâs most candid and vulnerable work, but also some of his angriest. Itâs within these contradictory stances that we find illumination, uncovering the ebb and flow of the frontmanâs shifts from feeling abandoned and cast out, to rising above both internal and external demons.\n\nâI like them all, but âTwisted by Designâ might be my favourite,â he shares. âI like the melody, the lyrics and the sound of it all. Itâs not fast but it comes off as pretty heavy, still.â The song is perhaps the most telling example of Whibleyâs frame of mind, serving as an acceptance for past mistakes and using his âscars to bearâ as a sobering reminder and source of strength, in both reconciling the past and moving forward.\n\nWhile Whibley states that the self-produced, recorded and engineered album chronicles âeverything Iâve gone through,â it also delivers the caustic anti-pop aggression that defined the bandâs aesthetic during its heyday. When not exploring the concepts of redemption and the salvation of his soul, he spends the rest abdicating from those who have sacrificed their own. Snarling almost biblically on songs like âFake My Own Deathâ and âGod Save Us All (Death To POP)â, thereâs an adamant stance of separation from those willing to sell their souls for a spot in the limelight â perhaps a plea born out of frustration, from someone who knows firsthand the difficulties in trying to reclaim his own.\n\nRELATED: Sum 41 live in Singapore review: Resurrected, refreshed and rowdier than ever\n\nDespite his own voice dominating charts, TV shows and radio waves in the past, Whibley appears to not only separate himself from the prevailing pop machine, but also the pop-punk resurgence on which Sum 41 stands at the forefront. Lending little time to hypothesise the reasons for the genreâs triumphant return, Whibley surmises, âI donât know. I donât really care or think about it, either. It might have something to do with the fact that most music is not very good these days â over-produced pop music with no meaning.â When asked what shape the pop-punk sound could possibly take in the future, including that of his own band, he similarly takes no liberties in speculating, adopting a âdonât know, donât careâ stance.\n\nWhat he clearly does care about, however, are his fans â and coming off the recently concluded Donât Call It A Sum-Back Tour, he has witnessed the forging of a new bond between Sum 41 and its dedicated followers. âI think thereâs a change in the relationship overall, since weâve now been around for so long. We have a stronger relationship now with the fans than ever before. It feels more like a family.â\n\nWith an arsenal of new music and old favourites, and a five-piece formation to put on a performance thatâs âbigger and better than ever,â fans whoâve been there since their metal-infused beginnings to new listeners recently inducted by the gospel of 13 Voices are assured that theyâll see the band at its best. âWe always try to put on the best and most energetic show possible. We want people to leave the show having one of the best times of their lives,â says Whibley. In helping fans have the time of their lives, itâs evident that Whibley has renewed a new lease on his own.\n\nSum 41 performs in Singapore on 24 August, 2017 at ZEPP@BIGBOX.

  "latent_6552": "Former Patriots doctor Thomas Gill, right, watches as offensive linemen Chris Barket and Nate Soder go through some workouts before a game in December 2013. (Boston Globe/Boston Globe via Getty Images)\n\nThe NFL Players Association, in a court document recently filed in an unrelated case, alleged that a team physician for the New England Patriots altered the medical treatment of a player in an effort to bolster a legal case that would force the player to return his signing bonus to the team.\n\nA grievance letter sent by the playersâ union cites an e-mail from former team physician Thomas Gill that the NFLPA contends shows Gill telling Patriots owner Robert Kraft and President Jonathan Kraft that he was âtrying to put together a caseâ that would compel former defensive end Jonathan Fanene to return $3.85 million after he suffered a knee injury in 2012. The letter further asserts that Patriots Coach Bill Belichick directed Gill to delay any surgery on Faneneâs knee while an effort was made to persuade the player to retire, thus forgoing his bonus.\n\nReached by telephone Thursday, Gill called the grievance a âlegal maneuverâ and insisted he put the playerâs health ahead of the organizationâs concerns. The Patriots did not respond to multiple requests seeking comment.\n\nThe substance of the grievance provides a window into the potential conflicts of interest and competing pressures that result when physicians employed by teams provide primary care to players. The Collective Bargaining Agreement between NFL owners and players stipulates that a team physicianâs primary obligation in providing care âshall be not to the club but instead to the player-patient.â\n\nHowever, difficult judgments about drugs, procedures and treatment are further complicated when the best course of treatment clashes with the best interests of the team.\n\nFanene was released by the Patriots in August 2012 for âfailure to disclose physical condition,â a claim that if proved would have allowed the team to recoup a signing bonus.\n\nThe playersâ union sent the letter to the NFL management council on June 19, 2013, demanding that the Patriots terminate Gill in accordance with the terms of the CBA.\n\nFaneneâs agent, Angelo Wright, confirmed the e-mails cited in the NFLPA letter were subpoenaed in a labor dispute between Fanene and the team. Wright said Fanene accepted a settlement agreement from the Patriots that bars him from discussing the matter. It also prevents Fanene from pursuing a civil case against either the Patriots or Gill.\n\nThe confidential letter entered the public record last week, when the NFLâs lawyers included it as an exhibit in an unrelated case concerning the conduct of NFL physicians. In urging U.S. District Court judge William Alsup to dismiss a class action lawsuit in which more than 1,300 former players allege that NFL medical staffs regularly violate laws in plying their teams with addictive narcotics to mask injuries, the NFL argued that the CBA between owners and players provides a grievance process to resolve legal-medical disputes and attached the letter as evidence of that process. The e-mails cited in the grievance letter were not included in the court filing.\n\nIn April 2014, the Patriots announced Gill had stepped down as the team physician. Gill claimed his resignation had nothing to do with the grievance.\n\nNFLPA President DeMaurice Smith said he couldnât discuss the details of the grievance, the related hearing or the terms of the eventual settlement but did express concern over the Patriotsâ internal communication cited in the letter.\n\nâIt makes serious allegations about the integrity and independence of a team doctor providing medical care to a player,â Smith said. âThe allegations would suggest behavior that is completely inappropriate. I will look forward to seeing what the league intends to do as far as investigating this pursuant to their personal conduct policy.â\n\nGill said Thursday: âGuys always know that they are treated as a patient and not as a player, and thatâs always something that I was very proud of during my tenure.â\n\nGill acknowledged Fanene passed a team physical before signing a three-year contract with the Patriots on March 20, 2012, after spending seven seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals. According to the Boston Globe, Fanene also passed a second team physical in training camp and did well in a handful of early practices before his release in late August 2012.\n\nâIt just didnât work out,â Belichick told reporters at the time. âNothing to add other than that. It just didnât work out.â\n\nThe Patriots later sought to reclaim Faneneâs bonus money on the grounds that he had arthritis in his left knee and failed to disclose that he needed pain medications to practice and play.\n\nGill confirmed he wrote an e-mail to Kraft using the phrase âtrying to put together a case,â but he disputed the context.\n\nHe said the training staff asked him to summarize for the Patriotsâ owners why the player had been cut so soon after receiving a signing bonus.\n\nâIf it was an e-mail to Mr. Kraft, it was basically saying, âIâm going to put together the chronology the training staff had asked me to put together,â â he said.\n\nIn its grievance letter, the playersâ union alleged that Gill initially scheduled Fanene for arthroscopic surgery to treat a knee injury. However, he subsequently âtook the direction of Head Coach Bill Belichickâ to âplay four corner offenseâ (a metaphorical reference to a stalling tactic in basketball) and delay any surgery, and âultimately Dr. Gill refused to do the surgery at all,â advising Fanene that if he wanted the surgery, he should use his personal physician.\n\nGill also confirmed receiving such direction in an e-mail from Belichick but said he was unclear on what Belichick meant.\n\nâCoach Belichick sent an e-mail that said something about âletâs play some four corners here,â which I think had to do with the timing,â Gill said. âItâs vague to me at this point. . . .\n\nâHe was saying letâs slow this process down till we can figure out whatâs going on with Jonathan. Coach was talking about a day or two of trying to figure things out.â\n\nHe said the directive âhad zero effectâ on his treatment of Fanene. âThere was never any care withheld or anything like that.â\n\nIn the grievance letter, the union also alleged âthere is evidence that Dr. Gill may have fabricated and/or back-dated notes of certain meetings in an effort to advance the Patriots legal case against Mr. Fanene,â but no supportive evidence was included in its letter.\n\nWright said he had never seen a team so brazenly seek the release of a player. âNot to that degree,â the agent said. âIt depends on the fish, I guess. Depends on what theyâre fishing for.â\n\nGill served as team physician for several New England professional sports teams and was involved in some controversies involving high-profile players.\n\nPatriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, for example, reportedly clashed with the doctor over treatment of a forearm injury that prematurely ended Gronkowskiâs 2012 season and then required four surgeries to properly heal.\n\nGill also served as the medical director for the Boston Red Sox from 2005 to 2011 and drew the ire of Jacoby Ellsbury for misdiagnosing four fractured ribs that limited the outfielder to 18 games in 2010.\n\nFollowing the 2011 season, the Red Sox eliminated the position of medical director, effectively severing ties with Gill.\n\nGill also served as team physician for the Boston Bruins from 1998 to 2012 and the New England Revolution of MLS from 1998 to 2010.\n\nUpon his departure from the Patriots last year, the team issued a statement saying, âWe greatly appreciate the many years of dedicated service and innovation that Dr. Gill provided our team and wish him well in the future.â\n\nFanene, now 32, never returned to the NFL.",
  "latent_6619": "The 2016 golf season is starting to pick up speed. In just a couple of months, the first major of the year, The Masters, kicks off at Augusta and with it the race for the FedEx Cup.\n\nBeing a golf nut, Iâve always wanted to create a visualization of PGA Tour stats. Thankfully, PGA.com has some impressive stats that are incredibly easy to get â no Python or Web Data Connector needed. Just the handy copy/paste into Excel does the trick.\n\nLooking at the data, I wasnât satisfied with just seeing numbers or bars of a PGA proâs average shot off the tee. I felt the story wasnât being told the right way. I wanted to recreate at beautiful parabola shape that happens when they bomb one down the fairway over 300 yards.\n\nHereâs the end result:\n\nBut how do we get Tableau to draw that parabola?\n\nI turn this next bit over to Tableau Zen Master and fellow InterWorks analytics consultant Robert Rouse to show you how he made Tableau draw that beautiful arc of a golf ball in flight.\n\nVisualizing the Arc\n\nOur first idea was to draw curves based on the physics of golf ball flight. Those discussions turned out to be academic since we lacked necessary data like initial velocity, course conditions, and other variables. Plus, weâre only showing averages so true flight paths are less meaningful.\n\nInstead I approached the problem by thinking of how to draw smooth curves given three data points: apex (distance and height), carry distance, and total distance (carry+roll). The key was to draw three line segments which intersect those points and are tangent to a horizontal line at the apex. This basically describes a BÃ©zier curve â three of them, to be precise.\n\nI first saw this done in Tableau with Chris DeMartiniâs hive plots, and borrowed much of the math from that. We start with the formula for quadratic BÃ©zier curves:\n\nIf you arenât familiar with these curves, the Wikipedia article includes some very helpful illustrations and explanation. The diagram below shows at a high level how BÃ©zier curves help us draw gold ball flight paths:\n\nIâll spare the algebra lesson on how we applied the BÃ©zier formula at each point and instead show the main resulting calculations in Tableau for the X and Y values:\n\nUsing the Arc in Analysis\n\nSo, with Robertâs calculated field magic, weâre able to look at each individual players stats for the 2015 season and see how their average drive looks compared to the field. Notice how #1 ranked golfer Jordan Spieth doesnât have to crush the ball. Heâs actually fairly short off of the tee (Avg 295 yards) compared to ball smashers like Dustin Johnson (Avg 319) and Bubba Watson (Avg 317).\n\nIt just goes to show that just because you can impress people on the driving range with that huge drive, it doesnât mean that youâre going to win in the PGA. Spieth is not only the top earner for the year, but also won the 2015 Masters, U.S. Open and came in 2nd for the Open Championship in the UK.",
  "latent_6698": "During World War II, the Allies famously tricked Hitler into believing that the First United States Army Group would invade France at Pas-de-Calais. The real invasion, of course, came at Normandy, and the First United States Army Group did not take partâmostly because it didnât actually exist.\n\nFake military units arenât the only thing the military is good at inventing. Sometimes it invents entire nations. When the U.S. Army trains for battle, it strives for immersion and realism. To help prepare soldiers for the overwhelming nature of invading a country where the language is unknown and the culture is mostly alien, the U.S. Army invents fully realized countries, from international dynamics to currency. Here are a few fake countries where the United States is prepared to fight.\n\n1. The Peopleâs Republic of Pineland\n\nImage credit: U.S. Army\n\nInvaders from the north beset the country of Pineland, located on the continent of Atlantica. There have been reports of a local strongman named Jose Cuervo, who is known to capture and torture local guerrilla fighters, and there is general discord among the local militias. Wanted terrorist Keith Mohammed is noted to be in the area. Because Pineland has been a stalwart ally of the United Statesâfighting alongside us during World Wars I and II, Korea, and Iraqâa U.S. Army Special Forces âA-Teamâ (ODA-914) has infiltrated the country to organize the guerrilla forces into a formidable army.\n\nAtlantica itself has an interesting history.\n\nItâs a bit over a thousand miles east of North America, and was first discovered by Saladero Indians of Venezuela. Eric the Great settled the land in 1342, and the English, Spanish, and French would arrive during the Age of Discovery. Ultimately, England would conquer the continent and divide it into three distinct territories: North Atlantica, Appalachia, and Pineland. Unlike the America-friendly Pineland, the United Provinces of Atlantica (previously: North Atlantica) would eventually side with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The region would seem to be marked by instability and unrest.\n\nAll of this is part of Robin Sage, the final phase of Special Forces training, where soldiers put their highly specialized training to the test. Those who succeed will earn the right to wear the coveted green beret. Based on reports of the exercise, the exact conditions of the war simulation seem to vary, reflecting actual, ongoing U.S. Army Special Forces missions and the lessons learned from conflicts around the world. And Pineland is serious business. The training area is 4,500 square miles across ten counties. Local communities are integrated into the mission. It has a flag (yellow, gray, and red, with LIBERTY printed at the top, and 1870 on the bottom), a national anthem (âThis is the land of the tall pine tree / where all of us used to live so free...â) and a currency (the don, denoted by orange and yellow bills that resemble Monopoly money, and signed by Seymour Bombs). And yes, there is a real dollar-to-don exchange rate.\n\nNotably, a precursor to Robin Sage was fought not in Pineland, but in Erehwon, with Special Forces pitted against the Erehwonian Army. Erehwon, of course, is ânowhereâ spelled backward.\n\n2. The Island of Aragon\n\nImage credit: GlobalSecurity.org\n\nThe Island of Aragon is roughly six hundred miles east of Atlantica, and is divided into three distinct nations: Peopleâs Democratic Republic of Acadia, the Republic of Cortina, and the Republic of Victoria. Cortina is rich in natural resources and vital to U.S. interests, but is highly unstable due to political corruption, ethnic strife, and right wing insurgencies. The Cortina Liberation Front, a domestic terrorist organization, is supported by the PDRA and has recently stepped up its violence. Their goal is to overthrow the Cortina government. The United States isnât going to let that happen. Joint Task Force Cortina, comprised of conventional land, air, and sea elements, as well as special operations forces, has been sent to the area. Theyâve been ordered to help with the counterinsurgency, provide security, and offer humanitarian aid where itâs needed.\n\nThis simulated invasion is one scenario used during the three-week field training exercise at the U.S. Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana. Where Robin Sageâs Pineland is designed around twelve-man Special Forces teams, JRTC brings together diverse elements from the whole of the U.S. Army, with units ranging from light infantry to Apache helicopters. Thousands of soldiers train at once on the 100,000-acre facility dubbed âthe Box.â Itâs one of the most technologically sophisticated training simulations in the military, employing 900 cameras that record everything, real-world sound effects, carefully employed pyrotechnics, and GPS tracking on pretty much everything.\n\nHundreds of civilians role-play as villagers, acting as mayors and farmers and peddlers at local bazaars. Citizens of the Box broadcast a radio show, print three daily newspapers, and run a nightly news broadcast, all of which reflect the ongoing âwar.â The 509th Infantry Regiment (Airborne) acts as the Opposing Force, or op-for. These soldiers live in the field for weeks at a time, eating and sleeping in their camps and villages. Like indigenous forces the military will encounter in the combat zone, the op-for is extraordinarily familiar with their terrain, and knows exactly how to use it to inflict maximum âharmâ on soldiers in training. Itâs an unfair advantage, but itâs designed to be that way. The goal for soldiers training at JRTC isnât to winâthatâs an almost impossible taskâbut to learn from their mistakes.\n\n3. Attica\n\nImage credit: U.S. Army/The Economist\n\nThe Middle Eastern nation of Attica has seen better days. The radical Islamic Congress of Attica seeks to destabilize the Attican government and install an oppressive theocratic regime. Meanwhile, the Ellisian Army has sent in mechanized elements as precursor to a full invasion. The Islamic Brotherhood for Jihad would like to establish a terrorist base of operations in the region, from which it can launch transnational attacks.\n\nTo deal with this, the U.S. Army has been deployed to work alongside Attican security forces to stop the insurgency, secure Atticaâs porous borders, strengthen its tenuous state, and deny haven to terrorists. Working against the U.S.-Attican alliance is the Wolf Brigade, an eight-man cyber-warfare cell capable of disrupting communications and networked electronics.\n\nThe crisis in Attica is part of the Network Integration Evaluation, a bi-annual exercise at White Sands Missile Range that evaluates military communications hardware in the field. The hostile forces represent al-Qaeda, the Taliban, Hezbollah, and the Iranian special operations Quds force. The training simulation is indicative of the kinds of wars the U.S. Army expects to fight in the futureâhybrid wars, not against single states, but against multiple, loosely affiliated actors with a common enemy in the United States. The Network Integration Evaluation also puts the U.S. Armyâs Warfighter Information Network-Tactical to the test. The WIN-T is a command-and-control system that allows critical information to be sent across the battlefield through such devices as Nett Warrior field-capable smartphones.\n\n4. The Peopleâs Democratic Republic of Krasnovia\n\nImage credit: GlobalSecurity.org\n\nDuring most of the Cold War, the United States may have known no greater threat than the Peopleâs Democratic Republic of Krasnovia. The threat of war was ever-present. The neighboring Republic of Mojave was a staunch U.S. ally, but a bitter enemy of the Kingdom of Parumphiaâa close Krasnovian ally. Tensions were further heightened by the Parumphian Peoplesâ Guerrillas, which wanted Parumphia to re-unify with the Krasnovian Motherland. (The nearby Baja Republic remained neutral.) While years were marked by highs and lows and the occasional bullet fired in anger, tensions were most heightened when uranium was found in the Mojave, prompting Krasnovia and Parumphia to mount a joint invasion. The United States intervened, not only to help a partner in the region, but also because there was little doubt what the Krasnovian-Parumphian alliance would use the uranium for: weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe scenarios for war with Krasnovia (âEveryoneâs enemy!â and an obvious stand-in for the Soviet Union) varied over the years. Bitter wars were fought at Fort Irwin and the National Training Center in California. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Krasnovia fell as well, to be replaced by breakaway republics presenting a new set of threats in Eurasia.\n\n5. Atropia\n\nImage credit: High Desert Warrior\n\nThe Defense Department expects future threats in Eurasia to look a lot like the war in Atticaâhybrid, with conventional forces, criminal forces, terrorist forces, and intelligence services working together to topple governments and repel external threats. Such countries as Donovia, Gorgas, Minaria, Atropia, and Ariana are each in some way either a vital U.S. interest or a belligerent state. History suggests that a military confrontation between any of the countries could easily engulf the entire region in total war.\n\nIf that were to happen, Gorgas and Atropia would call upon its allies in the West for helpâspecifically, the United States. Both countries face threats from Donovia, which has seen a surge in regional influence with the rise in oil prices. Gorgas is still reeling from a 2008 war against Donovia, and Atropiaâs natural resources keep it at perpetual risk. (Its Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline is highly vulnerable to attack.) Meanwhile, Atropia also faces a threat from Minaria, a relatively weak country with ties to the Donovians. Minariaâs grudge against Atropia comes from a border dispute over Artzak province. (Atropia controls it, though its population consists mostly of ethnic Minarians.)\n\nThis simulation is part of âDecisive Actionâ training now being rolled out by the U.S. Army. The variables in this kind of regional conflict war-game can be shifted, and provide units with experience in everything from stability operations to high-intensity conflict operations.",
  "latent_6717": "CLOSE Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis was our guest on the season finale of Beyond the Stripes on Tuesday at HofbrÃ¤uhaus Newport.\n\nCincinnati Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis looks at his playcard during Cincinnati Bengals training camp practice, Friday, July 28, 2017, on the practice fields next to Paul Brown Stadium in Cincinnati. (Photo: Kareem Elgazzar)\n\nCincinnati Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis missed practice on Tuesday due to what the club deemed a âminorâ health issue that the coach is taking care of.\n\nLewis was at Paul Brown Stadium on Tuesday and joked he wouldnât be on the injury report and had planned to attend practice up until it began. He had gotten to the field when Bengals staff told him to head back inside Paul Brown Stadium.\n\n\"I just hope Marvin's health gets back to normal and we can get him back out here quickly,\" quarterback Andy Dalton said.\n\nLewis had been favoring a leg following practice on Monday.\n\nSpecial teams coordinator Darrin Simmons assumed head coaching responsibilities on Tuesday and will remain in that role as long as necessary, though Lewis may be back on the field as soon as Wednesday.\n\n\"Not sure if he has (missed a practice),\" Simmons said. \"Iâve been here a long time. Thatâs a lot of practices. He might have. Might be when he had his ankle surgery. He missed a day. Spent a couple weeks in the press box. He may have missed one day, but heâs a tough guy, heâs a resilient guy. Heâll be back when itâs safe and he can be back. But most importantly he needs to take care of himself right now.\"\n\nAs far as Simmons being the one tabbed to steer the ship, it makes sense\n\nBefore training camp began, Lewis heaped praise on his longtime assistantâs ability to connect with the team.\n\nâA guy that we have that gets overlooked is Darrin Simmons, who does a tremendous job,â Lewis told The Enquirer in late July. âAnd he has to do it with new people year in and year out, and he does a great job of doing that, of blending the older guys and more experienced guys together.â\n\nIt also made sense for Simmons to assume the role from a logistical standpoint.\n\n\"I think that's the obvious thing,\" he said. \"We've got a good guy in place, Brayden (Coombs), if it comes to that, that he can handle it and it will cause the least disruption on offense and defense. Paully (Guenther) can still control the defense, Kenny (Zampese) can still control the offense. Least disruption. No waves.\"\n\nLewis brought Simmons to Cincinnati in 2003 and is in his fifth season as the special teams coordinator. His relationship with Lewis dates back to 1998 when he was hired in Baltimore and Lewis was the Ravensâ defensive coordinator.\n\n\"It's different just because Marvin's always been here,\" Dalton said. \"I thought the way that practice flowed, nobody really blinked and we just kind of went through and did things the way that we do. I think we've got a lot of great coaches on the staff to do that. We've got Darrin filling in right now with some of the stuff that he's got going.

I'm not worried about any of that kind of stuff. It is good that it is the preseason, because if something were to happen -- obviously you don't want it to happen -- you kind of get prepared for if something were to happen.\"\n\nThe team is off and closed to the media on Thursday, like most days before a game.\n\nMore: Marvin Lewisâ long-term game plan for football and life",
  "latent_6736": "Bernie Sanders's surprising success in the presidential primary may make it easy to think a huge number of Democrats are itching to throw their party's leaders out of office and replace them with insurgent outsiders.\n\nBut in the party's state and congressional primaries, incumbents and establishment frontrunners just keep winning.\n\nAs I've written, Sanders's success has inspired dozens of outsider, long-shot candidates to run primaries that mirror the Vermont senator's distinctive vision for the Democratic Party. And while Sanders has generally stayed out of these races, the candidates have closely identified themselves with him, hoping his popularity could vault them into Congress.\n\nBut these candidates got little good news in Tuesday's primaries â in California, New Jersey, and Iowa, enthusiastic Sanders fans in various races lost big.\n\nNow, we shouldn't exaggerate the significance of these defeats. After all, these candidates were little-known, little-funded, and always massive underdogs. And the Sanders movement itself remains focused on the presidential race for the time being.\n\nYet the results do underscore just how hard it will be for Sanders allies hoping to reshape the legislative branch, like the Brand New Congress PAC, to actually succeed. When it comes to their own local officials, rank-and-file Democrats don't seem eager to launch a \"political revolution\" â at least not yet.\n\nWhat looks like a bad night for the promise of a \"Bernie Congress\"\n\nFiguring out exactly who is running under the Sanders banner is a bit of an inexact science â many politicians, of course, embrace some parts of Sanders's message but not others.\n\nMoreover, many of the campaigns that tried to tie themselves to Sanders were launched by long-shot challengers who faced low name recognition and little access to campaign cash.\n\nNone of the races last night were ones where Sanders himself had an active role in endorsing a candidate, and the Brand New Congress is itself a new organization still trying to get off the ground. We'll get a better sense of Sanders's down-ballot reach in more high-profile races later this year â in Tim Canova's primary bid against Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz in southern Florida, for instance.\n\nStill, the results from last night hinted that it will take more than calling for a \"political revolution\" to replicate Sanders's movement in local elections across the country. Here's a rundown of several congressional candidates who tried tying themselves to Sanders:\n\nAlex Law, a 25-year-old trying to unseat Rep. Donald Norcross in New Jersey's First Congressional District , endorsed Sanders and ran a campaign that mimicked his message, according to Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute and a New Jersey political expert. But Norcross crushed Law on Tuesday night, winning more than 70 percent of the vote in the district, according to NJ.com. The race was never close, according to Murray.\n\n, endorsed Sanders and ran a campaign that mimicked his message, according to Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute and a New Jersey political expert. But Norcross crushed Law on Tuesday night, winning more than 70 percent of the vote in the district, according to NJ.com. The race was never close, according to Murray. Two women who endorsed Clinton, California Attorney General Kamala D. Harris and Rep. Loretta Sanchez, finished first and second in California's US S enate primary . (Because of the state's unusual primary rules, the two Democrats will now square off against each other as the sole candidates in the general election.) Meanwhile, \"Berniecrat\" Steve Stokes, the only candidate in the race to endorse Sanders, finished with less than 1 percent of the vote.\n\n. (Because of the state's unusual primary rules, the two Democrats will now square off against each other as the sole candidates in the general election.) Meanwhile, \"Berniecrat\" Steve Stokes, the only candidate in the race to endorse Sanders, finished with less than 1 percent of the vote. In Iowa's Democratic primary for US Senate , attorney Tom Fiegen embraced Sanders as tightly as possible. \"Fiegen wants to be Iowa's Bernie Sanders,\" wrote the Des Moines Register. \"His embrace of Sandersâ presidential campaign and message has been near-total.\" Yet Fiegen was steamrolled by former Iowa Lt.

Loretta Sanchez in California's 46th Congressional District . Nguyen was the only candidate in the race to endorse Sanders, and strongly criticized establishment politics throughout the race, according to the OC Register. But local politics mainstay and former state Sen. Lou Correa cruised to an easy victory.\n\n. Nguyen was the only candidate in the race to endorse Sanders, and strongly criticized establishment politics throughout the race, according to the OC Register. But local politics mainstay and former state Sen. Lou Correa cruised to an easy victory. Insurgents tying themselves to Sanders also failed to break through in California's 20th District and in California's 24th District. In the 20th, local prosecutor Jimmy Panetta â who was endorsed by Hillary Clinton at a rally in May â easily fended off the candidacies of Jack Digby and Joe Williams, who both tried to hitch their wagon to Sanders, according to the Monterey County Weekly. Similarly, in the 24th, Clinton backer and Santa Barbara County Supervisor Salud Carbajal beat back a challenge from Bill Ostrander, who touted his support for Sanders. Ostrander finished with around 6 percent of the vote.\n\nWhat this suggests about Sanders's down-ballot movement\n\nFrom a purely theoretical perspective, the idea of a Bernie Congress makes sense: Sanders ran up some massive margins over Hillary Clinton in congressional districts across the country â often in districts whose representatives endorsed Clinton.\n\nGiven that fact, couldn't some substantial number of democratic socialists get elected to Congress on his basic platform â or at least create a sort of \"Tea Party of the left\" that could give some incumbents serious scares?\n\nThe problem with this seemingly simple equation, according to political scientists, is that rank-and-file Democrats just don't appear to be that upset about their party's top officials â especially at the local level.\n\n\"If we see that start to change, maybe you see some movement designed to push the party to the left,\" said Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. \"But right now Democrats are generally more supportive of their party's leadership than Republicans are.\"\n\nOf course, Sanders has only been part of the national political consciousness for about a year, and many of Sanders's down-ballot allies are brand new to politics. But if last night's results showed anything, it's that it's going to take much more than embracing Sanders's message to transform Congress.",

Abrams knew exactly how fans would respond to Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Or, at least, a certain section of Star Wars fandom.\n\n\"I knew that, whatever we did, there would be a group of people â and I was just hoping and praying that it would be smaller than not â that would take issue with any number of things,\" Abrams says in the latest episode of THR's Awards Chatter podcast, admitting that everything about the project initially scared him. \"But I knew we weren't making the movie for any other reason than we believed that it could be something meaningful and special and entertaining and worthy of people's time.\"\n\nAnd sure enough, he has a response to complaints that The Force Awakens leans too heavily on homages from the original trilogy. \"I can understand that someone might say, 'Oh, it's a complete rip-off!' \" he says, adding, \"What was important for me was introducing brand new characters using relationships that were embracing the history that we know to tell a story that is new â to go backwards to go forwards.\"\n\nAs to what lies ahead for the Star Wars series, Abrams reveals that he did have the opportunity to stay on the series for future installments, but demurred. \"I realized when I was working on [The Force Awakens], the amount of energy that was required to tell the story, and do it justice, knowing when Episode VIII would start shooting, there was no way â if I wanted to still have my children talk to me in my old age â that doing that would make any sense,\" he says. \"If The Force Awakens worked, it was the perfect place to say, 'I got to make a Star Wars movie,' and not be a greedy bastard. If it didn't work, no-one would want me doing it anyway.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean that he doesn't have any idea what's coming for Luke, Rey and the rest of the team. \"Larry [Kasdan] and I had a bunch of thoughts of where certain things could go and we shared those things with Rian Johnson, who's directing VIII,\" he says. \"He had things that he came up with where he asked if it was possible if we could make some adjustments with what we were doing at the end, most of which we did â there were just a couple that didn't feel right, so he made adjustments â but it was just collaboration.\"\n\nAbrams' also discusses in the podcast his concerns about accepting the Star Wars job in the first place, the influence of the Harry Potter movies on Force Awakens casting, the differences between Star Trek and Star Wars and where Abrams' loyalties lie as a fan.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nATHENS (Reuters) - The next managing director of the International Monetary Fund is likely to come from outside Europe when current leader Christine Lagarde eventually leaves, the deputy head of the Washington-based fund said in an interview broadcast on Saturday.\n\nIMF First Deputy Managing Director David Lipton told the BBC World Service the tradition by which a European heads the fund while an American leads the World Bank was coming under pressure and the next appointment would be âstrictly merit-basedâ.\n\nDescribed on the same radio programme as an âincredible anachronismâ by former IMF Chief Economist Kenneth Rogoff, the convention that has ensured that Europeans lead the fund has been increasingly challenged during the euro zone crisis.\n\nLipton said that when Lagarde steps down, her successor would probably come from a non-European country.\n\nâWith candidates coming forward from around the world, I think itâs much more likely the next time around than it has ever been,â he said.\n\nâThere are more and more eminently qualified people from outside Europe and the United States and I think the fact that thereâs been so much focus on crisis in the United States right at the early stages of the global financial crisis and with Europe, is going to lead to a sense that there has to be a broader pool for the leadership role,â Lipton said.\n\nLagarde, a former French finance minister, took over as head of the IMF in 2011 after her predecessor, Dominique Strauss-Kahn was forced to resign over a sex scandal.\n\nHer five-year term comes to an end next year but she was quoted last month as saying she would consider a second term if she had the support of the IMFâs members.\n\nAlthough there is no formal requirement that the leader of the IMF come from Europe, it has been the practice ever since the institution was set up after World War Two, while the World Bank has always been led by an American.",
  "latent_7014": "Doughty, 26, has been one of the best defensemen in the NHL for a number of seasons, and won the Norris Trophy for the first time in 2016. He didn't win the Conn Smythe Trophy in either of the Kings' Stanley Cup championship runs, but he would have been a worthy recipient either time. He has won Olympic gold medals twice, and was a critical part of Canada's success in both tournaments. He had 51 points last season (14 goals, 37 assists), the second-highest of his NHL career (59 points in 2009-10), and he's one of three defensemen to average more than 27 minutes per game of ice time during the past three seasons. Ryan Suter of the Minnesota Wild and Erik Karlsson of the Ottawa Senators are the others.\n\nWhether it's breaking up a big play, setting up a goal or scoring on the power play, some defensemen can do it all. It's time to take a look at the League's \"Top 20 Defensemen Right Now\" as chosen by a panel of NHL Network experts:\n\nVideo: Drew Doughty of the Kings is named top defenseman\n\n2. Erik Karlsson, Ottawa Senators\n\nKarlsson, 26, is one of the game's best offensive players at the position. He has won the Norris Trophy twice, and had an NHL career-high 82 points last season, including a League-best 66 assists. He became the first defenseman in 20 years to have as many points in a season (Brian Leetch of the New York Rangers had 85 points and Ray Bourque of the Boston Bruins had 82, in 1995-96), and his 222 points the past three seasons are 39 more points than any defenseman. If Karlsson wins the Norris again, he'll be one of nine in NHL history to do so at least three times.\n\n3. Brent Burns, San Jose Sharks\n\nBurns, 31, has been back on defense for the past two seasons and is making the case to stay there permanently. His playful personality has boosted his profile, but his play cemented his stardom. Burns had NHL career highs with 27 goals and 75 points last season, and had 24 points (seven goals, 17 assists) to help the Sharks reach the Stanley Cup Final. He has 598 shots on goal the past two seasons, 58 more than the next defenseman (Erik Karlsson, 540).\n\nVideo: Top 20 Defensemen: Burns, Karlsson\n\n4. Duncan Keith, Chicago Blackhawks\n\nKeith, 33, is the only active player other than Karlsson to have won the Norris Trophy twice. Keith's time on ice is monitored during the regular season, but he often plays an incredible amount during the postseason. He won the Conn Smythe Trophy in 2015 after he had 21 points (three goals, 18 assists) in 23 games while averaging 31:06 of ice time during the Stanley Cup Playoffs. That's the second-most by any player who reached the Stanley Cup Final since 1998, just shy of Nicklas Lidstrom's 31:10 in 2002 with the Detroit Red Wings.\n\n5. Victor Hedman, Tampa Bay Lightning\n\nThe No. 2 pick of the 2009 NHL Draft, Hedman, 25, was rewarded with an eight-year, $63 million contract extension July 1. He has size (6-foot-6, 223 pounds) and is one of the best passers in the League at the position, especially on long-distance outlets to help ignite the Lightning offense. He might be the best bet to be the next first-time Norris Trophy winner now that Doughty has won it.\n\n6. Kris Letang, Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nLetang, 29, is second among defensemen in points per game in the past three seasons (0.81) behind Karlsson (0.90), but has had trouble staying healthy. That wasn't a problem during the 2016 playoffs, and he was a critical component of the Penguins' second championship in eight years. He had three goals and 12 assists in 23 games, averaged 28:52 of ice time per game and was a contender for the Conn Smythe Trophy.\n\n7. Roman Josi, Nashville Predators\n\nJosi, 26, might not be the most noted defenseman in Nashville, but quietly has become one of the best in the League. Josi is highly skilled and played on the Predators' top pair with Shea Weber. Going from Weber to P.K. Subban, acquired in a trade with the Montreal Canadiens on June 29, as a partner could be a big change, though there's no reason to believe a Josi-Subban top pairing wouldn't be successful. Josi is fourth in scoring in the NHL among defensemen during the past three seasons with 156 points, right behind Subban, who had 164.\n\n8. P.K. Subban, Nashville Predators\n\nSubban, 27, likely will pair with Josi with the Predators. Subban had 51 points (six goals, 45 assists) in 68 games last season, the third-highest total in his NHL career; he had reached double-digits in goals the previous three seasons. He ranked third in points among League defenseman the past three seasons with 164, behind Karlsson (222) and Burns (183). Subban already has endeared himself to his new fan base, and gold No. 76 jerseys should be popular purchases in Nashville this season.\n\nVideo: Top 20 Defensemen: Weber, Subban\n\n9. Shea Weber, Montreal Canadiens\n\nWeber, 30, is a big, strong defenseman with a powerful shot and likely will have a big impact on the Canadiens' power play. He's fourth in the League in average time on ice among defensemen during the past three seasons, at 26:13 per game. During that span he led players at the position with 31 power-play goals and was third in total goals with 58. Weber will be in new surroundings this season following his trade to the Canadiens by the Predators for Subban, but is expected to be just as big a contributor for the Canadiens as he was during his 11 seasons with the Predators.\n\n10. Oliver Ekman-Larsson, Arizona Coyotes\n\nEkman-Larsson, 25, has scored more than 20 goals each of the past two seasons. Only 18 defensemen have scored at least 20 goals in a season in the past 20 years, and Ekman-Larsson joined fellow Swede Karlsson as the only ones to do it in back-to-back seasons. Ekman-Larsson, along with Hedman, are big reasons why Team Sweden will be one of the favorites to medal at the World Cup of Hockey 2016 in September. Ekman-Larsson has never finished higher than seventh in voting for the Norris Trophy, but that could change in the near future.\n\n11. Ryan Suter, Minnesota Wild\n\nSuter, 31, tied his NHL career high with eight goals last season, and set NHL career highs with 43 assists and 51 points. He has had at least 38 points in each of the past seven 82-game NHL seasons and has been one of the better defensemen on the power play, with 163 points (21 goals, 142 assists) in his career. Suter has played every game in a season six times in his 11 NHL seasons. In 2013 he was a Norris Trophy finalist and an NHL First Team All-Star.\n\n12. Dustin Byfuglien, Winnipeg Jets\n\nByfuglien, 31, has been one of the fiercest defensemen in the League, with 222 hits last season and at least 200 each of the past three seasons. He also has 796 penalty minutes in 678 regular-season games, but that hasn't hampered his offensive ability. Byfuglien has had double-digit goal totals in eight straight 82-game seasons, and has had at least 53 points four times. In 11 NHL seasons he has 150 power-play points and 33 game-winning goals. He won the Stanley Cup with the Blackhawks in 2010 and was voted to the NHL All-Star Game in 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2016.\n\n13. Brent Seabrook, Chicago Blackhawks\n\nSeabrook, 31, is known for being a shutdown defender, but last season had NHL career highs with 14 goals and 49 points. He also had six power-play goals and 25 power-play points, which ranked second on the Blackhawks behind Patrick Kane (37 power-play points). Seabrook is as durable as they come, missing 11 games during the past 10 seasons. Seabrook, a three-time Stanley Cup Champion (2010, 2013, 2015) who played in the 2015 NHL All-Star Game, has 367 points (85 goals, 282 assists) in 844 regular-season games and 59 points (20 goals, 39 assists) in 119 playoff games.\n\nVideo: Top 20 Defensemen: Ekblad, Klingberg, Seabrook\n\n14. John Klingberg, Dallas Stars\n\nKlingberg, 23, was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team in 2014-15, when he had 40 points (11 goals, 29 assists), including 12 points on the power play, in 65 games. Last season he had 58 points (10 goals, 48 assists), a plus-22 rating, and four game-winning goals, including three in overtime. He led Stars defensemen with 22 power-play points last season, tied for 11th in the League among defensemen.\n\n15. Aaron Ekblad, Florida Panthers\n\nThe No. 1 pick of the 2014 NHL Draft, Ekblad, 20, has been one of the best defenseman in the League for the past two seasons. He won the Calder Trophy in 2014-15 and made the NHL All-Rookie Team, and played in the NHL All-Star Game in 2015 and 2016. Ekblad had 39 points (12 goals, 27 assists), including 13 power-play points, and was a plus-12 in 81 games in 2014-15. Last season he had 36 points (15 goals, 21 assists), was a plus-18 and helped the Panthers win their first division title and qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 2012.\n\n16. Alex Pietrangelo, St. Louis Blues\n\nPietrangelo, 26, had seven goals and 30 assists last season, and has at least 37 points in each of the past five 82-game NHL seasons. He has had at least 30 assists each of the past three seasons, and is a plus-53 in 459 career games. Pietrangelo has led Blues defensemen in scoring in five of the past six seasons, and was named to the NHL Second All-Star Team in 2012 and 2014; he had 51 points in each season.\n\n17. Ryan McDonagh, New York Rangers\n\nThe 27-year-old Rangers captain had 34 points (nine goals, 25 assists) last season with an NHL career-high 8.0 shooting percentage, and is two seasons removed from having 43 points (14 goals, 29 assists). McDonagh was a plus-26 last season, tied for ninth in the League, and the third time in five seasons he was a plus-23 or better. He was named the Rangers team MVP in 2013-14.\n\n18. Shayne Gostisbehere, Philadelphia Flyers\n\nGostisbehere, 23, had a huge impact on the Flyers after being recalled from Lehigh Valley of the American Hockey League on Nov. 14. The Calder Trophy finalist finished fifth among rookies in points (46), second in power-play points (22) and tied for second in game-winning goals (five), and was tied for second among all players with four overtime goals. He also set a League record for rookie defensemen with a point in 15 straight games. Gostisbehere finished fifth on the Flyers in scoring despite playing 64 games, and was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team.\n\nVideo: Top 20 Defensemen: Vlasic, Carlson, Gostisbehere\n\n19. John Carlson, Washington Capitals\n\nCarlson, 26, had 39 points (eight goals, 31 assists) last season, despite missing 56 games because of injury. Prior to last season he had not missed a game during the previous five seasons. He had NHL career highs in goals (12), assists (43) and points (55) in 2014-15. He tied Alex Ovechkin for the Capitals lead in playoff scoring last season with 12 points (five goals, seven assists) in 12 games, and in 454 NHL regular-season games has 228 points (53 goals, 175 assists) and is a plus-52.\n\n20. Marc-Edouard Vlasic, San Jose Sharks\n\nVlasic, 29, helped the Sharks reach the Stanley Cup Final with a plus-14 rating in the playoffs to go along with one goal and 11 assists in 24 games. That followed a regular season when Vlasic scored an NHL career high 39 points (eight goals, 31 assists) in 67 games. Vlasic has 47 goals and 179 assists with a plus-125 rating in 737 NHL games. The No. 35 pick in the 2005 NHL Draft has finished with a minus rating once in his 10 seasons, all with the Sharks.\n\nVideo: Top 20 Defensemen: Who Missed the Cut?",

  "latent_7104": "HOUGHTON, MI - Michigan Tech has defended its expulsion of a student accused of an internet threat to shoot blacks. The university said it acted appropriately given violent episodes at campuses around the country. Michigan Technological University has asked that a federal lawsuit filed by the now former student, Matthew Schultz, be dismissed. Schultz, a third-year student majoring in mechanical engineering, contends that Michigan Tech ignored the fact that his post had been altered, and said the university misled the public, media and a county prosecutor. The case originates from a Nov. 12, 2015, post that Schultz wrote on Yik Yak, a social-media app, as part of a discussion about racial threats at the University of Missouri and racial issues at Michigan Tech.\n\n'Poster boy for white hatred:' Michigan Tech misled students about racial threats, suit says Matthew Schultz, a third-year student, says he was expelled after administrators blamed him for a racist post that had been altered by someone else.\n\nHe wrote: \"Gonna shoot all black people......A smile tomorrow,\" followed by a smiley face. He removed the post minutes later but someone grabbed a screen shot and shared it with Michigan Tech. After no immediate response from the university, a shortened version of the screen shot, showing only, \"Gonna shoot all black people,\" was sent to school officials. The school considered both versions to be threats. \"Given the horrific instances of gun violence that have occurred on university campuses across the country in recent years, the intense reaction that (Schultz's) post provoked is not surprising,\" the school's attorney, Michael Cavanaugh, wrote in his motion to have the lawsuit dismissed. \"Indeed, reasonable recipients of the post viewed Plaintiff's message as making two distinct statements: 'Gonna shoot all black people' and that the anonymous poster would have \"A smile tomorrow' (perhaps after shooting black people today),\" Cavanaugh wrote. Within an hour of the original post, the university's Department of Public Safety and Police Services had issued a campus-wide alert. Police arrested Schultz hours later, but charges were dropped. Schultz was kicked out of school, however. \"He said he intended for his post to convey, in a humorous way, that he was not a racist, but that others deliberately altered the post by focusing only on the words, 'Gonna shoot all black people,'\" Cavanaugh wrote.\n\nMichigan Tech student charged for alleged Yik Yak threat against black students The student is temporarily suspended and banned from campus.\n\n\"In the end, however, it was determined that Plaintiff was responsible for the disruption that his own post caused because the post, as written, could reasonably be interpreted as conveying a threat.\" The university said Schultz's internet post was a threat, not protected speech under the First Amendment. A hearing is set for Feb. 2 in U.S. District Court in Marquette. Schultz says the school made him the \"poster boy for white hatred\" to show how seriously it took racial issues. His attorneys, Steven Pence and Nicholas Roumel, argued against dismissal of the lawsuit. They say former student Ryan Grainger provided school officials with both the original post and the altered post. Grainger, in response to the lawsuit, said he received the posts from a close friend and said any reasonable person would have reported the information. Schultz's attorneys say he was punished by Michigan Tech \"not for his own words but as they were maliciously altered by another, so as to entirely change their meaning.\" They say that only the \"altered, sinister words\" were released by the university until months later, when the university, acting on a Freedom of Information request, had to admit there were two separate posts. Police reports were also \"significantly\" altered, the attorneys said. \"In an effort to control the damage this revelation would do to its carefully crafted public image, MTU quickly claimed to the media that these two posts were equally menacing,\" Pence and Roumel wrote. The school held Schultz responsible for chaos outside of his own doing, they said. \"... MTU blamed Plaintiff for a social media post that was significantly altered by Defendant Ryan Grainger - but when they realized their mistake, MTU nonetheless misled the Michigan Tech community, the media, and even the county prosecutor for their own political purposes.\" A university hearing panel placed Schultz on probation after exonerating him of the most serious charges but they were re-instated - and Schultz was expelled - after he appealed, his attorney said. \"This case tells a troubling tale that even after MTU realized Plaintiff's social media post was significantly altered, they refused to back down, and perpetuated false public information for their own purposes.\" The attorneys, who referenced Watergate in their pleadings, said the case \"calls into mind the political saw, 'It's not the crime, it's the cover-up.'\" They said that Michigan Tech officials took immediate action in response to the altered post, and did not realize until two hours later that it had been altered. Yik Yak Legal, responding to an emergency request to identify the source of the post, told school officials that the post had been cropped and did not provide the information. Schultz contends the university should have concluded there was no threat. Then, the altered threat got on TV news. \"Thus MTU was faced with either a public 'Whoops, never mind,' or pressing on and perpetuating a false threat. They chose the latter course of action, much to Matthew Schultz's great detriment,\" his attorney said. Police got a search warrant for the Yik Yak account. Schultz was arrested that night on felony charges. By morning, the charge was reduced to a misdemeanor, and ultimately dismissed. Robert Bishop, director of academic and community conduct, told Schultz he was suspended pending a hearing despite the legal outcome. Bishop said that Schultz's original \"post clearly can be taken to mean a lot of different things subject to other people's interpretations.\" Schultz was suspended 18 months and given conditions to comply with. When he appealed, he realized he could face additional sanctions, up to expulsion, the school said. Dean of students Bonnie Gorman said the university would have responded to either post similarly. \"In addition, had you not made the initial post, it is unlikely that the (cropped post) would have appeared. Ultimately, your actions have hurt the integrity of the University and caused significant concerns from other students, parents, prospective students, faculty and staff.\" The university's attorney said that Schultz has presented so many \"unbelievable conspiracy\" theories it is difficult to respond to all of them. \"Undeterred, Plaintiff delves even deeper into wild and unsubstantiated conspiracy theories by suggesting that (Michigan Tech public safety) is engaged in some type of 'Watergate' cover-up,\" Cavanaugh wrote.",

  "latent_7296": "The Walking Dead â Across the Pond\n\nChapter 1 â Waking Up\n\nThe pain behind his eyes was beating in rhythm with his heart as he unstuck his tongue from the roof of his mouth, with the taste of whiskey still strong on his palette. Alex Pond was lying on his bed in his one bedroom flat on the third floor of an apartment building in London after another night of drinking himself to sleep. He was still a little dazed as he slowly began to regain function of his senses. The pain was relentless as he struggled to open his eyes.\n\nHe had spent a couple of years wasting away like this, slowly distancing himself from a society that he saw as broken. It wasn't that he didn't like people; it was that he found he had less and less in common with them as years went by. His thoughts drifted back to when he lived at home with his parents in Manchester. He hadn't had a lavish upbringing but it was a good one as far as he was concerned, but after leaving to study economics in London he felt he had lost everything and so began to drink his days away in his one bedroom flat.\n\nHis thoughts were broken by a loud scream piercing through his half open window and his ears. The sound caused Alex to cringe as the pain pulsed once again from behind his eyes. He rolled onto his side and was dazzled by the sight of 9 o'clock morning sun. Another scream came through followed by the sound of smashing glass. It was the sound of a woman. He was used to the loud bustle of London but it sounded more panicked than anything else. His brain turned over as fast as it could to process what was happening but came up with nothing. The sound of another shout and bang filled the small flat, something was happening down on the street.\n\nAlex lifted himself to his feet in a lacklustre way as the pain caused the room to blur a little. He took hold of his bed post to steady himself. The sound from outside was becoming clearer, it wasn't just one woman but the sound of many in a state of panic. He stumbled, bare footed, to the window and drew back to thin curtains. What he saw almost caused him to fall back in disbelief. Broken glass from windows and cars was scattered around the entire street as groups of people were running from buildings. \"Was this a riot?\" he thought to himself as he reached for his glasses on the bedside table. As his vision came more into focus he saw the devastation that lay before him. As far as he could see the city was in anarchy but it soon became clear that this was no riot. A man ran down the street underneath Alex's window, his right arm covered in blood. He slowed to catch his breath as, what looked like; three men came from around a car, pushed him to the ground and began toâ¦ eat him. Alex stumbled backwards with his hand to his mouth. He frantically tried to understand what he just saw. It was too much; he threw up in the corner of his room whilst steadying himself against the wall.\n\nCollecting himself, he knew he had to leave the apartment and find out what was happening. Flicking on the TV Alex began to throw on some clothes he had on his floor from the previous day. He slowed as he pulled his t-shirt over his head. The TV was blank. The channels cycled through as he thumbed the button on the remote but they were all the same, a message saying they will return soon.\n\n\"What the hell is going on?\"\n\nThrowing on his jacket Alex swung open the front door and began to descend the stairs hurriedly, the image of the man being eaten alive spinning around in his mind. His heart was racing by the time he got to the ground floor. Taking a second to catch his breath the realisation of the silence of the usually busy apartment building sunk inâ¦ Something was seriously wrong.\n\nThrough the silence the sound of the main entrance door creaking open almost screamed through the halls. Five creatures stumbled through the door, blood dripping from their mouths and hands, their eyes whited over, about ten meters from where Alex was standing. They lunged forward making a gargling, moaning sort of noise. Alex fell backwards into the door to the maintenance room as he panicked from the sight that was set before him. Quickly trying to react he spun around and threw himself into the cupboard, locking it shut with a metal mop handle. The creatures banged and screeched against the door as Alex stood, bewildered in the darkened maintenance closet. London, it appeared, was in decay.",
  "latent_7310": "Click here to view the complete list of archived articles\n\nThis article was originally published in the Winter 2010 issue of Methods & Tools\n\nTesting Dojos\n\nMarkus Gaertner, it-agile GmbH, www.it-agile.de, www.testingdojo.org\n\nProgrammers use Coding Dojos[1] to exercise their programming skills in a group setup. Deliberately they get together to pair program and get feedback from peers. But how do testers train their skills? Testing Dojos provide a similar setup as Coding Dojos, but help testers to practice their individual skills in a group.\n\nWhat is a Testing Dojo?\n\nA Testing Dojo is a meeting where testers come together to work on a testing challenge. The challenge can consist of testing a product, generating test ideas for a particular software or even exercising bug reporting. The challenges will use mainly Exploratory Testing, but learning a new test automation tool is also a very nice mission.\n\nA group of testers may decide to get together on a Lunch & Learn meeting each Friday and test an application from the Internet. The team members take turns facilitating the session and coming up with a mission and a product. The facilitator is responsible for the session. She can pick an application from the company or one that she uses regularly during her free time. It could even be one that she came across on the Internet. A mission provides the goal for the testing activities. Setting up a mission for a particular application might be a bit more difficult. That's why we will examine testing missions separately later.\n\nTesting Dojos take testing to a safe environment without schedule pressures and deadlines. Testing Dojos are a way to train testers new to the profession or the company in a collaborative manner.\n\nEquipment\n\nFor a Testing Dojo you should have some things in place:\n\na meeting room large enough for the group\n\naccess to a computer\n\na video projector so everyone can see what's happening\n\npen and paper, a flipchart or a whiteboard to take notes\n\nA meeting room with a computer and a projector are available in most companies. If the meeting room lacks a flipchart or a whiteboard, it is easy to get pen and paper for note taking. You will get more benefits if the notes from the session are clearly visible to everyone in the room, especially for a mission to learn about note taking. You can look at tools like Session Tester[2] or Rapid Reporter[3] to take session notes directly on screen.\n\nRoles\n\nDuring a Testing Dojo, each person in the room always fills one role. There is of course the role of the tester who has the power over the keyboard and who interacts with the software. Then there is the recorder's role, which takes session notes and makes sure to get reproducible steps noted down. The observer watches the performance. He thinks about suggestions for improvements and gives observations about communication in a paired setup. Finally, the facilitator makes sure that the rules of the dojo are followed.\n\nTester\n\nAs the tester has the control over the keyboard, he interacts with the program. It's crucial for the tester to expose his testing ideas about what to try or not to try and describe his mental model to the audience.\n\nRecorder\n\nThe recorder takes session notes about the activities. In a single tester setup the tester is simultaneously the recorder and he has to take care about his own session notes. In a paired setup there is a dedicated person for this.\n\nObservers\n\nIn a Testing Dojo there are one or more observers, depending on the size of the group. The observers take notes about the process. These notes include the interactions between tester and recorder in a paired setup or spoken thoughts and test activities in a single setup. Observers should monitor the testing activities and the interactions between the pair, rather than watch the screen. Additionally, observers should try to keep track of one or two points, rather than trying to observe everything. If you are neither testing nor recording, you are not taking a break. As an observer you must keep engaged in order to follow what happens.\n\nSpecific things to observe might be test heuristics[4], test framing[5], oracles, coverage ideas, management of focus, conversation, monologues, pauses in talk, pauses in testing, eye contact. The facilitator might want to hand out some common oracles [6] or mnemonics[7,8] for the participants.\n\nFacilitator\n\nThe facilitator picks the mission for the dojo. She enforces the rules like switching timeframes. At the end she moderates the feedback activity. The facilitator could also take on the role of the tester, recorder or observer, but her main responsibility is to facilitate the dojo. A junior tester can take on the role of the facilitator in order to learn the skills needed to lead a group or meeting.\n\nMechanics\n\nA Testing Dojo starts with the facilitator introducing the rules. The facilitator provides a mission and clarifies the structure of the dojo. If you run a Testing Dojo for the first time, you could consider providing a first focused test that gets the group going, rather than leaving it too broad.\n\nThe session facilitator should change so that everyone gets the opportunity to lead a small group of people.\n\nAny testing can be done by a single tester in front of the computer or in a paired setup.\n\nThe missions vary between testing a product, evaluating the usage of the following tools or using a new approach to check if we could incorporate it into our testing process.\n\nWhen the team has run many Testing Dojos, the introduction tends to get shorter since the facilitator has to explain less of the standard dynamics.\n\nSingle tester\n\nIn a single tester session, the person with access to the keyboard takes on the role of the tester and the others fulfill the role of observers. On a previously agreed upon time the tester is replaced by another participant from the audience. Five minutes seem to be just enough for this, but you can try different timings based on the size and skills of your group. The new tester continues to follow the mission tackling the product under test. When the individual tester gets stuck, he can ask for support from the observers. Otherwise observers have to remain silent while watching the performance.\n\nFor instance the facilitator has picked the latest application from the company and decided to explore it. A tester unfamiliar with the software is asked to begin for five minutes. Right after starting the application, she faces a problem because she does not know what it does. After a few hints from the observers about the documentation, she continues to explore the software, but does not quite understand it. After the five minutes have expired, a tester more familiar with the application starts, coming from the group of observers. He shows some of the features and explores areas of the product. He provides the first tester with some new insights about the application, as well as the approaches used to test it. A third tester then takes charge and explores the product from a completely new perspective.\n\nThe tester must explain every step of her thoughts for the observers to follow the individual actions. As a rule of thumb, the more the tester speaks, the better it is for novice testers in the audience. More experienced testers need less explanations of a particular motivation or applied heuristic.\n\nPaired session\n\nIn a paired session, two participants sit in front of the computer. The tester is working on the keyboard, while the recorder writes down the test ideas and discovered bugs. After a previously agreed timeframe, between five and ten minutes, the tester goes back to the group of observers. The recorder takes over the role of the tester and one of the observers becomes the new recorder.\n\nDuring a paired session the tester and the recorder in front of the computer need to clarify their steps so that everyone from the observers understands what they're doing, and more importantly why they are doing it. They should at least talk as much as they test and probably talk more than test. The pair is allowed to involve other participants only when it gets stuck just as in the single tester setting.\n\nThe paired setup is similar to a Randori Kata in a Coding Dojo. The people in front of the keyboard need to make their steps clear to the audience. Over the course of the time-box, they explain the model they got from testing the application. This knowledge is then transferred when the pairing partners switch. Since all observers watched and listened to the particular steps performed, the next partners will have similar knowledge about the product. Over the course of the session, each participant takes notes and tests.\n\nPairs switching can be decided using a round robin style or by picking the next volunteer for a larger group. In round robin switching, each participant should get into the role of the tester and the recorder at least once. The size of the group will influence how much time you schedule for the session. If you have one or two testers who feel uncomfortable to expose their testing steps to others, you can make testing and recording optional.\n\nTo make the activity more fun, you can include a ceremony activity for pair switching like a handshake when the tester leaves or a Karate-style bow when a new recorder joins. You can also bring in special things if the team found a bug, like a high five.\n\nSuppose that John and Susi are the first pair. John decides to pick up the keyboard and Susi begins with recording notes. They take the application and discuss which areas to focus on. The session facilitator starts a timer for five minutes, informing the pair when they have two and one minutes left. After getting a brief charter up, John and Susi start to test the application with the first item on their list. They make pretty good progress. The time also passes very quickly. John goes back to the observers after the facilitator announced that the time is up. Susi now takes the keys and Paul joins her. Paul raises a question about one area that he just saw while John and Susi were performing. Susi gets back to this area and Paul asks some questions that eventually result in Susi doing some follow-up testing.\n\nMissions\n\nThis section takes a brief look into possible missions for a Testing Dojo. Testing missions provide the goal for any testing activity. Testing missions can vary between \"Test this\", the evaluation of tools or learning new approaches.\n\nTest this\n\nThe classic mission involves testing an application. The variety of applications includes open source programs, commercial software available in your organization or even your companyâs latest product. Such a session can end up as a bugfest. The facilitator needs to check if the mission is doable before the session starts. The companyâs firewall may block some content on a web page or it might be cumbersome to test a web page with unstable network connections.\n\nThis type of missions has many different forms. The facilitator can focus the session on a particular aspect of the application like usability problems. The audience could get to know how to learn and model a new product without thorough documentation.\n\nYou could also pick test automation, though this needs more planning and preparation from the facilitator's point of view. The facilitator should provide some initial examples of automated tests and then ask the participants to extend them. Usually during a short period of a single hour or two, automating test cases for a new application seems to be not as productive as an exploration session conducted with mostly manual tests.\n\nEvaluate tools\n\nA mission to evaluate a tool could use mindmaps for test ideas or try out a particular test tool for the whole session. In such a mission, the product under test is usually the tool itself, but you can run it also for a common program that you test at work and compare the results directly with your daily work. Evaluating tools can help to decide if you want to learn more about them.\n\nYou could evaluate an open source application for writing test documentation similar to the company standards or assess several free online services such as URL shorteners to be incorporated into the next product. Yet another mission could be to evaluate a new bug tracking system and provide management with information regarding the capabilities of the tool given the company's context and culture.\n\nLearn new approaches\n\nThere are many testing approaches to try out. You could focus the mission on some particular mnemonic like FCC CUTS VIDS[9] or use soap operas[10] to generate test ideas. Like tools evaluations, this type of mission aims to try out and learn about new approaches. After these sessions, the whole team will have made some experience and can make a more informed decision about the usefulness of the approach.\n\nReflection\n\nTake some time after each session to think about it and share observations. To keep the discussion focused on suggestions, you can take turns with stating positive things from what you saw. After that, each participant can provide specific suggestions of what can be improved. Try to fill in the template \"I suggest toâ¦\", and remind participants to stay positively focused at this. It's easier to accept feedback in this manner.\n\nOn a meta-level you should also think about things to change after each dojo. For example you can modify the switching time from five to six minutes, drop a rule or try something new in the next session. The group should make the decisions.\n\nAfter the reflection, the team votes for the next facilitator, the time and place for the next dojo. The new facilitator becomes responsible to schedule and organize the next session.\n\nPutting it all together\n\nTesting Dojos help your team gain a shared understanding of their approaches to testing. The collaborative setup allows sharing individual approaches quickly. New testers can directly see how a more senior tester would tackle the program, while a more senior tester can get new insights from the fresh perspective of the rookies. A Testing Dojo conducted with project managers and programmers can bring transparency to the magic thing that's called testing. This surely aids in the team building process, since the whole team gets to know how a skilled tester works.\n\nBased on your team and company culture, you can play around with conducting a Testing Dojo each other week, running a Coding Dojo between them. With this alternation you make sure, that you get a balanced approach to your deliberate practice. In the end, programmers attending a Testing Dojo might even find out the value of testing.\n\nYou can use Testing Dojos in your local testing user group. Check the Internet if there is already a public Testing Dojo in your neighborhood.\n\nA rich variety of Katas exists for Coding Dojos. There is currently not an equivalent resource to pick testing missions from. One source of inspiration is the catalogue of testing missions from Weekend Testing sessions[11]. Blogs about testing are another source of information. You can also simply ask your favorite search engine on the Internet about a testing challenge. As more teams use Testing Dojos, the collections of possible missions might start to grow.\n\nHappy testing.\n\nSpecial thanks to Tiina Kiuru and Michael Bolton and all the attendees of the Agile Testing Days 2010 Testing Dojos on their early feedback.\n\nBibliography\n\nCoding Dojos, http://codingdojo.org Session Tester, http://sessiontester.openqa.org/ Rapid Reporter, http://testing.gershon.info/reporter/ Test Heuristics Cheat Sheet, http://testobsessed.com/2007/02/19/test-heuristics-cheat-sheet/ Test Framing, http://www.developsense.com/blog/category/test-framing/ Testing Oracles, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_%28software_testing%29 Testing Mnemonics, http://www.qualityperspectives.ca/mnemonics.html The Power of Mnemonics, http://curioustester.blogspot.com/2009/10/power-of-heuristics-and-mneumonics.html FCC CUTS VIDS test heuristics, http://www.michaeldkelly.com/archives/50 Soap Opera Testing, http://www.logigear.com/logi_media_dir/Documents/whitepapers/soap_opera_testing.pdf Weekend Testing, http://www.weekendtesting.com\n\nRelated Resources\n\nSoftware Testing Magazine\n\nSQAZone.net - Software Quality Assurance Portal\n\nSoftware Testing Videos and Tutorials Directory\n\nBack to the archive list",

  "latent_7559": "So youâre in a French bar.\n\nItâs loud, but you can make out what people are saying.\n\nYou hear a fellow drinker talking about drinking like a holeâ¦\n\nâ¦another is talking about having a fat morningâ¦\n\nâ¦and someone broke sugar cubes on someoneâs back.\n\nWhat the heck is going on?\n\nYou scratch your head and wonder why youâre still lost even though you can translate the words.\n\nWell, youâve just had your first introduction to French idioms.\n\nWhy Learn French Idioms?\n\nYou could go without learning French idioms, but who wants to sound like a middle school textbook when they make everyday conversation?\n\nImagine being a student about to go on exchange to France. You want to make the most of your experience â meet new friends, have interesting conversations, and maybe even meet a special someone.\n\nBut itâs hard to make a connection when you sound formal and awkward. Knowing common French idioms and expressions can help you connect on a deeper level with native French speakers.\n\nOf course, the thing about idioms is they can be confusing or hard to remember, since you canât usually understand them from the individual words alone. You need to learn them in context.\n\nFluentU is the best tool for that job. FluentU teaches you French idioms and other real-world language from music videos, commercials, news and inspiring speeches. FluentU lets you learn real French, the same way that people speak it in real life. FluentU has a diverse range of videos, like movie trailers, funny commercials and web series:\n\nFluentU brings French videos with reach, with interactive captions that let you tap on any word to see an image, definition and useful examples.\n\nFor example, if you tap on the word âsuit,â then youâll see this:\n\nFluentUâs quizzes let you learn all the vocabulary in any video. Swipe left or right to see more examples for the word youâre learning.\n\nAnd the whole time, FluentU keeps track of vocabulary that youâre learning. It uses that vocab to recommend examples and new content. You get a fully personalized experience. Start using FluentU on the website or take this immersive practice anywhere with the iOS and Android apps.\n\n15 Common and Highly Useful French Idioms\n\nSo without further ado, hereâs a list of French idioms to help you sound fluent (and maybe even funny).\n\n1. CoÃ»ter les yeux de la tÃªte\n\nCoÃ»ter les yeux de la tÃªte literally means that something costs the eyes in your head â itâs a price thatâs unreasonable. The English equivalent is âto cost an arm and a legâ. Hereâs an example:\n\nJâaurais aimÃ© acheter un nouvel ordi mais Ã§a coÃ»te les yeux de la tÃªte.\n\nI would have liked to buy a new computer but it costs an arm and a leg.\n\n2. Boire comme un trou\n\nBoire comme un trou literally means to drink like a hole. When you say that someone drinks like a hole, it means that they never stop, even if they should. This expression has a small hint of judgment, so be careful about when you use it. Hereâs an example:\n\nâAstrid a remarquÃ© que Charles a bu deux bouteilles de vin hier soir. â\n\nâMon Dieu, il buvait comme un trou.â\n\nâAstrid noticed that Charles drank two bottles of wine last night.â\n\nâOh my God, he was drinking like a fish. â\n\n3. Ne rien savoir faire de ses dix doigts.\n\nNe rien savoir faire de ses dix doigts literally means not knowing how to do anything with oneâs ten fingers. It means that somebody is completely useless. Hereâs an example:\n\nLaisse tomber, il ne sait rien faire de ses dix doigts, celui-lÃ .\n\nForget about it, that guy is completely useless.\n\n4. Arriver comme un cheveu sur la soupe\n\nArriver comme un cheveu sur la soupe literally means to arrive like the hair in a soup. It refers to entering a situation at the most awkward moment possible. Hereâs an example:\n\nJulien et Arnaud se disputaient quand je suis arrivÃ©e â comme un cheveu sur la soupe.\n\nJulien and Arnaud were in the middle of a fight when I got there â at the most awkward moment.\n\n5. Mettre son grain de sel.\n\nMettre son grain de sel literally means to put in oneâs grain of salt â to give someone an unsolicited and unnecessary opinion. Case in point, your mom offering you advice and feedback on your love life (or lack thereof). Hereâs an example:\n\nEncore une fois, elle a mis son grain de sel.\n\nOnce again, she offered an unsolicited opinion.\n\n6. Faire la grasse matinÃ©e\n\nFaire la grasse matinÃ©e literally means to have a fat morning. Sounds delicious, no? It actually means to sleep in â but if youâre going to sleep in, you might as well enjoy a fantastic brunch afterwards! Hereâs an example:\n\nJâai trop bu hier soir, alors aujourdâhui, jâai fait la grasse matinÃ©e.\n\nI drank too much last night, so today I slept in.\n\n7. Câest dommage\n\nCâest dommage literally translates to âthatâs a shameâ. Imagine someone looking at a small-scale disaster and sharply exhaling in sympathy â the expression also translates to âthatâs too badâ. Hereâs an example:\n\nCâest dommage que tu ne sois pas au courant.\n\nItâs too bad youâre not up to speed.\n\n8. Coup de foudre\n\nCoup de foudre literally translates to a strike of lightning. In fact, it refers to love at first sight â one of those moments where you see a special someone, and canât help but react immediately. Hereâs an example:\n\nQuand je tâai vu pour la premiÃ¨re fois, câÃ©tait le coup de foudre.\n\nThe first time I saw you, I fell head over heals.\n\n9. Appeler un chat un chat\n\nAppeler un chat un chat literally translates to calling a cat a cat. Itâs the equivalent of telling it like it is, or calling a spade a spade in English. When you call a spade a spade, you simply see the ugly truth, and put it very bluntly. Hereâs an example:\n\nâAttends, tu veux vraiment dire quâil est stupide?!â\n\nâÃcoute, il faut appeler un chat un chat.â\n\nâWait, do you actually think heâs stupid?!â\n\nâListen, Iâm just telling it like it is.â\n\n10. Je dis Ã§a, je dis rien.\n\nJe dis Ã§a, je dis rien literally means âI say that, I say nothing.â Its English counterpart is âjust saying.â You would use this expression when giving your opinion but wanting to soften the blow a bit, or not assume total responsibility for it. It also has its own Twitter hashtag: #JDCJDR! Use with caution, since itâs rather passive-aggressive. Hereâs an example:\n\nSi on ne part pas maintenant, on nâarrivera pas au spectacle Ã  lâheure. Enfin, je dis Ã§a, je dis rien.\n\nIf we donât leave now, we wonât get to the show on time. Just sayingâ¦\n\n11. Poser un lapin Ã  quelquâun\n\nPoser un lapin Ã  quelquâun literally means âto put a rabbit on somebodyâ. The French expression sounds as silly as its English equivalent â to stand somebody up, or to not show up for something that youâve planned. Hereâs an example:\n\nJe lâai attendue mais elle nâest jamais arrivÃ©e â elle mâa posÃ© un lapin!\n\nI waited for her but she never came â she stood me up!\n\n12. Ãa marche!\n\nÃa marche literally means âthat works.â Marcher is an interesting verb because it means both âto walkâ and âto function/to work,â so it is not always transparent for English speakers. Youâll use this expression much in the same way as its English equivalent. If you and some friends are making some plans, youâll say Ã§a marche to confirm that youâre on board. Note that this expression changes from region to region. In Switzerland, for example, people say Ã§a joue: that plays! Hereâs an example:\n\nâOn se retrouve Ã  midi pour dÃ©jeuner?â\n\nâOui, Ã§a marche!â\n\nâLetâs meet at noon for lunch?â\n\nâYes, that works!â\n\n13. Sauter du coq Ã  lâÃ¢ne\n\nSauter du coq Ã  lâÃ¢ne literally means to jump from the rooster to the donkey â or to jump from topic to topic in conversation. You can use it to describe somebody who is difficult to follow in conversation, or use it as a signal that youâre aware that youâre completely changing subjects, but youâre going to do it anyway. Hereâs an example:\n\nEt, je saute du coq Ã  lâÃ¢ne maisâ¦\n\nAnd, this is completely unrelated butâ¦\n\n14. Ãtre Ã  lâouest\n\nÃtre Ã  lâouest literally translates to âbeing in the Westâ. It refers to being completely crazy or out of it. Hereâs an example:\n\nComme jâavais mal dormi, jâÃ©tais complÃ¨tement Ã  lâouest toute la journÃ©e.\n\nSince I had slept poorly, I was out of it for the whole day.\n\n15. La moutarde me/lui monte au nez\n\nLa moutarde me monte au nez literally translates to âthe mustard is getting to my noseâ â it means that Iâm getting angry (not sneezy, which would also seem like a possibility in this instance).\n\nâQuand elle se fait taquiner, on peut voir que la moutarde lui monte au nez!â\n\nâWhen she gets teased, you can see her getting angry!â\n\nHope you found this post on French idioms useful!",
  "latent_7564": "1.9k SHARES Facebook Twitter Sign up and we notify you about new features and Add-Ons\n\nWhat do the governments of South Korea, Egypt, Ethiopia, Bahrain, Sudan, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan have in common? Theyâre all customers of Hacking Team, a cyber-surveillance company providing surveillance tools allowing governments to spy on their citizens.\n\nIt appears that South Koreaâs National Intelligence Service (NIS) was secretly purchasing Hacking Team software, and had requested additional software tools that would allow them to hack Kakao Talk conversations and spy on us.\n\nWe know this now because Hacking Team were hacked. Unknown hackers got their hands on 400GB of internal documents from Hacking Team, which were made available online via torrent and later posted on Wikileaks. The client list includes a heaping handful of ârepressive regimes,â and Korea finds itself among interesting company.\n\nHacking Team is a controversial company based in Italy, labelled a âCorporate Enemy of the Internetâ by Journalists Without Borders (RSF) for selling products that are liable to be used by governments to violate human rights and freedom of information.\n\nâTheir products have been or are being used to commit violations of human rights and freedom of information,â says a statement in RSFâs Enemies of the Internet 2013 Report. âIf these companies decided to sell to authoritarian regimes, they must have known that their products could be used to spy on journalists, dissidents and netizens. If their digital surveillance products were sold to an authoritarian regime by an intermediary without their knowledge, their failure to keep track of the exports of their own software means they did not care if their technology was misused and did not care about the vulnerability of those who defend human rights.â\n\nBut Hacking Team remains adamant that they did nothing wrong, even as the 400GB of leaked data continues to spill deeper and dirtier secrets.\n\nâOur technology has always been sold lawfully, and, when circumstances have changed, we have ended relationships with clients such as Sudan, Ethiopia and Russia,â said Hacking Team CEO David Vincenzetti in a statement.\n\nAnd in an interview with Vice Magazineâs tech magazine Motherboard, Hacking Team spokesperson Eric Rabe claimed âWe donât do business with North Korea.â In that same interview, he also refused to confirm that Uzbekistan is a client â they are.\n\nItâs unforgiveable that Hacking Team would do business with such a repressive regime. But at the same time, should those of us in first-world countries be any happier that they are enabling our governments and police agencies to covertly spy on us? Other more seemingly above-board clients of Hacking Team include Switzerland, Hungary, Luxembourg, and the United States, where Hacking Team products are used by the FBI, the Department of the Army, and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), all supposedly free, democratic countries like South Korea.\n\nIn total, 2410 letters mentioning âKoreaâ were shared on Wikileaks, which may also refer to North Korea or news articles shared between employees.\n\nIn letters dated to 2011 and 2012, Hacking Team corresponded with a South Korean man named Huh Son-koo claiming to represent the 5163 Army Division. The mailing address for Unit 5163 was a PO box in Seocho-gu. Correspondence intensified in December 2011, during which month 37 of the 109 e-mails sent from Huhâs Paran.com e-mail address arrived.\n\nThe Korean client was interested in purchasing Hacking Teamâs Remote Control System (RCS) tool, which would allow them to bypass security systems and monitor people.\n\nâIn modern digital communications, encryption is widely employed to protect users from eavesdropping. Unfortunately, encryption also prevents law enforcement and intelligence agencies from being able to monitor and prevent crimes and threats to the country security,â Hacking Team says on their website. âRemote Control System (RCS) is a solution designed to evade encryption by means of an agent directly installed on the device to monitor. Evidence collection on monitored devices is stealth and transmission of collected data from the device to the RCS server is encrypted and untraceable.â\n\nOn December 11, the same day that the Democratic United Party accused the NIS of manipulating public opinion online, Huh thanked Hacking Team key account manager Massimiliano Lupi and wrote, âYes, the total price is 260,000 euros plus our commissions. I hope that you use 10,000 euros for the customer support when we cannot join that training. â¦ I thank, may be, you have to come for next projects in Korea so that you explain your solution of PC basis.â\n\nOn December 19, the day of the election, Huh sent Hacking Team four e-mails.\n\nJust two weeks ago, on July 1 and 2, internal correspondence between VP Business Development Philippe Vinci and staffer Cristian Vardo, identified as in charge of âexploit requests,â confirmed that Hacking Team was still doing business with what they thought was the Korean army.\n\nâIs ska [South Korea Army] Korea?â asked Vinci.\n\nâyes, Ska is a korean client,â replied Vardo.\n\nJust three days after that e-mail, Hacking Team was compromised and all their correspondence was leaked. At first it was reported that Koreaâs army was using RCS, which led to speculation it would be used in cyberwarfare against North Korea. But the ROK Army has no 5163 Army Division, and unidentified sources reportedly claimed that the mysterious unit is highly likely to be the NIS.\n\nOn March 27, 2014, two Hacking Team employees identified as Serge and Daniel reported on a trip to East Asia to meet with their clients in Korea and Mongolia.\n\nâThey also asked about the progress of Kakao Talk which they mentioned is very commonly used in their country,â reported Serge.\n\nâIâve already informed our R&D team of KakaoTalk,â replied Operations Manager Daniele Milan. âIt is being pushed up in the roadmap, although with less priority than other applications. In general, we are getting solid results from exploit developers, hopefully we will be able to provide some remote exploits for Android and other platforms in the near future.â\n\nFollowing the massive data leak, Hacking Team has advised clients to stop using their tools, as the data of their capabilities and users is now entirely public.\n\nDespite the devastating information leak, Hacking Team intends to build patches for revealed weaknesses and continue doing business with government agencies.\n\nâWe at Hacking Team are now dedicated to restoring the ability of law enforcement to fight crime hidden in the new encrypted digital world,â said CEO Vincenzetti on the Hacking Team website.",
  "latent_7578": "There are many zigs and zags, twists and turns, and unintended consequences along the path to higher priced and scarce oil. Only three months ago it seemed we were headed towards an aerial bombardment of Syriaâs armed forces which would likely send oil and gas prices towards the sky in anticipation of a response. Well, the AAA reports that the current average price of regular gasoline is $3.18 and its spokesperson is saying we should be seeing $3.10 a gallon by Christmas and maybe even $3. Whatâs happening?\n\nFirst let me disabuse you of the idea that we are seeing more than a temporary blip and that sub-$3 gasoline will become a permanent feature of life in America. The underlying forces that will cause oil production to peak â i.e. oil fields depleting faster than new ones are being found and developed at affordable prices â is still with us as will become apparent one of these days.\n\nThis fall, however, there are several factors that have come together to force oil prices down. One major factor, higher U.S. oil production, is unlikely to last more than a few years, while others such as steadily weakening demand may be with us for a while.\n\nWhen oil prices got high enough five or six years ago, it became profitable to drill and hydraulically fracture tight oil formations in North Dakota and Texas. What made fracking feasible was that oil prices in the last decade rose from $20 a barrel to circa $100, making the drilling of very expensive fracked wells with very short productive lifetimes feasible.\n\nFrom about 5 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2007, U.S. domestic production has climbed by 2.5 million b/d to 7.5 million bthis summer. For a time the oil industry had difficulties moving this oil to market as it was coming from regions without sufficient pipeline capacity so that a big glut of crude built up in the mid-West where the fracked oil came from. This glut drove down the value of domestic crude until at one point it was selling at $25 a barrel below world prices.\n\nRelated article: Why Gasoline Prices are Heading Lower\n\nWhile this oil was making its way to refineries in the mid-West, it was not getting to the Gulf or East Coast. We in the East were buying our crude at world prices which have been hanging around $100 a barrel for the last four or five years. Thus while the great fracked oil boom was helping consumers in the middle section of the country it was not doing much for the coasts where most of the people live.\n\nNorth Dakota where nearly a million of our 2.5 million b/d of fracked oil is coming from was -- and still is -- not deemed worthy of building expensive pipeline collection systems because of the rapid depletion of its wells.\n\nThe solution to this dilemma turned out to be railways, which America has in abundance. It took some time to build the terminals along rail lines, but once on board trains the oil could be directed to the highest bidder anywhere in the country. Movement of oil by rail costs some $5 a barrel more than that moved by pipeline, but when it still costs less than imported oil it is going to be used.\n\nThe next factor behind our cheaper gasoline prices is lower demand. Since the U.S. economy went south in 2008, demand for oil has been weak. While the average consumption of oil products in 2007 was 20.7 million b/d, by 2012 it was down to 18.5 million b/d with an increasing share being exported. While some of this decline was due to more efficient cars and trucks, the bulk of it was simply less driving due to hard economic times.\n\nOur next factor is a little more complicated and has to do with what happens when oil is refined. To make the story short, when you refine crude, among other products, you end up with roughly two barrels of gasoline for every barrel of distillates (diesel, heating oil, kerosene, etc.) that you produce. Now this is very nice when your demand for these products is equal to your consumption, but when they get out of balance you have to import or export to avoid shortages or gluts. Now Europe taxed itself into a lot of more-efficient diesel cars years ago, so European refiners had been ending up with large surpluses of gasoline which they were happy to sell to America, where we really love the stuff.\n\nRelated article: The Reason for the âFallâ in Gas Prices\n\nCurrently Europe has a lot more energy problems than we have here in America. North Sea oil production has been dropping for decades; the economy is really bad so that oil consumption is down; refineries are closing; and to top it off, Libyan oil production of 1.3 million b/d, most of which went to Europe, went down the tubes this summer amidst political chaos.\n\nThe solution to this was for Europe and other Libyan customers to import diesel and other distillates from the U.S., which led to a rapid growth in U.S. exports of finished oil products. The U.S. of course was set up to refine more oil than we currently are using, but this summer our refineries hummed at record rates cranking out distillates for export.\n\nThe problem was that for every barrel of diesel that we shipped out of the U.S., there were two barrels of gasoline left behind. The export statistics tell the story. In 2007 the U.S. exported 120,000 b/d of gasoline and 260,000 b/d of distillates. By the summer of 2013 gasoline exports had climbed to 380,000 b/d, but distillate exports were up to 1.4 million b/d.\n\nSo there is the story of our âcheapâ gasoline in a nutshell. We are refining some 1.4 million b/d of distillates for export and are ending up with 2.8 million b/d of extra gasoline, as a result of which we can only export 380,000 b/d. Welcome to lower gasoline prices for as long as this imbalance lasts.\n\nBy. Tom Whipple",

  "latent_7930": "âGreenhouse gases are the second most important factor for climate, after the Sun.â -Syukuro Manabe\n\nModeling the Earthâs climate is one of the most daunting, complicated tasks out there. If only we were more like the Moon, things would be easy. The Moon has no atmosphere, no oceans, no icecaps, no seasons, and no complicated flora and fauna to get in the way of simple radiative physics. No wonder itâs so challenging to model! In fact, if you google âclimate models wrongâ, eight of the first ten resultsshowcase failure. But headlines are never as reliable as going to the scientific source itself, and the ultimate source, in this case, is the first accurate climate model ever: by Syukuro Manabe and Richard T. Wetherald. 50 years after their groundbreaking 1967 paper, the science can be robustly evaluated, and they got almost everything exactly right.\n\nThe Earth and Moon, to scale, in terms of both size and albedo/reflectivity. Note how much fainter the Moon appears, as it absorbs light much better than Earth does. Image credit: NASA / Apollo 17.\n\nIf there were no atmosphere on Earth, calculating the climate would be easy. The Sun emits radiation, the Earth absorbs some of the incident radiation and reflects the rest, then the Earth re-radiates away that energy. Temperatures would be easily calculable based on albedo (i.e., reflectivity), the angle of the surface to the Sun, the length/duration of the day, and the efficiency of how it re-radiates that energy. If we were to strip the atmosphere away entirely, our planetâs typical temperature would be 255 Kelvin (-18 Â°C / 0 Â°F), which is most definitely colder than what we observe. In fact, itâs about 33 Â°C (59 Â°F) colder than what we see, and what we need to account for that difference is an accurate climate model.\n\nThe atmosphere of Earth, as seen during sunset in May of 2010 from the International Space Station. Image credit: NASA / ISS.\n\nThe number one contributor, by far, to this difference? The atmosphere. This âblanket-likeâ effect of the gases in our atmosphere was first discovered nearly two centuries ago by Joseph Fourier and worked out in detail by Svante Arrhenius in 1896. Each of the gases present has some amount of absorptive effects in the infrared portion of the spectrum, which is the portion where Earth re-radiates most of its energy. Nitrogen and oxygen are terrible absorbers, but good ones include water vapor, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone and carbon dioxide. When we add (or take away) more of those gases from our planetâs atmosphere, itâs like thickening (or thinning) the blanket that the planet wears. This, too, was worked out by Arrhenius over 100 years ago.\n\nThe infrared and visible light absorption windows of various atmospheric gases. Image credit: J.N. Howard (1959); R.M. Goody and G.D. Robinson (1951).\n\nBut a true climate model is more complex, because thereâs more at play than just the atmosphere. The oceans ensure that the amount of water vapor (and cloud cover, which impacts temperature significantly) change dependent on conditions, and if you tinker with one component of the atmosphere â like carbon dioxide, for instance â it impacts the concentrations of other components. Scientists refer to this general process as feedback, and itâs one of the largest uncertainties in climate modeling.\n\nThe increased emission of greenhouse gases, notably CO2, can have a massive impact on Earthâs climate in just a few hundred years. Weâre witnessing that happen today. Image credit: U.S. National Park Service.\n\nThe big advance of Manabe and Wetheraldâs work was to model not just the feedbacks but the interrelationships between the different components that contribute to the Earthâs temperature. As the atmospheric contents change, so do both the absolute and relative humidity, which impacts cloud cover, water vapor content and cycling/convection of the atmosphere. What they found is that if you start with a stable initial state â roughly what Earth experienced for thousands of years prior to the start of the industrial revolution â you can tinker with one component (like CO2) and model how everything else evolves.\n\nConcentration of CO2 in the atmosphere over the past few hundred thousand years. Image credit: NASA / NOAA.\n\nThe title of their paper, Thermal Equilibrium of the Atmosphere with a Given Distribution of Relative Humidity (full download for free here), describes their big advances: they were able to quantify the interrelationships between various contributing factors to the atmosphere, including temperature/humidity variations, and how that impacts the equilibrium temperature of Earth. Their major result, from 1967?\n\nAccording to our estimate, a doubling of the CO2 content in the atmosphere has the effect of raising the temperature of the atmosphere (whose relative humidity is fixed) by about 2 Â°C.\n\nWhat weâve seen from the pre-industrial revolution until today matches that extremely well. We havenât doubled CO2, but we have increased it by about 50%. Temperatures, going back to the first measurements of accurate global temperatures in the 1880s, have increased by nearly (but not quite) 1 Â°C.\n\nMonthly global surface temperatures (land and ocean) from NASA for the period 1880 to February 2016, expressed in departures from the 1951â1980 average.

The 1967 paper by Manabe and Wetherald received eight nominations; no other paper received more than three. The uncertainties surrounding climate sensitivity are still grappled with today, of course, but these were laid out and quantified fifty years ago, and the analysis is still both valid and valuable today. It takes into account clouds, aerosols, stratospheric cooling, water vapor feedback and atmospheric emissions.\n\nThe interplay between the atmosphere, clouds, moisture, land processes and the ocean all governs the evolution of Earthâs equilibrium temperature. Image credit: NASA / Smithsonian Air & Space Museum.\n\nAccording to Manabe himself â still active at age 85 â the modeling of large-scale processes, like atmospheric circulation, is virtually identical today to what it was in the 1960s. Smaller-scale phenomena, like moist convection, cloud processes, and land surface processes were much simpler back then, and have improved in both precision and accuracy, although uncertainties (particularly in clouds) still remain. There are some aspects of models that are ineffective, he notes, but not for the reason people think:\n\nModels have been very effective in predicting climate change, but have not been as effective in predicting its impact on ecosystem[s] and human society. The distinction between the two has not been stated clearly. For this reason, major effort should be made to monitor globally not only climate change, but also its impact on ecosystem[s] through remote sensing from satellites as well as in-situ observation.\n\nAnd the number one uncertainty that we have to look forward to, according to Manabe? Ice sheet modeling.\n\nElephant foot glacier in Greenland is just one small part of a massive ice sheet that threatens to melt entirely over the coming centuries. Image credit: Kashif Pathan / flickr.\n\nAs the globe continues to warm, the ice sheets â particularly over Greenland â will continue to melt. But the rate of melting, the consequences of the melt and the impacts that various processes will have are not only uncertain, theyâre unprecedented. If the entire Greenland ice sheet melts, the sea level will rise by approximately 8 meters (26 feet), submerging huge amounts of coastal and low-lying areas around the world, including the majority of the state of Florida. Melting, sliding, percolation and runoff are all sources of uncertainty, and its a combination of modeling and monitoring thatâs necessary to understand whatâs happening.\n\nWeâve known whatâs coming for half a century now, and weâre on the precipice of its arrival. Thereâs never been a more important time to listen to the science.",

  "latent_8180": "Long an important target for marketers in the West, LGBT consumers often have higher disposable incomes and lead consumer trends. With public acceptance of LGBT people continuing to grow worldwide, itâs time for brands to think global when developing their marketing strategies to this community.\n\nCase in point: as the second-largest economyâand home to the largest LGBT populationâin the world, China deserves serious attention.\n\nAccording to Hong Kong-based venture capital firm LGBT Capital, the annual purchasing power of Chinaâs 70 million-strong LGBT population amounts to $300 billion, compared to $870 billion for Europe and $750 billion for the United States Despite its size and huge potential for growth, virtually no Western brand has formally engaged this community, mainly due to its invisibility in public and in the Chinese media.\n\nBut thatâs quickly changing.\n\nIn February, Chinese tech giant Alibaba launched a Valentineâs Day contest in partnership with several Chinese non-profit LGBT organizations, including PFLAG China and the Beijing LGBT Center, to sponsor 10 gay and lesbian couples for a trip to Los Angeles in June to get married. Although these marriages are largely symbolic for now, the campaign has ignited enthusiastic discussions about the acceptance of LGBT people in China, as well as the potential of Chinaâs âpink economy.â\n\nPublic opinion is also pointing to an optimistic future. According to a recent consumer survey by Baidu, Chinaâs dominant search engine, 88 percent of Chinese millennials say they have no problem with accepting people who are gay.\n\nAs more and more LGBT Chinese step out of the closet and embrace their own identities, they will want the brands that they like and associate with to share the same pride. In fact, some Western brands that are publicly supporting LGBT rights may have already reaped early benefits in the China market.\n\nLast October, Apple CEO Tim Cook came out as gay in an open letter published by Bloomberg Businessweek, a story that also appeared on the cover of the magazineâs China edition. Mr. Cookâs coming-out story quickly became a hot topic on Chinaâs dominant social media platforms, Weibo and WeChat, with many within the LGBT community calling him a hero.\n\nCoincidentally, Apple is also the preferred electronic brand for Chinese gay men. According to an LGBT consumer study released last year by Zank, Chinaâs leading gay social app, nearly 70 percent of Chinese gay men own an iPhone, compared to 26 percent for Samsung phones. Such an advantage will prove even more beneficial for Apple as the company slowly transitions to a luxury lifestyle brand with the imminent launch of Apple Watch.\n\nThe travel and tourism industry will be another major beneficiary of the so-called âpink yuan.â Already the worldâs top spenders on tourism, Chinese outbound tourists spent a record $165 billion overseas last year, according to Chinese government tourism statistics. As acceptance of LGBT people continues to rise in China, there will be even greater demand for travel products and experiences that are specially tailored to this demographic on online travel sites and for independent travelers.\n\nChinaâs statistically astronomicalâbut largely untappedâLGBT market presents a highly lucrative growth opportunity for brands and travel destinations that have long benefitted from LGBT consumers around the world. Businesses that are interested in this segment must act early, but be prepared to make a long-term commitment, in order to reap the harvest.\n\nCharlie Gu is an account manager at China Luxury Advisors.",
  "latent_8241": "An ice palace or ice castle is a castle-like structure made of blocks of ice. These blocks are usually harvested from nearby rivers or lakes when they become frozen in winter. The first known ice palace (or, rather, ice house, Ð»ÐµÐ´ÑÐ½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð´Ð¾Ð¼ in Russian) appeared in St. Petersburg, Russia, and was the handiwork of Empress Anna. Anna Ivanovna, Empress of Russia, commissioned an ice palace in St. Petersburg, Russia, during the winter of 1739-40. Architect Piotr Eropkin and scientist Georg Wolfgang Krafft used huge ice blocks measuring 16 m (52 ft) long by 5 m (16 ft) wide, joined together with frozen water, to build the palace. The city recreates the ice palace every winter.[1]\n\nAnna Ivanovna's palace [ edit ]\n\nIn this 1878 painting by Valery Jacobi , the scared newly-weds sit on the icy bed to the left; the jocular woman in golden dress is Empress Anna herself.\n\nIn the cold winter of 1739â1740, Anna Ivanovna gave an order to build a palace made of ice in St. Petersburg. The palace and the surrounding festivities were part of the celebration of Russia's victory over the Ottoman Empire. She ordered the architect Pyotr Yeropkin to design the building.[2] It was built under the supervision of Georg Krafft who left a detailed description of the palace.[3]\n\nThe palace was 20 meters tall and 50 meters wide. Huge ice blocks were \"glued\" together with water. The garden was filled with ice trees with ice birds and an ice statue of an elephant. The outer walls were lined with ice sculptures. Before the palace there were artillery pieces also made of ice. The palace was also furnished with furniture made of ice, including an ice bed with ice mattress and pillows. The whole structure was surrounded with a tall wooden fence.\n\nThe festivities involving the Ice Palace included a mock wedding of two jesters.[4] Prince Mikhail Alekseevich Golitsyn [ru] had married an Italian woman. Empress Anna saw this as an affront because she was a Catholic, not Eastern Orthodox. The wife died soon after but Anna did not forgive Galitzine and decided to punish him in an unusual manner. She first ordered him to become a jester.\n\nThe Empress selected prince Galitzine a new wife, an unattractive Kalmyk maidservant Avdotya Ivanovna Buzheninova [ru]. She forced the prince to marry her and displayed the newlyweds in a procession where they rode an elephant, dressed as clowns, and were followed by a number of circus freaks and farm animals. In the palace the newlyweds were closed naked into an icy nuptial chamber under heavy guard. The couple survived the night because the bride traded a pearl necklace with one of the guards for a sheepskin coat.\n\nEmpress Anna died the following year and the castle [for obvious reasons] did not survive the next summer. The Russian reading public was made aware of Anna's mock palace in 1835, when Ivan Lazhechnikov (1792â1869) described her escapade in The Ice House, one of the first historical novels in the language. The novel was made into a film as early as 1927. The Mirrored World (2012), a novel by the author of The Madonnas of Leningrad, also depicts this episode in history.\n\nOther ice palaces [ edit ]\n\nMany ice palaces have been built since. In North America, one was built in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1883.\n\nEagle River, Wisconsin, has constructed an ice castle most years going back to the late 1920s.[5]\n\nThe capital city of Minnesota, St. Paul, has played host to several ice palaces since 1886 as part of the city's Winter Carnival. Some palaces have featured ice blocks numbering in the tens of thousands. A 1992 structure had 25,000 and stretched to a height of 150 feet (45.7 m). One built in 1941 had 30,000 ice blocks. St. Paul last built an ice palace in January 2018.\n\nEvery year since 1954 the Quebec City Winter Carnival in Quebec City has featured ice palaces or ice castles of various sizes, depending on the budget, and has often used them to imprison briefly those persons who were judged to be too glum in this time of good cheer.\n\nCivil Works Administration: \"The Indian New Deal Ice Palace\", Lake Bemidji, Minnesota--1934\n\nSaranac Lake, New York has an annual winter carnival in which an ice palace is built. This tradition dates back to the 1897,[6] when it was initiated to raise the spirits of tuberculosis patients who came to the town for recuperation over the long winter.\n\nSaparmurat Niyazov, the recently deceased president of Turkmenistan, ordered the construction of a huge ice palace near the capital city of AÅgabat in April 2004.\n\nAlthough the appearance of the original ice palace is disputable, it has been rebuilt each year since 2005 in Saint-Petersburg, Russia and is open to the public.[1]\n\nIn 1895, the mining town of Leadville, Colorado, was in an economic slump, due to the depletion of gold and silver ores, and the Panic of 1893. The townspeople were looking for a way to increase tourism in the area, and hit upon the idea of a giant ice castle. City leaders financed the endeavor, and the structure was completed in December of that year. It was opened to the public New Year's Day, 1896, and was an immediate sensation. It was huge. Gleaming blue-white walls three feet thick surrounded an ice skating rink, restaurants, ballrooms, a merry-go-round, and a toboggan slide. Thousands of tourists came to Leadville to see the frozen castle. Special trains brought visitors up the mountains of Colorado, and word spread rapidly around the country. The colossal structure was built on a site roughly five acres in size, on the west side of Harrison Avenue, using almost 5 tons of ice. Boiling water was poured over this, which quickly froze, thus strengthening the walls even further.[citation needed]\n\nThe Ice Palace remained open for only three months, and it was not a financial success. An early spring thaw ensured that the structure would not last but a short time. Because of the fact it did not pull in much money, the Leadville city council decided not to rebuild the following winter. Periodically, there has been a resurgence of interest in building another Ice Palace, but nothing has ever come of it. The original site has since been built up with houses.\n\nThere have been modern developments in ice construction, including the now widespread use of snice as a mortar-alternative, instead of the more simple, but less reliable, use of water alone.\n\nIn popular culture [ edit ]\n\nIn the 2002 James Bond film Die Another Day , villain Gustav Graves has built a massive ice palace in Iceland for a demonstration to the world media.

The 50 yard zero is a vanilla standard, as it suits almost everyone wellâ¦ but each rifle or carbine is a unique combination of barrel length / velocity, bullet weight, and shooter. If each rifle setup is unique, then can we do better than a âvanillaâ zero for each rig? Yes.\n\nMany of you might have heard of the maximum point blank range method of zeroing. MPBR is a zero scheme that is unique to your rifle and loading. It maximizes the âpoint blank rangeâ where you have to remember a single hold to get hits out to the end of the point blank range, hence âmaximum point blank range.â As an example, imagine a disk six inches in diameter and I want to hit that disk as far out as possible with one zero. How would I do that? I would zero the rifle so that the trajectory of my bullet will arch 3 inches high and where the bullet would fall 3 inches below my line of sight, that would mark the end of my MPBR zero. That disk could be at 25, 100, 212, or 274.5 yards and a single center hold would allow me to hit it with no need for holdover.\n\nHunters have used this method for a while, but with the popularity of the bullet drop reticle, it has fallen by the wayside in recent years. So why not just use the bullet drop marks? Because time. Your target, be it defensive or hunting, will present you with an opportune shot for only a few seconds. Ranging and doping the target, even with a BDC reticle, may not happen fast enough and / or you may miscalculate. That 18 inch shoulder-width ACOG ranging system isnât so useful if the target is standing sideways or presents only for a split second. We want to put rounds on target, with the highest probability to intersect the target, without having to try and estimate range. Anything inside of my MPBR I want to aim at and hit without worrying about hold over, hold under, or BDC stadia. Thatâs the beauty of the MPBR method, it allows you to tune your trajectory to tailor suit your rifle, your loading, and your target diameter. So how do we zero with this wunder method?\n\nLetâs start by expanding upon why we want to ditch the 50/200 zero mantra and see how things go with a 3 inch diameter MPBR:\n\nPoint. Click. Hit.\n\nYou need a ballistic calculator and some load data. I recommend Strelok on the itunes or android store. Strelok has a wonderful tool built in that lets you calculate the maximum point blank range right in the app and is a powerful tool. Letâs proceed with some more examples as to why MPBR is worth the trouble over a standard 50 yard zero.\n\nWith a 50 yard zero in a 20 inch rifle, shooting XM193, you can expect a bullet apex (aka maximum ordinate) of flight to be close to 2 inches (by my calculations) and then it falls back to cross your line of sight again at 225 yards. Wait, itâs not over yet. As the bullet continues to fall, it will fall 2 inches below your line of sight at 259 yards. The maximum point blank zero here is 259 yards meaning you should be able to hit a 4 inch disk from 0-259 yards with a dead center hold. Think of the MPBR as the acceptable vertical resolution where the bulletâs trajectory stays inside the defined size of the target.\n\nNow letâs bring it out a new MPBR zero which allows us to stretch that useful range out a bit more. Letâs zero so the maximum ordinate of our XM193 is 3 inches above the line of sight.\n\nSo if I am shooting a 20 inch AR15 with XM193 and a maximum bullet rise of 3 inches over my line of sight, then I just extended my MPBR to 300 yards where at that point the bullet would dip 3 inches below the line of sight. That has effectively changed our âresolutionâ to 6 inches where the bullet would stay in the defined target zone. A 6 inch resolution easily fits in the space occupied by a human head out to 300 yards! That means a dead hold to the middle of the face will *potentially* score head-shots out to darn near 300 yards!\n\nRemember, this sighting method is target size defined and shooter-rifle-projectile unique. Each rifle and loading will need to be entered in Strelok (or other ballistic calculator) to determine the best zero for your desired target diameter. Why does this apply to a defensive rifle / carbine? In a self defense setup, we need to maximize the distance where we will hit our target *without* shot correction.\n\nIf the target is inside our point blank rangeâ¦ we want the rifle to be a simple âpoint and clickâ interface. Bam. Hit. We want the highest probability of hitting a head, torso, or half exposed limb. Point. Click. Hit. We want to maximize bullet âhang timeâ to increase the probability our projectile will hit the target at unknown distances. Click. Boom. Hit. So why not 4.5 inches up and down if the average head is 9 inches tall for a MPBR of 349 yards!? Why not a 3.5 inch zero for a 7 inch diameter vital zone!? Sure, you can do that. Itâs all up to you and it all depends on your expectations of precision vs the diameter of the target.\n\nRemember that standard zeroâs are made for shooter convenience and not whatâs best for your rifle and projectile combo. Ranges come in known distance increments and we pick a set distance to zero out of convenience. That 50 or 100 yard zero for your setup doesnât stretch out the rifle or carbines maximum useful trajectory. So what should be our goal when we zero?\n\nGoal: increase the probability that the projectile will intersect the target *without* calculations.\n\nFactors: Rifle and bullet accuracy, shooter accuracy, target size, and environment.\n\nA defensive target, once engaged, will not stand up waiting to be shot. They will be hiding, returning fire, and they will present a small target for the shooter. Three inches of rise and fall (for a total of 6 inches of vital zone) gives us a great starting point for hitting hiding, peeking, or partially exposed targets. So instead of estimating range in a quick, violent engagement, I want to hold dead on and know that if my target is inside of 300 yards, that target is gonna get hit. This simplifyâs ranging immensely. No holdovers. No hold unders either. My only quesiton âis the target inside of 300 yards?â Yes? Then just a dead hold.\n\nSix inches of total vertical resolution seems like a logical choice for a MPBR setup and extends us past our 50 yard / 200 yard zero a bit and is still a fine resolution for engaging defensive targets. I canât think of anything I would shoot at that would be missed because my trajectory apex is three inches high. Look at your knee. It likely has a targetable area of at least six inches. Torso? This 6 inch resolution is easily inside the vital zone of a center of mass hold.\n\nSo next I whipped up a basic chart to get an idea of what zero at 100 yards I would need to get a MPBR which targets a 6 inch radius.\n\nXM193 and Mk 262: Sight in at 100 yards X inches high in blue for a bullet apex of 3 inches; the MPBR is in red for each barrel and projectile. The XM855 would benefit at similar zeros as it will be in between the MPBR of the 77 grain and 55 grain ammo.\n\nBarrel Length 10.5 14.5 16 18 20 xm193 2.6 2.4 2.5 2.2\n\n2.0 MPBR 262 281 289 300 303 Mk 262 2.8 2.6 2.6 2.5 2.4 MPBR 242 261 270 279 284\n\nSo you can see there is a bit of difference in the MPBR between rifle, carbine, and bullet. At one end we have the longer point blank range of the 55 grain XM193 and at the other end the heavier 77 Mk 262 at the other. With modern ballistic calculators such as Strelok, you can simply zero at 100 yards, input the maximum target diameter, take the recommended zero for your new MPBR and Strelok will tell you how many clicks up from 100 yards to achieve that zero goal.\n\nThis method of sighting in gives you some excellent hit probability. If the target is near, a dead hold will hit anything in your maximum point blank range. If you estimate the target is at 300-400 yards, holding on the head will ensure rounds drop into the mid torso. If you were incorrect and your target was closer than you estimated, your projectile would still likely hit the head.\n\nIt appears that M193 or, even better, a quality defensive 5.56 equivalent such as Hornady 55gr TAP would make the best choice because of the high velocity achieved by 55 grain loadingsâ¦ but when wind is thrown into the equation the 55 grain stuff makes it more difficult to hit the small targets at the end of its MPBR. So letâs look at heavier match bullets, what benefit do they offer? Increased accuracy and increased wind resistance.\n\nAdding the Variables; wind, accuracy, and MPBR\n\nTypically M193 is considered a 1.5 to 2 MOA load and the 77 grain Mk 262 is considered a sub MOA load. Think of each bullet as a probability to hit an area based on its accuracy. Groupings are the defining measure of whether a MPBR zero will be effective as inaccurate ammo could possibly land too far away from our target radius to remain useful. If your gun cannot keep groups inside the defined zone, then the distance you have chosen wonât work very well since trying to keep the bullets in a 6 inch diameter target zone out to 300 yards wonât work if your rifle is shooting minute of barn.\n\nIdeally you should start with an accurate, free floated barrel, and use the best ammunition available to you. A rifle shooting terrible groups at (Say 4 inches at 100 yards) will not benefit from MPBR, as we must consider that at 200 yards the groupings would double to 8 inches, and at 300 the groupings would run around 12 inches. This eliminates the gains of our MPBR since many of these shots will escape our defined target zone due to simple inaccuracy. A match projectile on the other hand, which shoots 1 inch or less at 100 yards, 2 inches at 200, and 3 inches at 300 will remain useful inside our maximum point blank range.\n\nWind can cause us horizontal shift away from our intended goal of hitting the target. With our example of a 6 inch diameter target and a MPBR of 300 yards, I still want to be able to hit the target in a slight wind. The benefits of match ammo are two fold: better wind resistance and tighter groupings. Both of these characteristics are just what we want when setting up our rifle or carbine. In the 20 inch gun, the Mk262 gives us a MPBR for our six inch diameter target of 284 yards which sacrifices 16 yards from XM193â¦ but the gains in accuracy and wind deflection make it the logical choice for a shooter who wants statistically significant gains on hit probability. As long as you do your part and shoot well, the higher accuracy and better wind resistance will reduce flyers which could land outside our intended target.\n\nWrapping Up:\n\nSo ultimately, your shooting goals should play into the rifle and its associated setup and upgrades. A red dot or BUIS set up with a MPBR zero will assist you in hitting targets of opportunity and at any distance inside your MPBR âboxâ. Since we cannot effectively range estimate every shot on fleeting targets, best practice would be to utilize MPBR to ensure hits by maximizing projectile trajectory as it relates to the size of our target. This method may be off-putting to those with a ACOG or similar rifle optic since it negates the benefit of the bullet drop stadia. We donât need no BDC stadia to be riflemen. We need knowledge and best practice methodology to ensure hits at any distance.\n\nBest practice appears to be a heavy match bullet out of a rifle length platform to maximize the flat trajectory of the projectile and to take advantage of better accuracy and wind deflection. This should increase your success in hitting targets with less correction.\n\nThe true value of this setup is that it helps free you from thinking about your target distance in hundreds of yard increments, and instead it allows you to estimate either near or far. Is the target inside of my MPBR? Yes? Point. Squeeze. Hit.\n\nIntegrating this into my setupâ¦ I foresee finalizing my optic equipped rifle with two loadings: XM193 for practice, and Hornady 75 gr HPBT for longer range work. The Hornady is considerably cheaper than the 69 grain SMK I have been shooting, and switching back and forth between the two loadings is as simple as uncapping the dial and rotating in a few clicks of elevation and windage. I think these loadingâs can cover all shooting I can ever realistically do. I really like this method as it increases the probability of intersecting the target at x range inside my MPBR zone. Itâs important to get away from the 100-200-300 yard paradigm and examine a zero which allows a more fluid approach to hitting a target at unknown rangesâ¦ because remember this, if nothing else; every field target will present at an unknown range.\n\nThe goal of a marksman is to study the platform and integrate the best practice findings into his or her shooting. I think it is safe to say that for work inside of a MPBR of 300 yards, the 77 grain Mk 262 offers the best probability of hitting the target if shot out of a rifle length system, and its excellent characteristics make it best for environmental conditions. XM193 makes a good substitute as your holds would be the same, but wind may knock you off target without some very light wind correction.",

  "latent_8573": "Youâre going to read and hear a lot of the same things in the next little while with regards to the death of Bobby âThe Brainâ Heenan. The greatest manager in wrestling history. Comedic genius. Superb performer. Magic in the commentary booth.\n\nItâs easy to romanticise oneâs talents or contributions in the wake of their passing. Itâs rare when you can say, without any semblance of doubt, that itâs all completely accurate. This is one of those times.\n\nI donât need to recite the memories. If youâre reading this, you all have them. If you donât, I genuinely feel sorry for you that you missed them.\n\nTo a generation of wrestling fans that grew up on late eighties WWF, Bobby Heenan was woven into the very fabric of the promotion. Whether managing the top heels, announcing pay-per-views with Gorilla Monsoon, hosting Coliseum videos in hokey skits with Gene Okerlund or making Prime Time Wrestling entertaining, he was everywhere. The reason for his overwhelming presence is obvious to viewers new and old â Bobby Heenan was the very essence of what made pro-wrestling great.\n\nBy the time heâd made it to the World Wrestling Federation, âThe Brainâ was the absolute perfect character for the business. He was clever and witty, but he was bumbling and incompetent. He could cut a fierce money-drawing promo next to Andre The Giant, but he was the ultimate chickenshit at the same time. He dressed like a millionaire and acted like the big man in town, yet he was a shameless cheapskate and took shortcuts at every turn. He was diabolical, yet totally harmless. You could see him get his ultimate comeuppance in satisfying fashion, and rather than have it blow off his heat as it would with most, heâd come right on back and be as hot as ever. All it took was for one fan to chant âWeaselâ, and with a simple turn of his head in recognition, the entire building would follow suit. Every time. It was an amazing persona, masterfully executed.\n\nEven before that, Heenan was as polished a manager as youâd maybe ever see upon his arrival in the AWA. Managing the top heel team and two best workers in the promotion, Ray Stevens and Nick Bockwinkel, Bobby could lend his unique magnetism to any act and enhance it. Case in point, when Bockwinkel took the AWA World Title from Verne Gagne, there wasnât anybody in the world that needed to talk for Nick, he had a wonderfully eloquent, intelligent and despicable promo. But as a combination, the added undercurrent of arrogance to Bockwinkelâs confidence was pure magic, with Heenan serving as the catalyst for a dynamic main event heel act.\n\nIt wasnât even something that was developed. His understanding of the business came along, sure, but as a natural performer, Bobby Heenan was born with a very special gift. He was brought into this world with a sense of humour and delivery that allowed him to, when called upon, completely steal any scene he was in. Like watching a Don Rickles appearance on Johnny Carsonâs Tonight Show, where everybody else in the room is there in the supposed role of a âstarâ, but sit with their thumb up their ass in awe. Heenan could rattle off one-liners, see the comedy in any moment, and leave anybody in the dust. And he did, many times.\n\nThe brilliance of Heenan, however, is that he wasnât a one-note joke, and when it wasnât time for him to âbe the showâ, he was smart enough to know exactly what to do to let the appropriate parties shine. Youâll never watch a match or performance of Bobby Heenan in his prime and think he did the wrong thing at the wrong time. As an entertainer, he was completely unselfish, not caring if you laughed with him or at him.\n\nOne of the things that makes the career of Bobby Heenan so fun to ruminate on is that, unlike so many others, you donât see an unrecognised brilliance and lament the fact that he didnât get his due. You donât hear anybody say that he was ahead of his time or underappreciated.\n\nBobby Heenan was the master of the time he was in. If he came along right as wrestling was first big on television, heâd be a forgotten historical figure who wouldnât have had the chance to be the wildly entertaining personality he was. If heâd come along later heâd probably be scripted, made far less effective and possibly rendered useless.\n\nIn the territorial days, he homesteaded Minneapolis and was king of that hill at a time when managers were given an incredible responsibility. During a period of time when it truly mattered how big the next live gate was, Heenan and others of his breed were entrusted to deliver the goods. That Bobby was considered the best of his kind is no small feat, his position one of tremendous significance.\n\nIn the WWF world of cartoon hoke and slapstick comedy he could play the goof better than anyone, but backed it up with material that would easily get an announcer fired from WWE today. Though he was walking some lines that would be frowned upon in the modern age, he often touched on sensitivities for laughter. During one episode of Prime Time with Monsoon, Heenan pointed to a stuffed Gorilla toy with a laugh, calling it the new Koko B. Ware action figure. During a match where Koko wore a single white glove (a la Michael Jackson), âThe Brainâ theorized that he wore it so that drivers could see him hitchhiking at night. Heenan would be similarly snide to Virgil. At SummerSlam â91, as Ted DiBiase put a beat down on his former bodyguard, Bobby broke through with, âI hope Virgil didnât do something stupid like put a down payment on a boom boxâ.\n\nNothing was off-limits. Women, ethnics, little people, characters. Despite this, it was all tempered, excused almost, by the fact that nobody was made to look as bad by Bobby Heenan as he made himself look by design. As a character, he made it so that nobody could possibly aspire to be him, the true mark of a heel.\n\nConversely, âThe Brainâ was excellent at adding the right touches to enhance others. His WCW run was highlighted by his work in the early days of the New World Order angle, appropriately stating how big a threat the invading force really was. When it came to the money angles with Sting and Hogan, Bobby knew the points to hit and how to hit them. As Goldberg gathered momentum and it was obvious he was catching on like wildfire, Heenan was the first to drop the shtick, forget about his own agenda and focus on putting over Goldberg like he was a once-in-a-lifetime athlete.\n\nBobby had some bad habits too, no doubt. His drinking accelerated in his WCW days as the product declined and going to work became a chore. While it was a story that went largely unreported, the decision to remove him from Nitro came not for a no-show as widely believed, but for being drunk during an afternoon production meeting before a show.\n\nHe got to make a cameo at WrestleMania X-7 in his WWF return, and to nobodyâs surprise, stole the show in the Gimmick Battle Royal on commentary. It was the last major league role of note he ever had, his throat cancer incapacitating him shortly after. What followed was a slow, gradual decline that feels terribly inappropriate for a man who made people around the world smile so selflessly. His failing health became sadder and sadder, as the gifts he brought to the world were robbed from both him and us. Given the nature of the industry today, thereâs no doubt heâd have been brought back for random TV appearances for years to come, maybe even hosting the Hall of Fame if it werenât for his ailments.\n\nBut Heenan wasnât one that appreciated mourning and misery, so it would be wrong to remember him with anything other than smiles and laughter. âThe absurdity of life is very funnyâ, he once said, explaining the mentality that made him what he was. When I personally think of Bobby Heenan, my mind, like yours Iâm sure, races to a litany of preposterous moments. Howling with angst during the 1992 Royal Rumble. Throwing his pencil in the air on Prime Time to try and catch it with style like Mr Perfect, and failing miserably. Crippled with sadness as he reported the news that Jamison, the Bushwhackersâ annoying geeky manager that had choked on food, had tragically survived.\n\nOne of the more poignant Heenan moments, one that captured the full scope of Bobbyâs talents, is his farewell to the WWF. On an episode of Raw after Survivor Series 1993, after being a pain in the ass to Gorilla for all those years, Monsoon finally threw him out. Between his begging, cowardly comments, tripping all over the place, stolen toilet rolls falling out of his bags and screaming âMy belongings!â as Gorilla tossed his stuff out, itâs a joy to watch him play the quintessential buffoon. Then, right at the end, he looks back one last time. He suddenly tears up and salutes goodbye after eight glorious years. As entertaining as he was and as much as you loved seeing him lose, it was still heartbreaking to see him go. Just as it is right now.\n\nAmong the more enduring Heenan memories is seeing Bobby pay tribute to Monsoon after his passing on Nitro. Fighting back tears, Heenan said that the pearly gates would now be known as the Gorilla Position. It seems only fitting to end this piece by extending the same sentiment to the other half of one of wrestlingâs most iconic duos.\n\nIf there is such a thing as heaven, it just became the Bobby Heenan Show.\n\nSo long, weasel.",

  "latent_8671": "Social science has a way of confirming what we humans already knew about ourselves. Data that validate one's intuitive gleanings about the species make a timeless gift, always in season. \" Extreme Protest Tactics Reduce Popular Support for Social Movements,\" from sociologists Matthew Feinberg of the University of Toronto's Rotman School and Stanford's Robb Willer, is also delightfully of-the-moment.\n\n\"It was coincidental,\" said Feinberg. The research was a year-and-half's work. (Some perspective: Eighteen months ago, former reality TV stars Josh Duggar, Caitlyn Jenner, Donald Trump were copping to Ashley-Madison-aided infidelity, facing manslaughter charges, and rallying in the Deep South, respectively.) \"By no means are we trying to make a political statement,\" Feinberg told me, further downplaying his and his coauthors' apparent futuresense.\n\nThe first official month of the Trump era saw a burning limo and a viral Nazi punch, a window-smashing black bloc at UC Berkeley, and a steady pace of \"cathartic\" Resistance marches. \"Not My President's Day\" having come and gone, MoveOn.org's next feast day is April 15th when the observant will join a multi-city Tax March. Hey, it's a living. Plus, if someone smashes a window or starts a fire? It's great TV, and free publicity for the cause.\n\nThat's just the problem, found Feinberg, et al.: The more extreme a protest or demonstration, the more media attention it gets. But the more extreme the protest, the less likely it is the folks at home will identify with its motivating spirit. This trade-off, between publicity and influence, they call \"the activist's dilemma.\"\n\nExtreme tactics, violent rhetoric or illegal actions, make protesters and their cause less sympathetic. Animal rights activists who broke into an animal testing facility and set the wards loose won less support from study participants than those who peacefully marched outside on behalf of the poor guinea pigs and chimpanzees. With the chant \"Pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon\" removed from a news article about a Black Lives Matter march, the movement won wider support from a test group than it did among those who read the original.\n\nProtesters who blockaded a busy street near a Trump rally, creating a potentially dangerous traffic jam, were so unsympathetic to the study participants that their tactics increased the respondents' reported support for the candidate. But don't take it from me: \"An examination of the changes in Trump support in each condition showed a non-significant change for both Control and Moderate Protest conditions, Fs <.067, ps >.797, but a significant increase in support in the Extreme Protest condition, F(1, 108) = 5.80, p =.018. In other words, participants presented with extreme anti-Trump protesters responded by reporting greater support for Trump.\"\n\nWhen it's more chaotic than carefully organized, more extreme than moderate, more violent than civilly disobedient, a protest gains greater notice but loses its sympathetic appeal. And extreme tactics can also backfire, serving the interest of the enemy. So it is assumed, if unproven, that the Weather Underground bombings, not to mention the amply televised protest riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, served Nixon far better than they did the antiwar movement.\n\n\"If you're a protester, and you're wanting to get attention and strategically raise consciousness, then you're going to want to do something more extreme to get the media's attention. But as our research shows, if you do that, you will risk undermining support for your cause and possibly having it backfire,\" Feinberg told me.\n\nStill, he doesn't necessarily embrace the idea that this study serves either side of the current political debate. Activists who let his data be their guide might strengthen the influence of their ideas by toning down their tactics. And those who skew skeptical, or contemptuous, of boisterous political demonstrations get to be smug about the proven futility of protesters' most attention-grabbing efforts. One takeaway from the activist's dilemma might be that an ideal political discourseâan open enough exchange of ideas that the best ones win fair and square, for the good of us allâgets lost when ugly behavior makes ordinary people tune out.\n\nEarlier research shows the correlation between extreme tactics and intensified media coverageâand demonstrates that people join protest movements because they identify with the people who are already fighting for the cause. Extreme tactics like blockades, violent language, and breaking and entering make the fight much harder to imagine oneself a part of.\n\nThe intentionally impersonal structure of a black bloc protest, for instance, allows for an anonymous collective violence. And, the data tell us, without a human face, a moderate approach, and a sympathetic argument, the black bloc's recruiting power may be insufficient to overthrow the government.\n\n\"In order to persuade people, one needs to understand who they're speaking to, who they're aiming to persuade.\" Protesters' most effective tactics will target the hearts and minds of their opposition, to overcome the barrier between divergent perspectives.\n\nFeinberg, whose earlier research has specifically focused on the psychology of political polarization and bias, earned his doctorate from Berkeley and his bachelor's from Whittier College, where Nixon went. (He declined to speculate whether this specialized pedigree influenced his research focus.)\n\n\"Extreme Protest Tactics\" follows a Feinberg and Willer study from two years ago that codified conservatives and liberals' disparate moral frameworks, aiming to help the alien camps \"bridge the gulf\" between them. Conservatives best hear moral arguments that favor a certain \"purity,\" they found, while liberals prefer the touchy-feely \"caretaking\" vibeâso, frame your pitch accordingly. \"You really need to understand what perspective they're coming from and be able to speak to them within their perspective, if you want to be at all persuasive and have a productive dialogue.\"\n\nThe practical takeaway here is much the same as Feinberg and Willer's latest: A would-be influencer needs to consider his audience, or else risk alienating them. Nary a black-masked protester (nor even a pink-hatted one, for that matter) will pretend to aim for a \"productive dialogue\" at this point. But when they're ready, leaving the Molotov cocktail at home will make a solid startâand that's science saying so.",

Roaming PokÃ©mon have appeared in every core series game from Generations II through VI except Black 2 and White 2 and Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.\n\nMechanics\n\nThis section is incomplete.\n\nPlease feel free to edit this section to add missing information and complete it.\n\nReason: Double-check whether roaming PokÃ©mon in Generation III will attempt to flee if they are able to after the first turn.\n\nIn addition to changing routes (something that happens every time the player moves to a new area), roaming PokÃ©mon will also attempt to flee from battle.\n\nIf a roaming PokÃ©mon is damaged or afflicted by a non-volatile status condition, it will retain those effects in subsequent encounters.\n\nGeneration II\n\nA roaming PokÃ©mon will flee on any turn it is able to, immediately before it would use its move; if it is unable to flee, it will instead use its prepared move. Since the roaming PokÃ©mon in Generation II all know moves with different priorities, depending on the move they are prepared to use, the player's PokÃ©mon may sometimes act before it flees and sometimes not.\n\nThe player can stop a roaming PokÃ©mon from fleeing by using trapping moves (such as Mean Look or Wrap). Sleep and freeze also prevent the PokÃ©mon from fleeing.\n\nIf a roaming PokÃ©mon is defeated, it will not reappear under any conditions.\n\nGeneration III\n\nIf a roaming PokÃ©mon is not already trapped, each turn it will attempt to flee at an effective priority of 0 instead of using a move. If it becomes trapped in the battle during the turn, it will attempt to flee but fail. If it is already trapped at the start of a turn, it will use a move instead of attempting to flee.\n\nA roaming PokÃ©mon can become trapped if it is hit by a trapping move before it is able to act. Trapping Abilities (such as Shadow Tag) can only prevent the PokÃ©mon from attempting to flee if in place at the start of the turn; if a PokÃ©mon with a trapping Ability is switched in, its Ability will not prevent the roaming PokÃ©mon from fleeing on that turn if it is able. Status conditions do not prevent a roaming PokÃ©mon from fleeing.\n\nGeneration IV\n\nStarting in Platinum, if the player defeats a roaming PokÃ©mon, it will reappear when the player next enters the Hall of Fame, but the player must retrigger its roaming. For example, if the player defeats Mesprit and then enters the Hall of Fame, Mesprit will only begin roaming again once the player visits Verity Cavern.\n\nGeneration V\n\nIf a roaming PokÃ©mon is not already trapped, each turn it will attempt to flee at an effective priority of -7 instead of using a move. If it becomes trapped (either by a trapping move or Ability) before it is able to act, it will attempt to flee but fail.\n\nIf the player defeats a roaming PokÃ©mon, it will reappear when the player next enters the Hall of Fame.\n\nGeneration VI\n\nA roaming PokÃ©mon will flee unconditionally after the player sends out their PokÃ©mon. It will become stationary in a specific area after the player encounters it 11 times.\n\nIf a roaming PokÃ©mon is defeated, it will reappear in its stationary position the next time the player enters the Hall of Fame.\n\nTracking\n\nIn Generations II, III and VI, players can use their PokÃ©dex to check the current location of a roaming PokÃ©mon (after they have seen it). In Generation IV, the PokÃ©tch's Marking MapDPPt application and the PokÃ©gear's map cardHGSS serve this purpose. In Generation V, the player can track their locations using the notifications of stormy weather on electric bulletin boards in gates.\n\nList of roaming PokÃ©mon\n\nGeneration II\n\nThe Legendary beasts are found roaming Johto in PokÃ©mon Gold, Silver, and Crystal; however, Suicune is not roaming in Crystal, where it instead can be found at the Tin Tower.

Only one will roam Hoenn; the other can be obtained on Southern Island with the Eon Ticket. In Emerald, the roaming PokÃ©mon will depend on the color of PokÃ©mon that the player tells their Mom was on the TV; red will result in Latias roaming, while blue will result in Latios roaming. These are the only two roaming PokÃ©mon that can be encountered while Surfing.

It will commence roaming the Kanto mainland after the player defeats Team Rocket in the Rocket Warehouse on Five Island and delivers the Sapphire to Celio.

TornadusB or ThundurusW will make the weather more extreme in Route 7 when entering the route. Heading towards the second house on the route will cause an old lady to come out and pull the player in. She will then recite the story of either TornadusB or ThundurusW. Upon exiting the house, the player will be approached by the respective PokÃ©mon, which will then fly off and will roam around Unova until being caught or defeated. Wherever these PokÃ©mon appear will be subject to weather identified as \"stormy\" by the bulletin boards in gates. Only these two PokÃ©mon can cause stormy weather (which manifests as rain in-battle), so they can be tracked down using the bulletin boards.\n\nUnlike other generations, the roaming PokÃ©mon's location varies depending on the time of day. At night, between midnight and morning, the PokÃ©mon can only be encountered in Routes 12, 13, 14 and 15, in the morning it can only be encountered in Routes 2, 3 and 18, during the daytime it can only be encountered in Routes 4, 5 and 16, in the evening it can only be encountered in Routes 6, 7 and 8 and at night before midnight it can only be encountered in Routes 9, 10 and 11.\n\nBulletin boards can be considered somewhat inferior to the tracking methods of previous generations, as, unlike Generation IV, Tornadus or Thundurus's location changes when the player exits the gate. However, as they simply cycle between three or four routes, one may continuously re-enter and exit the same gate until the route displays stormy weather.\n\nPokÃ©mon Games Location Levels Rate Tornadus B W Grass 40 Event Thundurus B W Grass 40 Event A colored background means that the PokÃ©mon can be found in this location in the specified game.

It will begin to roam after the player has defeated the PokÃ©mon League, and it will always be the first wild PokÃ©mon encountered in tall grass after the PokÃ©mon League has been defeated.\n\nIf the player uses Fly, the roaming PokÃ©mon will relocate to a random location. Traveling normally, on the other hand, will only provide a small chance for the roaming PokÃ©mon to change routes, and even then it will move to an adjacent route. Furthermore, entering any of the connecting gates between cities (or Victory Road) may cause the roaming PokÃ©mon to relocate randomly. This appears to be on a timer, however, as immediately pursuing the roaming PokÃ©mon does not seem to cause it to change location.\n\nAs the bird will automatically flee upon encounter, it cannot be caught until after it has been encountered an additional 10 times (not counting the first encounter), and has subsequently retreated to the Sea Spirit's Den in Azure Bay, where it remains as a stationary Legendary PokÃ©mon. However, if the battle in the Sea Spirit's Den is fled from, the bird will begin roaming Kalos again as before.\n\nPokÃ©mon Games Location Levels Rate Articuno X Y Grass 70 Event Zapdos X Y Grass 70 Event Moltres X Y Grass 70 Event A colored background means that the PokÃ©mon can be found in this location in the specified game.

  "latent_9144": "In the most recent issue of New York magazine, architecture critic Justin Davidson attempts to lob a grenade, arguing in favor of gentrification in the provocatively titled, âIs gentrification all bad?â\n\nBut rather than a Bloombergian manifesto in support of ever more billionaires moving to New York, Davidson offers a well-argued, thoroughly-reported and exceedingly reasonable case for the beneficent impact of middle-class newcomers on lower-income neighborhoods. Examining two gentrifying neighborhoodsâInwood and Bed-Stuyâhe concludes that both neighborhoods are benefitting from the influx of more upwardly-mobile professionals and the changes that follow in their wake.\n\nDavidsonâs right, of courseâfew would argue that gentrification is all badâbut heâs also missing the point.\n\nThe kind of gentrification that Davidson is talking about, the sort perpetuated by yuppies who decades ago bought brownstones in Park Slope and on the Upper West Side, joined local PTAs and convinced bodegas to start carrying organic milk and fresh-squeezed orange juice are no longer the dominant forces of neighborhood change. Just as the cityâs middle class is disappearing, so, too, are the benefits they conferred when they moved to lower-income neighborhoods, the edenic âsweet spotâ that gentrification is, at least briefly, capable of achieving: turning marginal neighborhoods into middle-class enclaves where affordable housing co-exists with good schools, decent grocery stores, low crime rates and a plethora of local retailers and restaurateurs.\n\nâItâs more important than ever to reclaim a form of urban improvement from its malignant offshoots. A nice neighborhood should be not a luxury but an urban right,â writes Davidson. Which is true, but we no longer live in an era when that model is particularly relevant. New York and the nature of gentrification has changed substantially in the last three decades, from 1980, when New York magazine defined gentrification as âthe conversion of poor, working class areas into middle-class refuges,â to the present day, when the idea of a middle-class refuge seems both impossible and impossibly quaint.\n\nInstead, we live in an era where yuppies have been priced out of vast swaths of Manhattan, alongside the working poor. As New York has become more and more a magnet for global capital, the speed and the severity of gentrification has accelerated to the point where families making upwards of $120,000 a year qualify for affordable housing. Consider that the last two Hunt columns in the New York Times featured a college student finding a $2,100-a-month studio and a couple moving into a $6,900-a-month two-bedroomârents enabled not by professional jobs, but in the first case, very wealthy parents and the second, a tech windfall.\n\nWine bars and cafes serving soy lattes are still the grounds on which class battles are fought, but now they are the endangered rather than the invaders, the turf that stands between the ultra high net-worth individuals of the world and everyone else. The gentrification skirmishes in New York today are characterized by upscale restaurant that cannot afford the rents paid by international fashion houses and companies who increasingly see New York stores as a branding necessity rather than a physical place to sell goods. Just as the global elite increasingly see New York as a place to park some of their massive fortunes, rather than as a place to live.\n\nThe losses range from unpretentious restaurants like Big Nicks to upper-crust establishments like the Rizzoli bookstore. The economics of the new New York are not so much about catering to wealthier new arrivals existing side-by-side with the less affluent. They are about catering to a population who buy sprawling duplex penthouses as investment pied-a-terres where they will stay a few weeks a year. The gentrification that Davidson is talking about involves wealthier, upwardly-mobile residents moving into working class neighborhoods; the gentrification that is now washing over New York involves people moving into neighborhoods where they do not really intend to live. That many real estate developers no longer deign to build one-bedrooms, according to a recent article in The Times, tells you everything you need to know about New York today.\n\nEven for the rich who plan to use New York as a primary residence, there is a real question of just how much real interaction will take place between the super-elite and the rest of us. Yes, New York has managed to preserve pockets of low-income housing in places like Chelsea and the Upper West Side, but do the children growing up in the Chelsea-Eliot houses have anything to gain from the existence of Avenues and neighbors who send their children to school there? The gentrification of the past may have helped bridged the gap between low and middle income, middle and middle upper; itâs the reason why many parents fight to send their children to go to schools in wealthier neighborhoods. But becoming a tycoon or a movie star or an heiress is a different thing entirely than becoming a teacher or a nurse or a small business owner. And given that the cityâs population of homeless children has ballooned during the era of burgeoning wealth that Bloomberg presided over, it does not seem that the influx of global elite into the New York real estate market has done much to improve the prospects of lower-income children.\n\nIf Davidsonâs piece feels intuitive, rather than counter-intuitive, perhaps that is because so many of the points he makes have already been conceded, even as neighborhoods across the city continue to grapple with changing class dynamics, just as they always have. But even the outer-fringes of gentrification, in neighborhoods including Bed-Stuy, the process taking place is not the older form of gentrification, the one in which the middle class invades. Unrenovated brownstones now sell for over a million dollars in the blocks that border Clinton Hill, and thatâs if you can even manage to buy one without an all-cash offer. Even two-bedrooms are selling for upwards of $800,000. Supermodels and famous artists are among the neighborhoodâs new residents; it is not really a place for the middle class anymore, let alone the low-income. The teachers, mailmen, nurses and accountants, the assorted middle class professionals who have owned brownstones for years will be able to sell them at great profit, a boon that the New York mag piece rightly identifies as such, but the buyers will not be of the same economic milieu.\n\nAs Davidson writes, âGentrification can nudge a neighborhood up the slope; decline can roll it off a cliff. Somewhere along that trajectory of change is a sweet spot, a mixed and humming street that is not quite settled or sanitized, where Old Guard and new arrivals coexist in equilibrium. The game is to make it last.â\n\nThe problem is that in New York, the game is already over.",

He had no idea he wouldnât be coming back.\n\nTurkish Kurds watch developments in the Kurdish town of Kobani as they stand near the Mursitpinar border gate in Suruc, Sanliurfa province, Turkey, June 27, 2015. REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nDede says the Kurdish YPG militia did not let his family of seven return to Dedeler near the Turkish border, telling him it was now Kurdish territory and Turkmens like him had no place there.\n\nâWhen Islamic State was there, they persecuted people. Now there is YPG and they are no different,â the 43-year old told Reuters in an impromptu settlement of refugee tents at a disused truck depot near Turkeyâs Akcakale border gate.\n\nâWe donât support any group, but still we are stripped of our right to live in our own land.â\n\nThe Kurds, who have emerged as the U.S.-led coalitionâs most capable partner in Syria against Islamic State on the ground, strongly deny having forced people of other ethnic groups out of territory they have seized. They say those who left did so to escape fighting and are welcome to return with guarantees of their safety.\n\nâWhen you come inside Tel Abyad, youâll see that the Arabs, Muslims, Turkmens, the Armenian people, all of them - they are living together,â said Idris Nassan, an official in the Kurdish administration for the Kobani canton, which includes Tel Abyad.\n\nâIt is multi-cultural, multi-national, multi-sectarian. The protectors of this administration are the YPG, the Peopleâs Protection Units. That refers to all people. We are not just for the Kurdish people,â he told Reuters by telephone.\n\nBut accusations that non-Kurds have been forced to flee, described as âethnic cleansingâ by neighboring Turkey, have tarnished the Kurdsâ reputation even as their success against Islamic State on the ground has raised their stature.\n\nBacked by U.S. air strikes, the YPG and smaller Syrian rebel groups captured the border town of Tel Abyad from Islamic State on June 15, prompting more than 26,000 people to flee to Turkey.\n\nWith nearly half the length of Syriaâs border with Turkey now in Kurdish hands, Ankara fears the creation of an autonomous Kurdish region in northern Syria which could inflame separatist sentiment among its own Kurdish population. It accuses Kurdish fighters in Syria of links to the PKK militant group, which has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state for three decades.\n\nSome Kurds say fear among refugees is being whipped up by Turks to discredit them.\n\nâThis is a psychological war waged against Kurds,â said Dengir Mir Mehmet Firat, a member of the Turkish parliament from the pro-Kurdish opposition HDP.\n\nâThe (Turkish) government said that it doesnât want the (Kurdish) cantons to be united, and when it happened they are now trying to create negative public opinion because they are angry. Theyâre playing a dangerous game by igniting nationalistic feelings.â\n\nRami Abdulrahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that monitors the Syrian war with a network of sources on the ground, says there has been no evidence of systematic expulsion by Kurdish militias on the grounds of ethnicity, despite isolated cases.\n\nBut new father Yasin Saeed, who fled Suluk, a Syrian Arab village around 20 km (12 miles) east of Tel Abyad as Kurdish forces entered over a month ago, said he was afraid to return.\n\nâIf you are not a Kurd but an Arab who has been living under Islamic State rule, they automatically see you as someone who supports and aids the group,â he said, sat in a tent, as his wife played with their 8-month-old daughter.\n\nâTHE BARRELS ARE POINTING AT USâ\n\nTel Abyad had been held since January 2014 by Islamic State, the Sunni hardline group which has seized large parts of Syria and Iraq and declared a caliphate, and which proudly boasts of the extreme violence it metes out to its enemies.\n\nMost of the refugees in the make-shift camp near Akcakale, established by the Turkish authorities, lived for more than a year under Islamic State rule. They have few good memories, although they say it was a period of relative stability.\n\nAround 4,000 have returned, according to Turkish officials. The rest have either been placed in refugee camps around Turkeyâs southeast or have sought refuge with relatives, much like the 1.8 million other Syrian refugees Turkey is now sheltering.\n\nSaeed said that unless the Kurdish militias left his home region, he had no plans to go back.\n\nâThe distrust between Kurds and Arabs has been there for years. But now they are at an advantage because they have guns and the barrels are pointing at us,â Saeed said.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said this month that Washington was supporting the Syrian Kurds because they were âcapable of actingâ, although U.S. officials have also said they do not support a separate Kurdish entity in northern Syria.\n\nâWe are very clear in communicating our expectations to (the Syrian Kurds) about the behavior they should be exercising in the areas where they have recently pushed Daesh (Islamic State) off the border,â U.S. ambassador to Turkey John Bass told reporters this month, emphasizing that displaced civilians must be allowed to return.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nIn Syriaâs multi-sided civil war, the Kurds have often avoided conflict with the government of President Bashar al-Assad, although the YPG says it does not cooperate with Damascus. Some Arabs and Turkmens suspect the Kurds of having a tacit agreement with Assad.\n\nâTheyâve been spared by Assad,â said another refugee, Halil, 32, whose cousin was executed by Islamic State this year and who asked not to use his surname for security reasons. âAssad has carried out all sorts of atrocities against many groups, but hasnât touched the Kurds.

  "latent_9705": "\"Using tech during our breaks may backfire and make us more susceptible to boredom and want more breaks, more often,\" writes Nir Eyal. Elena Strebkova/Strelka Institute/Flickr In their book \"The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World\" Dr. Gazzaley, a neuroscientist, and Dr. Rosen, a psychologist, explain that good breaks can reduce mental fatigue, boost brain function, and keep us on-task for longer periods.\n\nBut Gazzaley and Rosen forewarn that taking the wrong sort of breaks might make us more susceptible to boredom and may actually backfire by making us want to take breaks more often.\n\nFrom \"The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World\":\n\n\"â¦ technology may be decreasing the time associated with the onset of boredom when single tasking as a result of our ever-escalating exposure to pervasive, high-frequency feedback â¦\"\n\nIn other words, repeatedly checking our phones when we get a tad bored can train us to check more often throughout the day.\n\nFrom \"The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World\":\n\n\"From decades of research on learning and behavior, we know that the shorter the time between reinforcements (rewards), the stronger the drive to complete that behavior and gain the reward.\"\n\nThe rapid rewards we get from skimming our newsfeeds alleviate boredom for a few moments, but they also teach our brains to seek out blips of joy the next time we feel a twinge of fatigue, Gazzaley and Rosen explain, \"[â¦] the next time we are bored, our past experiences, having gained reinforcement from our smartphone, will drive us to self-interruptâ¦\"\n\nSo by reaching for our phones when we want a break, we may be training ourselves to do it again and again. In order to resist the onset of boredom and self-interruption at work, Gazzaley and Rosen suggest we avoid our smartphones and instead take breaks that restore the part of the brain we use to keep focused on our goals.\n\nLocated right behind the forehead, the prefrontal cortex is considered the most evolved portion of the human brain. Although it has many functions, goal management is its main business. The prefrontal cortex orchestrates attention, working memory, and other cognitive resources in order to help us get what we want.\n\nFor example, if my goal is to cook dinner tonight, my prefrontal cortex will help coordinate my brain functions to guide me through the actions needed to complete the meal like navigating the grocery store, following a recipe, and cooking the meal, all while making sure I don't get sidetracked.\n\nWhen we work, our prefrontal cortex makes every effort to help us execute our goals. But for a challenging task that requires our sustained attention, research shows briefly taking our minds off the goal can renew and strengthen motivation later on. Doing activities that don't rely heavily on prefrontal cortex function but rely on different brain regions instead, is the best way to renew focus throughout the work day.\n\n1. Go natural\n\nResearch shows that nature exposure is restorative for the mind. One study reported better working memory scores after a walk in a natural environment, but not in an urban environment.\n\nFrom The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World:\n\n\"Natural environments capture our attention in a bottom-up fashion because natural stimuli are so inherently compelling to us (presumably owing to evolutionary factors). They draw us in but generate minimal [prefrontal cortex] responses.\"\n\nWork in a city? You don't have to go far to benefit from nature. Just noticing the sights and sounds of natural features around you can help you recharge.\n\nFind plants, fresh air, a fish tank, or a fountain. Sit down, take a deep breath, and notice the details of nature. Point out as many as possible: \"The left leaf is smaller,\" or \"There's a bruise on the third petal,\" or \"It's off center in planter box,\" or \"I wonder how many bugs are on it?\"\n\nIf you are stuck indoors, look at some pictures of nature instead, as research shows they work too. Or try tuning into nature videos on your computer for a few minutes; like a tropical beach or a mountain creek.\n\n2. Doodle and daydream\n\nHaving a moment with 'nothing to do' is rare these days. We dodge even the briefest moments of potential boredom with just a few swipes.\n\nHowever according to Gazzaley and Rosen, avoiding occasional periods of 'nothing to do' downtime may have some unintended effects.\n\nFrom The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World:\n\n\"This leaves little time for reflection, deep thinking, or even just simply sitting back and letting our random thoughts drive us places we might not have gone while immersed in directed thinking.\"\n\nWhen we let our minds wander without focusing on a certain goal, the brain's default mode network takes over. Daydreaming and doodling tap into default mode network activity and may give some prefrontal cortex functions a rest.\n\nSit alone, set an alarm for 10 minutes, take a deep breath and be patient. If you need a little help, try the website Do Nothing for 2 Minutes for a quick session.\n\nYou can also practice mind wandering in your daily life by keeping your phone in your pocket and letting your mind drift while you wait at a crosswalk, a train station, or in an elevator lobby.\n\n3. Exercise your eyes\n\nOur eyes bear the burden of our tech-charged lives. Fortunately, doing 20-20-20 eye breaks is a straightforward way to alleviate eye strain and fatigue.\n\nEvery 20 minutes, stare at something 20 feet away, for 20 seconds. Gazzaley and Rosen explain the reason why this is beneficial is that it \"â¦requires blood flow to brain areas that are not related to sustained attention.\" The shift in blood flow across certain brain regions may be the reason why eye exercises are restorative.\n\nOur eyes bear the burden of our tech-charged lives.

Gazzaley and Rosen explain the reason why this is beneficial is that it \"â¦requires blood flow to brain areas that are not related to sustained attention.\" The shift in blood flow across certain brain regions may be the reason why eye exercises are restorative.\n\n4. Laugh\n\nLaughter packs a punch. It increases heart rate, respiration, and it gets our blood pumping as our upper body muscles are recruited into the action. Although evidence of long term benefits of laughter is debated, short term effects show some improvements on memory tests.\n\nFrom The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World:\n\n\" â¦ older adults who watched a funny video scored better on memory tests and showed reduced cortisol and increased endorphins and dopamine, meaning less stress and more energy and positive feelings.\"\n\nSpontaneous crack-ups, and forced giggles from laughter yoga or cheesy jokes by google assistant, all have the same perks.\n\nListen to a comedy podcast or a stream a comedy radio station. Read the comics section in the newspaper in the breakroom. Or keep a funny book at the office to help you get through the next afternoon slump.\n\n5. Exercise\n\nWe all know regular exercise benefits the body and the brain. The good news is that even short bursts of exercise are helpful for cognition. Just 10 minutes of physical activity can boost attention and memory performance.\n\nFind a secluded space to do a 7-minute workout, do some pushups or planks, or just take a brisk walk around the block. A little physical activity is a great way to rev-up your brain without breaking a sweat in your work clothes.\n\nThe bottom line is breaks should make you feel better by providing a renewed sense of focus and concentration.\n\nAs digital detoxes and tech-free zones rise in popularity, we are beginning to value the benefits of removing technology every now and then. Taking better breaks can encourage creativity and increase focus by relieving the prefrontal cortex of some goal management duties for a while.\n\nFrom The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World:\n\n\"Whatever relaxes you and takes you away from your over stimulating technological environment will help you re-engage with greater arousal, more capacity for attention, and less susceptibility to being interrupted.\"\n\nThe next time you need to take a break at work, ignore your smartphone and skip the newsfeeds. Choose an activity that is restorative so you feel refreshed and more prepared to tackle the rest of your day.\n\nThe gist:",

Credit: 7 News\n\nDISGRACED former Auburn deputy mayor Salim Mehajer has joined forces with his solicitor sister threatening to launch Australiaâs biggest defamation case.\n\nThe plan to outdo Rebel Wilson â who recently won Australiaâs biggest defamation payout of $4.5 million over media giant Bauer â was outlined in a letter to a journalist sent today, Fairfax Media reports.\n\nBauer is appealing Wilsonâs record payday.\n\nBut Salim plans to seek plenty more than that.\n\nSigned by Zenah Osman, the sister of the embattled property developer, the letter sent via email says Salim and ârelated entitiesâ will launch defamation proceedings seeking $103 million against a number of media outlets.\n\nâOur client will be commencing legal action against, not limited to, Channel Seven, A Current Affair, The Daily Telegraph, which will be in our view Australiaâs Largest Case of Defamation,â Ms Osman said in the letter, which is on a MLG Solicitors letterhead and Fairfax says was sent at 2.15am Saturday.\n\nIt seems Fairfax will escape Salimâs defamation aim: it was reportedly chosen as the recipient of the email because âat this stageâ Salim isnât bringing proceedings against it.\n\nâBeing in the media spot light [sic] is tough and brutal. One must be very patient and enduring,â Mr Mehajer says in a statement at the bottom of the letter.\n\nâI let the media throw in all the punches for the past twenty months and watched my case build just like a business deal.

All proceeds will be donated to charity.â\n\nThe letter is signed off by Ms Osman as âprincipleâ [sic] solicitor.\n\nSalimâs legal threat, which apparently will be filed next week, will be the latest in a string of legal battles he is fighting on a number of fronts.\n\nIt caps an action-packed fortnight in which Salim was injured in a car crash, delaying court hearings over assault charges for allegedly robbing and assaulting a taxi driver outside Sydneyâs Star Casino in April.

For years, he has been a reliable vote against workplace equity for women, opposing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which makes it easier for women to file wage-discrimination lawsuits, and two similar measures.\n\nThe full outpouring of hard-right enthusiasm is based, to a large degree, on Mr. Ryanâs sweeping opposition to abortion rights. He has long wanted to ban access to abortion even in the case of rape , the ideology espoused in this yearâs Republican platform. (Mr. Romney favors a rape exception.)

  "latent_10317": "Can you guess how much of the U.S. population has student debt? According to The Institute for College Access & Success, 7 in 10 seniors (69%) who graduated from public and nonprofit colleges in 2014 had student loan debt. The average borrower had student loans totaling $26,860! While the percent of graduates with debt rose slightly from 65% to 69%, the average amount of debt at graduation increased dramatically. Have a look bellow at our new animated map to see the ten-year change in student debt from 2004-2014 in each state. The results are astonishing!\n\nDrowning in Loans\n\nBased on calculations by The Institute for College Access & Success, the average amount of student debt from the Class of 2004 was $17,493. Over a decade, student debt increased by over $9,000 (+54%)! Below we highlight the states that experienced the smallest and largest change in average student debt.\n\nTop 5 Increases in Student Debt (by %)\n\nDelaware: +129%\n\nMaryland: +118%\n\nIllinois: +85%\n\nKentucky: +82%\n\nHawaii: +82%\n\nBottom 5 Increases in Student Debt (by %)\n\nFlorida: +32%\n\nArizona: +25%\n\nIowa: +23%\n\nLouisiana: +21%\n\nIdaho: +17%\n\nWe have also compared the states in which students have the highest amounts of debt on average in both 2004 and 2014.\n\nHighest Average Student Debt (2014)\n\nDelaware: $33,808\n\nNew Hampshire: $33,410\n\nPennsylvania: $33,264\n\nRhode Island: $31,841\n\nMinnesota: $31,579\n\nHighest Average Student Debt (2004)\n\nIowa: $24,204\n\nNorth Dakota: $22,409\n\nIdaho: $22,273\n\nNew Hampshire: $21,441\n\nVermont: $20,706\n\nComparing both sets of data, it is important to highlight that Delaware made the top of the list for both top 5 increases in student debt (by %) and highest average student debt (2014). Additionally, both Iowa and Idaho were in the bottom 5 increases in student debt (by %) and highest average student debt (2004). Looking at the data collected as a whole, the states with the largest increases in average debt are spread across the country rather than clustered in one single geographic region of the country. If there is no geographic connection, what could be causing this rapid increase in borrowing?\n\nBad News for Students\n\nBased on a previous article entitled âThe Most and Least Expensive Places to get a Degree in Each State,â tuition fees have been rising faster than inflation for decades and although tuition increases seem to be slowing down, cumulative undergraduate debt is rising as a result of little to no growth in income levels. According to the article, there are 18 schools that cost more than $60,000 per year with the most expensive schools located in New York, California, Illinois, New Hampshire (second highest average student debt in 2014), and Vermont. While not all colleges carry the same price tag, the rising cost of higher education does provide an insight into the student debt crisis. Given the complexity of relationships between employment trends, graduation statistics, interest rates, and other economic factors, it is difficult to assign blame to any single person or entity. Although it is difficult to pinpoint the culprit for the rise in borrowing that has led to $1.2 trillion in student debt across 40 million Americans, yearly trends show that getting a diploma has become a more costly investment today than it was for our parents and grandparents.\n\nThis GIF Shows The Explosion of Student Loan #debt in the Past Decade https://t.co/ZWeWR7bHwl #dataviz pic.twitter.com/Zn2LAPd1T3 â How Much (@howmuch_net) December 16, 2015\n\nPlease feel free to leave your comments below!

Drivers using speed camera detectors were the first to spot the white boxes stuck to posts along the roadside. Their devices, designed to warn drivers about traffic enforcement cameras, react to the signals emanating from the new sensors in the same way they do to the radar guns used by traffic police. Helping enforce the speed limit is merely a positive side effect, however; the city authorities installed the sensors for a completely different reason. The devices count the number of cars of varying size in each lane, determine their average speed, and send the data to a unified traffic control center.\n\nA traffic sensor in Moscow\n\nAs a result, the city authorities receive information about traffic intensity, which allows them to, for example, adjust traffic light phasing or plan further road infrastructure. The weekly reports issued by Moscowâs traffic authorities present information about the slowest and the fastest highways, based on data coming from both the Center for Road Traffic Management and from Yandex. While the latterâs data comes from apps running on usersâ smartphones, the former would not be able to collect its data without the road infrastructure that will be discussed here.\n\nEach week the Moscow city authorities publish data about the cityâs fastest and slowest highways\n\nThese sensors are the lowest tier of âsmart cityâ infrastructure â they collect raw data about traffic and pass it on; without that data, no analysis can be done and systems cannot be configured properly. Therefore, the information coming from the sensors has to be accurate. But is that actually the case? Can an outsider manipulate the operation of the sensors and the information that they collect? We will try to answer these questions and identify any improvements that can be made to the urban IT infrastructure.\n\nHow to search for devices and information about them\n\nAny research begins by collecting all the available data, and research into embedded systems, to which traffic sensors belong, is no exception. Even in a narrow market segment, you cannot know all sensor types and models by sight unless you are dealing with them professionally every day. The odds are that you wonât be able to immediately identity the manufacturer of a device by just looking at it. This makes all the logos and manufacturer labels on devices all the more valuable.\n\nIf you do succeed in identifying the model of a road sensor just by looking at it, you can find various documentation on the vendorâs site (or that of their integrator), and, if you are lucky enough, you will also find the software used for working with the devices. You will almost certainly find a marketing leaflet about your device; there is also a good chance you will find a larger sales-oriented document. It is also not uncommon to come across documentation, but finding a full-fledged technological description with the deviceâs command system is a rare piece of luck.\n\nIt is practical to automate the process of working with the sensors, so you donât have to sit under each and every device with a laptop. Nowadays, such automation is quite normal â wireless connections are no longer a rarity for âsmart cityâ components. However, to ensure such automation, you first need to know which communication protocol each sensor uses, and how to separate the devices you need from all the other devices.\n\nFor this purpose, you can use any identifiers, including peculiarities in how the devices communicate their data. For example, most MAC addresses are reserved to specific manufacturers (however, anonymous MAC addresses also exist). As well as numeric IDs, devices also typically have alphabetic names that may also follow some type of standard, i.e. the device model plus an incremental index.\n\nAll of this makes it possible to write a scanner to search for devices that are of interest to us. One of the sensor models installed in Moscow uses Bluetooth for data communication. These devices have both MAC addresses and âfriendly namesâ that are quite distinctive, so we can add only these traffic sensors to the list and filter out all nearby smartphones and TV sets. A discussion on Bluetooth security goes beyond the scope of this topic, so we will not talk here of compromising Bluetooth devices. We informed the Moscow city authorities about the configuration drawbacks in November 2015.\n\nTraffic sensor records saved to a database\n\nI used Python, PostgreSQL and a bit of C. In real time, as I drive by each traffic sensor, the scanner identifies each deviceâs MAC address, friendly name and coordinates. The fields with the vendor name and the physical address are filled out later on a separate pass through the database based on the data already collected. Determining the deviceâs physical address from coordinates is, to a certain degree, a time-consuming procedure, so it shouldnât be done simultaneously while searching for devices. Establishing a Bluetooth connection is not fast either, so if you want to find traffic sensors, youâll have to drive slowly.\n\nWhat can be done with the firmware\n\nThe openness shown by the manufacturers to installation engineers, their readiness to give them access to tools and documents, automatically means they are open to researchers. (I respect this sort of approach; in my view, this sort of openness combined with a âbug bountyâ approach yields better results than secrecy.) After selecting any of the identified sensors, you can install the device configuration software supplied by the vendor on your laptop, drive to the location (the physical address saved in the database), and connect to the device.\n\nAs we do in any research of embedded system security, we first of all check if itâs possible to reinstall the firmware on the device.\n\nThe configuration software allows the firmware on the traffic sensor to be changed\n\nYes, we can install new firmware on the device via this wireless connection designated for servicing purposes. It is just as easy to find the manufacturerâs firmware and as it is its software. The firmware looks reminiscent of Intel iHex or Motorola SREC, but this is the manufacturerâs proprietary product. If we remove the overhead information (â:â â the write instruction, serial numbers, memory addresses and checksums) from the data blocks for the digital signal processor (DSP) and the main processing unit (MPU), we obtain the clean code. However, we donât know the architecture of the controllers in the device, so we cannot simply open the file with a disassembler.\n\nThe traffic sensor firmware\n\nOddly enough, LinkedIn helps out here â itâs not just a handy resource for careerists and HR departments. Sometimes the device architecture is not a secret, and engineers who used to work for the manufacturer may be willing to talk about it. Now, as well as the file, we also have an understanding of the architecture which the firmware was compiled for. However, our good fortune only lasts until we launch IDA.\n\nYou can find the controller types even if they arenât specified in the documentation\n\nEven when we know the architecture, the firmware remains a meaningless jumble of bytes. However, we could find out from the same engineer how exactly the firmware is encrypted, as well as the encryption algorithms and key tables. I didnât have the device to hand, so at that stage I decided this black box mode of firmware modification was showing little promise, and set it aside. We have to admit that in this specific case the microelectronics engineers know how to protect firmware. However, this did not mean the end of the road for our sensor research.\n\nOnly trucks travel at night\n\nFirmware modification is âgoodâ in that new functional capabilities can be added. However, there is sufficient functionality in the manufacturerâs standard software. For example, the device has about 8 MB of memory that is used to keep a copy of traffic data until the memory is full. This memory can be accessed. The firmware allows you to change the way that passing vehicles are classified according to their length, or change the number of lanes. Would you like a copy of the information collected on traffic? No problem. Would you like to classify all vehicles as trucks driving in the right lane? You can do that too. Of course, this will affect the accuracy of the statistics that are collected, with all ensuing consequences.\n\nSample of the data traffic sensors collect and pass along. The same data is stored on the device\n\nIf someone wants to get a copy of Moscow traffic statistics or manipulate the data, they will have to walk or drive around all the traffic sensors; however, they wonât have to launch software for each of the thousands of sensors and modify the settings manually. In this specific case, there is a description of the proprietary system of commands for the devices. This is not something that you come across a lot when researching embedded systems. In any case, after establishing a connection to the traffic sensor using the manufacturerâs software, the commands are no longer a secret â they are visible using a sniffer. Even then, thereâs a description in English that saves us the trouble of analyzing the machine-language communication protocol.\n\nDocumented device commands make traffic analysis unnecessary\n\nBluetooth services are not actually implemented on the traffic sensor; the wireless protocol in this case is only a data communication environment. The data is communicated via a regular serial port. Software handling of such ports is no different from reading and writing to files, the code for sending commands is trivial. For these purposes, itâs not even necessary to implement the usual multithreaded port handling â itâs sufficient to send bytes and receive the response in a single thread.\n\nTo sum up, a car driving slowly around the city, a laptop with a powerful Bluetooth transmitter and scanner software is capable of recording the locations of traffic sensors, collecting traffic information from them and, if desired, changing their configurations. I wouldnât say that traffic stats are a major secret, but tampering with sensor configurations could affect their validity. And that data could be used as a basis for controlling âsmartâ traffic lights and other traffic equipment.\n\nThe sensor sent a response, the command has been accepted. Because we know the command system, it is easy to âtranslateâ the response\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nIt turns out that the answers to both questions we raised at the beginning are negative: traffic data is not protected, and it can be manipulated. Why is that? Well, there was no authorization except that required for Bluetooth, and that was not configured properly. The manufacturer of the road sensors we examined is very generous when it comes to service engineers, with a lot of information about the devices publicly available on the manufacturerâs official website and elsewhere. Personally, I agree with the manufacturer and respect them for this, as I donât think the âsecurity through obscurityâ approach makes much sense these days; anyone determined enough will find out the command system and gain access to the engineering software. In my view, it makes more sense to combine openness, big bounty programs and a fast response to any identified vulnerabilities, if for the only reason that the number of researchers will always be bigger than the number of employees in any information security department.\n\nAt the installation stage, it makes sense to avoid using any standard identifiers. Obviously, manufacturers need to advertise their products, and the servicing teams may need to collect additional information from the adhesive labels on a device, but besides the convenience there are also issues of information security to consider. Last but not least, itâs not worth relying solely on the standard identification implemented in well-known protocols. Any additional proprietary protection that is properly implemented will be relevant and make penetration much more difficult.\n\nA detailed presentation of this research was delivered at RSA US 2016, and is available at RSA conference website.",
  "latent_10433": "MUMBAI: The demonetisation drive has eaten into the growth momentum of the biscuits sector , which has seen sales fall by up to 1.5 percentage points, according to market leader Parle Products \"Biscuits as a category saw growth of about 5 per cent in 2016, except in the past two months, when the sales were hit due to demonetisation.\"The momentum in consumption, which had picked up after the monsoon, was affected severely by demonetisation. The result was shaving off of about 100-150 bps from category growth,\" Parle Products Category Head Mayank Shah told PTI.The government on November 8 had banned old Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 banknotes worth around Rs 20 trillion to control black money and counterfeit currency. Noting that demonetisation has had a significant impact on consumer demand and rotation of capital in trade, Shah said the effect would continue till the government is able to infuse adequate currency into the system.\"We see it continuing till the government pumps back sufficient currency into the economy. Only about one-third of what has been demonetised has been replaced till date.\"In the meanwhile, we are effectively looking at change in spending or paying habits of consumers, but this may take time,\" Shah said.Parle Products, which owns biscuit brands like Parle-G and Monaco , enjoys around 40 per cent share of the estimated Rs 25,000-crore biscuits market. Shah said rural demand will be a strong growth-driver in 2017.\"While urban consumption is growing, rural demand has been sluggish due to the late arrival of the monsoons. But since then we have seen revival in rural consumption as farmers expect a bumper harvest and therefor we see rural demand to be a strong growth-driver in 2017,\" he said.The note ban has yanked a whopping Rs 1.2 trillion or 10.2 per cent from the market capitalisation of consumer goods companies.Out of this, as much as Rs 99,000 crore value erosion is from FMCG stocks alone.

  "latent_10463": "When the all-new 2018 Harley-Davidson Softail platform was revealed a few months back it caused a division within the H-D faithful. On one side were riders and bike builders excited with the new technology and high-performance features. Also it was a blank canvas for creating something completely new. On the other side were the Dyna model aficionados upset that their beloved platform was being shelved for a dang Softail. Even though the new Softail chassis is nothing like the old one, they werenât having any of it. Also noted was that they thought the new models could never look as cool as the Dynas.\n\nEnter a man who is not afraid to conquer something new or never been done. Mark Atkins, a.k.a. Rusty Butcher, has jumped over freeway on-ramps on his Harley, built choppers and a plethora of Hooligan racebikes, won tons of flat-track races, started his own clothing company from nothing, organized and run flat-track races, and started a motorcycle parts company after he was unhappy with stuff he kept breaking. Mark has always been one to go against the grain and start his own trends that others later join in on. Evidence is a cult-like following of his Rusty Butcher brand, which is much more than just some productsâitâs a way of living life to the fullest.\n\nAlmost instantly upon receiving his 2018 Harley-Davidson Fat Bob, Mark began tearing into it and giving it a makeover that he had envisioned before he even got the bike. Mark wanted to prove that the new platform could be âcoolâ and live up to his style of riding. Which is wheelies, burnouts, drifting, and curb jumps on the daily, even when just riding to the local taco joint.\n\nWhat Mr. Rusty Butcher came up with after his customizing is something that both the forward-thinking H-D enthusiast and the Dyna fanboys can both dig on. It will definitely open eyes as to what can be done to the new Softail platform and will be just the beginning of customizing these models. As usual Rusty Butcher has blazed a trail.",
  "latent_10484": "Thereâs no need to spend money when you can fix something yourself. If youâve popped a button on your shirt, worn down a hem on your pants, or busted a seam in your dress, these five hand sewing techniques can help you fix things in snap.\n\nRunning Stitch\n\nThe running stitch is the most basic of all hand sewing stitches and itâs what all other forms of sewing are based off of. In the video above, Lauren Bradley from the expertvillage YouTube channel explains the easiest way to join two pieces of fabric. While running stitches running stitches may seem simple, they can still be incredibly effective for repairing clothing. This stitch can be used to:\n\nSew patches onto clothing (like when the knees go out in your pants)\n\nRepair a hem at the end of a pant leg or the arm of a jacket\n\nRe-attach a strap or other piece of fabric back to the main piece\n\nAll you need is a needle and some thread. Once you have your needle double threaded, be sure to knot the end and youâre ready to sew. When youâre done, a running stitch will have the same appearance on both sides of the joined fabrics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack Stitch\n\nThe back stitch is an advanced variation of the simple running stitch where you constantly take one step back and two steps forward along your stitch line. As Dawn Anderson explains in the video above from the MonkeySee YouTube channel, the back stitch is very strong and flexible stitch for repairing areas of high wear and tear. A back stitch is ideal for:\n\nRe-attaching zippers where the seam has come undone\n\nRepairing tears or places where the fabric is starting to unravel\n\nGenerally, anywhere a running stitch would do the job, a back stitch can be used. Itâs stronger and will probably last longer, but it takes longer to sew (especially if youâre new to sewing). With a back stitch, one side will look like a simple running stitch, but the other will have a line of overlapping stitches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhip Stitch\n\nThe whip stitch is a little more complicated, but may be even more useful than the simple running stitch. In the video above, YouTuber Wendi Gratz demonstrates a whip stitch on a small stuffed pillow, but the technique can be used to fix other things like:\n\nBusted seams on pants, shirts, and jackets\n\nPockets that have split open\n\nHems that have split open at the bottom (not at the actual hem stitch)\n\nOf course, as demonstrated in the video, you can also use the whip stitch to fix pillows, pillow cases, couch cushions, and any other item thatâs busted open at the seams. Again, all you need is a needle and some thread, but itâs best if the threadâs color matches the fabric youâre sewing into because the thread will be visible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlip Stitch\n\nThe slip stitch can close up seams and holes just like a whip stitch, but the stitch itself wonât be visible. Unfortunately, itâs also the toughest stitch to master on this list. In the video above, YouTuber Professor Pincushion demonstrates the slip stitch method while explaining the finesse the procedure requires. This type of stitch is useful for repairing holes in more visible areas where the thread of a whip stitch would be too apparent. Keep in mind, however, that itâs also not going to be as strong as a whip stitch, so it should only be used to repair small holes and tears. Also, itâs best if you use a thread thatâs colored to match the fabric youâre working with. If you have the patience to develop your skill, the slip stitch can make clothing issues literally disappear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSewing on a Button\n\nLast, but not least, knowing how to sew a button back on, or add an additional button, can be pretty handy. Weâve featured it before, but this video from the ThreadBanger YouTube channel explains the process in the simplest way possible. It doesnât take long to learn, and once you know how, it will stick with you. If youâre having trouble with it, you can use a toothpick to help you sit the button properly. Now thereâs no need to go buy new clothes because you know how to replace buttons on your clothing and jackets, fix undone hems, and repair tears or busted seams.",
  "latent_10587": "Spoiler Warning: This post may contain spoilers for the game Final Fantasy VI\n\nFinal Fantasy and opera both use gorgeous music to shape unforgettable stories.\n\nFull of of intrigue, betrayal, revolutionary coups d'Ã©tat, love, and murder all staged against magnificent worlds while accompanied by beautiful orchestral scores, the Final Fantasy series shares operaâs innate sense of dramatic flair. Famous for its stories, characters, and music, Final Fantasy is an old friend and longtime staple in any gamerâs repertoire. This series helped to move the idea of what a game could and can be from a novel toy or idle pastime to an immersive, memorable journey.\n\nWhile the series overall shares thematic and musical parallels, one title draws a more direct connection to opera - Final Fantasy VI. The game is made up of an ensemble cast with fourteen player characters, the most still to date in any Final Fantasy main title. This is just our core cast, the game also features temporary playable actors and has major non-player characters who are essential to the plot. With no set protagonist, each character is meant to embody the hero of the game.\n\nâWe began work on Final Fantasy 6 with the idea that every character is the protagonist of the story. Everyone on the team contributed ideas for characters into a melting pot. We were very keen to design a game featuring individual episodes for each character. In fact, Final Fantasy 6âs influence may have been responsible for the greater emphasis on character creation in subsequent titles in the series.â â Yoshinori Kitase, Final Fantasy VI, Game Director\n\nThis game was unique in its development process, defining a standard for later titles. The challenge of rounding out such a large set of personalities while maintaining consistency in the story was tackled through a collaborative endeavor. Rather than a single character designer or concept artist, multiple creative team members worked together to have the game take shape. All these moving pieces coming together into one complete experience brings to mind a bustling back stage.\n\nOur party forms that of the rebel faction known as the Returners who fight to disrupt the expanding evil of the authoritarian Gestahlian Empire. Final Fantasy VI changed the canon of fantasy in role-playing games and arguably beyond. Before, the player would be placed in some pseudo-medieval setting with the expected lot of wizards, elves, dragons, and so forth.\n\nIn VI the fantasy genre pushed an aesthetic that popular culture now knows as steampunk. This pairing of magic with industrial machinery captivated imaginations while offering a needed breath of fresh air.\n\nâFinal Fantasy games are divided into two core elements: battles and drama.â â Yoshinori Kitase, Final Fantasy VI, Game Director\n\nWith a wink and a nod we have reference to opera made apparent early on in the game with the twins Edgar Figaro and Sabin Figaro of Figaro Castle.\n\nLater, the game takes a break from saving the world to wildly crash a performance during a heist at the opera house. At this point of the epic, our party is in desperate need of a working airship. Naturally, the only airship belongs to a flamboyant gambler known as Setzer Gabbiani who just so happened to send a letter outlining plans to kidnap the mezzo-soprano of the opera Maria and Draco. Why announce a kidnapping, one to take place in front of an audience no less? Well, thatâs Setzer.\n\nOur motley crew formulates a wacky plan to have hardened former general Celes ChÃ¨re don the disguise of Maria to intentionally get kidnapped by Setzer in order to then have access to his airship. Nonsensical? Sure. Fun? Absolutely. This convoluted plan (though is it really that much different than the comedic antics in Marriage of Figaro?) leads to a scene heralded as one of the best, most famous, and a pivotal moment that changed video game history.\n\nThis interactive moment of performing \"Aria di Mezzo Carattere\" highlights the emotional depth of the game â and series â while offering some relief from a story that often could veer into heavier moments. The story within a story, used throughout literature but at that time rarely within video games, also works as a plot device to illuminate aspects of Celes and treasure hunter Locke Coleâs relationship.\n\nThe opera is performed though, naturally, it is crashed by a boss. After its defeat, somehow our kooky plan works and Setzer joins the bunch with airship in tow.\n\nThe Final Fantasy game series pushed video game music into an established genre. Such grand scores not only create an atmosphere, they also guide the player emotionally through the story and establish lasting impressions. Indeed, the famed aria from Final Fantasy VI has proved these soundtracks have artistic merit. Square Enix powerhouse composers Nobuo Uematsu and Yoko Shimomura have dazzled fans not just in game but also with many full symphonic performances. These two legends have helped to shape the video game music genre into one that offers full blown academic programs shaped around it.\n\nFinal Fantasy has inspired musicians, artists, cosplayers, and opera singers alike. Aria di Mezzo Carattere later was re-recorded by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra and performed on tour. Moreover, the lasting influence of this aria can be heard in \"Aerithâs Theme\" of Final Fantasy VII. Certainly, there are many more soundtrack compositions within this series that are operatic or classically inspired.\n\nIt is easy to compare video games to cinema; however, Final Fantasy is a perfect example that, with grandeur and flourish, they stride hand in hand with opera.\n\nListen to the sounds of Final Fantasy here:\n\nStay tuned for more in this blog series exploring the cross section between opera and fandom culture.Find part one and two of the series here and here.\n\nTags: #VideoGames #FinalFantasy #FinalFantasyVI #YoshinoriKitase #SquareEnix #SquareSoft #YoshitakaAmano #TetsuyaNomura #HironobuSakaguchi #HiroyukiIto #NobuoUematsu #YokoShimomura\n\nGIF/Image Sources (in order of appearance):\n\n1.

  "latent_10589": "Beetlejuice is one of the more interesting platformers for the NES, and one thatâs usually overlooked because of the LJN tag and the weird license behind it.\n\nLJN was a hideous beast in the NES era, generally known for releasing, shall we say, less desirable titles. The kind of stuff best reserved for rentals so you didnât regret paying full price later. But some of their oddities, like Friday the 13th, are actually interesting when you understand the mechanics. But letâs face it â LJN had a reputation. Their penchant for suck is easily found in games like the notorious The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends, which easily proves how they often ruined the potential of a decent license. Though I have a soft spot in my heart for some of their games, most are trashy when looked at objectively. But I have a thing for trash. My record for the Atari 2600 title, Spikeâs Peak, is in fact over double the current âworld recordâ listed on Twin Galaxies. So yeah, I like my games bad. Thereâs something entertaining to me about B-movie level video games. Enter, Beetlejuice.\n\nBeetlejuice was an unusual source for a video game. It had Geena Davis before she hit the drink, grotesque effects, and a story revolving around a strange vision of the afterlife. The title character Beetlejuice worked as a second-rate spook to scare humans out of homes. Itâs one of a handful of Tim Burton movies that were any good, and heâll surely ruin it with a planned sequel. But a game based on Beetlejuice? Very strange, considering it would have posed several challenges based on the brief plot I just provided, though granted the cartoon series was pretty stellar. But weâre talking about a game here, in an era when graphics were still fairly limited. Should it be a puzzle game? Text-based? Perhaps a shmup? Well, LJN decided to make it a platformer. An odd choice, but surprisingly it actually came out better than youâd expect. You heard meâ¦\n\nGraphically, Beetlejuice has this third-party, unlicensed feel. Strange, because Rare (of Battletoads fame) had their hand in it. Why it looks the way it does is a mystery reserved for future scholars. Some of the sprites consist of only two frames of movement with quirky designs. Beetlejuiceâs head is too big for his body ala NBA Jam, and some of the creatures are bizarre. Like, why in the hell am I fighting one of the ghost football players in the sewer as a boss? Why is there a shark in a giant bathtub in the first house? Why is the land of the dead so consistently populated by octopi and scorpions? Typical LJN, but the gloominess and goofiness kind of works to its advantage. At the same time, some parts, like the continue screen, are finely done with lots of detail.\n\nBut one surprisingly strong area of Beetlejuice is the sound. The tunes are largely memorable, albeit childish at times. But some, such as the eerie track in the sewer or the jive of the Netherworld are pretty impressive programming. The sound effects mix it up with light touches, but thereâs one problem, the loud ones. When Beetlejuice is struck you hear this bomb blast, and upon death you get one of the most irritating death notes ever. For the love ofâ¦you could create a new form of Chinese torture out of this, playing it repeatedly until your brain splits in two. With a TV at moderate level itâs punishing and more annoying than a Windows error out of nowhere with your speakers at max. Itâs only one detail, but until you get the hang of playing youâre sure to hear it more than any man should. Trust me, youâre going to be about as comfortable as you would hearing a jet with your ear next to the engine.\n\nThe gameplayâs where Beetlejuice is really interesting. Loosely following the movie, your goal is to scare everyone out of the house, or something. Really, itâs not clear what in the hell is happening. Sometimes it seems to follow the film, other times it just makes a boss out of whatever the hell it wants. But itâs fair to say it plays like a typical platformer. Making sense of the plot, thatâs your problem. Even the ending doesnât make any sense. Beetlejuice can jump and stomp. Counter-intuitively, he cannot jump on most enemies. What? Strangely, you can only do the jump attack on a few foes, so itâs trial-and-error to get a feel for what you can kill bare-bones. Fitting analogy, because the annoying death sound I mentioned earlier is accompanied by an explosion of bones. Beetlejuice can also purchase a variety of attacks called âscaresâ. Scares are purchased in little stores around the game or sometimes youâll find them lying around. To acquire purchasing rights, you have to stomp on tiny beetles that pop out of holes throughout the game, thus the purpose of your other âattackâ. There are four types marked via color. You also get points for killing certain enemies, and this reserve is what you use to buy scares. So, what is in fact your score is also your âmoneyâ, in a sense, exactly the same idea as Capcomâs under-appreciated Gun.Smoke. Scares generally allow you to fire shots, and certain scares have more damage and more shots. Others, like the âBirdmanâ, give you abilities like increased leaping, which is highly useful for some of the difficult jumps.\n\nThe usage of scares, especially how you collect them, is pretty novel and requires an element of strategy generally not seen with this time of game. Beetlejuice is also maddeningly difficult. Later in the house, for example, it switches to an overhead view and itâs one of the hardest maze-type runs Iâve ever played, with unforgiving enemies. This is made even more agonizing by floating doors that take you to the Netherworld where sandworms fly at lightning speed and kill you in a single hit. Creatively speaking, Beetlejuice actually excels in some regards. It takes the standard platformer and does something new with it while mixing up the action with some different level types, but itâs damn challenging. Thankfully, each enemy you kill returns your hit count to normal, giving you three overall unless you get struck by a one-shot beast, and there are a few lying in wait.\n\nAnother shocker is Beetlejuice has a lot of replay value, though this may be my love of all things bad. Itâs just hard enough to present a good challenge, but not so much that you reach for le Game Genie. Some segments are nerve-wracking, especially the Afterlife stage where almost everything you can think of comes flying from all directions. Damn it, that guy who got run over by a car in the movie is frikken fast, not to mention everywhere I go! No password or save feature, either, but something disturbingly charming about Beetlejuiceâs play allows you to slowly ease into later levels until youâre good enough to make it through the whole game. With a few continues to use as well as the ability to purchase extra lives (up to 9 total), this allows for a pretty enjoyable experience. You can check out a full play video below, but note that some of the graphics are affected in whatever emulator heâs using.\n\nBeetlejuice is one of the more interesting platformers for the NES, and one thatâs usually overlooked because of the LJN tag and the weird license behind it, having a similar feel to Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street. At first glance youâd figure youâre in for another Wayneâs World (look it up) due to the stigmas out there presented by reviewers who are more about comedy than actual substance. But if you put some time into it youâll find that Beetlejuice is quite a fun game, and some of the horror elements may also appeal to the goth in some of you out there- or at least the Burton fanaticism best reserved for his early years.

  "latent_10649": "By Manasa Chandra\n\nâI am deeply honored to be a recipient of the DeLano award that recognizes the importance of the availability of computational resources for biological research.â âHELEN BERMAN âI am deeply honored to be a recipient of the DeLano award that recognizes the importance of the availability of computational resources for biological research.â\n\nHelen Berman has won the 2013 DeLano Award for Computational Biosciences from the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Berman, a professor at Rutgers University and co-founder of the Protein Data Bank, is being honored for her efforts to make data universally available.\n\nâFrom the earliest point in her career, she worked within the scientific community to set up guidelines to ensure that such universal access would be possible,â explained Ann Stock of Rutgers University in her nomination of Berman. She continued: âMotivating these efforts was her strong conviction that it would be possible to create new knowledge from systematic analyses of data. While this concept seems obvious today, it was visionary when she began to promote the idea in the early 1970s.â\n\nAbout 25 new structures now are submitted to the PDB each day, and more than 88,000 structures have been made available since it was established in 1971. (Berman, who today directs the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics PDB, has contributed 38 of those structures.) Berman also was involved in creating the Nucleic Acid Database of structures. Her contributions to the PDB and databases of the sort have had a profound impact on how we study biology.\n\nJane Richardson wrote in support of Bermanâs nomination for the award, âI think it is incontestable that disappearance of the PDB would leave a larger hole in macromolecular science than the loss of any other single computer-based system and also that Helen is the person who deserves the most credit for that.â\n\nBerman began studying crystallography at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons during her undergraduate years at Barnard College. Her interest followed her to the University of Pittsburgh, where she worked under the direction of George Alan Jeffrey and received, in a mere three years, her Ph.D. in crystallography in 1967. She stayed on at Pittsburgh for a postdoctoral stint and later moved to the Fox Chase Cancer Center, where she started her own lab and focused for 20 years on nucleic acid crystallography and the interactions between nucleic acids and drugs. In 1989, she joined the faculty at Rutgers and went on to expand her crystallographic program to include the study of collagen and protein-nucleic acid complexes. Berman became director of the PDB in 1998 and in 2003 co-founded the Worldwide PDB organization that now manages the PDB archive.\n\nEducation is another facet of Bermanâs extraordinary career: She has mentored numerous high-school, undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Janet Thornton at The European Bioinformatics Institute explained, âObviously, as a professor, she has been involved in education, but her commitment goes well beyond the normal devotion to duty. Within the PDB she has always devoted considerable energy and funds to ensuring that the PDB is accessible to school children and young undergraduates. Her work has made these complex structures much more accessible to these young people, the scientists of the future.â\n\nBerman will receive her award during the Experimental Biology 2013 conference in Boston, where she will deliver an award lecture. The presentation will take place at 2:55 p.m. April 22 in the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center.",

  "latent_10708": "One of the things I like best about the option to write stubs for service virtualization in code is that by doing so, youâre able to store them in and access them through the same version control system (Git, for example) as your production code and your automated tests. I was excited when I read a blog post on the SpectoLabs website announcing that they had added a Java DSL to their most recent Hoverfly release. Iâve been keeping up with Hoverfly as a product for a while now, and itâs rapidly becoming an important player in the world of open source service virtualization solutions.\n\nThis Java DSL is somewhat similar to what WireMock offers, in that it allows you to quickly create stubs in your code, right when and where you need them. This blog post will not be a comparison between Hoverfly and WireMock, though. Both tools have some very useful features and have earned (and are stil earning) their respective place in the service virtualization space, so itâs up to you to see which of these best fits your project.\n\nInstead, back to Hoverfly. Letâs take a look at a very basic stub definition first:\n\n@ClassRule public static HoverflyRule hoverflyRule = HoverflyRule.inSimulationMode(dsl( service(\"www.afirststub.com\") .get(\"/test\") .willReturn(success(\"Success\",\"text/plain\")) ));\n\nThe syntax used to create a stub is pretty straightforward, as you can see. Here, we have defined a stub that listens at http://www.afirststub.com/test and returns a positive response, defined using the success() method, which boils down to Hoverfly returning an HTTP response with a 200 status code. The response further contains a response body with a string Success as its body and text/plain as its content type. By replacing these values with other content and content type values, you can easily create a stub that exerts the behaviour required for your specific testing needs.\n\nAs you can see, a Hoverfly stub is defined using the JUnit @ClassRule annotation. For those of you that use TestNG, you can manage the Hoverfly instance (the Hoverfly class is included in the hoverfly-java dependency) in @Before and @After classes instead.\n\nWe can check that this stub works as intended by writing and running a simple REST Assured test for it:\n\n@Test public void testAFirstStub() { given(). when(). get(\"http://www.afirststub.com/test\"). then(). assertThat(). statusCode(200). and(). body(equalTo(\"Success\")); }\n\nSince Hoverfly works as a proxy, it can return any data you specify, even for existing endpoints. This means that you donât need to change existing configuration files and endpoints in your system under test when youâre running your tests, no matter whether youâre using an actual endpoint or the Hoverfly stub representation of it. A big advantage, if you ask me.\n\nConsider the following (utterly useless) use case: the endpoint http://ergast.com/api/f1/drivers/max_verstappen.json returns data for the Formula 1 driver Max Verstappen in JSON format (you can click the link to see what data is returned). Assume we want to test what happens when the permanentNumber changes value from 33 to, say, 999, we can simply create a stub that listens at the same endpoint, but returns different data:\n\n@ClassRule public static HoverflyRule hoverflyRule = HoverflyRule.inSimulationMode(dsl( service(\"ergast.com\") .get(\"/api/f1/drivers/max_verstappen.json\") .willReturn(success(\"{\\\"permanentNumber\\\": \\\"999\\\"}\", \"application/json\")) ));\n\nNote that I removed all other data that is returned by the original endpoint for brevity and laziness. Mostly laziness, actually. Again, a simple test shows that instead of the data returned by the real endpoint, we now get our data from the Hoverfly stub:\n\n@Test public void testStubFakeVerstappen() { given(). when(). get(\"http://ergast.com/api/f1/drivers/max_verstappen.json\"). then(). assertThat(). body(\"permanentNumber\",equalTo(\"999\")); }\n\nApart from being quite useless, the example above also introduces an issue with defining stubs that return larger amounts of JSON data (or XML data, for that matter): since JSON is not really well supported out of the box in Java (nor is XML), we could potentially end up with a large and unwieldy string with lots of character escaping for larger response bodies. Luckily, Hoverfly offers a solution for that in the form of object (de-)serialization.\n\nAssume we have a simple Car POJO with two fields: make and model. If we create an instance of that Car object like this:\n\nprivate static Car myCar = new Car(\"Ford\", \"Focus\");\n\nand we pass this to the stub definition as follows:\n\n@ClassRule public static HoverflyRule hoverflyRule = HoverflyRule.inSimulationMode(dsl( service(\"www.testwithcarobject.com\") .get(\"/getmycar\") .willReturn(success(json(myCar))) ));\n\nthen Hoverfly will automatically serialize the Car object instance to JSON, which we can visualize by creating another REST Assured test and having it log the response body to the console:\n\n@Test public void testStubGetCarObject() { given(). when(). get(\"http://www.testwithcarobject.com/getmycar\"). then(). log(). body(). and(). assertThat(). body(\"make\",equalTo(\"Ford\")); }\n\nWhen run, this test generates the following console output, indicating that Hoverfly successfully serialized our Car instance to JSON:\n\n{ \"make\": \"Ford\", \"model\": \"Focus\" }\n\nNote that the getters of the POJO need to be named correctly for this to work. For example, the getter for the make field needs to be called getMake(), or else the object will not be serialized.\n\nThe final Hoverfly feature that Iâd like to demonstrate is the ability to simulate error flows by returning bad requests. This can be done simply as follows:\n\n@ClassRule public static HoverflyRule hoverflyRule = HoverflyRule.inSimulationMode(dsl( service(\"www.badrequest.com\") .get(\"/req\") .willReturn(badRequest()) ));\n\nand can be verified by checking the status code corresponding with a bad request, which is HTTP 400, with a test:\n\n@Test public void testStubBadRequest() { given(). when(). get(\"http://www.badrequest.com/req\"). then(). assertThat(). statusCode(400); }\n\nSimilar to the Hoverfly product in general, its Java DSL is still under construction. This post was written based on version 0.3.6 and does not reflect newer versions. I had a bit of trouble getting the code to run, initially, but the SpectoLabs team have been very responsive and helpful in resolving the questions I had and the issues I encountered.\n\nAs an end note, please be aware that the Java DSL weâve seen in this post is just one way of using Hoverfly. For a complete overview of the features and possibilities provided by the tool, please take a look at the online documentation.\n\nA Maven project featuring all of the examples and tests in this post can be downloaded here. Tip: youâll need to set your Java compiler compliance level to 1.8 in order for the code to compile and run correctly.",

  "latent_10821": "Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has one person to thank for reviving his political fortunes, and it's a surprising person: Kim Jong Un.\n\nJust two months ago, Abe was mired in scandal and his poll ratings were falling so precipitously that analysts were ready to write the 62-year-old's political obituary. Then the North Korean leader started firing missiles over Japan and suddenly the hardline Abe was looking like just the prime minister Japan needed again.\n\n\"Kim Jong Un is doing him a great favor,\" said Jeff Kingston, director of Asia studies at Temple University's campus in Japan. \"During crises like this, there is a rally around the flag and that helps the LDP, which is seen as strong on security,\" he said, referring to Abe's conservative Liberal Democratic Party.\n\nAbe is expected to announce Monday that he is dissolving the lower house of the Diet, or parliament, and calling a snap election for Oct. 22, 14 months ahead of schedule.\n\nDuring the \"lost decades\" since Japan's bubble burst, elections here have tended to revolve around the economy. Until now, Abe's focus has been no exception to this rule, with his concept of \"Abenomics\" to boost consumption and growth.\n\nSome analysts, including Kingston, had seen this as part of a strategy for Abe to win widespread public approval and therefore the mandate to press ahead with what he really wanted to do: revise the American-written post-war constitution to allow Japan to return to normal military footing after seven decades of imposed pacifism.\n\nThat has been controversial as most Japanese thought that the constitution, particularly the war-renouncing Article 9, had served them well. Other changes in security legislation here, such as the 2015 \"re-interpretation\" that allowed Japan to come to the defense of the United States, had sparked protests of a size not usually seen in Japan.\n\n[North Korea fires another missile over Japan, triggering warnings and condemnation ]\n\nBut now, the threat of North Korean missiles and the relative proximity to huge nuclear explosions is making many Japanese think again.\n\nIn the space of three weeks, North Korea fired two intermediate-range ballistic missiles over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido and into the Pacific Ocean, an apparent test of technology aimed at reaching the mainland United States. Then, earlier this month, North Korea detonated what appeared to be a hydrogen bomb that was as many as 17 times the size of the American atomic weapon that destroyed the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945.\n\nA new poll found that 85 percent of respondents said they felt threated by North Korea and 68 percent said they wanted Japan to beef up its defenses against ballistic missiles. Notably, more than half (54 percent) said they wanted Japan to have the capability to launch an offensive strike, according to the poll from the conservative newspaper Sankei and Fuji television network.\n\nA growing number of influential lawmakers in the LDP, including the current defense minister, have been calling for Japan to be allowed to have pre-emptive strike capabilities, not just the defensive ones as laid out in the existing constitution.\n\nEarlier this week, Japan deployed a Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile-defense system to Hokkaido, although the system has a range of only 12 miles and the most recent North Korean missile reached a height of 480 miles. Abe's government also wants to deploy the Aegis Ashore land-based anti-missile system and is in talks with the Trump administration about this.\n\nHelpfully, the Yomiuri newspaper, which is staunchly supportive of Abe, reported that President Trump had praised the Japanese prime minister's \"strength\" when the two had lunch in New York this week.\n\n[Abe accused of giving secret donation to far-right school]\n\nAbe has seized on this opportunity to call the election, said Atsushi Kinoshita, a political analyst who served as a lawmaker for the main opposition Democratic party.\n\n\"With North Korean missiles flying over Japan and local governments conducting evacuation drills, of course people feel a sense of crisis,\" he said. \"Prime Minister Abe is betting that Japanese citizens will agree with his position on reinforcing Japan's military.\"\n\nThis is quite a turn-around from July, when Abe was being pummeled with allegations of cronyism and his approval ratings plummeted from around 60 percent to below 30 percent. At the same time, the LDP suffered a crushing defeat in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election.\n\nThese factors had analysts wondering whether he could even survive an LDP leadership election next year.\n\nBut the scandals have faded into the background over the summer, and the prime minister reshuffled his cabinet. His ratings are back up around the 50 percent mark in the latest Yomiuri poll.\n\nThat gave Abe an opening, said Harumi Arima, a political commentator on Nippon TV who calls this an \"election for survival.\"\n\n\"Abe's approval rate is now picking up and the Democratic Party is coming apart,\" Arima said, while the political party formed by Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike does not yet have a national presence. \"If Abe waited until next year, there would be less and less opportunity to find a good time for a snap election and he might have no choice but to dissolve the lower house at a time when his approval rating is low.\"\n\n[Japanâs prime minister pushes ahead with controversial âanti-conspiracyâ bill]\n\nCalling the election now also has the added benefit of dissolving the Diet before it can question Abe about the corruption scandals that plagued him before the summer break. The lower house is due to go into an extraordinary session, where Abe could be questioned, on Sept. 28, the day that the prime minister is now expected to dissolve the parliament.\n\nThe left-leaning Asahi Shimbun, which is generally critical of Abe, said the prime minister was calling the snap election to \"serve nothing but his own interest\" so that he can \"weasel out\" of being questioned on the scandals.\n\n\"Abe will go down in history for setting a dishonorable precedent as a prime minister who took the liberty to 'own' the right to dissolve the Lower House for no other reason than to protect himself,\" the newspaper wrote in an editorial Thursday.\n\nKinoshita agreed, calling the decision to call a snap election \"a very selfish act\" that went against the wishes of the Japanese people.\n\nThe big question now is not whether Abe will call the election, but whether he will maintain his two-thirds supermajority in the lower house, a threshold that is crucial if he is to proceed with trying to revise the constitution.\n\n\"He may win big but he may also lose his super majority in the lower house,\" said Kingston. \"If the voters give Abe a nasty surprise, it might bring out the long knives in the party.

  "latent_10899": "As a former video game journalist of little to moderate success, Iâve found that the industry has kind of passed me by since I quit a little over two years ago. Still, with my experience as a games journalist at independent sites (and some bigger ones too), I do have a sense of what is ethical and what is not. While Iâve moved on to working in SEO and focusing my creative energies on my my comic book work and this blog, I often look back on my time as a game journalist and question some of the ethics in games journalism. Despite what people may think, ethics in games journalism, and all journalism for that matter, is a legitimate issue. With that in mind, here are some ways Iâve found whether or not to tell if a publication is acting ethically or not.\n\nIs There a Personal Relationship Involved?\n\nIf it seems like nepotism, itâs probably nepotism. One of the first rules about journalism is that colleagues normalize ethics for each other. This means that if there are journalists that are uncomfortably close with PR representatives, then they probably also have friends who are also uncomfortably close with PR representatives. This has become a real problem in all forms of journalism, but particularly in product journalism. In terms of the ethics of games journalism, PR representatives manage all aspects of a publishers contact with the games press, from reviews, to previews to interviews, and define the standard of ethics in games journalism.\n\nWhat this means in practical terms is that PR representatives tend to largely control the narrative around game releases. While larger outlets do have some autonomy due to brand recognition, blogs and mid-size publications are almost entirely beholden to PR representatives for access. This includes embargos on reviews â which are often not allowed to be posted until after a game is released. This often is not the case in other forms of product journalism, such as film or tech.\n\nHow is the Quality of the Content?\n\nOne of the biggest indicators of a publicationâs ethics is the quality of content. This is particularly true in game journalism, where newsjacking s a prevalent part of most sitesâ coverage. With newsjacking, publications are not actually putting any effort into doing any of their own research or reporting. Instead they are relying on other outlets (and sometimes PR representatives) to do their coverage for them. They then regurgitate the story with their own slightly different personality-driven spin, giving credence to the argument that there is a lack of ethics in games journalism. This is all done while promoting the same content assets (screenshots, trailers etc.) and acting as hype men as opposed to critically reporting on and analyzing culture and games.\n\nEthics in Games Journalism Is Likely Not a Solvable Situation\n\nUltimately, we need to recognize that what has fostered this situation is the consumerism of the internet and expecting to read everything for free. As much as we want to hold ethics in games journalism to a higher standard, we are also not willing to fund it. That isnât to say that no efforts are being made toward promoting quality reporting in games journalism. But it is to say that games journalism itself is not a sustainable outlet without any form of independent revenue. This is why a lot of games reviewers have turned to video. Itâs a more sustainable outlet where you can use another siteâs audience (mainly YouTube) to help traffic views in and gain ad revenue.\n\nBut having helped run an independent site for some time that in its peak got close to 60,000-80,000 views a month, I can say with certainty that audience is not what pays the bills. Itâs access. Itâs impossible to grow a publication without access to the companies that you are covering, regardless of what size game publication you run. This actually extends to all forms of product journalism, and even lifestyle journalism. But as long as we the mainstream is ok with lazy ethics in games journalism, itâs what we will continue to get.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

  "latent_11405": "You've probably heard by now of PokÃ©mon Go -- the augmented reality game sweeping the nation. The game, which came out July 6, is based on the hit â90s anime show that followed teens who train mythical animals for battle. Itâs become wildly popular. Now, millions of people are running around with the phone game that allows them to find and train PokÃ©mon by visiting real-life locations.\n\nTo be fair, the runaway success of the game has led to some problems. Robbers have been caught hanging out near Pokestops, virtual reality spots in the game where you go to collect items that improve your standing, so they can corner people late at night; the company that developed the game, Niantic, came under fire for the extreme data permissions it demands from users who use their Google accounts to join the game; Suffolk County police have recently called on PokÃ©mon Go to prevent sex offenders from using the game to target youths.\n\nBut this story is not about those problems. This story is about how, in spite of every legitimate reason people have to hate PokÃ©mon Go, the game is giving users one more reason to stay obsessed. As tech magazine Fast Company aptly puts it: PokÃ©mon Go is helping us fall in love with our cities.\n\nItâs a phenomenon Iâve been seeing firsthand here in New Haven. My house is about three doors down from a park that acts as a Pokestop, or location in the game where people can collect Pokeballs, candy, and other items that help them get ahead. And when people walk by, phone hovering a foot or so from their face, all I have to do is yell, âPokÃ©mon?â to get a conversation with a complete stranger started on my stoop. In a city where I've found strangers are usually reticent to speak to each other, this sudden friendliness is a welcome change from the status quo.\n\nI spoke to players Michael Eskridge and Daniel OâRourke at a local games cafe, Elm City Games, and they said conversations like mine are happening to them nonstop. âWe have met tons of people through this,â OâRourke says.\n\nBecause so many people play this game now, thereâs suddenly a lot of strangers bumping into each other -- with a lot to talk about.\n\nâI actually ended up talking to a visiting couple for about 45 minutes just about the game,â says Eskridge.\n\nAs if to prove their point, as we leave Elm City Games in pursuit of a rare PokÃ©mon called a Koffing, three complete strangers walk by. âHey! Hello!â Eskridge says. The strangers ask what team the two guys are on. Some light ribbing ensues. They all go their separate ways.\n\nMolly Sauter, a PhD student at McGill University who researches online activism and digital politics, says the opportunity for real-world interactions like these are one of the things that fans of augmented reality games find so exciting. Sauter says: âWhen you have something that you know you have in common with someone else itâs a lot easier to say hello to them and exchange information because you have something to talk about.â\n\nPeople who play PokÃ©mon tell me in these moments, they feel like theyâre breaking down social barriers and getting to know their neighbors in a new way. And that cuts through some of the coldness of modern cities.\n\nSauter says thereâs another way people are falling in love with their cities through PokÃ©mon Go. Because the game forces you to go to local landmarks to get candy, PokÃ©mon, or other game benefits, thatâs leading people to take a closer look at parts of their cities when they might have just walked by. Sauter says: âGetting you outside and getting you walking around different communities and different places, thatâs a really valuable thing.\"\n\nThis is the kind of urban exploration OâRourke and Eskridge say theyâve seen in New Haven as they run to the different landmarks that make up the cityâs Pokestops. âI started wandering my own neighborhood,â says OâRourke, âand I found a library I didn't know was there before.â\n\nItâs also the kind of urban exploration that Elm City Games co-owner Matt Fantastic is banking on. âItâs super weird that this dumb, incredibly fun game is creating these instant communities,â says Fantastic. âPeople who would never talk to each otherwise are connecting to each other on this thing.â\n\nHeâs been playing the game and setting up lures that draw more PokÃ©mon toward the cafe -- and, he hopes, more customers with the PokÃ©mon. âWeâre getting to meet new people who maybe didnât know we existed,â he says. âI donât know that itâs translated to a measurable bump in sales, but weâre definitely getting people popping their heads in and stuff like that.â\n\nAccording to Forbes Magazine, Elm City Games isnât alone. Businesses and cultural institutions across the country are advertising when you can catch PokÃ©mon nearby.\n\nIt remains to be seen how theyâll wield their new Pokepower, or if the bonding power of PokÃ©mon dies down when the novelty of the game wears off. But for now, the game is bringing me down a side street with OâRourke and Eskridge, to look at a conceptual sculpture in the federal government courtyard while Eskridge grabs a photo.\n\nThis interaction may be temporary, but I don't need to overthink it. Thanks to PokÃ©mon Go, this city -- and the people in it -- suddenly feel a little more special.",

I learned it when I was a kid but have never once used it in my life (my signature is a drawing of a middle finger wearing cool-guy sunglasses). This realization made me wonder what other shockingly outdated practices are still persisting in education, so I did some digging ...\n\nMost people who know me know that, in my spare time, I volunteer at a non-profit fight club for 8- to 15-year-old children from low-income families. I don't think that makes me a \"hero\" (although I humbly accept that as the nickname the children have given me). Last week, one of the 10-year-olds (who would honestly be the best in her age group if she didn't keep dropping her hands) informed me that she wouldn't be able to fight because she had homework to do. When I learned what her assignment was, I was shocked: They are still teaching cursive in schools.\n\n4 The Coolest Stuff Is Getting Left Out of Textbooks\n\nIn high school, if you wanted me to get an A in chemistry, you would show me a list of steps an experiment required and I'd follow them to the letter and proceed to not give a shit, because I wasn't trying to see what happened when I mixed magnesium with frog butts.

  "latent_11754": "From the outset of his achingly long contract dispute, Dwayne De Rosario was clear about two things.\n\nFirst, that he needed more money to play the game of soccer. And second, that he wanted to earn it playing in Toronto.\n\nHeâs gone now. And, as it turns out, neither of those things mattered as much as getting back at his hometown club.\n\nOn a Tuesday conference call from his new home in New York, De Rosario conceded that, yes, he was determined to get out of Toronto when the club would not give him a raise. More surprisingly, he was so determined that he switched allegiances without benefit of a raise.\n\nâYeah, Iâm still under the same contract as when I left (Toronto FC),â De Rosario said.\n\nUm. So explain to us again why you had to leave?\n\nâI couldnât play unhappy,â De Rosario said. âYou would expect them to keep their hometown boy as comfortable as possible. I didnât sense that.â\n\nAfter banging a drum for weeks about securing his financial future with an extended contract, it now turns out that De Rosario has decamped Canada for what amounts to a year-long trial with the New York Red Bulls. His goal â a designated-player spot and a seven-figure salary next year. If he plays poorly, heâs out of luck. If he blows out a knee, heâll be left without a contract or a future in the game.\n\nThese are precisely the same challenges he faced here.\n\nFinally, this picture is beginning to get a little clearer. This wasnât about whatâs right. It was at least partly about revenge.\n\nHe got it. The club is significantly lessened without him â in both the short and medium terms.\n\nHowever, in leaving under these circumstances, heâs also given Toronto FC something they badly needed â a hate object.\n\nNow De Rosario was never a hateful person. Obfuscatory, sure. But he was always generous with his time and appreciative of the fans. He has (sort of) resisted the urge to lob bombs indiscriminately once out of town.\n\nBut itâs growing daily clearer that De Rosarioâs version of events has always been skewed in favour of De Rosario. He has a bad case of the professional athleteâs most recurrent narrative impediment â torque-itis of the story-ismus.\n\nMLS soccer in Toronto has always been about Toronto. The team exists in a vacuum. Every other weekend, an interchangeable group of anonymous players from another city visit to play here.\n\nIf even the most ardent fans are a little fuzzy about the personnel on other clubs, theyâre even more mystified as to why they should care about them, other than a win versus a loss. The leagueâs milquetoast, letâs-all-be-friends marketing strategy doesnât help.\n\nBut fans in this city (and every other) want a fight. They tried to pick one with Landon Donovan of the L.A. Galaxy â based almost entirely on Donovanâs perfectly reasonable contention that he didnât like playing on FieldTurf. It turns out, they agreed with him. Now BMO Fieldâs got grass, and no one can remember why they hated Donovan in the first place, other than that heâs good.\n\nAfter a few years, supporters have begun to discover that itâs hard to love if youâve got no one to hate.\n\nNow they have their man â Dwayne De Rosario, the former hero who turned his back on his hometown club for spite. Prepare your bile for Oct. 1, when Toronto will be well out of a playoff spot but ready to âwelcomeâ De Rosario and New York to town.\n\nYes, Toronto FC would have been far better with De Rosario. But he deserves some consideration for providing the club with the parting gift of ill-will and a reason to care other than points on the standings table.",

More frequent services, better timetables\n\nAdjusted and new routes to be introduced\n\nTrials of innovations like electric buses, bike racks\n\nPublic transport bus service contracts will expire next year and the Andrews Government has decided to open up 12 of the 13 contracts.\n\nMany of the contracts have been held by the same private operators for decades.\n\nMinister for Public Transport Jacinta Allan said the current arrangement had been restricting Public Transport Victoria's ability to overhaul the system, which has been declining in usage over the past three years.\n\nShe said the primary purpose for the changes was to create better services across metropolitan Melbourne.\n\n\"We have to step through this carefully because some [services] have been in place for a very long time, and those operators provide a really valuable service to those communities,\" she told ABC Radio Melbourne.\n\n\"Other have grown as Melbourne has grown and indeed for some communities, they do not have adequate bus coverage at all.\n\n\"We all want to provide more bus services. The challenge we've got is the contracts, some of which date back decades, are really holding us back.\"\n\nBike racks on buses, electric services flagged\n\nMs Allan said the Government planned to work with the industry to make improvements, and would not necessarily change the operators.\n\nMelbourne's bus network: Carried 122.5 million passengers last financial year\n\nTravelled 113.3 million kilometres\n\nMet punctuality targets 78.8 per cent of the time\n\nServiced 18,296 metropolitan bus stops Source: Source: Public Transport Victoria\n\n\"It's about looking at how we can improve the timetable, look at how we can extend bus services with new routes or adjusted routes,\" Ms Allan said.\n\nShe said the Government would look at how to introduce smaller, more frequent and possibly electric buses.\n\n\"The current arrangements don't give us the flexibility to jump on those innovations,\" she said.\n\n\"Another great example is there's a trial in Moreland and Bendigo of bike racks on buses.\"\n\nCurrent bus routes 'like spaghetti'\n\nThe Public Transport Users Association welcomed the plan, saying Melbourne's buses were too infrequent.\n\nSpokesman Daniel Bowen likened current routes to spaghetti.\n\n\"They do need reform and if the current contracts are a barrier to that then it does make sense to reform them,\" he said.\n\n\"Buses need to run more like trams. They need to run direct routes, frequent all day including weekend and evenings.\"\n\nOn ABC Melbourne's Facebook page, many people said the shunned bus services because they were slow, often late and infrequent.\n\nOne woman wrote: \"In our area, buses only run every one to two hours and the stops are not close enough - if I have to drive to a bus stop, I may as well drive to my destination!\"\n\nMany others agreed, complaining the timetables with connecting services did not match up.\n\n\"When I didn't have a car a couple of weeks ago I was going to use bus services to get my kids from school,\" another woman said.\n\n\"Problem is not one ran directly near the school to my place so I would've needed two services. Getting home 1.5 hours after school finished!\"\n\nMs Allan said there would also be community consultation about the best routes to keep or introduce.\n\n\"Some people love the bus stop at their door, others don't, some want to see the bus going down their street and others don't, so that all has to be part of that next wave [of negotiations],\" she said.\n\nTopics: urban-development-and-planning, community-and-society, states-and-territories, melbourne-3000, vic\n\nFirst posted",

But she fell temporarily. She will rise again. She will stand again,â he told reporters, his voice breaking with emotion.\n\nMalala has become a powerful symbol of resistance to the Talibanâs efforts to deny women education. Public fury in Pakistan over her shooting has put pressure on the military to mount an offensive against the radical Islamist group.\n\nâWhen she fell, Pakistan stood â¦ this is a turning point,â her father said. â[In] Pakistan for the first time â¦ all political parties, the government, the children, the elders, they were crying and praying to God.â\n\n[np-related]\n\nThe Taliban have said they attacked her because she spoke out against the group and praised U.S. President Barack Obama.\n\nA cheerful schoolgirl who wants to become a politician, Malala Yousufzai began speaking out against the Pakistani Taliban when she was 11, around the time when the government had effectively ceded control of the Swat Valley to the militants.\n\nShe has been in critical condition since gunmen shot her in the head and neck as she left school in Swat, northwest of Islamabad.\n\nShe could be at risk of further attack if she went back to Pakistan, where Taliban insurgents have issued more death threats against her and her father since she was shot.\n\nâItâs a miracle for us,â her father said. âShe was in a very bad condition â¦ She is improving with encouraging speed.â\n\nBritish doctors say Malala has every chance of making a good recovery at the special hospital unit, expert in dealing with complex trauma cases.

The demo scenes will be constrained by a time limit, but other scenes will be available if you tap the Amiibo again, Nintendo President Satoru Iwata said in a presentation to Japanese investors. \"We hope that when you tap your Amiibo, the quickly changing game scenes will pleasantly surprise you and make you feel as though you have just exchanged a game cartridge,\" Iwata said.\n\nAmiibo have quickly become a new pillar of Nintendo's business alongside gaming hardware and software, with 5.7 million in worldwide sales by the end of 2014. Nearly two-thirds of those sales have come from North America, Nintendo announced, with Link figures ranking as the most popular in all regions but Australia. In the investors presentation, Iwata reiterated plans to introduce \"card versions\" of Amiibo that could be used to unlock stuff without a figurine.\n\nCertain retailer-exclusive and supply-limited Amiibo have been incredibly hard to find in the US, leading many fans to line up outside stores as new shipments come in. \"As store shelf space is limited, some Amiibo may become standard models while others may be replaced once they sell out,\" Iwata said, adding that figures which are \"indispensable to play a certain game\" will be restocked regularly. Currently, Amiibo figurines can be used to manage upgradeable computer-controlled characters in Super Smash Bros. on the Wii U and new 3DS and to unlock in-game items or outfits in certain Wii U games.\n\nElsewhere in the presentation, Iwata highlighted strong first week sales of the New Nintendo 3DS XL internationally, with about 175,000 sales in the US and 160,000 sales in Europe.",

This is what Iâm dealing with eight to 12 hours a day.â\n\nA former babysitter told â20/20â the couple locked the middle girl in her bedroom for hours and blasted Christian music at the doorway to ward off demons, and she said the Harrises kept the younger girls separated because they believed they could telepathically communicate.\n\nThey even brought a group from Alabama to perform an exorcism over the girls, the former babysitter claimed â although Harris disputes that.\n\nâWe are Southern Baptist,â the lawmaker said. âWe do not do exorcism, Iâll be very clear about that. Period.â\n\nAfter reaching their âwitsâ end,â Harris and his wife used a legal loophole to turn over the foster children to Eric Francis, an employee at their Christian day care, in October 2013.\n\nâWeâve done all this counseling, and nothing is getting better, and I just said, âGod, I canât do it anymore â weâve done everything,â Harris said.\n\nFrancis was later convicted of molesting the middle girl, who had been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, while his wife was out of town.\n\nThe two younger girls now 7 and 5, have been adopted by one family, who spoke to â20/20,â and the oldest girl was adopted by another family and did not participate in the news program.\n\nâThese girls are not monsters, and they donât like that people are calling them monsters,â said Vargas, the anchor.\n\nVargas said the girlsâ first adoptive family and their new family did not experience the same behavior the Harrises claim, but she cautions viewers not to draw conclusions against the couple because âwe canât say what did or did not go on inside that house, because we werenât there.â\n\nShe said reporters and producers gave Harris an opportunity to address claims made by others during the news-gathering operation, but she was irritated that the lawmaker posted a photo on Twitter that gave the impression that â20/20â would vindicate his claims.\n\nâI canât speak for what Justin Harris believed,â Vargas told the Arkansas Times. âWhen I posed for that picture with him â¦ he did not tell me he planned to tweet that picture. That is not something we were particularly pleased with, but that happens. I donât know his motives. He would have to speak to that.â\n\nThe anchor did tell Harris that she had never seen a reaction to any news story quite like the response to the rehoming story.\n\nâIn all of my career of doing stories, many of them very controversial â and we went in and we spent days and days reading and watching all the commentary in response, largely, to your stories, (the Arkansas Times) reporting â I told him, âIâve never in my career seen a story where 100 percent of the comments that I have read thus far are negative â about you, Justin Harris,'â Vargas said. âIt was extraordinary, the backlash.â",

George is a great example of how it is possible to use web technologies, fused with hardware, to deliver new and engaging experiences.\n\nThis article covers the basics of how to get started building for your own IoT devices using JavaScript.\n\nGetting Started\n\nBuilding hardware prototypes and Internet-connected devices has traditionally been something that only electrical engineers would have attempted. This changed with the appearance of development boards such as Arduino UNO, Particle (formerly Spark Core) and Raspberry Pi.\n\nDevelopment boards mimic a motherboard on a computer. They have input and output sockets, such as USB and power, as well as pin boards that allow you to add external components. A microcontroller chip acts as the processor, running the applicationâs code and communicating with the inputs and outputs. This chip is relatively slow, specifically designed to perform simple tasks such as reading sensor data. However, it also has the ability to switch, making it possible to change the power supply of lights, motors and many more components.\n\nA small selection of development boards, in all different shapes and sizes. (View large version)\n\nThe maker movement has been gaining traction in the last few years, and building IoT devices has become big business. This has expanded the market of development boards, and there is now a wide range on offer, each with its own features. Competition has caused many to focus on unique selling points, such as wireless communication (with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips), size and battery life. When architecting your own devices, you will need to consider which physical attributes you require. Likewise, software will also factor into the decision, such as the programming language you can run on the board. Research thoroughly and choose the board that best suits your needs.\n\nIn the examples featured here, weâre using Arduino UNO. This particular development board is probably the most popular on the market because it is very easy to use. If you are just getting started, we would recommend buying a starter kit, something along the line of what is offered by Arduino. It will come with compatible components for your chosen development board and usually a lot of documentation to help you get started.\n\nThe Basics of Electricity and Circuits\n\nAs the name suggests, an electronic circuit is circular. Electrons flow from the positive end of the power source (for example, a battery) around the circuit to the negative end of the same power source.\n\nThe easiest way to understand the physics of what is happening inside an electric circuit is to compare it to a water tank system. Water in a pipe flows just like electrons in a wire. These electrons are what form the electric current that powers the components of the circuit.\n\nA water tank system has the same characteristics as an electric circuit. (View large version)\n\nJust as the amount of water stored in the tank affects the pressure on the tap, the more electrons there are in the power source, the more itâs charged. This is the voltage. The higher the voltage, the more electrical pressure exists between the negative and positive poles, controlling the velocity of the electrons around the circuit.\n\nJust like a volume of water flowing through a pipe, the current of a circuit refers to the number of electrons flowing through the wire. This is important when building a circuit because youâll need to make sure that each component is receiving enough to perform its task. Current is measured in amperes, or amps (A), and can give us information on the amount of electrons used. For example, if a motor consumes 100 milliamperes (mA) and a battery has a capacity of 1000 milliamperes per hour (mAh), then we can run the motor for 10 hours on a single charge.\n\nAs electrons flow through an LED, they light it up. (View large version)\n\nWhen components in a circuit require less current to run than there is in the circuit, they can receive too much power and break. In this situation, resistance needs to be introduced to prevent this from happening. Using our water analogy, the diameter of a pipe will limit the amount of water that can flow through it, just like resistance limits the flow of electrons.\n\nResistors are the components used to reduce current. They vary in the amount of resistance they apply, shown by the colored bands on the outside of the resistor. The different colors represent different numbers, and adding these bands together will reveal the resistance of that particular resistor. (Calculators are available!) The higher the value, the more resistance is applied to the circuit and the less likely you will cause damage to your component. Using Ohmâs law â resistance equals voltage divided by current (or R = V / I ) â you can calculate the exact resistor needed in a circuit.\n\nHello World\n\nWith the basics covered, we can look at a simple example to visualize how it all fits together. We will be undertaking the âHello Worldâ of hardware development: making an LED blink.\n\nAs mentioned, you can use any one of multiple development boards. In this example, we will be using Arduino UNO. We will also be using a Mac running Mac OS X, but all of the examples should also run on Windows.\n\nThe Hardware\n\nYou will need:\n\n1 Ã Arduino UNO\n\n1 Ã solderless breadboard\n\n1 Ã standard LED\n\n1 Ã 220 Ohm resistor\n\n2 Ã jumper cables\n\nAll of the components you will need to build this project. (View large version)\n\nThis includes a few components that havenât yet been mentioned:\n\nJumper cables are used to direct the flow of electrons , just as any wire is used in a circuit.\n\n, just as any wire is used in a circuit. LED is short for light emitting diode, which is essentially a small bulb . It has one long leg and one short leg. The longer leg signifies where the positive flow of the circuit should enter, and the shorter leg the negative output. If you get these the wrong way around, the LED will not light up.\n\n. It has one long leg and one short leg. The longer leg signifies where the positive flow of the circuit should enter, and the shorter leg the negative output. If you get these the wrong way around, the LED will not light up. A solderless breadboard (the white block with holes) is a prototyping tool that allows for the creation of circuits without the need for soldering, making it possible to easily change and correct a circuit, as well as to reuse components. These come in many different shapes and sizes, but all perform the same role.\n\nThe image below shows the flow of current. Components can be used to link sections together, as the LED and resistor do in the following example. On larger breadboards, the outside vertical lines are commonly used for connecting the positive and negative jumper cables to give separation to the circuit that you are designing.\n\nA solderless breadboard showing the flow of current.

This will make things easier when continuing in the next section.\n\nA schematic of the âHello Worldâ exercise. (View large version)\n\nTo start the circuit, connect a jumper wire from pin 10 on the Arduino. This is the point at which the Arduino starts talking to the circuit. You can use any numbered pin from the right side of the Arduino â just make sure your code refers to the correct one.\n\nTo make sure the ideal amount of current flows through the LED, the resistor is needed. Unlike the LED, it doesnât matter which way it is inserted into the circuit.\n\nWhether pin 10 is allowing current through or not (controlled by your code) will determine whether the LED is on or off.\n\nAnother jumper wire then connects to the negative side of the LED and returns to ground to complete the circuit. Simple!\n\nOnce completed, your circuit should look something like the image below. Plug this into your computer via USB. The next task is to set up the Arduino to work with JavaScript.\n\nThis is how your circuit should look when built. (View large version)\n\nBefore writing any software, we need to make sure the Arduino has the correct firmware so that it will work with JavaScript. The firmware essentially exposes an API for the computer, so that the code can interact with the board through the USB port.\n\nDownload and install the integrated development environment (IDE) from the Arduino website. Next open up the IDE, ensuring your Arduino is plugged in via USB.\n\nBefore running anything, you also need to check that you have the correct USB port. Go to âToolsâ â âPort.â The names can differ, so a good rule is to choose a port that has âttyâ and âusbâ in its name on Mac OS X and âCOMâ on Windows.\n\nOnce completed, you can now upload the firmware. Select âFileâ â âExamplesâ â âFirmataâ â âStandard Firmata.â Once done, select âFileâ â âUpload on Macâ (or âSketchâ â âUpload on Windowsâ).\n\nFinding the right firmware can be tricky; this is where you will find it. (View large version)\n\nNow itâs time to write some JavaScript!\n\nThe Software\n\nTo control the LED with JavaScript, we will need to use a library built for Node.js called Johnny-Five. Basically, itâs a library built by the team at Bocoup to make building hardware more accessible to the web community. If you donât know what Node.js is or how to use it, Elliot Bonneville has a great introduction on this very website.\n\nBecause the core of our example uses an Arduino, this library allows our machine to connect to the hardware through the USB port.\n\nTo get started, you will need to have Node.js installed. If itâs not, you can download it from the Node.js website. This will also install Node Package Manager (npm), which we will use to install all of the dependencies for the application. The example is run on a Mac, using Terminal as the command-line tool; however, because Node.js is multi-platform, this can work on any machine.\n\nAll of the code featured in this article is available on GitHub.\n\nTo install all of the dependencies required for this project, you will need to create a package.json file, which can be taken from the code below. This is a shopping list of the libraries required to get the example running. When the install command is initialized, npm will go out and get all of the ingredients needed for everything to run. This file must be in your root folder.\n\n{ \"name\": \"Hardware-Hacking-with-JavaScript\", \"description\": \"Smashing Magazine - Hardware Hacking with JavaScript\", \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"homepage\": \"http://www.james-miller.co.uk/\", \"keywords\": [\"arduino\",\"tutorial\",\"hardware\"], \"author\": { \"name\":\"James Miller & Mate Marschalko\" }, \"repository\": { \"type\": \"git\", \"url\": \"git://github.com/jimhunty/Hardware-Hacking-with-JavaScript.git\" }, \"bugs\": \"https://github.com/jimhunty/Hardware-Hacking-with-JavaScript/issues\", \"license\": \"MIT\", \"dependencies\": { \"johnny-five\": \"^0.9.13\" } }\n\nIn your command-line tool, ensure that you are in the same folder that you created for this example with the package.json file; then, run npm install . If you donât have the permissions to install these packages, use sudo npm install instead.\n\nNow, you need to create the application code to run our example. We have named this file blink-led.js . The comments detail what is going on.\n\n// Johnny-Five is our JavaScript framework for accessing Arduino. var jfive = require(\"johnny-five\"); var board, led; board = new jfive.Board(); // Similar to jQuery, we wait for the board to be ready. board.on(\"ready\", function() { // 10 represents the pin number that the LED is plugged into. led = new jfive.Led(10) // The LED blinks (i.e. turns on and off) every 1000 milliseconds. led.blink(1000); });\n\nFirst, the libraries are loaded, then the variables are initialized. A new Board instance is created using the constructor, and the on ready function will get the board warmed up and ready to receive instructions. Because you plugged the jumper cable that connects to the LED into pin 10, it needs to be defined in the led variable. The blink method is then used to turn the light on and off, in 1-second phases.\n\nYou now have everything you need to get this light show started â crank up the music! Make sure your Arduino is plugged in and the circuit is all set up. In the command line, run node blink-led.js , replacing the file name with whatever you have called your code. You should now have a blinking light.\n\nTry modifying the code to make the light blink faster or slower. Each time you do, you will need to restart your code in the Terminal. You may wish to try led.pulse() ; this will fade the LED in and out, instead of just switching with no transition.\n\nHome Monitoring\n\nAlready youâve learned a lot! Now you can put this knowledge to use and build a simple home-monitoring system, similar to commercial products like Nest and Hive.\n\nThis time, youâre going to be using a temperature sensor, connected to the Arduino from the Node.js server. The temperature will be read by the sensor and fed into a browser that will display the data on a simple web page.\n\nThe pageâs background color reflects the temperature. (View large version)\n\nThe Hardware\n\nYou will need:\n\n1 Ã Arduino UNO\n\n1 Ã solderless breadboard\n\n1 Ã TMP36 temperature sensor\n\n3 Ã jumper cables\n\nThe temperature sensor chosen for this example is available in most starter kits and is incredibly cheap to purchase individually.\n\nComponents needed to build the home-monitoring project. (View large version)\n\nWith the previous LED blink example, you set up the connection between the Node.js server running on the computer and the Arduino. This connection can also be used to read data from sensors connected to the Arduino.\n\nA schematic of the home-monitoring circuit. (View large version)\n\nAbove is the completed circuit. Try to match this pin for pin.\n\nBe careful when handling the temperature sensor because it is easy to get the legs mixed up. The flat side of the component is the front and should be facing towards you as you wire up the sensor. Because each of the three legs has a different purpose, wiring them incorrectly will mean your circuit will not work.\n\nThe analog input pins are the five pins lined up along the left side of the board. The Arduino has both analog and digital pins, both input and output. Digital means there are only two states â on and off (or electric signal and no electrical signal) â and are great for buttons and other binary switches that interpret only two states. Analog input, on the other hand, can represent a range of values, and the analog input pins on the Arduino can measure any voltage between 0 and 5 volts (and produce a 10-bit value of that reading). The temperature reading from the sensor will be returned in a variable resistance measurement that is proportional to the air temperature.\n\nConnect the signal pin in the middle of the sensor to the analog input A0. Connect the left pin to the 5V pin (positive) and the right pin to ground (negative) to complete the circuit.\n\nYour circuit should now look something like the picture above. Next, you need to create a new file to read the temperature sensor. This file will start in the same way as in the previous example, loading the Johnny-Five library, initializing a new board instance and then adding an on ready event listener.\n\nvar jfive = require(\"johnny-five\"); board = new jfive.Board(); board.on(\"ready\", function() { // We create a new sensor instance and define the sensor type and the pin itâs connected to. var tempSensor = new jfive.Thermometer({ controller: \"TMP36\", pin: \"A0\" }); // We add an event listener to the sensor and handle the incoming data. tempSensor.on(\"data\", function() { // The data object also has a fahrenheit property, if thatâs what we are after. console.log(this.celsius + \"Â°C\"); }); });\n\nSave this piece of code as temperature.js , and run it from the console by typing in node temperature.js .\n\nBecause console.log was used in the code, the readings will be outputted to the Terminal for debugging.\n\nTemperature data should start to print out very fast. (View large version)\n\nServers and Sockets\n\nNow you have a working thermometer running in Node.js. This simple example alone opens up a whole range of possibilities if you consider all of the different Node.js modules available to process and use this data. You could save this to a Google Spreadsheet, tweet or write about it, or even stream this data to the browser in real time with WebSockets â which is what you are going to do next!\n\nFlow of data from each device. (View large version)\n\nTo establish the connection with the browser and to stream the sensor data, weâll need to start a Node.js HTTP server to serve our HTML document, and then open the WebSocket connection between them. Starting up a web server in Node.js is relatively simple with the Express library. First, install it from the Terminal:\n\nnpm install --save express\n\nOnce itâs installed, these lines of code will instantiate the server:\n\n// Load libraries and then initialize the server. var app = require('express')(); var http = require('http').Server(app); // When the user requests the root of the page (/), we respond with index.html. app.get('/', function(req, res){ res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html'); }); // We listen for connections on port 3000. http.listen(3000, function(){ console.log('listening on *:3000'); });\n\nSave this as a server.js file.\n\nIn this server code, the first two lines load the required libraries and create an HTTP server instance. Next, simple routing logic serves the index.html file from the projectâs folder when the user requests the root ( / ). Finally, port 3000 listens for connections.\n\nTo test this, create a standard index.html file in the root of the projectâs folder. In the command line, navigate to your projectâs folder and type node server.js . If you then type http://localhost:3000 or the IP address of your machine and the port (for example, http://190.140.0.00:3000 ) in a browser, you should see your standard index.html page. This means your server is all set up.\n\nThis was definitely easier than configuring an Apache server!\n\nBefore merging this piece of code with the temperature.js file, weâre going to set up the WebSocket connection.\n\nA WebSocket makes it possible to open a communication session between the browser and the server. With this API, you can send two-way real-time messages and receive event-driven responses without having to poll for a reply. Socket.IO is the Node.js module that you are going to use to establish and handle this connection. Install Socket.IO just like you installed Express and Johnny-Five:\n\nnpm install --save socket.io\n\nNotice how your package.json file is now updated with Express and Socket.IO under dependencies? This means that whoever wishes to run your application from their machine can simply run npm install , and all of the module dependencies that you loaded will be installed at once. Nice! Now you can add the WebSocket functionality to the working server.js code. Below is the full example:\n\nvar app = require('express')(); var http = require('http').Server(app); // Load the Socket.IO library. var io = require('socket.io')(http); app.get('/', function(req, res){ res.sendfile('index.html'); }); // Establish the WebSocket connection with the browser. io.on('connection', function(socket){ console.log('a user connected'); }); http.listen(3000, function(){ console.log('listening on *:3000'); });\n\nFirst, Socket.IO is loaded, and then an on connection event listener is created. This will be triggered when a user loads the index.html file.\n\nOn the index.html page, the Socket.IO client-side library needs to be initialized in order to talk with the server. To prepare your HTML file for this, add the piece of code below right before the closing body tag:\n\n<script src=\"https://cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.2.0.js\"></script> <script> var socket = io(); </script>\n\nThe connection should now be set up, and you should see the âA user has connectedâ message in the command line upon loading the index page via the localhost link.\n\nNow, you can send messages to the browser from the server with the socket.emit() function. You can do this by replacing the previous function in server.js :\n\nio.on('connection', function(socket){ console.log('a user connected'); socket.emit('Server message', âHello from the server!â); });\n\nThis is how you need to modify index.html to receive the message:\n\n<script src=\"https://cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.2.0.js\"></script> <script> var socket = io(); socket.on('Server messageâ, function (message) { console.log(message); }); </script>\n\nIf youâve done everything correctly, you should see the âHello from the server!â message in your browserâs console. Congratulations! This means you have set up a real-time WebSocket connection between a Node.js HTTP server and a browser!\n\nThis is really quite useful, and not just for this project. A WebSocket connection can be used to communicate between multiple browsers to create chat applications, multiplayer games and much more!\n\nWebSockets enabled! You are now connected. (View large version)\n\nNow itâs time to merge the temperature.js file, which handles communication with the Arduino, with our new WebSocket server code, which is responsible for connecting to the browser.\n\nThis requires extending server.js :\n\nvar app = require('express')(); var http = require('http').Server(app); var io = require('socket.io')(http); var jfive = require(\"johnny-five\"); var board = new jfive.Board(); var board, socket, connected = false; app.get('/', function(req, res){ res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html'); }); io.on('connection', function(s){ console.log('A user has connected'); // Tracking connection connected = true; // Saving this for the board on ready callback function socket = s; }); board.on(\"ready\", function() { console.log('board has connected'); var tempSensor = new jfive.Thermometer({ controller: \"TMP36\", pin: \"A0\" }); tempSensor.on(\"data\", function() { // We send the temperature when the browser is connected. if(connected) socket.emit('Temperature reading', this.celsius); }); }); http.listen(3000, function(){ console.log('listening on *:3000'); });\n\nHere, you have simply copied over from temperature.js the line that loads Johnny-Five and initializes the board, as well as the whole board on ready function.\n\nYouâve also added two new variables: one to keep track of WebSocket connections and another to store the socket instance for other functions to be accessible â in this case, for the board on ready function that uses it to send and receive messages.\n\nNow, the index.html file needs to be updated to handle the data coming through the socket connection Temperature reading . The code below needs to be added to the HTML document within the script elements where the Server message handler previously existed.\n\nsocket.on('Temperature reading', function (message) { console.log(message); });\n\nThe Interface\n\nThe last thing to do is add a few lines of HTML and CSS to index.html to display the temperature reading in a user-friendly way. Youâre also going to update the background color, making it change between blue (cold) and orange (hot), according to the temperature. The HTML is very simple: just one h1 element to hold the number.\n\nThe following needs to be added to the body .\n\n<h1 class=\"temperature\">0ÂºC</h1>\n\nA large thin typeface should work very well with the numbers; try Lato, a free font from the Google Fonts library. Load this in the head section of the document:\n\n<link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:100' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>\n\nThe styling is minimal in this example. The only tricky bit is the way the temperature label is loaded. It grabs the class name with the content CSS property and adds it to the :before pseudo-element.\n\nbody { background-color: hsl(0, 60%, 65%); transition: background-color 1s; } h1 { font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif; font-size: 120px; font-weight: 100; color: white; text-align: center; margin: 60px; } h1:before{ content: attr(class) \":\"; font-size: 22px; position: relative; top: -69px; left: 0; text-transform: uppercase; }\n\nYou are now sending temperature data in real time to your interface. Project complete! (View large version)\n\nThis looks pretty already!\n\nTo finish it off, add a few lines of JavaScript to update the values when receiving the WebSocket message, and to change the background color.\n\n<script src=\"https://cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.2.0.js\"></script> <script> var socket = io(), temperature = document.querySelector(\".temperature\"); socket.on('Temperature reading', function(message) { // Rounding down the decimal values and adding ÂºC temperature.innerHTML = parseInt(message) + \"ÂºC\"; // Calculating the hue for the background color and changing it var hue = 200 - (parseInt(message) * 5); document.body.style.backgroundColor = \"hsl(\" + hue + \", 60%, 65%)\"; }); </script>\n\nYouâre done! The Arduino temperature readings will now show in real time in the browser.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the prospect of building your own hardware can be daunting, hopefully, after working through these two examples, youâre already thinking about the possibilities and planning your next project. Many components are compatible with the Johnny-Five library, meaning that the only limit is your imagination.\n\nResources\n\nâHardware Hacking With JavaScript,â James Miller and Mate Marschalko, GitHub\n\nAll of the code needed for this project\n\nAll of the code needed for this project Johnny-Five, Rick Waldron, GitHub\n\nA âJavaScript robotics programming frameworkâ\n\nA âJavaScript robotics programming frameworkâ Web on Devices, Mate Marschalko\n\nA website on electronics hacking with JavaScript and other web technologies\n\nA website on electronics hacking with JavaScript and other web technologies Make\n\nAn online magazine by Maker Media aimed at makers, offering new projects as well as tips\n\nAn online magazine by Maker Media aimed at makers, offering new projects as well as tips Arduino Experimenterâs Guide for Node.js\n\nMore JavaScript and Arduino projects with Johnny-Five",
  "latent_12478": "Charles Chahwan sitting in front of his bookshelf\n\nWearing thick-rimmed glasses, a hoody, and a leather jacket, his head framed by a chaotic tumbleweed of hair, Charles Chahwan sat in a family-run cafe in Jounieh, a coastal town just north of Beirut.\n\nOn the table, surrounded by a Lebanese meze, was a decent-sized book. Its cover displayed an abstract painting in garish colors of a disheveled, bearded man in underwear, standing beside a cactus and drinking a bottle of beer. A crudely drawn, upside-down stick-person with tits and a vagina also peered out from the cover's right-hand corner.\n\nThe image somewhat resembled Chahwan, perhaps after a particularly heavy night of drinking. However, though it was painted by him, it in fact pays homage to another Charles: Bukowski.\n\nChahwan's translation of 'Women'\n\nChahwan, a 50-year-old Lebanese author, best known in his home country for Harb A-Shawari'a (\"Street Wars\")âa collection of short stories profiling the lives of rival gunmen competing for control of Beirut's streets during the country's 1975â1990 civil warâis the first person to translate American author Charles Bukowski into Arabic. The book on the table is an Arabic-language copy of Bukowski's 1978 novel, Women. Previously, Chahwan has translated works by other 20th-century American literary figures, including Raymond Chandler and Paul Auster, as moonlight projects on the side of a career as a journalist and art and literary critic.\n\nChahwan became interested in Bukowski and writers of the Beat Generation during Lebanon's civil war while studying English literature at a faculty of the Lebanese University in Fanar, a town close to Jounieh.\n\n\"Back then, reading and writing provided me with an escape. I mean, they still do,\" said Chahwan, who penned his first bookâa collection of short poemsâat the age of 18. \"I preferred American literature to British and other European writers. I felt like I could relate to it moreâthe aspirational side.\n\n\"Growing up in the 70s and 80s, the French colonial influence in Lebanon was still strong. Often I would first encounter excerpts from American writers in French magazinesâI think maybe the first time I read Women was in French.\"\n\nAt just over 300 pages, Women is arguably Bukowski's most autobiographical work. It describes, in smutty, matter-of-fact detail, the life of protagonist Henry Chinaskiâa 50-something sexually re-awakened alcoholic writer going through a steady stream of vomiting, women, poetry readings, dog races, quarts of half-water, half-whiskey, the occasional quaalude, and a desire to live to 80 and have promiscuous encounters with 18-year-olds.\n\nThree of Chahwan's books\n\nReleased in Lebanon shortly before Christmas, it has gained a fairly positive reception at book fairs in Beirut and in some of the local Lebanese pressâthe most liberal in the Arab worldâalbeit often as an oddity or point of intrigue. Given its subject matter, the book is unlikely to receive a pan-Arab release. Chahwan, understandably, was aware of such a reality before he undertook the translation.\n\n\"I can't imagine it going down well in the Gulf or Saudi,\" he laughed. \"Saudi channels cut kisses when they show Western films. How can you have a romantic film with the kisses cut? The film won't make sense!\"\n\nTaking, on and off, two years to complete the book, once he was finished and had found a publisher, Chahwan was paid just $2,000 for his work.\n\n\"They're bloody thieves. I get screwed over every time,\" said Chahwan, shaking his head. \" Women is pretty pornographic, so the translation was quite difficultâsome modern Arabic dictionaries don't even have an entry for penis. Conservatism has shrunk the language; I almost had to consult a medieval scientific text.\"\n\nChahwan sitting in front of one of his paintings\n\nIn 2002, a comprehensive study conducted by the United Nations suggested that only 300 books are translated from Western languages into Arabic every year. Greece is said to annually translate five times more books from English than the entire Arab world, a stark contrast to the reams of literary translations during the reign of the Umayyad Caliph al Ma'mun, in the ninth century.\n\nDuring that era, al Ma'mun founded an unrivaled school of learning in Baghdad known as Bayt al Hikma (House of Wisdom), which was home to a translation center marked by a vociferous appetite to translate the intellectual traditions of conquered foes. Among many of its achievements, it's partly through the endeavors of Bayt al Hikma that the foundations of modern science were established and the philosophical legacy of Aristotle and Plato rediscovered by the West.\n\n\"It's a shame that more books are not translated into Arabic. Maybe if some of these guys from Daesh [the Islamic State] read Bukowski they would enjoy it and not go to war,\" said Chahwan, smiling. \"I don't know. Maybe it would make some even more angry. These people are a nightmareâthere was nothing comparable to them here during the [civil] war.\"\n\nDuring the 80s, Jouniehâknown for its casino, cobbled high street, and nightclubsâremained relatively conflict-free compared with other parts of Lebanon. However, Chahwan did, on a number of occasions, incur the wrath of the Lebanese Forces (LF), a Christian militia that came to control the area.\n\n\"The first time it was over a girl I had dated that an LF member wanted to marry,\" recalled Chahwan. \"They basically parked a car full of armed men outside my house for a week to intimidate me out of seeing her again.\"\n\nThe tactic worked.\n\n\"Shame. She was a nice girl,\" said Chahwan.\n\nOne of Chahwan's paintings\n\n\"Another time they accused me of sacrilege for this short story I published in a local leftist magazine. They took offense to a metaphor I wrote describing Jesus in the form of a blond woman in a Ferrari,\" he told me. \"It was called 'Jazz in Solitude.' That time I didn't leave the house for two weeks. They were really after me.\"\n\nThe relative dearth in translations of Western literature into Arabic is often attributed to religious conservatism and low literacy rates in the MENA region. The theory holds that this then leads to a focus on religious texts, written in Arabic. But in Lebanon, a large cross-section of the population is competent in both English and French.\n\n\"Most kids write text messages in [Lebanese] Arabic using the Latin script. In schools, they don't teach the children how to write proficiently in Arabic,\" said Chahwan, touching upon the difference between Arabic dialects (which differ from country to country, region to region) and written Arabic, which comes in a largely uniform style across the Arab world.\n\n\"It's sad that this connection with written Arabic is being lost. But speaking and writing in English and French creates opportunities to leave and establish better careers elsewhere. This has been happening since even before the civil war. It's also part of what makes Lebanon a bit different to other countries around here,\" reflected Chahwan.\n\n\"I mean, at least here in Lebanon people can buy my Bukowski translation,\" he added. \"If you want, I can say I translated Bukowski as a counter-attack to ISIS â [that] I'm fighting against these kinds of mentalities. But really, I did it because I like Bukowski. If I were doing it for the money then I'd be an idiot, because there's no money in it.\"\n\nFollow Martin Armstrong on Twitter.",

While the Bills and Bucs don't match the pace of those record-holders, a pair of bad weeks with multiple replacement players could put either over the top.\n\nTampa Bay currently leads the league with 134 penalties, two ahead of Buffalo. 9.6 penalties per game would put the Buccaneers at 153 accepted penalties, to fall short of the record. With Buffalo putting up 17 penalties against the Giants and 15 a week ago against the Eagles, the record is still in reach for Rex Ryan's club with another ugly game or two.\n\nIn terms of penalty yardage, the Bills have averaged more than 80 yards per game in accepted penalties, which puts them on pace for just over 1,300 yards, a football field from the record. The most yards they've surrendered via flags was 140 against New England and 135 against the Giants. Two outings like that pair would put them over the top.",

The Belgian parts of the village are called Baarle-Hertog and the Dutch elements are called Baarle-Nassau. The Belgian part includes 16 exclaves within Dutch territory. The exclaves, in turn, surround seven Dutch areas. Belgian territory also surrounds an eighth Dutch area near Ginhoven. In 1995 the border was finalized to include a formerly neutral grassland. This village contains three quadripoints.\n\nThe line of the border means that some buildings straddle both countries. This is the case for a branch of Zeeman. For these properties, the voordeurregel (literally: \"front door rule\") policy applies: their address lies in the country that contains their front door. The exception is a house on Loveren street with both Belgian (#2) and Dutch (#19) front doors. For convenience, every house number plaque shows a flag.\n\nToponymy [ edit ]\n\nThere are various theories about the origin of the name \"Baarle\" (referred to in old sources as Barle or Barlo). The last part certainly originates from the -loo suffix, which means forest on sandy ground, next to a settlement. The first part could be interpreted as:\n\nbaar : a bare, flat or uncultivated land [1]\n\n: a bare, flat or uncultivated land barza : Proto-Germanic word for softwood.\n\n: Proto-Germanic word for softwood. Baro or Bera, an old first name.[2]\n\nThe suffixes Hertog and Nassau refer respectively to the Hertog (Duke) of Brabant and the House of Nassau which held the Lordship of Breda.\n\nThe name of the Tommel hamlet has its origins in the Latin word tumulus, meaning Tumulus and there are a number of prehistoric tumuli in the vicinity. Urns have also been found around Tommel, evidence that this area has been inhabited since the Bronze Age.\n\nAdministration [ edit ]\n\nDuring the twelfth century the area was marshland. In 1198, Henry I, Duke of Brabant made over some of the land to Godfried of Schoten, the Lord of Breda. Hendrick kept the lands that were paying him a rent.[3] The area that Hendrick kept is now part of Belgium. The area that was given to Gotfried is now in the Netherlands. The title \"Lord of Breda\" is now held by Willem-Alexander, king of the Netherlands.[4] The title \"Duke of Brabant\" is now a courtesy title of the heir to the Belgian throne.[5]\n\nBaarle-Hertog and Baarle-Nassau each have a burgemeester (mayor). Each town has its own elected town council and each has a police station. Each town has its own church. In some areas the two town councils can cooperate. They have set up a joint council to look after things like electricity, water and gas supplies, highway maintenance and refuse collection.[6] The border was only finally defined in 1995.\n\nBoth councils also fund a joint cultural centre that houses a combined library. The cultural centre has two official entrances. The international border passes through the building. The Dutch entrance is at 7 Pastoor de Katerstraat. The Belgian entrance is at 5 Pastoor de Katerstraat. The tourist office is affiliated to both the Dutch and the Belgian tourist boards.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nDutch trading law applies to the Dutch parts of the town. Belgian trading laws apply to the Belgian parts of the town. Differences in the laws have long encouraged smuggling, but European integration, especially since 1993, has made it much less relevant. After the Second World War many people smuggled butter from the Netherlands into Belgium.[7]:9 In modern times many people still buy fireworks in Belgium and smuggle them into the Netherlands.[8]\n\nCafÃ© in Baarle-Nassau (Netherlands), on the border with Belgium. The border is marked on the pavement.\n\nEconomy [ edit ]\n\nThe areas of Baarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertog are essentially agrarian in character, although there is some industrial activity. The complex situation led to smuggling becoming a significant source of income in this area. The middle class also profited from the exceptional situation. There is an expensive and busy selection of shops. There are also numerous parks in the vicinity.\n\nAs predicted, the population of Baarle, for the first decade of the 21st century, shows a downward trend.\n\nGeography [ edit ]\n\nBaarle contains, alongside broad agricultural settlements, a number of natural areas. Merkshe in the south is a beautiful stream valley and the Hollandse Bossen (Dutch Forests) in the west form an estate. Bels Lijntje, a former railway line, is now a bicycle path for tourists that runs from Riel to Turnhout.\n\nUtilities [ edit ]\n\nElectricity [ edit ]\n\nThe power grid has been set up redundantly.\n\nIn Baarle-Hertog and Zondereigen the electricity is delivered by Eandis nl]\n\nIn Baarle-Nassau and her parish Ulicoten the power is provided by TenneT from the Netherlands. The village of CastelrÃ© is powered by Eandis in Belgium\n\nCable (radio, television and internet) [ edit ]\n\nUntil August 26, 2012, the Flemish company Telenet provided both Dutch and Flemish television to Baarle. Since August 26, 2012, Telenet may not offer more services to the Dutch section of Baarle, because the cable, which belongs to Eandis, was bought out by the Dutch company Reggefiber. They have locked the cable distribution and provides fiber to the Dutch network. That means that the Dutch area of Baarle is now serviced by Dutch providers (such as KPN, Tele2 and Telfort) can provide service, but Flemish providers can no longer be used (such as receivers of Flemish commercial broadcasters, for example VTM).\n\nIn the Belgian area of Baarle there have been few changes. Telenet continues to offer service to the area, the Dutch commercial broadcasters (such as RTL 4) have removed the analogue cable offerings and these stations only provide digital reception. These are only available through cable (and thus through Telenet); other Belgian providers of radio, TV and internet are accessed via ADSL. They have no Dutch commercial broadcasters included within their package.\n\nGas [ edit ]\n\nEnexis (from the Netherlands)\n\nWater [ edit ]\n\nBrabant Water (From the Netherlands)\n\nWaste disposal [ edit ]\n\nMany streets are visited by a rubbish collector twice per week (1Ã Dutch, 1Ã Belgian). The recycling centre on Smederijstraat can be used by the whole population of Baarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertog.\n\nPost [ edit ]\n\nThe mail is delivered by PostNL in the Dutch area and bpost in the Belgian area.\n\nTelephone [ edit ]\n\nThe telephone network is redundantly served by KPN and Belgacom, but with a special condition: calls between Baarle-Hertog and Baarle-Nassau are available at local rates. Also, every GSM provider from the Netherlands and Belgium is available.\n\nShopping [ edit ]\n\nDue to legislation, there is an erotic video store in Baarle-Nassau and a fireworks store in Baarle-Hertog which is open the entire year. In Baarle there is Sunday shopping every week. This is a result of the fact that the stores can always be open on Sunday in Belgium and that, in Baarle-Nassau, many rely on the tourist attractions resulting from its enclave status.\n\nEmergency services [ edit ]\n\nThe police of Baarle-Hertog and Baarle-Nassau are located within the same office on the Parallelweg in Baarle-Hertog and are locally established. The local police officer of Baarle is sometimes called the 'Dirco'.\n\nThe fire services of Baarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertog merged into a single body on 1 January 2010. The joint fire service is formed by Dutch and Belgian volunteers and the station is located at C.A. Bodestraat 2 in Baarle-Nassau.\n\nPublic transport [ edit ]\n\nTraffic [ edit ]\n\nA VanHool bus in Baarle-Nassau on line 460 to Turnhout\n\nThe village of Baarle is easily accessible by car via the two Dutch provincial roads N260, N639 and the Belgian regional road N119. The highways A58 in the Netherlands, E19 and E34 in Belgium also run near the village.\n\nBus [ edit ]\n\nLines from De Lijn:\n\nLijn 458 (Poppel - Hoogstraten)\n\nLijn 459 (Turnhout - Hoogstraten)\n\nLijn 460 (Turnhout - Baarle)\n\nLines from Arriva:\n\nLijn 132 (Tilburg - Breda)\n\nRail [ edit ]\n\nBaarle had two huge railway stations straddling the border, Baarle Grens and Weelde Station. The railway was established in 1867 and closed on 7 October 1934, running from spoorlijn Tilburg - Turnhout.\n\nThis line has now been converted into a 31-kilometre-long cycle path called \"Het Bels Lijntje\", that links the two villages.\n\nEducation [ edit ]\n\nBaarle-Hertog has two schools: De Vlinder and De Horizon.[9]\n\nBaarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertog have a joint library with Belgian and Dutch staff.[10]\n\nActivities [ edit ]\n\nBaarle has several clubs and societies. Some have both Belgian and Dutch counterparts: for example, the football clubs of Gloria US (Netherlands) and KVV Dosko (Belgium). In other cases there is only one club in Baarle. They include:\n\nHarmonie Sint Remi\n\nStichting Jeugdwerk Baarle\n\nHeemkundekring Amalia van Solms\n\nDe Baarlese Beeldhouwclub\n\nKarnavalsvereniging De Grenszuukers\n\nMedia [ edit ]\n\nWebsite [ edit ]\n\nBoth villages have a community website that can be accessed through both baarle-nassau.nl and baarle-hertog.be . By using European subsidies for border projects, the first community website opened on 30 March 2002. The website was taken down in 2004, after a Dutch opinion poll found that baarle-nassau.nl/baarle-hertog.be was one of the worst municipal websites. A new community website opened on 8 July 2005. At the time of writing this article (2012), each of the two Baarles has a different website.\n\nRadio and television [ edit ]\n\nThe village of Baarle has its own local broadcasting, Baarle's local broadcasting, also known as Stille Genieter. In addition, there are still a number of regional broadcasters that are received in Baarle, Omroep Brabant (In Baarle-Hertog one receives digital TV via Telenet) and RTV (only available in the Belgian area).\n\nNewspapers and magazines [ edit ]\n\nThe regional newspapers in Baarle are BN/De Stem, Brabants Dagblad and Gazet van Antwerpen. Baarle also has a weekly newspaper, Ons Weekblad.\n\nNeighbouring villages [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",
  "latent_12656": "Photo\n\nOne of the most sobering realities of climate change is that even if all greenhouse gas emissions came to an abrupt halt tomorrow, climbing temperatures, rising seas and extreme weather would still be in the global forecast for perhaps hundreds of years because of the carbon dioxide already released into the atmosphere.\n\nTo get some perspective, the story of the ozone hole over Antarctica illustrates how even a relatively small perturbation in the atmosphere can have wide-reaching and long-lasting consequences.\n\nInternational action was taken within just two years of the discovery of the patch of thinning ozone in 1985 to put an end to the release of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs â an organic compound that was used in refrigerants and aerosols and is the main culprit in ozone depletion. But scientists are still discovering the rippling effects of that CFC pollution decades later.\n\nTwo papers published online on Thursday in the journal Science highlight how the hole in the ozone layer, which is beginning to recover because of limits imposed on CFCs, is influencing major wind patterns, ocean circulation, concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere and even rainfall in the Amazon.\n\nSukyoung Lee and Steven Feldstein, professors at Penn State, provide evidence that the depletion of the ozone layer, even more than greenhouse gas emissions, is contributing to the observed movement of the southern jet stream toward the pole. This leads, among other effects, to unusual rainfall patterns in the subtropics.\n\nJust how the hole in the ozone causes a shift in the southern jet stream is not well understood. Generally speaking, however, ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation and therefore warms the atmosphere.\n\nA decline in ozone therefore leads to less absorption and less heating, which cools the polar lower stratosphere. This has an impact on the winds in the troposphere â the lowest 10 kilometers, or six miles, of the atmosphere.\n\nIn the same issue of Science, Darryn Waugh, a climate scientist at Johns Hopkins University, and colleagues present research showing that the hole in the ozone layer and its effects on wind patterns are in turn amplifying ocean currents that move surface water from the pole deeper into the ocean. As the water moves toward the Equator, it brings water from deep in the ocean up to the surface at the pole.\n\nDr. Waugh tracked concentrations of CFC-12 to determine how recently water had been at the oceanâs surface.\n\nâThe water from deep in the ocean may not have seen the surface for hundreds of years,â Dr. Waugh said. âThis âoldâ water is very carbon-rich, from dead organic matter that sinks to the bottom of the ocean.â\n\nWhen water that is already high in carbon dioxide is pulled to the surface, the ocean in this area absorbs less carbon\n\nâIs it good? Is it bad? I guess that depends whether you care more about preventing ocean acidification or reducing atmospheric carbon,â Dr. Waugh said. âProbably we should care about both. What is certain is that itâs having a significant impact on the carbon cycle.â\n\nAround 40 percent of the absorption of carbon into the ocean has been thought to occur at the high southern latitudes, he noted, which makes this significant.\n\nLast winter, the ozone hole was smaller than it had been for a long time. It may fully recover by 2060.\n\nBut the studies underline how even the quick international response to the threat back in the 1980s could not prevent decades of damage from continuing to unfold.",

See all of our year ahead stories here.\n\nââ\n\nThe Department of Education has its sights set on regulatory reform in 2018. Led by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who often speaks out against what she calls a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to education, the department is focused on reviewing rules and requirements issued by previous administrations, seeking to curb what she says is federal overreach.\n\nThat review will involve further consideration of the Obama administration's Title IX guidelines on how campuses should handle sexual assault, which DeVos rescinded to the applause of many observers on both the Left and Right in September. A department source told the Washington Examiner they are working to have the draft rule out by March.\n\nThe source summarized the department's broader goal as \"reducing overreach the department has engaged in in the past,\" in an effort to \"[free] up educators and administrators and institutions to actually serve students rather than be more worried about compliance.\"\n\nOther priorities for DeVos will involve a further review of a gainful employment rule that proponents say protects students at for-profit colleges but which DeVos calls \"overly burdensome.\" The department also is reviewing borrower defense regulations, which establish when a student is eligible for federal relief given to students who have been defrauded by their schools.\n\nOn the K-12 level, a possible two-year delay of the \"significant disproportionality\" rule will likely be opened up for comment as well. The rule is a requirement that states note \"when districts â¦ discipline children from any racial or ethnic group at markedly higher rates than their peers.\"\n\nLooking ahead to next year, press secretary Liz Hill told the Washington Examiner that the departmentâs \"Regulatory Reform Task Force will continue its scrutiny of regulations and significant guidance during 2018.\"\n\nHill pointed specifically to Title IX's college sexual assault provisions and Every Student Succeeds Act guidelines as areas of focus. \"The department recently announced in its fall 2017 Uniform Regulatory and Deregulatory Agenda a number of initiatives that will occur in the coming year, such as rescinding K12 regulations that do not comply with ESSA and proposing a rule on Title IX that corrects the deficiencies of Obama-era guidance.\" Under ESSA, the successor to No Child Left Behind, the federal government's regulatory hands have been tied in many ways, creating a devolution in education regulatory power to the state level.\n\nAs for school choice, the only federal action is likely to be implementing the expansion of 529 college savings accounts to include K-12 public and private school expenses. That expansion, part of the GOP tax reform bill, originally included homeschool expenses, but a Senate parliamentarian ruling ended that.\n\nDeVos praised the expansion, but said it âdoesn't address the needs of parents who are from lower incomes.â DeVos is a proud supporter of school choice, but itâs not clear what federal action she would take on the issue, aside from using her bully pulpit to support legislative action at the state and federal levels.\n\nCongressional action on school choice could include an expansion of the District of Columbia's school voucher program, education savings accounts for military families, or a tax credit for organizations that give out private school scholarships, but itâs tough to see those as a priority for a Congress that already has a lot on its plate.\n\nâ¢ Jason Russell contributed to this report.",

  "latent_13767": "I received a nice email from an SMO enthusiast this week.\n\nHello!\n\nJust a quick note to say that I enjoy reading your column. I know you said it may be the MMO, and now here we are at TEO (Tuesday evening optimist)...:-). Any chance you'll be writing an article for last week's game?\n\nThanks for your articles...\n\nNichole\n\nNichole - to be honest - I was planning on sitting this one out because Texas football took my fragile little heart and stomped on it last weekend.\n\nBut to see my readers out there begging for content - I realized I canât let them down the same way Texas football has let me down. Someone has to be here reminding fans that itâs not all bad - even when you lose by double digits to Maryland â the Big Tenâs recent basketball addition â at home on opening weekend.\n\nEXTREMELY OPTIMISTIC - Texas overs the rest of the season\n\nVance Bedford. Charlie Strong. Todd Orlando. Chuck Noll. Tom Landry. It doesnât matter who is calling plays on the defensive side anymore - Texas is giving up points, baby.\n\nFor a unit that returned a majority of its starters this season, the Texas defense looked like hot garbage. Excluding one defensive touchdown in the first minute of the game, the Longhorns were pretty much unreliable the rest of the contest. Texas gave up nearly 500 yards (482) and 51 points to a team that averaged 377 and 25 points/game last season - playing with a quarterback in his first start who many believed did not know how to correctly throw a football.\n\nWhen Texasâ offense was able to get the game within three points twice in the second half, the Longhorns defense simply couldnât stop the Terrapins from extending the lead back to 10. It was an absolutely atrocious performance from a defense made up of veterans.\n\nThe over/under last week was 56.5. Total points scored was 92. Go ahead and mash those overs for the rest of the season because this Texas defense isnât stopping anybody.\n\nSMO prediction: Havenât seen an over/under on this weekâs game but I am going to guess itâs in the low 60s and you can put your life savings on that over.\n\nEXTREMELY OPTIMISTIC - Ticket prices\n\nFolks, if youâre in the market for an affordable Saturday family activity, might I suggest an afternoon at DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium?\n\nAccording to Kirk Bohls of the Austin American-Statesman, Texas has 13,000 available tickets for this weekendâs home contest against San Jose State. The powers that be are doing their best to unload those before kickoff this weekend - even offering up free tickets to people affected by Hurricane Harvey. Cynical translation: Texas is expecting a lot of empty seats.\n\nFormer Texas coach Mack Brown used to preach that losing the season opener is unacceptable because it lets âtoo much air out of the bagâ on the rest of the season. Well, the air is out of the bag. Texas fans are not going to show up in 100 degree heat to watch San Jose Stateâs freshman quarterback kick off his Heisman campaign.\n\nSMO prediction: You can get a family of four into the game this Saturday for $15 a head.\n\nEXTREMELY OPTIMISTIC - Schadenfreude\n\nTexas is not good. Thatâs the bad news.\n\nThe good news is that Texas A&M and Baylor are bad as well. And what is more fun than watching your favorite team - considered by some to be a dark horse for the college football playoff - get throttled by a Big Ten bottom dweller at home? Watching your old pal A&M blow a 34-point third quarter lead on the road at UCLA only 24 hours after the imposing Liberty Flames marched into Waco and embarrassed Baylor, 48-45.\n\nIf youâre looking for small football victories this season, consider basking in the misery of another fan base.\n\nSMO prediction: UTSA beats Baylor at McLane Stadium this weekend.\n\nEXTREMELY OPTIMISTIC - Reggie Hemphill-Mapps\n\nNot everything about Texas football was unwatchable Saturday. Redshirt freshman wide receiver Reggie Hemphill-Mapps was a fun little bright spot that should have Texas fans excited for his future.\n\nHemphill-Mapps pulled in seven receptions for 69 yards against Maryland. Additionally, the Texas newcomer returned a punt 91 yards for a touchdown in the second half - the only exciting moment of the final 30 minutes and the first punt return for a Longhorn since 2015.\n\nFirst college touchdown , thanks to my brothers and my city Houstonâ¤ï¸ #HookEm pic.twitter.com/vtWC0amaeY â Houston Prodigyâï¸ (@ReggieHemphill) September 3, 2017\n\nThat return brought Texas within a field goal - filling Texas fans with hope before the Texas defense immediately relinquished another seven points to the masterfully proficient Maryland offense.\n\nGREENVILLE PAT\n\nLetâs check in with South Carolina fan and BONâs resident gambling expert Greenville Pat for his take on Texas football and his five picks for Week Two:\n\nâThe Maryland loss doesnât matter. Texas is still winning the Big 12 and this will be a funny afterthought on the Longhornsâ 2017 national championship campaign. This is Clemsonâs loss to Pitt last year. The fairy dust has been sprinkled. Texas wins by three scores MINIMUM.\n\nTexas 55, San Jose State 21.â\n\nPATâS PICKS (2-3)\n\nNotre Dame -4 v. Georgia\n\nWashington State -10 v.

Well, 2-1 is still on the table - and thatâs where Texas will be after three games in the UPDATED FULL SEASON SMO PREDICTION.\n\nMaryland (scrimmage) - SCORE WAS NOT RECORDED\n\nSAN JOSE STATE - WIN\n\n@USC - WIN\n\n@IOWA STATE - THIS IS MOST DEFINITELY A L***\n\nKANSAS STATE - WIN\n\nOKLAHOMA - WIN\n\nOKLAHOMA STATE - WIN\n\nBAYLOR - WIN\n\n@TCU - WIN\n\nKANSAS - TOSS UP\n\n@WEST VIRGINIA - WIN\n\nTEXAS TECH - WIN\n\nâTexas is back, folks.â",
  "latent_13803": "Geri Walton has long been interested in history and fascinated by the stories of people from the 1700 and 1800s. This led her to study for a degree in History and resulted in her website, Geri Walton: unique histories from the 18th and 19th centuries which offers unique history stories from the 1700 and 1800s.\n\nGeriâs first book, Marie Antoinetteâs Confidante: The Rise and Fall of the Princesse de Lamballe, is due to be released by Pen & Sword in October 2016. It looks at the relationship between Marie Antoinette and the Princesse de Lamballe, and among the people mentioned in the book is Madame de Genlis.\n\nYou can find Geri on Facebook, Twitter (@18thcand19thc, Google Plus, Instagram (@18thcand19thc), and Pinterest.\n\nFrom an early age, StÃ©phanie FÃ©licitÃ© du Crest de Saint-Aubin was a forward thinker intrigued by learning and education. She was also a harp prodigy whose wittiness and capabilities were noticed by Charles-Alexis BrÃ»lart, Comte de Genlis (afterwards Marquis de Sillery). He was âstruck with the style of a letter which accidentally fell in his way, [and] conceived so high a sentiment of admiration for the writer, that he immediately made her an offer of marriage [without having met her].â Thus, at the tender age of 16, StÃ©phanie became Madame de Genlis.\n\nBecause of her wittiness and skills, Madame de Genlis found herself employed by the Duchess of Chartres as a lady-in-waiting, but it was her education of her own children that caught the eye of the Duchessâs husband, the Duke of Chartres. Later, he was also captivated by her sexuality, and the two enjoyed a brief love affair. While working as a lady-in-waiting, Madame de Genlisâs first writings included âmoral and entertaining dramatic pieces, which her children performed in the presence of the duchess of Chartres [after 1766].â Madame de Genlis later published these plays (between 1779 and 1780) under the title of âTheatre for the Use of Young persons, or Theatre of Educationâ.\n\nAfter Madame de Genlis and the Duke ended their affair, Madame de Genlis continued to have a power over him and that is likely part of the reason why the Duke involved her in his childrenâs education. Later, in 1781, the Duke went a step further and boldly declared her gouverneur (not governess) of his sons. At the time a gouverneur was a position held only by a man and the appointment created a scandal: Rumours flew that Madame de Genlis and the Duke were having an affair, although by this time their affair was over. Moreover, with her new appointment, Madame de Genlis was unwilling to share power and was reputedly so dictatorial in how and what the children should learn that all the other tutors resigned.\n\nAs gouverneur, Madame de Genlis instituted teaching techniques that were unusual and forward-thinking for the times. For example, history was taught with the help of slides using an early image projector called a magic lantern, and botany studies were conducted by a real botanist while the children went out for their daily walk. Madame de Genlis also believed her students should be self-reliant, sleep on hard beds, and get plenty of exercise. In fact once she reportedly put lead in the boots of Louis-Philippe, the boy who would grow up to be Louis Philippe I (King of France from 1830 to 1848), and made him walk for miles.\n\nMadame de Genlis was reputedly also a strict taskmaster when it came to learning and education. Her studentsâ activities began as early as 6.30 in the morning, and the children were kept busy all day. Subjects the children studied included literature, mythology, mathematics, chemistry, geography, physics, and anatomy. Foreign languages were also greatly emphasized, and the children practiced them regularly learning Italian from the chambermaid, German from the gardener, and English from the valet. Yet despite her strictness, her students adored her and sweetly called her âBonne Amieâ or âMaman Genlisâ.\n\nMadame de Genlis also provided plenty of first-hand experiences and hands-on lessons for her pupils. Field trips were an important part of her curriculum. This resulted in the children visiting a variety of places that included factories, artist studios, and furniture manufacturers. The children also took numerous educational vacations to places such as Normandy, Chantilly, or Spa. Moreover, after the attack by revolutionaries on the Bastille, she took the children to visit the infamous site.\n\nFrom the garden terrace of her friend Beaumarchais, Mme de Genlis, surrounded by her pupils, watched âmen, women, and children working with unprecedented ardourâ at the demolition of the fortressâ¦And she shared the joy of the destroyers at the fall of the fortress, on which, so she said, she had never been able to look without a shudder, remembering the arbitrary imprisonments within its walls.\n\nThe childrenâs religious instructions were also not neglected. Madame de Genlis read the Bible to the children faithfully for an hour a day, and when Louis-Philippe was slated to receive his first communion, she undertook to prepare himself for the event. To prepare him, however, she stepped on toes and her pushiness was âvociferously protested by the chaplain, lâabbÃ© Guoyt, and seen by many othersâ¦as an arrogant usurpation of his theological function.â\n\nOver the years, if Madame de Genlis was said to have one outstanding talent, it would have been writing. She was a prolific writer, and one person noted she loved it so much âshe would have invented the inkstandâ¦ if the inkstand had been uninvented.â It was said of her that her pieces were diverse enough to be enjoyed by princes or lackeys and that she âessayed almost every style, from the fugitive piece to the bulky alphabetical compilation, from the roman-poeme to the treatise on domestic economy and the collection of receipts for the kitchen.â\n\nMadame de Genlisâs husband was guillotined in 1792, and although Madame de Genlis favored the French Revolution, she sought safety in Switzerland after the fall of the Girondins in 1793. At this time most her students had grown, and she spent much of her time writing and producing historical novels. In 1814, her ability to write became more important than ever after Louis XVIII discontinued her pension. There was also one other sad note. Her old pupil Louis-Philippe, who had been so enamored with her when he was young, now rarely visited her. However, she did see him crowned King of the French on 9 August 1830, four months before she died on 31 December 1830 at the age of seventy-six.",
  "latent_13826": "A lot of ballparks have colorful vendors. Weâve talked about the Spring Training/Diamondbacksâ vendor who does the âLemonade, lemonade like grandma made!â thing in the past. The Tigers used to have a hot dog guy who sang opera as he vended. Thereâs a âBeer Pirateâ in Pittsburgh. The list goes on and on, with many of them featured over at MLB.com in this article last year.\n\nOne of the vendors featured there was the âPistachio Girlâ of Citizens Bank Park. Her name is Emily Youcis and sheâs popped up in the fringes of sports news a few times. Iâve not been to a game at Citizenâs Bank Park, but Iâve heard people talk about her. Sheâs a lot like any of these other colorful vendors. Some people love her, some people are somewhat annoyed. She doesnât even sell pistachios anymore because the Phillies discontinued them so she hawks Cracker Jack. Life goes on. Either way, she came in second in the MLB.com poll for top vendor. Check her out in action:\n\nDespite it not being baseball season, sheâs in the news today. Seems that, however colorful her vending style is, she has a favorite color: white. And that led to some difficulties for her over the weekend. From Philly.com:\n\nShe was an observer of the conference, not an attendee, but she tells Will Bunch of the Philadelphia Daily News that âsheâs been in thrall with the so-called âalt-rightâ movement for about 10 months.â Which she calls âa white identity movement.â She said âThis doesnât mean that we hate anybody â we simply want to find our own identity as Americans â¦ as white Americans, and find our own culture.â\n\nNot everyone considers âwhite identity movementsâ to be simple searches for identity, and thus you may not be surprised to learn that there were protests of the conference. The protests got ugly and Youcis got spray paint sprayed on her hair. Others suffered minor injuries which is unfortunate, no matter what ideology one harbors. One may protest whatever one desires as vehemently as one desires, but one hopes the line is drawn at physical violence.\n\nOne does wonder, however, how her Cracker Jack sales are going to go next summer given her newfound notoriety. Because, no matter what the headlines are saying about it lately, white nationalism is not exactly a super popular ideology.\n\nFollow @craigcalcaterra",

We rejoice when a new kind of cotton is grown and when strawberries bloom in Israelâ â Golda Meir\n\nIsraelis tend to think the United Nations preoccupies itself with classic political issues, but the reality is different. On taking office, Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, declared his priority would be promoting worldwide sustainable development.\n\nLast month, in Brazil, the Rio+20 Conference met to discuss sustainable development. The conference attracted over 100 heads of state and 50,000 participants. For Israel the conference was a considerable success.âSustainable developmentâ is economic growth in which resource use aims to meet human needs, while preserving the environment so these needs can be met for generations to come.Israelâs success at Rio+20 was not guaranteed. The Syrian government tried to ban two Israeli environmental organizations from participating â the JNF and Life and Environment (an organization representing 130 Israeli environmental NGOs). At the very time the Syrian regime is slaughtering its own people, it has time to launch a diplomatic attack on Israel. A worldwide Israeli diplomatic campaign ensured that the Syrian ploy failed.The Palestinians failed to have their status upgraded at the conference to that of a full-state member. Unfortunately Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki chose to use his speech as a platform to attack Israel rather than talking about cooperation and the environment.The Israeli delegation came to Rio+20 with a vision of sustainable development for the world. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, in his greetings, said that Israel is a country that manages to âdo more with less,â and in the future expects to do even more with much less.Israelâs ability to do more with less and successes in sustainable development have brought international recognition, causing a number of UN and international figures to describe Israel as a âsustainability superpower.âDr. Daniel Hillel from Israel was recently awarded the World Food Prize for pioneering an innovative way of bringing water to crops in arid and dry-land regions. CNN selected Yosef Abramowitz, founder of the Arava Power Company, as one of six world leading âgreen pioneers.âIn 2008, Time magazine named Shai Agassi, the founder of Better Place, the company responsible for introducing the electric car, as one of the âenvironmental heroesâ of the year.In a further sign of international recognition, the head of the Israeli delegation to Rio +20, Environmental Protection Minister Gilad Erdan, was elected vice chairman of the Conference.In his meetings with colleagues from around the world, many expressed a desire to increase partnership with Israel, mainly in water management.This is hardly surprising: Israel is the worldâs leader in water re-use and recycling. Israel treats and recycles 80 percent of effluent water for agriculture. There are 35 desalination facilities in Israel. The Ashkelon desalination plant is the worldâs second largest.Israel is a world leader in desalination and by 2015, 75% of Israelâs water supply will come from water desalination. The UN General Assembly recently adopted an Israeli proposed resolution calling for international investment in agricultural technology.Israel is also a world leader in forestry as we implement Ben-Gurionâs dream of making the desert bloom â and one of the only countries that had more trees at the end of the 20th century than at the start.Thousands of experts flock to Israel every two years to attend WATEC: The Israel Water Technologies, Renewable Energies and Environmental Control exhibition. This November, Eilat- Eilot, the largest renewable energy conference of its kind will be held in Eilat.Since 1958, MASHAV (Israelâs agency for international development cooperation at the Foreign Ministry) has brought to Israel over 270,000 professionals from across the globe to take courses, learn from experts and see sustainable development in practice. Israeli experts have also been sent to the developing world to run courses there.During the Rio+20 conference the Israeli government, for the first time, invested in an international campaign on CNN branding Israel as a world leader in green technology. The Foreign Ministry launched a Facebook Page called âGREEN ISRAELâ and an environmental YouTube channel.Many places around the world suffer severe drought. Millions in Africa face life-threatening hunger. Israel is willing and able to continue to share its technology and know-how with the world and be a âlight unto the nationsâ of sustainable development.In the words of the prophet Isaiah: âI will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.â (Chapter 41, verse 18) The writer is the coordinator for Sustainable Development in Israelâs Foreign Ministry and was a member of the delegation to the Rio+20 Conference.Previously he was the Minister for Congressional Affairs at the Israeli Embassy in Washington.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

The WCSB is scheduled to meet early next year to discuss their initial findings in these two areas to determine next steps.\n\n\"Kratom is a safe, natural botanical helping millions of responsible consumers across America like me suffering from chronic and debilitating illness. Today it was clear the WCSB recognized that,\" said Susan Ash, Director of the AKA and Lyme disease sufferer. \"The Board's decision today is a significant step in the right direction. The AKA and our members look forward to continuing to work with the WCSB as the state moves toward making the right decision, ultimately removing kratom's Schedule I classification, either through the WCSB or the legislature.\"\n\n\"Regulators are supposed to do what's in the best interest of the public and today the WCSB did just that in taking a major step toward reversing the state's mistake made in scheduling Kratom,\" added Kerry Biggs, native of Milwaukee and AKA member. \"It's exciting to know that my state is on the regulatory road to getting kratom back on shelves for people like me that have found it to be a true life saver.\"\n\nAbout the American Kratom Association\n\nThe American Kratom Association (AKA) was founded in 2014 to protect the right of all Americans to use the natural botanical kratom for the purposes of improved health and wellbeing. We do not manufacture or profit from sales of the plant. Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a natural analgesic used for hundreds of years to safely reduce pain, combat fatigue and help with the effects of anxiety and depression. Unfortunately, the spread of misinformation about kratom (both scientific and anecdotal) has created a challenging regulatory environment.

  "latent_14267": "NSA whistleblower and privacy advocate Edward Snowden took part in his first public debate on encryption on Tuesday night, facing off against CNNâs Fareed Zakaria, a journalist and author known for his coverage of international affairs.\n\nZakaria, in New York, defended the governmentâs right to access any and all encrypted messages and devices as long as thereâs court approval. Snowden, speaking over a live video-link from Moscow, argued the security of the Internet is more important than the convenience of law enforcement. The debate was organized by NYUâs Wagner School of Public Service and the Century Foundation.\n\nThough Zakaria started off firm in his conviction that law enforcement should be able to get hold of all digital messages with court approval, he gradually conceded that it may not be that simple. Zakaria said he himself doesnât actively encrypt any of his communications, assuming everything will be fine â though Snowden pointed out that, since he has an iPhone, some of his data and communications are encrypted by default.\n\nZakaria opened the debate by posing a hypothetical: Bank of America creates an âiVaultâ allowing anyone to store all their financial data totally encrypted. An embezzler could take advantage of that service to hide the evidence of their misdeeds, foiling investigators. âI understand within a democracy, you have to sacrifice liberty for democracy at some point. You cannot have an absolute zone of privacy,â he said.\n\nSnowden agreed with Zakaria that absolute zones of privacy donât exist, and that encryption does pose real problems for law enforcement. But he disagreed that universal access is the best way to solve the problem. âFor the government to unlock everything there has to be a key to everything. Every other person in the world can find that key and use it too,â he said. âItâs a fundamental problem of science.â\n\nInstead, he suggested, police should take advantage of the many other options available to them. He cited the investigation into the founder of Silk Road, an anonymous, encrypted platform for black market drug sales. In that case, a team of investigators caught the mastermind at the library after he typed in his password.\n\nâEncryption is not an unbreakable wall,â Snowden said. âOr if it is, it is one we can get around, if we are patient, if we are careful, if we think and plan how to go about our investigations.â\n\nBy the end of the debate, Zakaria said he did not support the legislation proposed by Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., which would mandate companies to immediately decrypt all communications when asked by a court. The bill has been heavily criticized by technologists.\n\nAnd Zakaria acknowledged that if it was genuinely impossible for a company to decrypt communications, then the court should accept that â though it would be a âhard case.â\n\nâIf WhatsApp says we literally do not know how to write this code â WhatsApp could demonstrate to a court that they donât have to do it,â Zakaria said.\n\nHe concluded by encouraging greater clarity about what kind of communications the government can and cannot access â before the next disastrous terrorist attack. âWe do face real threats out there. There are people out there trying to do bad things. Once they happen, the government will be given carte blanche,â he said.\n\nSnowden noted that former security officials now proclaiming the value of unbreakable encryption â including former NSA Director Michael Hayden â had considered those questions carefully and had fallen on the side of computer security.",

However, you can still order adult toys, lingerie, novelty items and lotions from our online catalog.\n\nWhat the hell was that all about?\n\nSo I called up Adam & Eveâs customer service line and ended up having a lovely 17-minute conversation with a company representative regarding what this was all about.\n\nHereâs the short version of the story as I understood it: In the 1970s and 1980s, there were laws forbidding the sending of pornographic material through U.S. mail. Adam & Eveâs founder Phil Harvey, among others, went to court over this several times â and he came out on top each time. He even wrote about it in a book available on the companyâs website:\n\n37 armed law enforcement agents forced their way into the offices of Adam & Eve in 1986. Employees were detained without due process or access to an attorney. This was only the start of 8 years of legal battles and $3 million in legal fees that would mean the difference between survival and oblivion.\n\nHowever, faced with the possibility of further lawsuits, a compromise was reached decades ago. Harvey essentially threw the feds a bone. Since obscenity rules were different based on where you lived, the company promised not to sell certain items to people in those locations.\n\nWhich items were forbidden? Anything depicting actual genitalia, including videos and dirty magazines.\n\nDildos and blow-up dolls, however, were fine since they were fake.\n\nUnless, of course, the boxes they came in showed the actual pictures of the porn starâs nether regionsâ¦ in which case they fell into the forbidden zone.\n\n(I should tell you at this point that my wife was very amused by this conversation, mostly because, every few seconds, she would hear me say something along the lines of, âWhat about dildos?â)\n\nEven though most of these communities have very different demographics now and much looser obscenity rules â which is why adult bookstores may have been built in those places over the past several years â Adam & Eve is still sticking to their promise. They wonât send genitalia-depicting items to âsexually conservativeâ cities in places like Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Utahâ¦ not because they would lose in a lawsuit anymore, but because theyâd rather just play it safe by adhering to decades-old rules. And they want to show theyâre making a sincere effort not to violate local standards.\n\nPlus, you know, itâs not like you canât find those things somewhere else.\n\nSo thereâs your explanation. I hope I got it right. There are more details here if youâre interested. And if youâre looking to do some last-minute erotica shopping, you know where to look.\n\nUnless you live in Spring City, Tennessee, in which case your options may be limited.",

  "latent_14432": "Prince Edward County is a county located in the Commonwealth of Virginia . As of the 2010 census , the population was 23,368. [1] Its county seat is Farmville . [2]\n\nPrince Edward, Duke of York and Albany, for whom the county was named\n\nFormation and county seats Edit\n\nPrince Edward County, Virginia was formed in the Virginia Colony in 1754 from Amelia County. It was named for Prince Edward, second son of Frederick, Prince of Wales and younger brother of George III of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe original county seat housed the courthouse and was called Prince Edward Courthouse; it is now the village of Worsham.\n\nNear the headwaters of the Appomattox River, the Town of Farmville was formed in 1798, and was incorporated in 1912. The county seat was moved from Worsham to Farmville in 1871.\n\nRailroads Edit\n\nIn the 1850s, the Southside Railroad between Petersburg and Lynchburg was built through Farmville between Burkeville and Pamplin City. The route, which was subsidized by a contribution from Farmville, required an expensive crossing of the Appomattox River slightly downstream which became known as the High Bridge.\n\nThe Southside Railroad was heavily damaged during the American Civil War. The High Bridge played a key role during Confederate General Robert E. Lee's final retreat from Petersburg to Appomattox Courthouse, where the surrender to Union General Ulysses S. Grant took place in April, 1865.\n\nAfter the Civil War, under the leadership of former Confederate General William \"Billy\" Mahone, the Southside Railroad was rebuilt. In 1870, it was combined with the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad and the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad to form Mahone's Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad (AM&O), which extended 400 miles across the southern tier of Virginia from Norfolk on Hampton Roads to Bristol. After the Financial Panic of 1873, the AM&O fell into default on its debt; it was purchased in the early 1880s by new owners who renamed it the Norfolk and Western (N&W). In 1982, it became part of the current Norfolk Southern Railway system.\n\nDue to the high cost of maintaining the High Bridge over the Appomattox River, the line through Farmville was downgraded and eventually abandoned, in favor of the Farmville Belt Line, which had been built on a more direct line between Burkeville and Pamplin City, as had originally been envisioned in the planning for the Southside Railroad.\n\nAnother railroad formerly served Farmville. In the late 19th century, the narrow gauge Farmville and Powhatan Railroad was built from Farmville through Cumberland, Powhatan, and Chesterfield counties to reach Bermuda Hundred on the navigable portion of the James River near its confluence with the Appomattox River at City Point. It was later renamed the Tidewater and Western Railroad, but was dismantled in the early 20th century.\n\nDesegregation Edit\n\nPrince Edward County is the source of Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, a case incorporated into Brown v. Board of Education, which ultimately resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court decision that racially segregated public schools were unconstitutional. This ultimately led to the desegregation of all U.S. public schools. Among the five cases decided under Brown, Davis was the only one initiated by students, after they walked out in 1951 to protest overcrowding and poor conditions at their segregated school under Jim Crow laws.\n\nThe all-black R.R. Moton High School, named after Robert Russa Moton, a noted educator from neighboring Amelia County, did not have a gymnasium, cafeteria, or teachers' restrooms. Due to overcrowding, three plywood buildings had been erected, and some students had to take classes in a school bus parked outside. Teachers and students did not have desks or blackboards. The school's requests for additional funds were denied by the all-white school board. On Monday, April 23, 1951, Barbara Johns, the sixteen-year-old niece of Reverend Vernon Johns, a civil rights activist, led students who staged a walkout protesting the conditions.[3] The NAACP took up their case when the students agreed to petition for an integrated school rather than improved conditions at their black school. This vote passed by one count. Howard University-trained attorneys Spottswood W. Robinson and Oliver Hill filed suit against the county school system on behalf of the students. As in other Southern states, since the turn of the twentieth century black voters in Virginia had been largely disenfranchised, which resulted in their lacking political power.\n\nIn Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, a state court rejected the suit, agreeing with defense attorney T. Justin Moore that Virginia was vigorously equalizing conditions in black and white schools. The state verdict was appealed to the U.S. District Court, which ruled for the plaintiffs, a decision the school district and the state appealed. Subsequently, it was one of five cases incorporated into Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark case in which the U.S. Supreme Court in 1954 ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional.\n\nMassive Resistance Edit\n\nIn 1956, the Virginia General Assembly passed a series of laws (the Stanley plan) to implement Massive Resistance, a policy promoted by the Byrd Organization led by former Virginia governor and U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd, to avoid compliance with the Supreme Court ruling in Brown and its direction to integrate public schools.\n\nThe state legislature (overwhelmingly dominated by whites since disfranchisement of African Americans in the state in the early 1900s) created a program of \"tuition grants,\" which could be given to students so they could attend a private school of their choice. In practice, this meant state support of all-white schools that were developed as a way to evade integration of public schools. These newly formed schools became known as the \"segregation academies\".\n\nAs a result of the Brown decision, and changes in Virginia laws, in 1959, the Board of Supervisors for Prince Edward County refused to appropriate any funds at all for the County School Board. It effectively closed all public schools rather than integrate them. The Prince Edward County Public Schools remained closed for five years. While other Virginia and some southern school systems resisted integration, Prince Edward County was the only school district in the country to resort to such extreme measures.\n\nDuring the interruption in access to Prince Edward County's public schools, white parents established the Prince Edward Foundation. It founded a series of private schools restricted to white children. These schools were supported by the tuition grants from the state and tax credits from the county. Collectively they became known as \"Prince Edward Academy\", one of Virginia's \"segregation academies\". Prince Edward Academy operated as the de facto school system and enrolled K-12 students at a number of facilities throughout the county.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1964, black students in Prince Edward County had to go to school elsewhere or forgo their education altogether. Some got schooling by living with relatives in nearby communities or at makeshift schools the community created in church basements. Others were educated out of state with funds raised by groups such as the Quakers. In the final year (1963â1964), the NAACP-sponsored Prince Edward Free School picked up some of the slack by educating some of the black youth who had been unable to leave the county to attend public schools elsewhere.\n\nIn 1963, federal district courts ordered the public schools to open; Prince Edward County appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Ruling in Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, the Court unanimously agreed in May 1964 that Prince Edward County's actions violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. At that point, county and state supervisors gave in rather than risk prosecution and prison, ending the era of Massive Resistance in Virginia.[4]\n\nThe same summer, following the Griffith ruling, 16 students from Queens College (New York) ventured south to Prince Edward County during their \"Student Help Project\" Program, a precursor to the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer. The students served as teachers to the many African-American children who had been denied an education. These volunteers worked with the students to prepare them to resume classes when schools reopened that fall. The volunteers from Queens College were housed among leading African-American families in the county that summer. They used local churches as school houses during the week. Many of the students involved in the program have since donated their archives to the Queens College Department of Special Collections and Archives.[5]\n\nAs a result of Prince Edward County's actions, some students missed part or all of their education for five years. This group has been called the \"Lost Generation\" of Prince Edward County's youth.\n\nPrivate education since 1964 Edit\n\nEven after the re-opening of the public schools, Prince Edward Academy remained segregated. Many of the segregation academies in Virginia eventually closed; others changed their missions and eliminated discriminatory policies. Some yielded on integration only after the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) revoked the tax-free status of non-profit discriminatory private schools. Prince Edward Academy was one of the latter and lost its tax-exempt status in 1978. In 1986, the school began to accept all students regardless of race or ethnicity. It was renamed the Fuqua School in 1992, in honor of J.B. Fuqua, a wealthy businessman who was born in Farmville and was a strong supporter of the school in its early years. Fuqua remains the only private school in Prince Edward County.\n\nRobert Russa Moton Museum Edit\n\nThe former R.R. Moton High School building in Farmville has been recognized as a nationally significant community landmark. In 1998, it was designated a National Historic Landmark. It now houses the Robert Russa Moton Museum, a center for the study of civil rights in education.",

  "latent_14577": "Republican opposition to U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice as the next secretary of state began to crack Sunday as Sen. John McCain said she was \"not the problem\" in the White House's handling of the Sept. 11 attack in Libya and suggested he could be persuaded to swing behind her possible nomination.\n\nMcCain's comments provide an opening for the Obama administration, which struggled mightily in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 6 election to tamp down speculation of a cover-up involving the attack against the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi. The assault killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya.\n\nAt issue is Rice's account â as the administration's representative on the Sunday talk shows Sept. 16 â that the violence was the spontaneous result of a mob angered by an anti-Muslim video posted on YouTube. She said she relied on talking points provided by the intelligence community that were later discredited.\n\n\"I think she deserves the ability and the opportunity to explain herself and her position,\" McCain, R-Ariz., told \"Fox News Sunday.\" ''But she's not the problem. The problem is the president of the United States\" who misled the public on terrorist involvement.\n\nMcCain's remarks were in contrast to his previous stance that Rice wasn't qualified to replace Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is expected to step down soon as the top U.S. diplomat, and that he would do \"whatever is necessary\" to block Rice's possible nomination.\n\nRice is widely seen as Obama's first choice for the job as secretary of State. As the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, McCain would have considerable sway in the Senate's screening of Rice.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, McCain's close friend and colleague on the committee, told ABC \"This Week\" he still suspects the White House intentionally glossed over obvious terrorist links in the attack to keep voters from questioning Obama's handling of national security.\n\nBut instead of repeating his prior assertion that he was \"dead set\" against a Rice promotion, Graham suggested he looked forward to hearing her out. If Rice were nominated, \"there will be a lot of questions asked of her about this event and others,\" said Graham, R-S.C.\n\nThe subtle shift in GOP tenor on Rice could be the result of internal grumblings on how far to take party opposition. Democrats picked up extra seats in the election to maintain their narrow majority, making it that much harder for the remaining 45 Republicans to block the president's nominees.\n\nOne senior GOP Senate aide said Sunday that Republicans hadn't united against Rice and were not convinced that she was worth going after.\n\n\"There's a definite sense within the caucus that you have to be conservative about where you put your firepower,\" said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly on internal GOP deliberations. \"The question is whether the caucus is prepared to filibuster her, and I'm not sure we were.\"\n\nIntelligence officials have said they knew immediately that the Sept. 11 incident was a terrorist attack and suspected that the local al-Qaida branch was involved. But they also initially believed that the attack may have grown spontaneously from a protest against the film.\n\nUnclassified talking points provided to Rice and other administration officials in the days following the attack omitted references to terrorists and al-Qaida because intelligence officials said the information was tenuous and could tip their hand in the investigation. The administration also didn't want to prejudice a criminal investigation.\n\nRice said she used those talking points in Sept. 16 interviews in defending the administration's protection of overseas diplomats, saying \"clusters of extremists\" had \"hijacked\" film protests. Officials say it wasn't until after Rice spoke that intelligence agencies adjusted the assessment to clarify that the attack was not spontaneous or related to a protest.\n\nRep. Peter King, R-N.Y., chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee and a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said Rice should have reviewed the raw classified intelligence and not just relied on unclassified talking points provided to her.\n\nGraham said he remains unconvinced that Rice was relying solely on information provided to her by intelligence agencies.

  "latent_14609": "VANCOUVER, B.C. â When the Vancouver Whitecaps trot out against FC Edmonton on Wednesday in the first leg of the Canadian Championship semifinal (9:30 pm ET, Sportsnet), it will likely be a mixed lineup featuring fringe players and regular starters.\n\nThe Eddies play in the second-division NASL, and the temptation in such situations is to make wholesale changes â but head coach Martin Rennie suggested on Monday that it wonât be an outright \"B\" team.\n\nâOne of the things for us is that we donât have a ton of veterans all healthy at the same time right now,â Rennie said. âBut weâll have a couple of guys in there who are veterans. But weâve got a young team and weâve got a lot of good young players.\n\nâWe want them to be in there as well. It depends â you could look at Camilo as an MLS veteran, [Darren] Mattocks has played a lot of games. Those guys come into contention, but thereâll be other experienced players too.â\n\nREAD: All you need to know about the 2013 Canadian Championship\n\nWhen a reporter asked Rennie if he was aware of recent press criticism of some of his team selection decisions in recent weeks â especially in the wake of Saturdayâs 2-0 defeat to FC Dallas, the Scottish tactician suggested that he knowingly didnât select his best lineup as he wanted some players to be fresh for this semifinal.\n\nThe omissions of established players such as Mattocks, Gershon Koffie and Camilo from the starting lineup in favor of the likes of Matt Watson, Tom Heinemann and Erik Hurtado were particularly surprising decisions which came under close scrutiny following the match.\n\nâI want to put [out] a strong team on Wednesday,â Rennie said. âI think some of those guys who didnât play in the game against Dallas will come into contention for Wednesday, so thatâs part of it. I donât want them to all play every game. I donât think theyâre going to play Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday, Wednesday, all the way through.â\n\nThe Canadian Championship is a bit of a tightrope to walk for the Whitecaps given their recent MLS run of five winless matches, but Rennie is looking on it as a chance to gain some momentum.\n\nWhile the Voyageurs Cup awarded to the tournament champion is a trophy in itself, the more significant carrot on offer is qualification for the CONCACAF Champions League such an achievement would bring.\n\nâI think itâs a very important competition,â Rennie said. âPerhaps thatâs part of the lineup that we played in the last game. That just shows you just how important we think this competition is. Weâll have a strong lineup coming into this game.\n\nâWe want to get into the final, and then we want to win the final. Of course, that would be the first time the clubâs done it, and it would also give us a chance to play in the CONCACAF Champions League.â\n\nREAD: Whitecaps will see several familiar faces vs. FC Edmonton\n\nDesignated Player Kenny Miller is currently in the United Kingdom as his wife is having a baby, and will not be available for Wednesday's match. The Scotsman has struggled with a hamstring injury in recent weeks but Rennie says he could be in contention for Saturday's match at BC Place against FC Dallas after arriving back in Vancouver on Wednesday.\n\nCorey Hertzog is still getting over concussion symptoms after a head-to-head collision with Adam Clement in training last week but could play on Saturday barring a setback.\n\nOmar Salgado has yet to play a minute for the Whitecaps this season due to a foot injury, but has received a call-up for the US Under-20 national team for a training camp from April 22-29 in Carson, Calif., ahead of the U-20 World Cup this July in Turkey. That rules him out of Wednesday's match as well as Saturday's game against FC Dallas.",
  "latent_14628": "There are a variety of reasons why Red Bull has over 20 million Facebook fans, but one that surfaces to the top is their unapologetic âLike our Page, hint, hintâ custom landing greeting. And while Red Bull has a budget larger than most of us, that doesnât mean weâre cut out of the custom landing page party. Thanks to a fantastic WordPress plugin and a bit of copy/paste inside Facebook, you can have a custom landing page up and running within 5 minutes. Hereâs how:\n\nVisit https://www.facebook.com/developers and click on âSet Up New Appâ in the top right corner.\n\nin the top right corner. Give your app a name and agree to Facebookâs Terms of Service.\n\nOn the next screen, give your app an official name (this is the one the public will see). The About and Website tabs are optional, however itâs recommended to create and upload a custom icon and logo.\n\nClick on Facebook Integration\n\nNow hereâs where most of us get hung up. Facebook is asking for a whole lotta URLâs and canvases, secure this, and iFrame whats? Fear not, thereâs no need to bring in the development team. If youâre familiar with WordPress, youâre already half way to publishing your first custom landing page.\n\nProvided that you have admin rights to your WordPress based blog (or site), head on over to the plugins directory and search Facebook Tab Manager. Found it? Great, install it, and letâs get this party started! Once youâve installed and activated the Facebook Tab Manager, you will next create a custom Facebook page within the confines of the self hosted WordPress installation, and then tell Facebook where to look for it. To do thisâ¦\n\nFrom the Facebook Tabs icon in your WordPress sidebar, select Add New. You should be greeted with a very familiar WordPress interface. In essence, what youâre doing here is creating a new page within your WordPress installation, but hidden from public view. To this end, I like to title these pages the same as the app for quick and easy recognition.\n\nOnce youâve titled the page, the wysiwgy editor is your new best friend. Hereâs where youâll want to design and edit your HTML. If using the visual interface is more your style, no problem, edit away.\n\nFor this example, Iâm employing my own narcissism, and using my Worldâs Smallest 3D printer article as my landing page, but you can use any HTML based code you want (images, iframe code, etc.). Iâve copied the HTML code from the article, and pasted it in the editor box (under the HTML tab and not visual tab).\n\nSo far, so good. The Facebook Tab Manager plugin also offers you the option to change and/or alter your CSS styles, but letâs keep it simple, and assume that the existing style sheet is to your liking. Likewise, you can add additional scripts and style sheets, but K.I.S.S.\n\nYou will, however, want to pay attention to the tick boxes below the extra code box. Open Links / Post Forms to a New Window is just as it says, or for the hidden coder in you, think of it as a target=â_blankâ. Unless youâve got some super fancy code going on in your header or footer, donât worry about the âTemplate should executeâ¦â options, but do pay attention to the âSet resize/autoresizeâ box, as well as the âHide post titleâ¦â option. Weâre now 80% complete, and only a bit more copy/pasting to go.\n\nNow that youâve perfected your HTML code via the editor and selected the options for your page, go ahead and publish your masterpiece. Again, fret not, as this page is not publicly viewable on your site/blog. Once published, the Facebook Tab Manager plugin will present you with a number of URLs. Remember that URL, canvas, and iframe information Facebook was previously requesting? VoilÃ .\n\nBack at the Facebook Integration tab, you now have all the URLs you need to fill in the form. Note: The Facebook Tab Manager plugin will also allow you to get a bit fancier and create two separate posts, one to act as a tab manager, the other as a stand alone application canvas. Again, for the sake of simplicity, letâs skip the canvas, and stick with what weâve got.\n\nCopy/paste the appropriate URLs from the plugin to their corresponding fields within the Facebook Integration tab. As the plugin states, âMake sure the radio buttons are set to iFrame, not FBML, for both the Canvas URL and the Tab URL.â Also note that those who choose to browse Facebook under the âSecureâ (https) feature may have trouble viewing your custom landing page if your domain does not have an SSL security certificate installed. If youâre in doubt, consult your IT manager, and/or hosting company. Now click on that awesome âSave Changesâ button, and letâs see what weâve got.\n\nHead back on over to your page, and you should now see your app appear in the left column navigation, just below your profile image. Clickit, and letâs confirm weâre seeing the same thing as we did in the WordPress editor. This is where that âSet resize/autoresizeâ option comes in handy, as the plugin with automatically reformat your content to fit within the constraints of the available Facebook real estate.\n\nWeâre now 95% complete. Click on âEdit Pageâ at the top right corner of your wall. Under âDefault Landing Tabâ select your new app from the dropdown and click âSave Changesâ.\n\nNow log out, or visit your page from another browser where youâre not logged in, and â¦.Presto! a custom landing page for new visitors.\n\nPost Script: While the resize/autoresize option will work for text, during my testing I discovered that the same is not true for images, video, other iframe content, etc. To ensure that these additional media formats apply correctly, I recommend using dimensions of 500px wide or less.\n\nRead next: Amazon's \"Hollywood\" tablet could launch with free movie subscription",

  "latent_14915": "Your ideology might be swamped by your biology when you cast your vote, and this is why parties like UKIP are riding high, say John Hibbing and Kevin Smith\n\n(Image: Andrzej Krauze)\n\nPOPULIST movements are everywhere at the moment, on both the left and right of politics. Yet many observers seem in denial about the strength and stubborn appeal of this phenomenon and, rather than trying to explain it, simply dismiss it as irresponsible pandering to the masses.\n\nAt the same time, scholars are using biology to understand political attitudes, chiefly the liberal-conservative split. Might this approach help us understand populismâs pull?\n\nPopulists are characterised not just by their championing of the interests of ordinary people, but also by their often angry crusades against political or economic entities seen as hostile and threatening to those interests. These can be external: the European Union fits that bill for the left-leaning Syriza party in Greece as well as for the right-leaning UKIP in the UK. They can be internal: elite corporations and an out-of-touch government have spurred both the right-leaning Tea Party and the left-leaning Occupy movement in the US. Similar forces are at work in Spain, where left-wing Podemos is riding high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArguably, the most potent and volatile populist catalyst is immigration. Political systems throughout Europe typically have at least one right-leaning populist party unsympathetic or openly hostile to immigrants. It is not unusual for them to draw 10 to 15 per cent of the vote, sometimes more. In January, polls suggested the anti-immigration National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, was the most popular party in France.\n\nResearch in the past few years, using information on brain structure and function from MRI scans, physiological responses, eye-trackers and behavioural genetics, shows that individual political orientations are deeply connected to biological forces that are usually beyond personal control (see âBeyond beliefâ). Despite initial incredulity â people like to believe political opinions are rational responses to salient events â the evidence that political preferences are linked to systems that often involve subconscious processes is growing. An admittedly simplistic but useful summary of this research is that human emotions are grounded in biology, and politics is grounded in emotions.\n\nWhen it comes to biology and populism, it is worth asking two questions: first, why does populist partiesâ appeal rise and fall over time â more so than that of most other parties â and, second, why is the appeal so much greater among some people than others?\n\nBiology has little to say about the first. Although environmental changes, such as conflict, can and do alter individual biological predispositions, sudden environmentally mediated shifts of biological predisposition that are strong enough to alter the electoral fortunes of populist parties in multiple societies seem unlikely.\n\nInterestingly, non-biological, purely environmental explanations do not provide much better answers. The popular belief is that populism surges when economies falter or tragedies unfold. While intuitively appealing, studies find little evidence for a link to any metric of a nationâs fortunes.\n\nAs for why populismâs appeal varies so much from person to person, many see populism as a symptom of working class angst in a world where external forces disproportionately threaten that group. That view is questionable given that support is often from those not low in socioeconomic status â think UKIP and the Tea Party. It is on this question of individual variation that biopolitical literature provides a more plausible â though far from total â explanation.\n\nHumans have a well-established and potent negativity bias; we subconsciously respond more and pay more attention to negative than to positive events. This makes sense. Negative situations can have more severe consequences in survival terms, so successful organisms should be more sensitive to such stimuli. It is also well established that individuals vary in their degree of response to negative stimuli.\n\nPhysiologically speaking, some react nearly as strongly to positive as to negative stimuli; others much more strongly to negative.\n\nWork in our lab and several others suggests that, after accounting for socioeconomic status, people who are more biologically responsive to and who devote more cognitive resources to negative stimuli favour policies that could be viewed as protective.\n\nThose with a strong negativity bias are more likely to be suspicious of new approaches and different people. They tend to prefer certainty, tradition and security. Perhaps because they are more in tune with potential dangers, they are attracted to policies they believe will limit their vulnerability â whether the perceived threat comes from outside groups, pathogens or something that violates their group norms. In the face of perceived threats, they seek in-group safety. Variations in biologically measured negativity bias appear to predict attitudes on immigration and other perceived threats â issues typically at the core of populist movements.\n\nÂVariations in biologically measured negativity bias appear to predict attitudes on immigrationÂ\n\nExplanations for the lure of populist parties are undoubtedly more complex than biological sensitivities to negativity bias. Yet the biology suggests it would be a mistake to dismiss populismâs appeal as something easily countered and to conclude that populist leaders create rather than capitalise on organic populist impulses.\n\nBiological predispositions that bolster populism are by no means immutable. At the same time, they seem significantly harder to alter than many would like to believe; a strong negativity bias is usually deeply ingrained. Support for populist parties will continue to ebb and flow â but individual biological mechanisms animating populist urges are here to stay.\n\nThis article appeared in print under the headline âWe are what we voteâ",

  "latent_15003": "Sure, saving $1,000 on a car that may cost you far in excess of $70,000 might seem like a minor victory, but itâs still better than nothing. But now that Tesla is becoming more of a household name and hoping to reach a more mass-market car-buying audience, itâs getting rid of even this relatively small savings program.\n\nTesla recently announced it will end its referral credit program that provided prospective buyers with a $1,000 toward their purchase Tuesday evening.\n\nThrough the program, current Tesla owners could provide five friends with a $1,000 credit to be used on any new Model S or Model X vehicle. These new customers would also receive free unlimited supercharging for their vehicles.\n\nIndividuals who donât make their purchase by end-of-the-day Tuesday wonât exactly be left empty-handed. Instead, the carmaker notes that purchases made after Oct. 31 will still receive free, unlimited supercharging.\n\nIf youâve got a friend with a Tesla, they might just be hounding you over the next two days to finally buy one of the electric cars. Thatâs because theyâre also getting a prize for referring you to the company.\n\nCurrent owners receive an array of âthank youâ awards, including a free Black Wall Connector, a miniature Model S for kids, a new set of (literal) wheels, and Powerwall 2 home batteries.\n\nTesla first unveiled its incentive program in July 2015, offering both the current Tesla owner and the new customer $1,000 off the list price of a new vehicle, accessories, or service.\n\nIt should be noted that Tesla does not appear to offer any kind of referral program for customers who already own or are looking to buy the new, more modestly priced Model 3.\n\nThe Model 3, which officially launched this summer, is intended to be Teslaâs first mass-produced electric vehicle with a price tag starting around $36,000.\n\nHowever, the carâs debut has been marred with complications, as Tesla deals with âmanufacturing bottlenecks.â\n\nEarlier this month, the company said it had fallen short of its goal of producing 1,500 vehicles between late July and the end of September, only producing 260 Model 3 cars and delivering 220 of them.",
  "latent_15010": "A few weeks ago, Malcolm Gladwell stopped by The Bill Simmons Podcast and, at one point during their conversation, he brought up the idea of precipitous decline. Using Folger's coffee as an example, Gladwell essentially remarked that people don't notice massive declines in a product's quality if that decline happens slowly and incrementally over time. Has this happened in filmmaking? Everyone has access to video technology, and the media landscape is flooded with amateur video in a way that we've never seen before.\n\nIf we are seeing a decline in our own video standards, then the iPhone is the ultimate culprit. The iPhone began the smartphone revolution that has, since the 3Gs, given everyone and their grandparents the ability to record, edit, and broadcast their own video content all from something that fits in their pocket. It has, though, also changed the indie film scene in some interesting ways. Is the iPhone good or bad for filmmaking? With the official announcement of the iPhone 7 just a few days away, letâs discuss.\n\nThe Good: Versatility\n\nThe iPhone doesn't come out of the box as a very good filmmaking device, but that hasn't stopped app and peripheral developers from attempting to make it one. Out-of-the-box thinking is what defines success in the mobile market, and some of the filmmaking creations for the iPhone have been unlike anything we've seen in the market before. Additionally, there are ton of great iPhone apps that make filmmaking easier for when you're shooting with another camera. This kind of creative energy can only be good for filmmakers.\n\nThe Bad: The Real Cost\n\nWhile the smartphones seems like a low-cost option for filmmakers on a budget, the price of adding everything needed to turn your smartphone into a quality video camera adds up quickly. You're gonna need extra battery life, some sort of stabilizer, extra lenses, video improvement apps, an audio solution and, in the iPhone's case, prohibitively expensive memory. Added peripherals and app power alone can easily set you back $500, and that's before you add in the cost of the phone. Are you sure you wouldn't be better off spending that money on a DJI OSMO, a Lumix G7, or a Blackmagic Pocket?\n\nThe Good: Creativity\n\nHow can adding another avenue for filmmaker success be anything but good? 8mm and16mm film revolutionized early independent cinema. The prevalence of camcorders revolutionized the possibilities of found footage horror. What if a smartphone revolution in film style is just around the corner? What if \"Tangerine\" is just the beginning? I mean, a Swiss TV station has replaced a traditional studio with iPhones and selfie sticks. Maybe the revolution is already upon us.\n\nThe Bad: The Slippery Slope\n\nIt's one thing to talk about the iPhone compared to other home video options, but it's another to talk about it as a tool for professional filmmakers. If iPhone footage is becoming more and more acceptable as a filmmaking norm, will clients begin approaching filmmakers with lower budgets and iPhone demands? Even if filmmakers don't forget what truly beautiful footage looks like, what if audiences and the folks with the money do? The democratization of video content might allow anyone to become a filmmaker, but might not actually be lowering the barrier to entry. Terry Green, writing for Filmmaker Magazine, puts this anxiety nicely.\n\n\"Today, a hand-held digital camera and home editing system is all you need to make a film and to call yourself a director... On one hand, itâs made filmmaking possible for those who otherwise would never have the opportunity. On the other, itâs watered down the landscape and made it harder to recognize filmmaking talent.\"\n\nThe Good: Finding the Next Great\n\nFor those of us shooting on cinema cameras of one kind or another, maybe it's too late to become inspired by the iPhone. The next generation of young filmmakers, though, will grow up with smartphones in their pockets. What if it inspires them? What if the next JJ Abrams or Steven Spielberg is out there right now honing their craft on an iPhone 6?\n\nThe iPhone is also a great tool for budding photographers. With very few extra purchases and a tiny learning curve, the iPhone can provide great early lessons on composition, editing, and lighting. For those inspired enough to go down the rabbit hole, the iPhone can even deliver some pretty astounding images on its own. Having your phone with you at all times also teaches that, with image capturing, you're never going to want to miss a moment.\n\nThe Bad: Bad Habits\n\nI've heard photographers talk about teaching photography students using entirely manual film cameras. The idea is that, with limitations, we become better at our craft. If you're reading this, you've probably owned or operated a camera that really tested your skills and forced you to be a better filmmaker. Maybe you've hacked into your DSLR to get a flatter image or you've developed a raw workflow that maximizes your image potential or just simply worked with a camera that was above your skill set and rose to the occasion. You probably remember the first camera that led you to the cameras you're working on now.\n\nDoes the iPhone lead young filmmakers (and photographers) in the right direction, or create a generation of bad habits? You don't need to learn about lenses or lighting or audio or editing to set your creation loose upon the world. All you have to do is hit the record button and share for instant gratification. These habits could become distressing to filmmakers faced with the slower-moving, production-oriented film industry. Does the iPhone even meet the basic requirements to be entry-level anything?\n\nThe Future?\n\nIs the iPhone liberating filmmakers with the expressive power of new technology or is it a dangerous gimmick that is creating a new industry of bad habits and lowered expectations? The answer probably lies somewhere in between. Right now, it seems like the iPhone's best days as a filmmaking tool are ahead of it, so all we can do is wait until the iPhone 7 is announced for a glimpse of what those days might look like. Right now, we know that Apple acquired the innovative camera company Linx in 2015, and rumors suggest that they might be implementing some of Linx's creations into the iPhone 7. This could mean a lot of things, since Linx's developments as of 2014 include dual system cameras that produce DSLR-level images, multi-aperture cameras, refocusing technologies, improved low-light performance, and 3D object modeling. If Apple adds any crazy new technologies or even improves on what it already has working, the iPhone 7 is going to be tempting to amateurs and professionals alike.",
  "latent_15080": "Will Ferrellâs Land of the Lost had a disappointing opening Friday, bringing in right at $6.8 million on Friday, with a projected $20 million for the weekend. That might not sound all that bad, but the movie cost Universal studios somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million to make and they wanted a $30 million opening weekend to alleviate fears of having a financial bomb on their hands.\n\nItâs a perfect storm working against the high-budget special effects comedy with two competing funny films opening the same weekend, both of which exceeding expectations at the box office. The Hangover (read the starcasm review) is bringing in the R-rated older crowd with a projected opening weekend of $50 million while Pixarâs Up is drawing in the families with a projected $45 million opening weekend.\n\nBut, the biggest thing working against Julaughic Park is the negative buzz and really bad reviews. A common complaint among critics is that the movie doesnât have a target audience â there are a number of very adult situations and jokes while at the same time the movie spends a lot of time rehashing poop and homo jokes well-suited for boys aged 10-16 years of age and thatâs about it. Most agree the movie has its moments, but a few prehistoric reptiles, a Salvador Dalian pop culture desert landscape, a funny cameo by Todayâs Matt Lauer, the crutch of being a remake of a campy cult favorite and Will Ferrell being Will Ferrell werenât enough to overcome a poor script and the overall lack of vision the project suffered from. Here are some of the best of the worst reviews of Land of the Lost on the web â a showcase of witty snark that reads like a long strand of barbed wire:\n\nThis dramatically, thematically and artistically bankrupt comic fantasy cost something in the neighborhood of $100 million to make & isnât worth the celluloid itâs printed on.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\nWill Ferrellâs terminally stupid, sloppy, campy and cheesy â and thoroughly unexciting and unfunny â experiment in âfamily entertainment.â â¦ To report that Matt Lauer, in two lengthy scenes as himself, gives the funniest performance in Land of the Lost is to damn it with the faintest praise possible.\n\nNew York Post\n\nThe only discernible intention in Land of the Lost , the latest comedy starring Will Ferrell acting like Will Ferrell, seems to have been to take a slight idea and make the least of it in a very expensive wayâ¦If it werenât for the welcome anomaly of his Stranger than Fiction (2006), you get a depressing suspicion [Will Ferrell]âs modelling his career on Chevy Chase.\n\nThe Globe and Mail\n\nLand of the Lost is, unfortunately, a perfect example of studio bloat: Itâs all noise and flash and chaos, but it lacks virtually everything that made the original television series so memorable.\n\nThe Austin Chronicle\n\nLike its characters, the film keeps getting lost too, stumbling as it struggles to keep kids and adults from squirming in their seats.\n\nLA Times\n\nLand of the Lost becomes an endurance test â one thatâs too borderline bawdy for families and too dull and rote for anyone over 15. Who, exactly, is the intended audience for this drivel?\n\nMiami Herald\n\nThis lumbering, ha-ha-look-what-we-remade action-comedy is a high-concept disaster.\n\nNY Daily News\n\nThe result is a movie with an exceedingly narrow target audience that should test Will Ferrellâs appeal among boys maybe ages 12-14 â about the only demo likely able to endure this laborious mess.\n\nVariety\n\nLame sketch comedy, an uninspired performance from Will Ferrell and an overall failure of the imagination turn Brad Silberlingâs Land of the Lost into a lethargic meander through a wilderness of misfiring gags.\n\nHollywood Reporter\n\nItâs all so resolutely uninspired that even the kids in the audience may want to duck out. Grade: D+\n\nChristian Science Monitor\n\nIt doesnât help that neither Ferrell nor McBride bring their best material, with McBride offering yet another variation on an angry redneck, and Ferrell falling back on Ron Burgundy-like bluster and nonsense exclamations. Theyâre two unpredictable talents at their most predictable, and the dull action and half-assed story hardly make up for the deflated comedy. So who is this movie for? Maybe it isnât for anyone.\n\nA.V. Club\n\nA turd of T-Rex proportions, Land of the Lost makes one remember last summerâs Speed Racer fondly â¦ I have often said that if I ever walk out on a movie, it wonât be something truly awful, but one that stagnates in the belly of mediocrity. I nearly walked out on Land of the Lost. A part of me wishes I had done so.\n\nReel Views\n\nGenially terrible, Lost is lazy, sloppy multiplex filler, good for a few solid giggles and not much more â¦ thatâs what you get with megastar âSNLâ comedy grads like Ferrell and Mike Myers and, at his weakest, Adam Sandler: the proudly smug assumption that boner jokes, bad â70s songs, and computer graphics are all you need to separate summer audiences from their money. That may be true, but Sid and Marty Krofft deserve better and so do you.\n\nBoston.com\n\nLike so many nominally child-oriented movies these days, Land of the Lost gets its knickers in such a twist trying to curry favor with several demographics at once â gross-out gags for the nippers, scary dinosaurs for the pimply boys, and a modicum of wit to keep parental bums in seats â that it ends up sagging into a pleasantly undistinguished pudding.\n\nL.A. Weekly\n\nThe movieâs wafer-thin plot is just an excuse for Ferrell, McBride and Jorma Taccone (as Chaka) to drag out the boob, dino pee and narcotic-fruit-juice jokes. Almost every gag is a notch too spacey and a minute too long.\n\nSan Francisco Chronicle\n\nThe film appears ambivalent about whether it wants to embrace to low-budget camp of the original or use that big budget and instead it just looks like an expensive-but-still-kind-of-crappy version of the original.\n\nCollider.com\n\nLand of the Lost, starring Will Ferrell, Danny McBride, and Anna Friel, is horribly conceived, almost entirely laugh-free, and with absolutely no personality of its own. Itâs one of the most inert, dull, and dead-on-arrival major summer films in a very long time with no target audience likely to be satisfied by it.\n\nHollywood Chicago\n\nHere are a few giggles and a couple of clever set pieces, but otherwise itâs just an aimless romp lost in the land of juvenile humor and missed opportunities.\n\nSeattle Post Globe\n\nOn the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Land of the Lost is a tiresome, time-warped 2. The title says it all.\n\nSusan Granger\n\nItâs hardly worth explaining the story, since Chris Henchy (âEntourageâ) and Dennis McNicholas (âSaturday Night Liveâ) hardly wrote one. Instead, we get dinosaur-poop jokes, stale pop-culture references (âA Chorus Lineâ provides a running gag) and Jorma Taccone as the ape-man Chaka, who exists mainly to grope Holly.\n\nNewsday.com\n\nBased on a near-forgotten low-fi TV show, the movie pushes its bad special effects and downright terrible costumes at the viewer as part of the joke. So what? The humor in that lasts about three seconds. After which, youâre stuck watching a clichÃ©-ridden, bad special-effects riddled, lazy, just plain stupid movie thatâs not only not worth your money but certainly not worth your time.\n\nDetroit News",

It puts pressure on politicians to make cycling more accessible.\n\n\"It infuriates me that it's so hard to get the government to fund and prioritise something that has no downsides. Instead we're building more roads while car traffic's dropping. It's ridiculous.\n\n\"The logical thing is to make cycling and walking your preferred transport. You make sure that streets prioritise people over vehicles. You legislate and fund accordingly.\n\nHe added: \"Walking, cycling, public transport, taxis, private cars. In that order. At the moment it's almost totally the other way round. It's not logical or sustainable.\"\n\nBoardman, who besides his world and Olympic titles also wore the leaderâs yellow jersey in the Tour de France and held the UCI Hour record, also said that despite the high profile cycling currently enjoys due to Britainâs sporting success, his main aim was to get people to adopt bicycles as an everyday mode of transport.\n\nEarlier this year, he was at the House of Commons to help launch British Cyclingâs ten-point #ChooseCycling manifesto.",
  "latent_15256": "Itâs True: Crystal Pepsi Is Coming Back For All Those People Who Forgot They Hated It The First Time Around\n\nFor better or worse (mostly worse), Iâve always been a big fan of soda, so when I was a senior in high school in Florida in the early â90s, I was over the moon that my area would get to try Crystal Pepsi before some other parts of the country. Then I tasted the underwhelming clear cola for myself. Now, more than 20 years later, Pepsi gets to introduce a new generation of cola lovers to that same unique disappointment, with a limited time re-release of Crystal Pepsi that weâre pretty sure the world could have done without.\n\nIn a press release apparently written by someone who either has no memory of the 1990s or doesnât understand what âiconicâ means, PepsiCo says that âoverwhelming fan demandâ has given the company no other choice but to fill a few bottles with the âiconic 90s [sic] clear beverage.â\n\nUm, Crystal Pepsi was barely around for a year, and its reputation is primarily that of an overhyped failure, so dubbing the drink âiconicâ is like calling Cop Rock an iconic piece of TV history, or saying Ryan Leaf is a football icon. We guess âinfamousâ or âfrequently mockedâ doesnât read as well in a press release.\n\nRegardless, those who genuinely think they have fond memories of Crystal Pepsi can join those who will purchase it ironically in clamoring for the stuff when 20 oz. bottles hit store shelves July 7, with a scheduled end date of Aug. 8.\n\nWho knows, maybe Iâm just old and bitter and completely wrong. Maybe weâre actually standing on the precipice of a clear cola boom â a true Crystal Pepsi generation.

  "latent_15414": "A/N: Thank you to Challos for editing this chapter. Smoothed it out considerably.\n\nIsra, along with every other prospect in the ballroom, shot up, woken from their slumber by the school bell. He absently rubbed at a spot on his right side, the spot he'd been dreaming about. At least that's not a problem anymore. While they were composing themselves, the intercom switched on and relayed them their instructions for the morning, concluding with the news that initiation would take place at the nearby cliffs.\n\nAppraising the crowd of similarly-dishevelled prospects, Isra chose to forgo breakfast in favour of properly readying himself and finding the locker rooms, which had, according to the intercom, already been assigned. Checking his Scroll for the locker he'd been assigned, he left, now using the map loaded on the scroll to guide him. Not getting caught out again like last night.\n\nHe arrived in the locker room with little distraction, the map of the campus proving invaluable in his efforts to navigate it. As he walked in, a blip echoed from his scroll, a noise soon reciprocated from somewhere in the rows of lockers. Some way to find your locker. Couldn't they just use numbers? His scroll blipped again, and the room echoed the noise in response. Well, let's get hunting, then.\n\nHe wandered the rows for a while, searching for the locker that was making noise in reply to his scroll. As he was about to start waving his scroll indiscriminately over locks in a final attempt to brute-force the location, he was startled by the locker's noise coming from right next to him. Found you at last. Why in Vytal's name did they think that was a good idea? Easier to read numbers than it is to guess sounds.\n\nHe placed his bag on a nearby bench and began to unpack his things, starting with the armour pieces he wasn't already wearing. Once he had the pieces laid out on the bench, he removed the rags and lubricants, placing them in the locker.\n\n\"This is some pretty nice kit. Old, sure, but you've got to respect the classics, right?\"\n\nIsra's head whipped around, revealing the voice to have come from a student â if the uniform was any indication â looking over one of the pauldrons Isra had left on the bench. Isra scowled at the intruder, taking back the pauldron he held.\n\n\"Do Beacon students normally have better?\"\n\nThe student picked up another armour piece before answering the question. \"You think I'm a Beacon student? No. Prospect, just like you.\" He placed the piece back on the bench and extended a hand to Isra. \"Vardan Marist. A pleasure.\"\n\nIsra inspected the boy carefully, surprised that his initial appraisal was wrong. \"Isra Feher. Your gear looks a lot like the Beacon uniform.\"\n\nVardan chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck. \"That's actually what I was going for. You know, in case wearing the uniform is required all the time. May as well be comfortable.\"\n\n\"You think the regular uniform wouldn't be?\"\n\n\"Isra, have you seen the way the actual students walk around? That's not comfort, that's rigidity.\"\n\n\"Trust me, man, that's probably heaven compared to some things I've worn.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. So, where'd you come from?\"\n\n\"School-wise?\" A nod from Vardan confirmed the intent of the question. \"That's a long story, actually.\"\n\nVardan looked around the room, then at his scroll, before taking a seat. \"We've got ten minutes until initiation begins. Hit me with it.\"\n\nIsra turned around, returning to his things to hide the frown. Damn. Hoped I could get out of that. \"Alright, it's not a long story. I haven't been to a combat school. Never have.\"\n\n\"Never have? How'd you get in here then?\"\n\n\"Luck, mainly. Ozpin thought I was good enough for Beacon without the pre-requisites.\"\n\n\"You think he was wrong?\"\n\nIsra raised an eyebrow. \"Noâ¦ why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Easy way to get a read on somebody. Besides, if you didn't think you could get through initiation, you probably wouldn't be here.\"\n\nIsra nodded slowly, strapping on his armour as he turned to face Vardan again. \"Uh-huh. You make a habit of 'reading' people?\"\n\n\"Just those I've met.\" Vardan's scroll buzzed and a girl's face appeared on it. \"Speaking of, we should probably get going. You or me, doesn't really matter.\"\n\n\"Not getting away that easy, Vardi!\"\n\nVardan paled as the shout echoed through the locker room. \"Oh no.\" He looked Isra in the eyes. \"Run. Run as fast as you can.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nVardan nervously glanced towards the entrance. \"She's probably a little too much for you to handle.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"ME!\" A girl yelled from the start of the row, sprinting down and leaping at Vardan. Vardan quickly glanced at her and leapt up on top of one of the nearby lockers, leaving the girl to catch herself in a roll further down the row.\n\n\"Going to have to be more subtle than that, Rox. By the way, Isra, meet Roxane Mallor. She's a little eccentric.\"\n\nRoxane walked back to them, dusting herself off as Vardan slid down off the locker he'd retreated to. \"You know me, Vardi. Subtlety's never been my strong suit. And don't call me 'eccentric'. I prefer 'unusual'.\" She nodded at Isra. \"Who's your new friend?\"\n\n\"Isra Feher, Miss Mallor. At your service.\" Isra mockingly bowed as he spoke.\n\n\"Vardi, what have you told this guy about me?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Rox. Just that you're eccentric. Not a word about your family so far.\"\n\nRoxane looked at Vardan sceptically as he responded. \"Rightâ¦ Word of advice, Isra, don't say 'at your service' to anyone in my family. They'll take you at face value.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\nRoxane shrugged, turning her attention fully to Isra. \"Yep. That's the sort of thing that happens when your family's Mistral aristocracy for the past nine generations. My parents never went in for that stuff â part of the reason why they moved to Vale â but I've got a slew of relatives who come to visit every once in a while that really miss having servants.\"\n\n\"As somebody who made that mistake once, let me just confirm Rox's claim. You do not want to imply to any Mallor that's not Rox or her parents that you are beneath them. They won't let you forget it.\"\n\n\"Vardi, don't say anything more. I'm sure Isra understood what I was saying perfectly well without you backing me up. Right?\"\n\nIsra looked between the two, uncertain of how to respond, before settling on siding with Vardan. \"You made your point pretty clear, but I think Vardan really cemented just how important it was. Even if he was a little vague.\"\n\nRoxane cocked an eyebrow. \"Not often that happens, Vardi. People are pretty happy to take my side in our discussions. You've found somebody rare here.\" She placed one hand on Isra's shoulder, locking eyes with him as she continued.\n\n\"But maybe, perhaps, he might see there's more merit in my side than he thought.\" Her eyes glowed a dark purple as her grip on his shoulder tightened and a faint whispering made itself known in Isra's head.\n\nHold onâ¦ Is sheâ¦ Alright, let's put an end to this before it starts. There is nothing here that I want to share. Isra reached out and took Roxane's other hand, focusing on the slight tingling that surrounded her. Come on, now, your Semblance can't be that hard to dupe if you're trying to run it on me. He felt the tingling grow more intense as his Aura merged itself with hers, growing to a crescendo before falling to a stop as he mirrored her Semblance.\n\nHis eyes glowed a slightly bluer shade of purple as he put her Semblance to use counteracting her. \"I'm sure you're a very convincing person when you need to be, Roxane. But for now I'll settle for you getting out of my head.\" He grinned as he saw the shocked expression on Roxane's face and slowly lifted her hand off his shoulder.\n\n\"That'sâ¦ Vardi, tell me I'm not imagining things.\"\n\nVardan, who'd contented himself with watching the display, smiled at Isra's response before confirming Roxane's observation. \"Yep, that just happened. You've met somebody who can say 'no' to you, Rox. Told you charisma was essential.\"\n\n\"Shut it. If I want to hear how great you are with people, I'll ask. Bigger things to deal with for now.\"\n\n\"Like how this is the fifth guy you've tried that on who's denied you? I've been telling you ever since we got here that this'd happen. People here are going to be dedicated. Sure, there's going to be a few with doubts, but not nearly enough to make it worthwhile. My advice? Become a better speaker or stick with Grimm.\"\n\nIsra raised an eyebrow at Vardan's remark. \"'Stick with Grimm'? Does her Semblance work better with them or something?\"\n\n\"Little more than that.\" Roxane glanced down at the floor as she collected herself, returning her gaze to Isra when she'd recovered. \"But that's not important right now. What is important is how you just did that. Start talking.\"\n\nIsra returned Roxane's glare with amusement, glancing at Vardan with a raised eyebrow. \"She's serious, isn't she?\"\n\n\"Pretty serious, yeah. Unless you think you can pull that off again, I'd get talking.\"\n\nIsra looked at Roxane, handles of weapons just barely protruding from beneath her coat. Hell, humour them. It's only fair. \"So you want to know what I did. It's simple, really, no more difficult than your Semblance. I can imitate the Semblance of anyone I touch. Is it perfect? Not unless I'm still touching them. The moment I break contact, it gets weaker over the next four hours, then it dies. As an example, one Semblance I cloned was 'Impulse'. It let you create points of incredible force on things. The master copy â the guy who had this Semblance naturally â could cave in a wall with a finger. He'd just tap the wall and the wall would just begin to crack and splinter â even with concrete walls â until it exploded, always away from him. I grabbed it once, for a quick bit of fun, and I didn't have nearly the same results. Best I could do was splinter wood. Nowhere near the potential of this guy.\"\n\nVardan raised an eyebrow, glancing down at his hands for a moment before looking back up at Isra. \"Sounds like a cool Semblance.\"\n\n\"Cool, but hampered. If it was one-to-one replication, then it'd be cool. This is just a useful one.\"\n\nRoxane cut back in on the discussion. \"You still haven't explained how you knew what I was doing.\"\n\n\"Glowing eyes, noises in my head and a physical bridge â that's your hand on my shoulder, by the way â tends to paint a picture that says 'I'm going to try and mess with your head'. You're not the first person who's tried something like that on me.\"\n\n\"But it was working on you?\"\n\n\"There were whispers telling me 'obey', I felt a compelling need to go along with you, I just happen to be less-than-receptive to that kind of persuasion. So yes, it did work for a bit.\"\n\nRoxane looked down at her hand, watching as her palm took on a purple glow. \"Well, it's not supposed to be just whispers; you're supposed to feel a little pain if you disagree.\" She shook the glow from her hand and looked up at Isra, eyes wide with anticipation. \"Want to try it again?\"\n\nIsra nervously smiled back at the girl and shook his head. \"I'd really rather not.\" Like hell am I letting her back in there. She wasn't expecting resistance the first time. Now she's prepared for it. \"Besides, Vardan said something about your Semblance working better with Grimm. Care to elaborate on that?\"\n\nRoxane frowned, disappointed that she wouldn't get to test herself again. \"Yeah, my Semblance works better on Grimm. Gives me almost-unlimited control over them, as long as I can get within touching distance.\"\n\n\"Not all Grimm, though. Rox learned that pretty fast.\"\n\nRoxane shut her eyes and took a deep breath, her voice wavering slightly. \"Vardi, I'm going to ask you to shut up. That is not something I'd like to revisit.\"\n\nVardan nodded, leaning back against a locker. \"Yep. Sorry, Rox. Isra, if you want to know about it, come find me after initiation.\"\n\nRoxane sighed, her voice steadying. \"I'd rather you didn't tell him, but there's not a lot I can do to convince you otherwise, is there?\"\n\nVardan shrugged, a tired tone entering his voice. \"If you were a little more adventurous, then maybe you could convince me. But as it stands, no, there isn't. Besides, it's an interesting story.\"\n\n\"It was a nightmare. Nothing more, nothing less. And don't give me the 'adventurous' crap again. I'm plenty adventurous, just not where it seems to matter to you.\"\n\nIsra stepped back, finishing his preparations as the two continued to bicker. Once he'd comfortably assessed the fit of the remaining pieces, he finally intervened in their argument. \"Hey, you two. Could you both take a minute to realise you've got an audience here and shut up? Don't get me wrong, your disagreement makes for amazing background noise, but I'd love to be able to hear any notifications about where and when initiation is taking place.\"\n\nThe two paused in their speech to look at Isra in silence before Roxane replied. \"You don't have to stick around here either. In the interests of me and Vardi continuing to argue, I'm going to ask you to leave if our 'disagreement' annoys you that much.\"\n\n\"He's got a point, Rox. We've burnedâ¦\" Vardan trailed off as he checked his scroll. \"We've burned six minutes here talking. Initiation's at the cliffs, which is a bit of a walk, and we've got four minutes to get there. I say we put this on hold for later and make tracks. Work for you?\"\n\nRoxane glanced at Isra, then back at Vardan before nodding. \"Yep. Let's go.\"\n\nIsra walked slower than his companions, letting them take the lead and affording him the opportunity to get a full visual inspection of their gear. Know thy enemy, even if they aren't your enemy. Never fails. He started with Roxane, inspecting her clothes for any additions or alterations that might seem unusual.\n\nLet's seeâ¦ long coat, unbuttoned. I saw her weapons back in the locker room, with the holsters on the inside of that coat, so it's not going to be buttoned up. Rest of her clothing seems a little loose. Not ill-fitting, but billowy. Like she wants to look a little bigger than she is. Probably not looking to fight people, at any rate. Too easy to get a good grip on loose pants and blouses and the like.\n\nThe haircut's about the only thing that shows she's put any thought into fighting people, now that I look at it. Nice and short â no grip possibility there. Now for Vardan. I don't care what he says about Beacon's uniform being uncomfortable, trying to clone it's only going to be troublesome.\n\nHe switched his view to the brown-clad boy, debating his choice of attire as he looked. Red hair. Long red hair. He smirked as he worked his way down. Longer than Roxane's, funnily enough. Wonder if that comes up between them. As for his gear, that looks like it belongs in an office. Tie, waistcoat, dress shirt, jacket, slacks â are the Marists some kind of business tycoons or something?\n\n\"Hey, Isra! You having trouble keeping up or something?\"\n\nIsra snapped out of his assessment at the question. \"Huh, what? Oh, no. Justâ¦ lost in my thoughts. How much further to the cliffs?\"\n\n\"Just over this rise. Put a bit of speed on, though. We're down to two minutes and I don't think they take kindly to latecomers.\"\n\n\"It's a miracle they let you in then, Rox.\"\n\nIsra rolled his eyes. Didn't take them long to get back to sniping at each other.\n\n\"Not now, Vardi. You want to start taking cheap shots like that, you can start once initiation's started. Let's just make sure Isra doesn't go wandering off first.\"\n\nVardan shrugged, nodding at Isra's armour. \"I'm sure he can handle himself.\"\n\nRoxane glanced sceptically at Vardan. \"The last person you thought could 'handle themselves' wound up with Dust-based injuries across his torso and right arm. Forgive me if I don't trust your opinion on these things.\"\n\nIsra shook his head as he walked between the two, leaving them to their bickering as he joined the small crowd before them. His respite from conversation proved short-lived, however, as a voice came from behind him.\n\n\"You lookâ¦ different.\"\n\nIsra turned his head in the direction of the voice, revealing it to have come from a girl about his height with dark hair that almost seemed to glow. \"Same can be said for you.\"\n\nThe girl smiled bemusedly. \"I'll take that as a compliment. So, Knight-in-not-so-shining-armour, what brings you to Beacon?\"\n\nIsra chuckled at the name his new conversational partner had invented for him. \"It's Isra. And why I'm at Beacon isâ¦ not exactly a story I'm willing to share. I'm sure you understand.\"\n\nThe girl leaned back on her heels, eyebrow raised. \"Secret, huh? Fair enough. We've all got our skeletons and other unpleasantries. Eira Sable. Pleasure to meet you, Isra. Pardon me if I don't shake hands.\"\n\n\"Isra Feher, if we're going for surnames. And I don't blame you for that. What brings you to Beacon?\"\n\n\"Love to tell you, Izzie, but it seems like Professor Ozpin's about to start. Wouldn't want to talk over him.\"\n\nIsra shot Eira an annoyed look before turning to face the front of the crowd where, true to Eira's claim, Ozpin stood, ready to speak.\n\n\"For years, you have trained to fight. Whether in a tournament capacity, with aims of joining the military or to become a Huntsman proper, Beacon will not discriminate. Neither will our test. Over the years, you have doubtless accumulated skill enough to be considered for this esteemed school, and that skill will be proven below, in the Emerald Forest.\"\n\nThe professor motioned to the vast expanse of green behind him. \"Now, many of you will have heard about how initiation works from the students here. More of you will be aware of the teams that we organise students into. The organisation of such teams will take place in the forest.\" He paused, allowing the prospects a moment of respite to organise themselves and try to pick out their teams in advance.\n\n\"You think he'll let us pick our own, Izzie?\"\n\n\"It's just Isra, Eira. And I think there's more to this than he's told us.\"\n\n\"Good to see I'm not the only one who thinks that.\"\n\nA woman standing next to Professor Ozpin, who Isra quickly recognised as Professor Goodwitch, began to speak. Man, how much does she do around here? She handled entry, she's handling initiationâ¦ Is Ozpin just a figurehead or something?\n\n\"Do not believe that teams will be left entirely to your discretion, as that is not the case. Your teams will be assigned based on a set of criteria that you will be graded on. However, you will have the opportunity to select your partner down in the forest.\" Another ripple of happiness spread through the group as she said that.\n\n\"More to come again?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\nEira and Isra exchanged a curt smile as Professor Goodwitch continued. \"Your partner will be the first person you interact with in the forest. Be it through trading blows, escaping Grimm, or simply chance, you will be stuck with that person for the next four years. I would suggest you prepare yourself to be partnered with anyone here.\"\n\nOzpin sipped from his mug as sounds of disappointment and more plans were made by the gathered prospects. \"After you've found a partner, make your way to the northern edge of the forest. You will find a temple there containing several relics. You and your partner are to select a relic and then return to the cliff top. Your choice of relic, as well as your conduct within the forest, will be taken into consideration for your grading.\" Sounds of disappointment soon turned to worry.\n\n\"A final warning: Grimm will be present in the forest. They will have no hesitation in fighting you. They will have even less in killing you. It is expected that you will defend yourselves to the best of your ability.\"\n\nSurveying the crowd, he finished with a simple question. \"Does anyone have any questions regarding this exercise?\" He smiled, noticing the lack of response. \"Good.\" He gestured to the stone platforms behind him. \"Assume your positions.\"\n\nIsra looked around as everyone shifted themselves in preparation for the beginning. Looking to his right, he saw Vardan grinning. \"How is this fun to you?\"\n\n\"You've got to admit there's a rush to being flung over a forest, Isra.\"\n\n\"For you, maybe. Look at me. There's not going to be much flying with me.\" To reinforce his point, he waved a hand over the full plate armour he was clad in.\n\n\"Hah. Yeah, I can see that being a problem.\" A pair of knives appeared in Vardan's hands. \"Tell you what, if I see you come down, I'll make sure you're still breathing.\"\n\n\"What, you'll partner with me?\"\n\n\"Rox could do with the socialising. Besides, she's not exactly helpless down there, if the Grimm thing was true.\"\n\n\"Right. She can get inside their heads or something, yeah?\"\n\n\"Dominate them. If she wants one to dance, she can make it dance. That kind of thing. Good luck.\"\n\nIsra raised an eyebrow at the addendum to Vardan's explanation, only for the ground to suddenly vanish from beneath him as he was catapulted into the air. Should've prepared for that.",

What do you like to do? Where did you go to college? Who do you know here?\n\nWhat theyâre really doing, is probing to find a shared interest or a common ground. And, if theyâre successful, a little click happens.\n\nThat little click is precisely what PR can facilitate by identifying what people already want and then connecting it to what you want them to want. And donât underestimate that connection. Itâs strong. Itâs an authentic level of relationship between you and your customer that no other medium can achieve at scale. A paid advertisement can support click moments, but not induce them very easily. It is at this intersection â where common ground is identified and a click happens â that you can actually work to change what someone wants. And hereâs how to do it.\n\nThen vs. Now.\n\nThe Cloud by The Fox And King\n\nTen years ago PR was reliant on the all-powerful press release. Social media wasnât dominant back then. Things are a little different nowadays, but the essence of PR hasnât changed. We now have an opportunity to engage and relate directly with customers through social media. Remember: social media itself is neutral. Itâs just an interface through which relationships are facilitated. And thatâs nothing to be afraid of!\n\nFact: ten years ago, there were 150,000 journalists in the United States. Today there are less than 50,000, even though there are more than 5 times the number of media publications than there were a decade ago. These days, reporters donât have time for the volume of incoming requests from those seeking attention from the media. Itâs only a select few of the most energetic PR dynamos who have backstage access to the top reporters, and this is a full time occupation. For the rest of us, backstage access is closed. But shhh. Thereâs another way to get backstage, and identifying it is our work in this article.\n\nWhy are press releases significant?\n\nContrary to popular notion, the intent of PR is not is not necessarily publication in the WSJ or NYT, especially when youâre interested in reaching a lot of peopleâ¦ but itâs the rotation thatâs triggered by the press release. Even PR repositories like Yahoo will likely be socialized and that puts things into rotation on social media. Itâs all about the rotation.\n\nWhat do reporters want to write about?\n\nIdentifying and then delivering the story a reporter needs, well that backstage pass is nearly ours. And what a reporter needs is a relevant, credible story. A story thatâs relates to trend or an industry theyâre focused on. A reporter doesnât want fluff or waffle â obviously. They also donât want jargon nor superlative â âawesome this, and fantastic that.â Stay credible, relevant and current. Letâs look at exactly what this means.\n\nTo come up with a story, look at what influencers are talking about in your industry. Hereâs where your story begins. Next up is taking\n\nThe characters in your story are a) current trends and b) an industry-changing aspect of your product or creation. Your story will need to stitch together a) and b) in a believable and matter-of-fact way and voila, relevance is born. You now have a story. After all, the reporters who you want to get your story will be looking out for these important factors: a current event or a breaking trend â and a good story to hang the event or trend on to. You want the effect on the reporter to be, âThis is going to be someone that Iâm going to want to write about.â\n\nItâs worth mentioning that you donât always need to give reporters stories about you or your product. If you have your ear to the ground, you can also just give a reporter a news tip. Itâs a kindness, and helping journalists with scoops creates a strong bond with the reporter. Now youâre someone the media wants to come back to, and now you have your backstage pass.\n\nWhat if Iâm a startup without a brand or credibility.\n\nAs a startup with no brand or market credibility, you have the opportunity to get coverage through contributed articles. All major publications are desperate for these because journalists and reporters donât have the mental resources these days to write about, let alone learn about, all the new movements being hatched and all the new stuff being made. When you contribute an article, it has the same weight as earned media because it has the blessing of the publication itself. And the best part? You donât need a reporter, you can do it yourself.\n\nMaking PR click.\n\nIllustration by The Fox And King\n\nTo make connection points that click, do the following:\n\nAsk yourself whatâs a major issue or trend in your industry that youâre trying to change or fix? Not technical or specific or too granular but rather think big: industry, world, life, business, health. Find a trend that you can jump onto thatâs just breaking in among social media influencers within your industry. Social media influencers are usually the highly opinionated bloggers with lots of followers. Connect what theyâre trending or talking about right now to what your product can do, and make it into a pitch thatâs simple and articulate â and free of superlative.\n\nThe effect is not only good fodder, but this also facilitates the need of a reporters whose ability to be first-to-tell is key to their own credibility. It also gives you one opportunity after another to keep coming out with new stories by simply taking a trend, and connecting it with how your product is innovating or making change in its industry. Click.\n\nWhere to be seen?\n\nAre you conscious of what is your audience is reading? Are they looking at Forbs? Techcrunch? Or Medium and Twitter? Are they only reading industry publications and local news?\n\nWell, if itâs all of the above, your tactic should be the famed ð¥firestormð¥ technique: you identify your target, and you surround them with media from multiple sources. Social media, big publications, local ones, industry journals etc. all as part of your strategy. This multi-pronged approach forms the impression that âyouâre everywhereâ which is very good for credibility.\n\nHow the blogger sphere works.\n\nChurn by The Fox And King\n\nThis sphere can be divided into two:\n\n1. Blogs that weâre all familiar with, like Mashable, Techcrunch etc. but they really function like journalists. They tell us whatâs hot.\n\n2. There are hundreds of organic blogsâ¦ they are called âinfluencersâ. They tell us their opinions.\n\nThese little industry influencers are what many reporters rely on in order to validate their stories. Consider them third-party validators. Why? Because theyâre theyâre authentic, honest and opinionated and well, 3rd party.\n\nResearch firms like Forrester are called analysts (as opposed to influencers) and are another source of 3rd party validation. Both influencers as well as analysts function as early warning signals of upcoming trends that will likely precede those of which TechCrunch and Mashable will be looking for.\n\nGetting in early is key to identifying the right influencers can be a firehose of ideas for your press releases that click.\n\nThe three types of media.\n\nBack To The Future by The Fox And King\n\nEarned Media â the media you get placed through personal effort.\n\nThis includes social media shares, reposts, reviews, mentions.\n\nPaid Media â the media you get placed through your hard earned cash.\n\nThis includes paying for clicks, display ads, retargeting and even paying influencers influencers. Paid content promotion and social ads are part of this too.\n\nOwned media â making a destination of your web and social media properties.\n\nThis includes your website, your social media properties and your blog.\n\nWhat kind of content should we put out?\n\nSocial content, ad content, PR content, industry and product announcements, promotions more. Content can also be thought leadership driven â sharing insights and expert ideas. How do you choose what content youâre going to use your valuable time creating? Well, the answer is the content youâre most equipped to put create. You donât have to do it all. You just need to focus on one thing thatâs within your scope and just do it. If you spread yourself too thin, youâll end up neglecting doing any of it.\n\nHave you ever considered doing a Twitter Round Table?\n\nAhhh HAH! by The Fox And King\n\nA Twitter Round Table is an organized a discussion within a particular industry on a topic where you present ideas and get a couple influencers to participate. Conjuring up and hosting an online event like this requires nothing but simply doing it. Identifying and then inviting influential Tweeters is appealing and amusing for any industry audience and sets your social brand to âneutral.â Your audience finds this neutrality valuable because itâs safe and nurtures conversation. In other words, your social media presence isnât all about prodding and promoting, which is very one dimensional.\n\nThe value of the CEO to the press.\n\nFired Up by The Fox And King\n\nThe CEO has to have the time and willingness to parley on any topic or any story that the reporter is writing about. It doesnât really matter if youâre the world expert in a given topic, as long as you can speak with confidence and strong opinion.\n\nAs a CEO, when a reporter is covering a given topic even if itâs at best remotely related to your story, your job is to support their story through your lense. What youâre doing is using hijacking in a sense, the trending news topic as the common ground in order to facilitate the story needed to make a click. Youâre also helping a reporter out.\n\nWith the CEOâs presence, credibility is more easily and quickly acquired. My advice to all CEOs is to go out and be a thought leader by connecting current trends to how your ideas are changing things within your particular industry.\n\nChannel and venue overload.\n\nCloudy by The Fox And King\n\nGiven the sheer volume of channels, itâs overwhelming to keep up with. When I see CEOs spending all day on LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram etc., I ask myself how theyâre effectively running their company. And the truth is theyâre probably not. One way to navigate this is to share the burden in your entire organization and get them to post. You can use a tool like Yala to manage that collaboration on Slack. Of course, if youâre going to have the whole company posting, you first need a policy about style, voice, subjects etc.\n\nTwitter: hot or not?\n\nAs far as earned media, Twitter is by far the most pervasive and itâs going anywhere in the immediate future. Granted, Twitterâs viability is in question but who caresâ¦ let the academics banter it out. If youâre engaging influencers, media, Twitter is the place to do it. Twitter is huge. Customers use the phone, they use email. Businesses, thought leaders, the media and influencers all use Twitter right now.\n\nGet an influencer without spending much.\n\nIf youâre bootstrapping, regarding paid media, brand-ambassadors are perhaps the most bang for your buck. Bloggers who are hungry for money and have a big following are often eager to be an ambassador for your brand. For $500 or so, you can get ambassadorship at events and tradeshows, via social media. It can be tricky to track the value here so proceed with caution, but a good ambassador can drive lots of love.\n\nThree kinds of social media.\n\nUsing the news\n\nLook at the current news, steal a topic thatâs envogue, connect it to your story in a way thatâs amusing or informative.\n\nUsing competitors\n\nLook at competitive landscape, and see what your competitors are blabbing about. You can also harness negative sentiments to address them to your advantage.\n\nUsing the public\n\nLook at what articles or industry stuff youâre reading. Let ideas from trending articles inform your social media. Donât pressure yourself in trying to come up with posts from scratch. Create debates and dialogue on this material.\n\nNever a monologue\n\nJust do not talk to yourself on Twitter. You need to identify where your audience is receptive and attentive and share their space.\n\nThe Tools people use.\n\nSet Phasers to Stun by The Fox And King\n\nHere are some tools the pros use:\n\nPR dashboard\n\nMeltwater, SeeDepth, Trendkite\n\nMedia and Influencer management\n\nSprinklr, Vision, Augure\n\nSocial media management and monitoring\n\nSprout Social, Simply Measured, Oktopost\n\nLight Management\n\nBuffer, Hootsuite, Yala (yep, thatâs us).\n\nContent Publishing\n\nCurata, Kapost, Hootsuite, Buffer, Yala.\n\nOne final comment about social media: content is still the most important asset.\n\nWhen youâre doing social, see to it that the information you put out is valuable, sincere, honest. Things like debates and round tables are superb additions to your strategy.\n\nLessons for us.\n\nJust Keep Swimming by The Fox And King\n\nPR and social media are often misunderstood by small businesses but because thereâs no cheaper way of getting publicity off the ground. That, and the fact that nothing has the value and the impact of PR so if youâre a small business or someone just starting outâ¦ just start somewhere â anywhere, and just keep swimming!",
  "latent_15597": "Yesterday, I posted the Pro Football Focus ratings for the Raiders' entire depth chart. It seems whenever fans agree with their findins, they are a good source, and when they don't agree, it's \"what do they know?\" and the usual misunderstanding of why exactly we tend to trust their ratings over most. It's because they're completely objective and based on analyzing each individual play.\n\nUsing it to predict future performance is another story. The results don't consider things like injuries, difficult circumstances, or progress throughout a season. They can't because it would mean making a judgment call and that doesn't fit the straightforward analysis.\n\nNot surprisingly, the poll results have most Raiders fans saying the depth chart rankings were \"Too negative overall\". Fans always think that because they are prone to the bright side and giving the benefit of the doubt to those players wearing the uniform of their favorite team.\n\nWith that said, there are a few players who have a very good chance of outplaying their current ratings which are based mostly upon each player's 2013 performance.\n\nQB Matt Schaub\n\nPFF rating: Below Average Starter\n\nIf you go solely on his numbers last year, below average actually seems pretty generous. But over his career, he has been at least a good starting NFL quarterback if not high quality. I have actually seen a few commenters say something to the effect \"At his worst, Schaub is average.\" No, at his worst he is absolutely terrible. We JUST saw this. He threw six pick sixes last season in eight starts. That isn't average by any stretch. While I don't expect Schaub to revert to his Pro Bowl ways this season, he is just a season removed from that level of play so it seems difficult to believe he would simply fall off the cliff, never to return.\n\nTE David Ausberry\n\nPFF rating: Below Average Starter\n\nTechnically, Ausberry didn't have a 2013, but he gets a rating none the less because he had played the two previous seasons. Ausberry took a while to get on track as an NFL tight end. It appeared as if he had figured things out last training camp and was easily the starter. That plan was upended when he was... and landed on his shoulder, placing him on injured reserve. Many have said he should get a \"not enough information\" but I completely disagree and here's why: He was active the previous two entire seasons. Just because we didn't see much from him doesn't mean we don't have the information we need. What it means is he wasn't good enough to see the field. Even \"Below Average Starter(s)\" have more than nine career catches over 28 career games. The reason I see him outplaying that is because we have seen what he is capable of doing when he gets it right. This former receiver has the necessary hands and speed and as of last off-season, he had put on the necessary weight as well. In last year's camp, he had clearly improved his blocking and that was half his issue before. If he is healthy, I have little doubt he will outplay his current rating.\n\nP Marquette King\n\nPFF rating: Poor Starter\n\nThis is simply a case of early 2013 versus late 2013. King was struggling to find his footing (so to speak) as a first year NFL player at a position he hadn't played for very many years. He had the booming leg but had yet to catch up with the nuances of the game. He would just launch it and hope for the best, often outkicking his coverage or kicking a touchback that resulted in a pathetic net yardage average. But he improved greatly over the second half of the season, so much so I am surprised he wasn't able to ultimately make up for his early season struggles. He finished the season averaging the highest gross yards per punt average (48.9) in the league. He did this despite being second in the league over the first half of the season in touchbacks. All he needs to do now is continue to punt as he did over the latter half of last season and he would be considered at least average. If he continues on the same progress trajectory, we could see him more highly rated than that by season's end.\n\nFollow @LeviDamien",
  "latent_15642": "If you were born after February 1985, youâve never lived through a month of below average global temperatures. According to new data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in June the earthâs surface was warmer than the 20th century average for the month for the 340th time in a row. It was the fifth hottest June since 1918, NOAA said. (An analysis from NASA says the month was the second hottest since 1880.)\n\nAn entire generation has grown up during this streak of hot weather, which Philip Bump, who now writes for the Atlantic Wire, pointed out in the online environmental magazine Grist last year. The last time the global average of land and ocean temperatures was below long-term levels was in February 1985. The United Nations reported earlier in July that more countries have seen record-breaking temperatures in the first decade of this century than ever before. This month, northern Canada, northwestern Russia, southern Japan, the Philippines, southwestern China, and central-southern Africa all saw unprecedented temperatures for the month, according to NOAA.\n\nStill, it wasnât hot everywhere. Spain saw its coolest June sine 1997. Temperatures in the UK were also lower, about 0.2 degrees celsius (0.4 degrees fahrenheit) below than the long-term average for the month. (A slew of retailers, including spanish clothing company Inditex, said rainy and cool summer weather in Europe was to blame for slower sales for the quarter.)\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Red indicates the warmest temperatures on record. Pink signifies temperatures âmuch warmer than averageâ and light pink means âwarmer than average,â according to NOAA.\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration â\n\nWeâve already seen some of the effects of a warmer world. Since the early 20th century, the average world temperature has risen by about 0.8 degrees celsius, or 1.4 degrees fahrenheit. Researchers have recorded higher rates of hospitalization and crime. Thanks to melting ice caps in the Arctic, shipping has quadrupled just in the the last year. And last year, warmer temperatures and higher sea levels arguably turned a hurricane that hit the eastern US into a âfrankenstorm.â\n\nThe United Nations has warned that the average temperature could increase by 4 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100, which some researchers say will wreak further havoc, causing extreme temperatures, lower crop yields, damage to ocean ecosystems and human health risks.",
  "latent_15692": "Related Press Release\n\nOn November 8, the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute, a case challenging Ohioâs practice of purging voters. According to a friend-of-the-court brief filed by Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) Educational Fund, People For the American Way Foundation, and sixteen other organizations, removing voters from the rolls in the aggressive way that Ohio has for years is particularly harmful to Asian Americans and Latinx people. Our introduction follows below. Click here to download a PDF copy of the full brief.\n\nOhioâs Supplemental Process purports to purge from its rolls those voters who have moved, but, in reality, it targets voters for failure to vote in violation of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA). And, in doing so, the Supplemental Process disproportionately affects Asian Americans and Latinos.\n\nAsian American and Latino registrants vote at lower rates than the rest of the U.S. population. Because of their lower voting rates, Asian Americans and Latinos are more likely to be subject to Ohioâs Supplemental Process and purged from the registration lists than any other racial group.\n\nAsian Americans and Latinos already encounter a number of barriers to voting. For one, a large percentage of the U.S. population is comprised of Asian Americans and Latinos for whom English is not their first language and who may not be fluent in English. As a result, English-only election-related mailings create a barrier to access and comprehension which disenfranchises limited English proficient (LEP) voters, many of whom are Asian American and/or Latino. Notably, Ohioâs Confirmation Notice, which explains the steps voters must take to avoid removal pursuant to the Supplemental Process and the consequences of failing to respond, is generally provided in English only. Asian Americans and Latinos also face the brunt of other constraints that the state places on voting. Ohioâs Supplemental Process is just one of a slate of policies on registration and voting that have impeded the ability of otherwise eligible Asian Americans and Latinos to register and vote.\n\nIn light of the barriers discussed herein, once purged, it is unlikely that many Asian Americans and Latinos will re-register, return to the polls, or, even if they attempt to vote, be allowed to cast a ballot. This is exactly the disenfranchisement that Congress warned about when enacting the NVRA, especially with respect to low-income voters and those facing language barriers.\n\nOhio over purges registered voters because its Supplemental Process is not tailored to remove people who have moved. Indeed, the Supplemental Process has resulted in the purging of thousands of people based on Ohioâs faulty premise that these voters moved. This requires the thousands of purged people to re-register, even though their residence has not changed since they last voted. At best, the Supplemental Process is an overly-broad solution to a relatively minor problem that removes voters, particularly Asian Americans and Latinos, for not voting, a result that Congress explicitly prohibited. Accordingly, the Court should uphold the decision of the Sixth Circuit.",

  "latent_16049": "Art of Living (AoL) foundation on Friday expressed its inability to pay the \"remaining green fine\" of Rs 4.75 Crore to the National Green Tribunal that was levied against it in leu of alleged environment destruction caused by its World Culture Festival on the Yamuna floodplanes last month.\n\nThe foundation said it can only give a bank guarantee for it.\n\nPetitioner Manoj Misra's lawyer, Sanjay Parikh, has alleged that Art of Living did not intend to pay the penalty and was only \"beating around the bush\" since beginning of the case.\n\nâThey are doing so consistently from the very beginning. First they lied to the court in a sense that they don't have money to pay for the environment destruction, their event had caused. Although the ministry of culture had released Rs.1.5 Crore for the event, but they told the court that they don't have any money and got away by paying just Rs. 25 Lakhs in place of Rs.5 Crore,â Parikh said.\n\nThe development comes amid reports of ISIS threats to AoL head Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.\n\nParikh also expressed the apprehension that AoL was trying to get the March 9 NGT order nullified. The NGT in its judgment had established that there was âenvironment destruction caused to Yamuna Flood plains by the World Culture Festivalâ and instructed a principal committee âto verify the quantum of destruction occurred after inspecting.â\n\nâAoL knows that principle committee's report will be against them. So they are creating hurdles in their inspection. Now they are saying that they will decide on their own if at all any destruction has been caused to the flood planes by their event,â Parikh Said.\n\nMeanwhile, officials from Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) confirmed, âthey are not ready with the inspection report yet\".\n\nThe NGT committee comprised officials from DPCC, National Pollution Control Board, ministry of Environment and Forest Conservation and union Water Resource ministry.\n\nAoL, though, countered the allegations insisting they have no hesitation to pay the money. \"We have only asked for a change in the modalities of payment.â\n\nThe change, according to them: âWe have no objection to pay the penalty if at all any damage has been done to the flood planes. We have just informed the NGT that we may like to pay in form of a Bank Gurantee than cash in this case,â AoL lawyer Akshama Nath said.\n\nReplying to the question on creating hindrance in the way of NGT committee's inspection, Nath blamed the delay in preparing the report on âinter-departmental mis-communication.â\n\nâThere was some confusion among the officials who visited the site for inspection and the higher up in the hierarchy of their department,â Nath said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Delhi Development Authority has also expressed apprehensions that AoL may not pay the penalty to restore the damage done to the flood planes. They said a bank guarantee was not enough.\n\nâIf they had to do so they would have done that long back. The three weeks for paying full fine of Rs. 5 crore lapsed on April 1.

  "latent_16135": "Uber is alleged to have used a piece of software called Hell to secretly monitor the locations of taxi drivers working for rival ride-sharing company, Lyft.\n\nAccording to an unnamed person who was involved in the programme and another who was briefed about it, Uber used Hell to monitor the driving habits of Lyft drivers, especially those who worked for both Lyft and Uber, The Information reports.\n\nThe software enabled Uber to create fake passenger accounts and see how many Lyft drivers were available for rides in a specific area, and what they were charging. By cross-referencing this with Uber's own driver data it was able to determine which drivers were 'double-dipping' and working for both companies at once.\n\nIn addition to this, Uber discovered a vulnerability in Lyft's system which allowed it to see driver ID tokens, a unique number given to each Lyft driver which does not change. This, the sources claim, made it easier for Uber to track the location and driving habits of workers they sought to lure away from Lyft.\n\nThere is nothing preventing drivers from doing this common practice, but Uber wanted to use Hell to find out who the double-dippers were, then offer then incentives to part with Lyft and use Uber exclusively. The software got its name off the back of Uber's 'God View' programme, a tool for tracking customer location in real time, but which was abused by Uber staff and used to track celebrities and former partners.\n\nUber is alleged to have used Hell until early 2016, by which time only a few people inside the company knew about it, including chief executive Travis Kalanick, the sources claim. Lawyers who have previously represented Uber said that, if the allegations about Hell are proven to be true, Uber could face civil legal claims including breach of contract, unfair business practices, stealing trade secrets and violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\nUber is refusing to comment on internal policy, while Lyft said: \"We are in a competitive industry. However, if true, these allegation are very concerning.\"\n\nUber's annus horribilis\n\nThis reports comes after months of bad press for Uber. The company began 2017 by coughing up $20m (Â£16m) to settle claims it misled drivers over earnings potential, then lost many users during the #DeleteUber social media campaign in the wake of President Trump's proposed immigration ban.\n\nIn February Kalanick quit Trump's advisory board. A week later, Uber's autonomous truck division, called Otto, was alleged to have operated its driverless trucks on public roads without a license. A former Uber engineer then claimed her manager openly propositioned her for sex during her first day on his team.\n\nThis was followed by Waymo, Google's self-driving car company, suing Uber for allegedly stealing 9.7GB of documents relating to its autonomous vehicle technology, which Waymo claims Uber is using on its own cars. In late February a video emerged of Kalanick swearing at and losing his temper with an Uber driver. A month later, one of Uber's self-driving cars was involved in an accident which caused it to roll over. The autonomous fleet was withdrawn from service, but resumed work once it was established that the Uber was not at fault.\n\nIn April, Uber was banned from operating in Italy, then days later it was accused of secretly short-changing both drivers and customers in the US. Most recently, Uber's head of PR, Rachel Whetstone, quit the company.",
  "latent_16162": "Paola Loriggio, The Canadian Press\n\nCanada is sending more relief supplies to earthquake-stricken Nepal, promising to match donations to a fund specifically set up to help -- and defending itself from claims that affected Canadians aren't getting the assistance they need.\n\nThe federal government will match -- dollar-for-dollar -- all eligible contributions to the Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund between April 25 and May 25, Foreign Affairs Minister Rob Nicholson announced Monday.\n\nRelief supplies from emergency stockpiles in Mississauga, Ont., and Dubai are also being deployed to help meet immediate needs, including blankets, jerry cans, kitchen sets, hygiene kits, and tarps.\n\nNicholson, Defence Minister Jason Kenney and International Development Minister Christian Paradis gathered outside the House of Commons to announce the additional aid efforts.\n\nSome $5 million in initial aid has already been committed, and advance elements of Canada's celebrated Disaster Assistance Response Team are also on their way.\n\nKenney said more than 40 Canadian Armed Forces personnel were aboard a C-17 Globemaster aircraft that's already been deployed, including 18 DART assessment team members, seven urban search and rescue team members, six medical personnel and one member of the Canadian Red Cross.\n\nThey were expected to arrive in Nepal by early Wednesday, but that depends on the condition of the airport in the capital city, which suffered some damage in the earthquake, Kenney said.\n\n\"So whether or not we will be able to land the C-17 at Kathmandu as scheduled remains to be determined.\"\n\nSaturday's magnitude-7.8 earthquake, centred outside Kathmandu, was the worst to hit the South Asian nation of 31 million in more than 80 years and has left more than 3,900 people dead.\n\nCanadians trying to escape the chaos are having difficulty, however, and at least one complained Monday that Ottawa's not doing enough to help stranded expats and travellers.\n\nEmilie-Anne Leroux said that while other countries have pulled out all the stops to get their citizens home, she and other Canadians haven't received so much as a phone call from officials despite having registered as being in Nepal.\n\nLeroux, who is in Nepal working for the International Organization for Migration, says that's left some people feeling neglected and \"very panicky.\"\n\n\"I feel like they haven't reached out any type of support or help,\" she said from the UN House in the capital city of Kathmandu, where a handful of Canadians have been staying and helping to co-ordinate aid efforts.\n\n\"It's just frustrating -- compared to the Australian Embassy, who have booked hotels, picked up people at their apartments, helped them get their (stuff) out and fly them home if they want to, I think the Canadian government is showing a very poor example of how much it cares for its citizens who choose to work abroad for development.\"\n\nNicholson said consular officials are trying to get into the country to help, but they are having difficulty getting in.\n\n\"We have an honourary consul I know has been working on this consistently since this tragedy has taken place, (and) we're making every effort to bring in consular officials as well,\" Nicholson said.\n\n\"They have made two attempts to land at the airport in Kathmandu and on both occasions they have been turned away, but we are determined we are going to get them there.\"\n\nForeign Affairs said there are 462 Canadians registered as being in Nepal, but cautioned that's only an estimate because registration is voluntary.\n\nLeroux, 28, was trying to get back to Canada to be with her father, who is having heart surgery, when the earthquake hit. The airline could only rebook her on a flight Wednesday and she can't afford an earlier, pricier ticket.\n\nKenney said once the C-17 is relieved of its load of supplies, it would remain in the area to ferry Canadians who want to leave Nepal to nearby India. But that wasn't expected to happen until late Wednesday at the earliest.\n\nA spokesman for Foreign Affairs said the government's Emergency Watch and Response Centre in Ottawa and Canadian offices abroad are working with local authorities and providing consular assistance to Canadian citizens.\n\nTo date, the department has deployed six additional people to the affected region, although they have been unsuccessful so far in reaching Kathmandu, said Nicholson.\n\n\"But they are going to get there.\"\n\nOfficials from Canada's sparsely staffed consular offices in Nepal were also continuing attempts to reach Canadians believed to be in the area, he added.\n\nThe Ontario government, where members of the legislature held a moment of silence to honour the victims, also added $1 million Monday to the Red Cross's relief efforts in Nepal.\n\nSome Canadians are still anxiously awaiting news of relatives they hope survived the devastating quake. But others, like Faye Kennedy's family, have had long-awaited reassurances.\n\nThe Ottawa woman was trekking in Langtang National Park and hadn't been heard from since the earthquake. But her brother-in-law said Monday that Kennedy had been found.\n\n\"She is alive, was airlifted from Langtang National Park because of injuries, and is now in Kathmandu,\" Justin Piche said in an email. \"We think she will be okay.\"",
  "latent_16246": "A few months ago someone asked me how porn chicks avoid getting pregnant. I rolled my eyes and thought, Duh, the same ways all chicks avoid getting pregnant. My sarcastic response wasn't worth the energy it would have taken to type into Twitter and send. A week or so later someone asked the same question at a Q&A panel during an adult convention called Exxxotica. Over the next couple of months, more people asked the same thing via Twitter and Tumblr. One of my co-workers, Kayden Kross, brought up the fact that she'd been receiving questions about birth control as well. Neither of us remembered pregnancy on porn sets being a subject of public curiosity in previous years. Maybe all the public discussion of Measure B (the condoms-in-porn law) sparked the interest. So, without the sarcasm, let's talk about birth control.\n\nI'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure that you can't get pregnant if you're completely abstinent. There's that whole Virgin Mary thing, but if I start factoring in acts of God, the topic gets too wacky to wrap my head around. I'm also pretty sure you can't get pregnant if you stick to masturbation, are a woman who only has sex with women, or have sex in ways that completely avoid any vaginal contact with semen. However, if you are engaging in penis-in-vagina penetrative sex or moving hands back and forth between penises and vaginas, pregnancy is a risk that needs to be managed. This handy chart provided by the US Government can fill you in on the various types of available birth control.\n\nMaking hardcore porn involves showing everything possible to the camera, including the male ejaculation. We call this the \"pop shot,\" and the male performer(s) usually pop on the face, breasts, ass, or stomach. There are a couple of exceptions, but for the most part, we don't use condoms in pornographic films. There's still a possibility of sperm reaching an egg, but I'm pretty sure it's lower than if they drive their cock deep into your pussy and jizz right up next to your cervix. By avoiding internal ejaculationâor \"cream pie\" (does that phrase gross anyone else out?) scenesâusing condoms, for the most part, off set, and general luck, I've been pretty successful at avoiding pregnancy. Spermicide makes me itch like crazy, which rules out the sponge, diaphragm, cervical cap, and shield. I do enjoy the mental image of my cervix wearing a jaunty hat. Ideally, I'd be on some kind of hormonal birth control, but as I'm about to explain, the Pill and I don't seem to get along well.\n\nMy periods have always been pretty horrific. They are extremely painful, usually involve migraines, and are irregular. In my early teens, my gynecologist had me try a couple of different types of the Pill to try and regulate some of those problems, but the side effects were so bad that we decided I was better off without them. When I started performing in sex scenes with men, I figured I should give hormonal birth control another try. It'd been a few years since the last experiment. I was older. I hoped my body would be able to handle it better.\n\nThe thing about hormonal birth control is that you have to keep trying different types until you find what's right for you. Or at least, that's what doctors say. They also say that you have to give it 3â6 months for your body to adjust.\n\nFour months into taking Yaz, I was miserable. I bled profusely the whole time. Instead of migraines once or twice a month, I had them multiple times a week. I had intense mood swings and was constantly dizzy. I had planned on giving it another one or two months, hoping that my body would adjust, and then I fainted while waiting in line at the bank. I woke up on the floor. One of the people standing around me said they had called an ambulance. Passing out and hitting the floor in broad daylight was embarrassing. Worse, I didn't have health insurance and couldn't afford to pay for a trip to the hospital, so I picked myself up and ran out of the building. I stopped taking the Pill and still refuse to go back to that bank.\n\nFour years went by before I was ready to give the Pill another shot. That time it was Ortho Tri-cyclen Lo. Again, I was dizzy all the time, had migraines, excessive bleeding, and mood swings. I couldn't take a joke. My roommate remarked that maybe the reason the Pill prevented pregnancy so well was that no one wanted to be around me long enough to have sex. I broke out in a rash, which turned out to be shingles. My doctor and dermatologist said that it was a coincidence, but still... My experiment with Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo lasted three months. I gave my body the rest of the year to balance out.\n\nIn the beginning of January, my doctor suggested I try Loestrin 24 Fe. The first couple of weeks went by pretty normally. Sixteen days in, I started bleeding. Technically, no matter how much blood there is, the medical types call this \"spotting.\" I think applying the word spotting to a situation where there's enough blood that a tampon, sponge, or maxi pad needs to be changed every three hours is dismissive. This bleeding/spotting/near hemorrhaging continued until day thirty-two.\n\nMy blood smelled different. It didn't smell like menstrual blood, or like blood from a wound. I wasn't sure if the blood itself smelled different, or if my sense of smell had changed because of the hormones. I started smelling everything. I smelled the cat. I smelled various parts of Daddy (my boyfriend). I used to love strawberry-flavored yogurt, but now the scent makes my stomach turn. On the way to Playboy radio with Kayden to do a guest appearance on her Krossfire show, I asked everyone to be quiet so I could focus on sniffing the elevator wall. I think the wood in the elevator of the Playboy building has always smelled odd, though. I squeezed a pimple in the bathroom of the Burbank airport and the pus smelled weird. Then I wondered if the goo that collects in the holes from my old nipple piercings smelled any different. A woman walked in and caught me standing at the counter with one breast out, smelling my fingers.\n\nOne evening, I started crying quietly, little tears dripping out of my eyes and rolling down my cheeks. Someone asked what was wrong. I replied, \"Nothing,\" and then sobbed inconsolably for a solid ten minutes purely because I'd been crying about nothing. Somewhere between pill number twenty and pill number twenty-five, I spent a whole two days feeling fat. I was fully aware the entire time that it was completely illogical for me to feel fat. I weighed the same as I did in December. My clothing still fit the same. I told Daddy I felt fat, and he told me that was crazy, at which point I started sobbing (again) because the way that my feelings were refusing to line up with visible fact was making me feel crazy.\n\nOn day twenty-nine, my breasts started to hurt. A couple of days later, I noticed that I actually filled out my bras. This was really exciting since I now needed to wear said bras to keep my breasts from bouncing when I walked and hurting more. They were by no means giant hooters, but they were noticeably fuller, which was pretty cool. Less cool was the part where I couldn't get a pen out of the small pocket in my purse and ended up standing alone in my apartment screeching about the injustice of nonfunctional pockets in womens' clothing and accessories. There was also the ingrown-hair mishap.\n\nCut to day thirty-eight, when dragging myself out of bed became a herculean effort, and the idea of showering or brushing my teeth was beyond my abilities. Everything felt tragic and hopeless. I was a useless sack of human flesh, incapable of writing a rent check without a melodramatic pen incident, much less a blog post. The most productive thing I'd done in weeks was ponder the smell of a wall and a half-eaten cookie. My only redeeming qualities were my tits, which weren't even that cool compared with the rest of the tits in the world. I felt insane, and the distress was further complicated by this bastardization of Joseph Heller's Catch-22: If you're self-aware enough to think you might have lost your mind, you obviously still have it. I started to think hormonal birth control was a patriarchal plot to keep women down by rendering us completely looney. The question, \"How can we ever break the glass ceiling, if we can't stop crying and being revolted by everyday food items?\" actually came out of my mouth.\n\nIt's day forty-one now. I still feel nuts, but I have a column to submit and am sure there's something in the house that I haven't thoroughly sniffed yet. But hey... at least this B-cup kind of fits.\n\n@Stoya\n\nRead more about preggy ladies:\n\nOne in the Oven featuring Girls' Jemima Kirk\n\nMy Abortion Story\n\nGreat Sex During Pregnancy",

  "latent_16295": "A district voted one of Japanâs most beautiful will soon join the Earthâs list of nuclear casualties\n\nSLEEPY, IDYLLIC and dangerously irradiated, Iitate is preparing to evacuate. The junior high school is closed, its children bused every day to nearby towns. Tractors sit idle and weeds poke through rice and cabbage in the fields. Half-empty shelves greet customers at the A-Coop supermarket. By the end of this month, this mountainous farming village of 7,000 people, recently voted one of Japanâs most beautiful places, will join the Ukrainian ghost town of Pripyat in the planetâs short list of nuclear casualties.\n\nâWeâve no idea when we can come back,â says Katsuzo Shoji, who farms rice and cabbages and keeps a small herd of cattle about 2km from Iitateâs village office. Shoji (75), went from shock to rage and then to despair when the government told him he would have to destroy his vegetables, kill his six cows and move with his wife Fumi (73) to an apartment, probably in Koriyama City, about 20km away. âWeâve heard five, maybe 10 years, but some say thatâs far too optimistic,â he says, crying. âMaybe Iâll be able to come home to die.â\n\nIitate has been living on borrowed time since the March 11th earthquake and tsunami knocked out the cooling systems of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, about 40km away. Though outside the 30km government exclusion zone set up around the plant, the villageâs mountainous topography meant radiation spewing from its crippled reactors lingered, poisoning crops and water. The young, the wealthy, mothers and pregnant women began leaving for Tokyo or elsewhere. The rest gathered every day in the village office for information, and prayed against the inevitable.\n\nLast month the central government finally ordered the remaining citizens to leave after the International Atomic Energy Agency and other observers warned that safe radiation limits for cesium and other toxins had been exceeded. âWeâve been told to quit our jobs and move out by the end of the month,â says Miyoko Nakamura (59), who works as a clerk in the village office. She is near retirement and says sheâll manage. âA lot of people have no idea what to do. Theyâre just hoping everything will be okay somehow.â\n\nVillagers snort at the initial compensation of one million yen (â¬8,670) offered by Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco), operator of the ruined Fukushima plant. Farmers will be given another 350,000 yen in moving expenses this month.\n\nAfter that, there are no more concrete promises. âMoney is the biggest question people have,â explains Takashi Hamasaka, an official from Japanâs Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), seconded to the village to assist evacuation. âThey want the government to pay more. If it was just a tsunami or earthquake we would pay, but the nuclear problem was made by Tepco, so the situation is so difficult.â\n\nAmong his governmentâs tasks is finding homes for 700 family pets that will be left behind. Thousands of pigs and over 8,000 of the regionâs famous, prized âwagyuâ beef cattle, worth up to a million yen a head, will be slaughtered if they cannot be relocated. Apartments in towns outside the irradiated zone must be found for locals, who are being kept alive on supplies shipped into the village office â bottled water, masks, and nappies for bedridden elderly people lie in boxes around the hall. Locals arrive in light vans to pick up the supplies and glance at the Geiger counter across the road, which hovers at around 3.15 microsieverts per hour.\n\nTepco officials, led by executive vice-president Norio Tsuzumi, came to the village hall over a week ago to apologise. Pictures from the visit show the officials, in identical utility suits, bowing deeply before 1,000 mostly stony-faced locals.\n\nâGive us back our beautiful village,â one demanded. Some say the disaster is too big for any company to manage, even one as powerful as Japanâs largest utility. âAt least they can raise electricity prices, says Shoji.\n\nâWhat can we do except wait for our homes back.â\n\nLocal restaurants have already shut. Many still have signs up of a smiling cartoon cow, symbol of Iitate beef, which is now too irradiated to sell. The one supermarket, a crucial lifeline to many elderly customers, still operates â at least for now.\n\nâWeâre waiting to see what happens; some older people are not leaving, and they need us,â says manager Toshiyuki Matsuda. âThey would have to shop 20km away if we werenât here.â\n\nA woman in the car park outside bundles her shopping into a small pick-up truck. âIâm old, Iâve been here all my life â where would I go?â she asks. âIâm going to stay, and if the supermarket closes Iâll go elsewhere.â\n\nWhat will the government do regarding holdouts? METI official Hamasaka shrugs his shoulders. âItâs a good question. We donât have any power to force them to go.â Faced with a similar problem closer to the stricken power plant, the government last month made the 20km zone around it a no-go area. Evacuees who return there now face arrest and fines. Hundreds of thousands of farm animals are being slaughtered.\n\nFarmers here claim their produce is safe to eat, but the country has become hysterical about the Fukushima contamination. Many have heard stories of bullying against children evacuated from the village, sometimes hundreds of miles away â a painful echo of the decades-long discrimination that dogged survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. âIâve heard that other kids shout âbaikinâ at them,â says Shojiâs granddaughter, Hiroko (22).\n\nLike many in the area, Shoji, whose family has been farming this land since the 1880s, is too old to become embroiled in a protracted legal battle with Tepco or the government. âAll we can do is bow our heads and heed the order,â he says as his wife, granddaughter and eldest son Hidekatsu look sadly on. He has been told he will be taken care of, but he fears compensation offers will dwindle once the media spotlight shines elsewhere.\n\nThe worst irony of the crisis that has destroyed their lives, he says, is that this rural area, 250km from Tokyo, sees not a single watt of the electricity produced by Tepcoâs Fukushima plant.\n\nâAll the power is sent to the city. We had nothing to do with this problem but we will have to somehow bear the burden.â",
  "latent_16353": "by Adam Budofsky\n\nWant to be a better drummer? Try taking these words out of your vocabulary: Always. Only. All. Never.\n\nDespite the prevalence of educational books, DVDs, and online lessons, most drumming information is still passed down the old-fashioned way: from one player to another, while shooting the breeze at the drum shop. A lot of what we hear, we take at face value, and we repeat these drumming âabsolutesâ to the next guy as gospel. Sometimes, though, itâs worth questioning the wisdom passed down through the agesâ¦.\n\n1. A great band necessarily has a âgreatâ drummer.\n\nIf âgreatâ means serving the music, regardless of how subtle or crazed the drums might have to be to do that, then this is correct. If it means always playing mindblowing stuff even when some space is called forâor offering up supremely tasteful, metronomic accuracy even when more blood and guts are requiredâthen itâs not.\n\nGood music is about balance, and if one element draws too much attention away from the power of the whole, the music suffers. Imagine the late Keith Moon playing in any band other than the Who. His over-the-top style would probably soundâ¦wellâ¦way over the top. But because his bandmates had equally wild musical personalities, the music worked. And as genius as Kenney Jones isâand his work in the Faces makes it clear that heâs a monsterâthe thing that people inevitably missed when Kenney replaced Moony was the wild abandon. (In fairness to Kenney, it should be noted that Who songwriter Pete Townshend was already writing for a less âmessyâ Who sound when Moony passed away.)\n\nDebates go on today about things like, Whoâs the better drummer, Keith Moon or John Bonham, Neil Peart or Phil Collinsâ¦? The only thing we know for sure is that if those certifiable drumming gods hadnât found their respective bandsâor those bands hadnât found themârock ânâ roll would be a far less fun thing to be a fan of.\n\nAlso, donât get into the habit of listening to music only as a drummer, or even as a musician. There are plenty of amazing songs and albums that were recorded by players who, if heard alone playing a groove or a solo, wouldnât turn many peoplesâ heads. Often the most magical performances are made by solid but unspectacular players who nonetheless hit upon some wonderful common sound with their bandmates. So next time youâre listening to music, try not to dissect it. Just feel it. If the music touches you, who cares about maxims like âA great band always has a great drummerâ or other attempts to define this gloriously indefinable thing we call music? We invent these things to make ourselvesânot the musicâfeel better.\n\n2. Mistakes are always bad.\n\nHonor thy mistakes with repetitionâI think the legendary Brian Eno said that. If itâs the right mistake, and you react quickly enough to it and then either repeat it artfully or create some cool variation of it, you could end up being called a drumming genius.\n\nPlus, if you obsess over playing everything just right, youâll likely have trouble relaxing enough to groove well. And youâll have trouble opening yourself up to the unknown, which is something great artists continuously strive for.\n\nSo you blew that fillâwhat are they gonna do, arrest you? Lighten up and have some fun.\n\n3. More resonance is always good.\n\nAbout fifteen, twenty years ago, the drum industry fell all over itself trying to create mechanisms that allow toms to resonate as freely as possible. The trend continues today, with some manufacturers shackling their otherwise gorgeous kits with hideous-looking suspension mounts in response to this âneed.â\n\nIt seems to me that a blind ambition toward more resonance represents a case of art following technology, rather than the other way around. Yes, a less choked drum can often mean a better-sounding drum, and the resultant longer sustain of a note can be a desired effect. The opposites are obviously sometimes true as well, given the existence of things like Moongel and electronic gates.\n\nIn cases like this I find it helpful to think about all of the profound pieces of recorded music that were produced before the advent of suspension mounts. Would Bonzoâs drums on Zeppelin IV sound better if theyâd been recorded with hung toms? How about Art Blakeyâs on Orgy in Rhythm? Or Nick Masonâs on Dark Side of the Moon?\n\nAnd check this out: Freely resonating toms can actually make it harder for you to be heard. Controlled drum sounds can be more easily mixed, manipulated, and amplified, allowing them to be better heard without obliterating the other instruments.\n\nWhile itâs cool that mechanical âimprovementsâ like suspension mounts give us more options, be careful to separate the marketing from the motivation. In this day and age of overly programmed music, itâs always wise to question the importance of any piece of technology, no matter how seemingly benign.\n\n4. Bigger drums are louder.\n\nThough larger drums move more air, smaller drums have higher pitches, which can cut through the music more easily. If you want a subsonic boom so bad that youâre willing to schlep a 26â³ bass drum around, all the power to you. Just know that youâre not necessarily going to rock the house that much more with it.\n\n5. A stiff feel is a bad thing.\n\nIf the music calls for it, a âverticalâ feel might be the most appropriate thing. Some new wave and electronic music, for instance, would sound silly with slinky grooves. Creating intentionally mechanical beats to highlight certain lyrical content can be the perfect choice. Beware of people who always slag songs or bands for sounding too stiff. If the drummer is furthering the artistic causeâwhether or not itâs your tasteâgive him or her the benefit of the doubt.\n\n6. Brushes, dowels, and the like will allow you to play more quietly.\n\nNot always. What these alternative strikers do do well is offer different impact sounds, giving you another way to differentiate song A from song B. But if youâre just trying to play the same music at a quieter volume, youâre better off learning to play with more control, perhaps with thinner sticks.\n\n7. âPerfectâ time exists.\n\nIf it did, you wouldnât want to hear it. As Einstein said, time is relative, which in musical terms means you should control it but not take the life out of it.\n\nImagine a breathtaking view of trees on a distant hill in, say, late October. The lovely curve of the skyline, the radiant yellow glow of the leaves. Look a little closer, and youâll notice that all the treetops donât perfectly swoop into each other, and that lots of those leaves are brown and crumbly. And look at that tree stump over there. The rings are hardly perfect concentric circles. Thereâs some squiggle there, right?\n\nMusic isnât meant to be listened to with the dispassion of a scientist studying microorganisms. Itâs made to dance to, to party to, to make out to, to sing along to as we drive down the highway. Perfection is often the enemy of emotion. Take a step back when you judge your own playing. Yeah, maybe when you hear your part soloed back to you in the control room, you want to cringe. Now bring up the bass and guitars. Are heads bobbing? Then you did good.\n\nItâs okay to strive for perfection, as long as you understand youâre never going to attain it. If itâs good enough for Mother Nature, it should be good enough for you.\n\n8. Fusion and progressive drumming are for over-educated drum snobs.\n\nNonsense. By denying rhythmic sophistication, youâre severely limiting the possibilities of making effective music. The âIâm more punk than youâ game is for children. The flip side of this isâ¦\n\n9. Punk drumming is for talentless Neanderthals.\n\nSometimes simplicity is profound. Focusing on one basic part and playing it with passion is often exactly what a track needs. And, you know, there can be a certain charm in amateurism. (Though a little of that goes a long way.)\n\n10. If it feels good to you, itâs right for the song.\n\nEvery musician has certain grooves and tempos that feel best to play. But donât assume that the particular song youâre playing works best at your favorite tempo or groove. Sometimes to make a song happen, you have to play a part that initially feels awkward. The proof is in the pudding. Listen back to a recording before you make a final judgment. And listen respectfully to the opinions of your bandmates. Not all singers are morons.\n\n11. Drum parts should always be clear in the mix.\n\nUntrue. Listen to Harry Nilssonâs âMe and My Arrow.â In places, itâs hard to actually hear whatâs going on in the drum part. But itâs blatantly clear how wonderful the performance is. Every song is unique; sometimes a little mystery in a drum part adds just the right amount of rhythmic power to the song.\n\n12. You should work toward being proficient at as many different styles as possible.\n\nMaybe, maybe not. If everyone did it, then weâd likely have fewer players with truly unique styles. Would Elvin Jones have been âbetterâ if he mastered garage rock, electro-pop, and Elton John ballads? Maybe. Maybe not.\n\nYes, learning new drum styles allows you to play in more situations, and we can never have enough tools in our belt. But not every drummer is cut out to play different styles convincingly, or even absorb them effectively, no matter how much they practice. Some musicians are destined to cut their own path, and they shouldnât be shackled by the âwisdomâ of academia when their time could be better spent following their own muse.\n\nWould the world necessarily be blessed with more great, original music if every musician tried to be a jack-of-all-trades? (Remember the other half of that saying: âmaster of none.â) If youâre into exploring different styles, by all means do it. But if working out of method books or listening to samba is just not your thing, maybe you should focus on finding your musical voice, developing it, and playing with people who âgetâ you. History might just remember you more fondly.\n\nJust remember, if youâre avoiding certain types of rhythms out of laziness or closed-mindedness, youâre the only one losing out. The point is, take the time to discover who you want to be as a musician, and follow the path that gets you there, regardless of how well traveledâor un-traveledâit is.",

  "latent_16476": "Team Ted Cruz is taking shape, and the Senate first-termer's presidential campaign could start before this spring.\n\nThe Republican senator from Texas tentatively plans to fill senior campaign positions with the triumvirate he signed last summer to expand his political operation. At the top is Jeff Roe, whose organizational title is undefined but who would be the campaignâs chief strategic and logistics decision-maker. Jason Miller would shape and oversee campaign messaging; Lauren Lofstrom would direct fundraising.\n\nCruz is in the process of âfeeling outâ additional campaign hires and prospective donors in preparation to join the field of 2016 candidates. If the senator decides to run for president, he wants to hit the ground at full speed, a senior Cruz advisor confirmed Monday.\n\nRoe, founder of the direct mail firm Axiom Strategies, has never managed a presidential campaign. But he advised Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Rick Perry in 2012 and is familiar with the terrain in the early primary states. Republicans who have worked with Roe describe him as a talented strategist who is capable keeping a campaign operation humming. Perhaps most importantly, Roe is a good fit for Cruzâ aggressive style.\n\nâHe is a mean, bare-knuckles brawler,â one Republican operative told the Washington Examiner.\n\nRounding out the team are pollster Chris Perkins, who earned plaudits for being among the few to correctly forecast Novemberâs Georgia Senate race, and Jason Johnson, the senatorâs longtime political consigliere. Nick Muzin, Cruz's deputy chief of staff in his Senate office, is steeped in South Carolina politics. He is viewed as someone who might take a leave of absence from Cruz' Senate office to join the campaign.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, is often referred to as Cruzâs âpolitical brain.\" He is rooted in the Texas GOP establishment and has been with the senator the longest among his advisors. Johnson served as chief of staff to Greg Abbott for a period when the incoming governor was state attorney general. It was in Abbottâs office that he and Cruz, then the the Lone Star State's solicitor general, bonded. Johnson guided Cruz to second place and then victory, respectively, in Texasâ 2012 GOP primary and runoff contests.\n\nThose two races constitute the 44-year-old lawmakerâs only experience with competitive campaigns. Cruz had a very easy time in his general election win against an under-funded, no-name Democrat. Republican insiders expect Cruz to contend for first choice among GOP primary voters who favor the most confrontational and conservative candidate. But to compete for the nomination, Cruz has to step up his game.\n\nâHis early reviews among tea party audiences have been stellar in Iowa,â a Republican insider in the Hawkeye State told the Examiner. âI don't think he can appeal as broadly in the party or in the general electorate as other candidates, but his support will be intense among those voters who have the highest anger score.â\n\nCruz has countered that to win the White House, Republicans must nominate a strong conservative who contrasts sharply with the Democratic nominee, likely Hillary Clinton.\n\nCruz has maintained a vigorous political travel schedule and been a constant presence in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina â hosts, in that order, of the first three 2016 primary contests. On Sunday, he was in Myrtle Beach to address the South Carolina Tea Party Coalition Convention. Cruz has cast himself as the conservative alternative in a field that could feature multiple Establishment and Tea Party candidates. That is consistent with the image Cruz has cultivated since bursting onto the national scene three years ago.\n\nIn 2012, Cruz defeated an Establishment favorite in his GOP Senate primary. Once on Capitol Hill, he led a campaign to derail Obamacare by leveraging a government shutdown and opposed comprehensive immigration reform plans that included a pathway to legalization for illegal immigrants. These moves helped Cruz solidify a fevered fan base, particularly among Tea Party Republicans, and positioned him as a national leader.\n\nBut competing for the presidential nomination, which will be decided by more than just the most conservative voters or those sympathetic to the Tea Party, requires organization, money and an expanded network of supporters. Cruz has to assemble all of that from scratch. If the senator is as skilled at the business of campaigning as he is debating, he could surge into the top tier of candidates and propel himself beyond South Carolina. Getting there usually depends at least somewhat on how a candidate performs in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nIn Iowa, Cruz is expected to face stiff competition in the struggle to be king conservative. The likely field includes former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who won the 2008 caucuses; former Sen. Rick Santorum, who won the 2012 caucuses; neurosurgeon Ben Carson; Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker; Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal; Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and others. In New Hampshire, the top overall contenders could include 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney; former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush; New Hersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n\nâCruzâs politics are likely too conservative for the New Hampshire electorate; his willingness to engage voters will serve him well here,â a Granite State GOP insider said. âStill, expectations for him here will be low. A strong showing in New Hampshire as the top conservative alternative would be a shot in Cruzâs arm.â",
  "latent_16693": "As you all know, the federal NDP announced on Friday it would repeal the employee stock option deduction and reallocate the savings to support low and middle income earners. I have long been writing about this deduction and would like to think this policy idea is founded, at least in part, on my work (work that is joint with Daniel Sandler who wrote the book on venture capital and tax incentives). If it is, it makes me feel at least someone is listening at least some of the time.\n\nI thought I would give you some background information in this area and allow you to form your own thoughts. I certainly understand that not everyone has a good grasp on this very technical issues. Iâll go right back to basics so even those of you without any knowledge in this area can get informed. As a result, this will be a long post and is based on a number of papers that I have coauthored in this area.\n\nIn addition, I have some question for the NDP that do indeed need to be answered.\n\nWhat is an Employee Stock option?\n\nA stock option is a financial instrument which provides the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell stock of a corporation within a stated period of time at a specified price, commonly referred to as the âstrike priceâ.\n\nThere are a number of significant differences between employee stock options and standard stock options that you can trade in the open market.\n\nUnlike standard stock options, employee stock options are not traded publicly on an exchange, but rather are granted pursuant to a private contract with the board of directors or compensation committee of the firm serving as the writers of the option and the executive (employee) acting as the holder of the option.\n\nEmployee stock options must often be held for a pre-specified vesting period before they can be exercised (usually 3 -5 years during which time the employee cannot sell or transfer the options), which is not present in standard stock options.\n\nThe option period of an employee stock option can be quite lengthy (e.g., ten years), which is longer than standard stock options. The option period is the period of time that the holder has the right to buy stock of the corporation.\n\nFourth, the option period of an employee stock option is often curtailed in the event that employment is terminated or the employee dies.\n\nEmployee stock options are usually (and often required to be) granted at-the-money, meaning that the strike price of the option equals the market price of the underlying stock on the day of the option grant, whereas a traditional stock option is issued out-of-the-money, meaning that the strike price of the option exceeds the market price of the underlying stock.\n\nIt is important to understand that employee stock options are a form of compensation. Rather than be paid in bonus or salary, employees forgo these forms of immediate compensation in exchange for future compensation (at least that is true for stock options granted either at or out-of-the money) that comes from stock options. Stock options have become the single largest component of compensation among senior executives at large publicly traded companies in North America.\n\nWhat is the Canadian Tax Treatment of Stock Options?\n\nCompared to most countries, the personal income taxation of employee stock options in Canada is notably less complex and more generous from the employeeâs perspective. Since 1972, all employee stock options share the same general tax treatment in two respects.\n\nUnlike other employment income (e.g. annual salary or bonus income), which is taxable in the year it is received, there are no tax consequences when stock options are granted or when they vest. Rather, under subsection 7(1) of the ITA, a tax liability does not arise until the year the option is exercised. The amount that must be included in income from employment upon exercise is equal to the difference between the fair market value of the stock on the date the option is exercised and the strike price.\n\nis equal to the difference between the fair market value of the stock on the date the option is exercised and the strike price. Upon the sale of the stock acquired pursuant to the option, the difference between the proceeds of disposition of the stock and the fair market value of the stock on the date the option is exercised is taxed as a capital gain or capital loss, as the case may be. Under section 38 of the ITA, the taxable portion of a capital gain or capital loss is one-half of the capital gain or capital loss.\n\nFor options issued by a public corporation (employee stock options can also be issued by a Canadian-controlled private corporation (âCCPCâ) and the taxation history and treatment of these options differs from those issued by a public corporation. I do not consider the tax treatment of options issued by CCPCs in this blog post), there were two significant tax changes to this base tax treatment: the changes made in 1984 and 2000. The employee stock option deduction is related to the 1984 change.\n\nIn order to encourage the use of stock options as a compensation mechanism, the 1984 federal budget introduced paragraph 110(1)(d) of the ITA. Under paragraph 110(1)(d), if a Canadian public company grants stock options to an employee, and the strike price is at least equal to the fair market value of the underlying share on the day the option was granted, the employee receiving the options is able to deduct 50 percent of the stock option benefit. The application of the deduction means that the income benefit obtained from stock options is taxed at the same rate as capital gains (and thus at a lower rate than that applicable to ordinary income).\n\nMotivating the 1984 federal tax change was the desire âto encourage more widespread use of employee stock option plansâ (1984 Budget Plan, p. 7). Employee stock options are generally believed to assist in the alignment of incentives of company executives and workers with that of company shareholders. By aligning the incentives of employees with shareholders, employees have a stake in increasing their companyâs value (and hence, share price) and must be entrepreneurial and innovative to do so. (This is actually the exact motivation for Gordon Gekkoâs Greed is Good Speech). By increasing the productivity and ultimately growth of their company, the hope would be for overall higher rates of economic growth and prosperity.\n\nWhat?\n\nThat is all pretty technical so I think an example would be helpful. Employee A (most likely a CEO or VP) is employed at a publicly traded company in Canada and is the recipient of an option grant for 100,000 shares. The grant is dated as having been made on January 1 when the share price was $15 and that is set as the strike price. Assume that the individual faces a combined federal and provincial marginal tax rate of 45% and assume that the options vest after one year, meaning that the employee must hold the options for at least one year.\n\nOn January 2 the following year the employee elects to exercise these options just as the vesting period expires. The companyâs stock is now currently trading at $20. The employee exercises 100,000 options and sells the obtained shares from the exercise on the same day (more than 90 per cent of executive stock options are exercised and sold on the same day) which were granted with a specified (exercise) price of $15. The exercised shares are valued at $1.5-million (100,000 options at $15 a share) and the sale is valued at $2-million (100,000 options at $20 a share). That is, the employee pays $1.5 million for shares that they then immediately sell for $2 million. The employee derives an employment income benefit valued at the difference of these two amounts, which is $500,000.\n\nIf the full $500,000 were taxed, as it should be because it is income, the employee would pay $225,000 in taxes leaving her with after tax income from the stock options of $275,000. But because of the special deduction, she only pays tax on $250,000 of the income benefit for a total of $112,500 paid in tax. That is, with the special deduction, the employee pays $112,500 less in tax than she would otherwise.\n\nLetâs be clear: This $500,000 is not a capital gain. A capital gain only accrues if shares are bought and then held because there is an element of risk associated with the holding the shares. By buying and selling the shares on the same day, the employee is simply realizing the income benefit that had been attached to the awarded stock options. It is simply deferred employment compensation.\n\nWe have lots of forms of deferred employment income, mostly performance-based employment income that are taxed as regular income. So it is not the presence of the deferral that dictates this special treatment.\n\nDid the Tax Change Do It Job?\n\nThe intent of 110(1)(d) was to encourage the use of employee stock option plans to promote economic growth and prosperity. Did it do this?\n\nFirst the view that employee stock options drive productivity is not a view that is still widely held. There is no real evidence that employee stock options actually have any discernable effect on employee productivity. For example, Ittner, Lambert, and Larcker (2003) are unable to show that rapid growth of companies is due to employees working harder and more innovatively. Oyer and Schaefer (2005) demonstrate that option awards to non-executive employees are not only too small to provide any incentives but that few of these lower level employees have the necessary authority to make the types of decisions and affect the changes necessary to greatly increase productivity.\n\nSecond, while we know that stock option plans took off in the 80s and 90s, there is no reason to think that this was due to the deduction. Why?\n\nThis tax regime favors the recipient, the employee, rather than the supplier, the company. It provides no direct impetus for a company to create employee stock option plans or increase the supply of stock options available under such plans which was the intent of the change. However, assuming the existence of a stock option plan, it does increase the after-tax value of stock options to the employee, particularly when compared to wage and salary income, and may lead to increased take up by employees.\n\nThe use of employee stock options in the United States has increased at a much faster rate and risen to a far higher level than in Canada, despite a more limited tax preference in the United States. The most common type of stock option in the United States is a non-qualified stock option (NSO), which accounts for more than 95% of all employee stock options in the United States (Hall & Liebman, 2000), and these are taxed as ordinary income. It is often asserted that the key driver to the use of NSOs as a component of employee compensation has been the ability of the issuing company to deduct the expense even though the company is not out of pocket (Malwani, 2003, p. 1231). Canadian companies are not permitted such a deduction.\n\nIt is often asserted that the key driver to the use of NSOs as a component of employee compensation has been the ability of the issuing company to deduct the expense even though the company is not out of pocket (Malwani, 2003, p. 1231). The use of employee stock options throughout North America, particularly in ICT companies, is highly correlated with the large increases in the stock market during the 1990s. During this time, recipients could expect to more than offset the higher wages they would have earned without the option plan while employers reduced their compensation costs, which is a particular draw for companies with limited or negative revenues like many ICT companies at the time.\n\nUnintended Consequences\n\nSection 110(1)(d) rewards option manipulation practices, practices that have been shown to have been widespread at least in the US. In order for an individual to qualify for the deduction the employee stock option must be granted such that the strike price is at least equal to the fair market value of the underlying share the day the option was granted. This is, if the stock is trading at $15 on the day of the option grant, the exercise price of the stock option must be equal to or greater than $15. That is, there is a clear tax advantage to stock options that are granted not-in-the-money or at least reported as such.\n\nBackdating is the act of using hindsight to select a date for a stock option grant after that date has occurred, and then claiming to have granted the options on that earlier date, in order to take advantage of the historical price performance of a companyâs stock. In practice this would involve looking back to find a local low point for the underlying stock relative to the current dayâs stock price and choosing that low point as the optionâs grant date. Hence, the act of reporting options that are granted in-the-money as being not in-the-money, (i.e. backdating), is an act of tax evasion in Canada. In the context of employee stock options, Canada has devised a system that rewards risky and fraudulent behaviour.\n\nThe backdating of options has become a significant policy issue due to its suspected prevalence. US research has shown that backdating was quite prevalent (e.g. Lie, 2005; Heron & Lie, 2007). Some estimates indicate that approximately 20% of executive stock option grants appear to have been backdated (Heron, Lie, & Perry 2007, p. 22) and at least 30% of companies that granted options to executives appear to have manipulated one or more of their grants (Heron & Lie, 2009). In addition, close to 200 companies (some Canadian) have been investigated by the SEC and the U.S. Justice Department (Collins, Gong, & Li, 2009, p. 403), many companies have had to restate earnings, a number of company executives have been forced to resign after admitting to backdating options, and criminal investigations have been launched against several key insiders.\n\nDespite this data, only one Canadian company has undergone an investigation that resulted in information which the CRA used to reassess some employees that exercised suspicious stock option awards. In addition, at least four other Canadian companies have quietly announced that they found practices consistent with backdating, but it is not clear whether this has resulted in their employees being reassessed by CRA.\n\nQuestions for the NDP\n\nEmployee stock options are a poor, indeed perverse, form of executive compensation. The preferential tax treatment of options only exacerbates this problem. By getting rid of the deduction, we are eliminating this tax loophole that disproportionately benefits the wealthy elite and rewards fraudulent behaviour.\n\nBut eliminating the deduction under paragraph 110(1)(d) is not the end of this issue. Two questions that remain are:\n\nwhen the tax benefit from stock options should be reported, and\n\nWhether the employer should be permitted an offsetting deduction that is currently not allowed in Canada because of the presence of 110(1)(d)\n\nBoth of these questions need to be addressed by the NDP in their policy and I have not seen them discussed.\n\nWe could look to the accounting treatment of stock options for a way forward for taxing stock options. Until recently, Canadian and U.S. firms did not have to recognize a compensation expense for stock options that were granted not-in-the-money and were not performance-based because the options could be accounted for using the intrinsic value method. The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price at the grant date. Provided that the option was granted not-in-the-money, it had no intrinsic value. When options were granted in-the-money, the intrinsic value of the options at the grant date must be amortized over the option vesting period. Therefore, firms that favoured compensation in the form of not-in-the-money stock options (or that least that were reported to be not-in-the-money) over cash remuneration reported higher book income.\n\nIn 1995, the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a statement encouraging but not requiring companies to use the fair value method. The fair value method requires that stock options be expensed based on their fair market value at the time of issuance (and amortized over the vesting period) even if the options are not-in-the-money. Option pricing models, such as a modified Black-Scholes or Binomial model, can be used to determine the fair market value of options on their grant date. A similar non-mandatory move was made by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) in late 2001. However, in the period following corporate scandals such as Enron, both Canada and the U.S. have made the fair value method mandatory. In Canada, firms have been required to use the fair value method for financial periods beginning on or after January 1, 2004 while the U.S. rule applies for financial periods beginning on or after June 15, 2005.\n\nI do not think it would be inappropriate for the tax treatment of options to match the current accounting treatment: that is, taxing options at grant. Since employment income is taxed on a received rather than earned basis, an employee should not be required to include an amount in income prior to having an unconditional legal right to exercise the options: that is, when the options vest. On the day the options vest, the employee does indeed receive something of value; they have the unconditional legal right to that income making the vesting time to be appropriate for taxation. How do you value the options when they vest? Option pricing models are now sufficiently robust that they can determine an optionâs value at that time with a reasonable degree of accuracy.\n\nWith respect to the corporate deduction, it is important to remember that employee compensation is a cost incurred by the company and section 110(1)(d) was used in lieu of the company deduction. If 110(1)(d) is repealed, the employer should instead be allowed to now take the deduction and that this deduction be incurred at the same time and for the same amount as the employeeâs tax liability.\n\nThe final issue that remains for me is when will any policy makers, the securities regulators, or the CRA recognize the importance of the backdating issue and begin investigations into this practice and demanding the repayment of taxes owed as a result of this fraudulent behavior. Employees who receive backdated stock options should be reassessed not only to deny any deduction claimed under paragraph 110(1)(d), but also to include the full stock option benefit in an earlier year than that in which the employee reported the benefit for tax purposes. Such reassessment would also include interest, compounded daily at a relatively high rate.

  "latent_17118": "Oil is a tricky thing. On the surface, it seems so simple. It's a single commodity that's extracted, refined, and sold. Much to the chagrin of Adam Smith, though, the price of oil rarely is based on simple supply and demand. It's one of the most complex commodities in the world because of the economic and political implications it carries. To quote Daniel Yergin, author of The Prize and one of the foremost authorities on energy security:\n\n\"The major obstacle to the development of new supplies is not geology but what happens above ground: international affairs, politics, investment and technology.\"\n\nLet's look at three factors that can have a profound effect on the price of a barrel of oil.\n\n1. Economic growth. You could argue for days on whether oil prices determine economic growth or if economic growth has dictated oil prices. So let's settle on the fact that they both go hand-in-hand. Since 1975, almost every U.S. recession has been accompanied with a pullback in oil prices. It should come as so surprise, then, that oil and the S&P 500 0000have moved in tandem as well.\n\nThis applies to almost everywhere around the globe. In the past couple of months, the price of Brent crude, the benchmark for global oil trading, has dropped 18% in large part because of weak U.S. and Chinese GDP figures. Perhaps to be more general, economic growth is dependent on the price of energy; it just happens to be that oil is the predominant energy source around the world, supplying more than one-third of the world's energy demand. So unless some other source of energy captures the top spot from oil, then oil will remain the bellwether for energy prices around the world.\n\n2. Geopolitical risk. Oil is a very delicate commodity, and any potential disruption of supply could lead to large changes in prices. During the Libyan revolution, Total (NYSE:TOT), BP (NYSE:BP), and several other oil companies halted operations, and a country that was once repsonsible for 1.6 million barrels per day came to an almost screeching halt. From January to May 2011, as Libyan oil prosecution had tumbled 88%, Brent crude jumped almost 30% even though Libya supplied only 0.5% of total global exports.\n\nThe same can be applied to the value of companies as well. Apache (NYSE:APA) has about 20% of its production in Egypt, and in its recent annual report it highlighted the Arab Spring and the Egyptian election as major risks that could drastically affect production numbers for the company. Whenever companies invest heavily in regions of the world with political uncertainty, they're taking a much larger risk that can affect their operations and market value.\n\n3. OPEC production decisions. If you were to ask an average person on the street to name the world's largest oil company, the first response you get would almost undoubtedly be ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). But that's not even close. Exxon lags behind the large nationalized oil companies that are part of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, more commonly known as OPEC.\n\nWhile the U.S. may have the world's third largest petroleum reserves, they're divided up among several hundred companies, and very rarely is there excess supply. That's not the case with OPEC members. These countries, most notably Saudi Arabia, have excess production capacity and will set production targets that more or less dictate the price of crude around the world.\n\nWhile normally this will bring a certain stability to the price of oil, it can also lead to dangerous consequences. Take, for example, the big run-up in oil prices leading to the financial collapse in 2007-2008. At that time, excess production capacity for OPEC nations was much lower than normal, and they were less able to control prices.\n\nAs long as OPEC controls more than 40% of global oil production and has the ability to dictate global supply levels through production targets, it will continue to have a major influence on oil prices.\n\nWhat a Fool believes\n\nAs much as we want to take control of our energy future, there are just some factors that are out of our control. Unfortunately, several of those factors are working against us, and it's very unlikely we will ever see cheap oil again.\n\nComing back to Mr. Yergin: \"The starting point for energy security today, as it has always been, is diversification of supplies and sources.\" Certainly wise advise for energy policy, and investment strategy.",
  "latent_17167": "President Trumpâs governing blueprint represents the most ambitious effort to cut domestic spending and pare back the federal government since former president Ronald Reagan came to Washington in 1981. Whether it will come close to accomplishing the presidentâs ambitions is a far different question.\n\nTrumpâs new budget proposes to raise discretionary defense spending by $54 billion in the next fiscal year and cut domestic discretionary spending by an equivalent amount, a sizable shift in priorities. To pay for his defense buildup, he would take huge chunks out of the budgets at the State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies. The list of programs identified for elimination is lengthy, with targets both familiar and obscure.\n\nThe presidentâs ambitions go beyond the numbers in his new budget, however. Earlier this week, Trump signed an executive order designed to reorganize the executive branch. Unlike President Bill Clintonâs initiative to reinvent government, Trumpâs order appears to be far more expansive, with a stated goal of finding programs and perhaps whole agencies that could be eliminated.\n\nâPresidents create their own eras,â said John Samples of the Cato Institute. âIf he did this â whatever he said in the campaign â you might see a different cycle going forward with more restraint and a reduction in the size of government. This could be the beginning of a new cycle, but heâs got to get from here to there.â\n\nPresident Trump speaks before signing the order about reorganizing the executive branch March 13. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThat caveat â âwhatever he said in the campaignâ â is not insignificant. Trump has emerged in his early weeks in office as a president with an agenda to tear down parts of the federal government that he sees as superfluous or hostile to his views. Stephen K. Bannon, White House senior counselor and chief strategist, has talked about the âdeconstruction of the administrative state.â\n\nAs a candidate, Trump espoused some of the goals he is following now â cutting regulations, for example â but also promised to hold harmless programs such as Social Security and Medicare and pledged a health-care program that would provide coverage to everyone while also promising major tax cuts. If he sticks to those pledges, the impact on the deficit could be significant.\n\nAll this leaves open the question of what Trumpâs true priorities are. Are they mainly to raise defense spending, thereby being forced to find offsetting savings from domestic spending? Are they to reduce the deficit significantly, in which case what he is proposing will not go very far? Are they to take an ax to the executive branch, both through regulatory changes and the elimination of programs, in an effort to fight a bureaucracy that he appears to see as hostile to his presidency?\n\nâIn terms of the overall change in direction, this is basically following the Reagan blueprint to reorder priorities in discretionary spending,â said former senator Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), who as a House member and âblue dogâ Democrat played a key role in Reaganâs first budget battle. âIt would be modest in any private entity, but in government, itâs significant.â\n\nThe domestic cuts proposed in Trumpâs new budget will produce pain and are likely to spark the same kind of backlash that has greeted past efforts. Trump enjoys the advantage of having a Congress in Republican hands, and one that includes many members who came to Washington determined to cut governmentâs size and scope. But the built-in resistance to cuts in specific programs will test Trumpâs ability to shift priorities and truly shrink Washingtonâs reach.\n\nâThere arenât a lot of examples of presidents coming in and saying, âIâm going to eliminate this program and that program and cut a whole bunch of programs back anywhere from 10 to 30 percent,â â said Robert Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. âThis is quite unusual.â\n\nReagan came to Washington determined to scale back the federal government. His 1981 budget and tax program did just that, cutting taxes dramatically and cutting overall projected government spending by about 5 percent and domestic discretionary spending by about 14 percent, according to Samples. When he left office after eight years, most of those programs he had cut had gotten bigger again, and those he tried to eliminate were still in existence.\n\nThe reason, said Leon E. Panetta, who was director of the Office of Management and Budget during Clintonâs administration, was the built-in obstacles that confront any president seeking to cut rather than spend.\n\nâDeep down, despite a lot of rhetoric about cutting, members of Congress, both Republican and Democrat, are committed to areas of domestic spending, particularly those that affect their districts,â he said. âWhat it means is that defense will go up, but then there will be a real game of smoke and mirrors to find a way to somehow cover those costs.â\n\nPanetta pointed out that successful efforts to attack the deficit combined cuts in defense and domestic spending, higher taxes and changes in entitlement programs. He cited the 1990 agreement between President George H.W. Bushâs White House and a Democratic Congress and the deal reached by Clintonâs White House and a Republican-controlled House that produced a balanced budget in the late 1990s.\n\nBut deficit reduction is not necessarily Trumpâs top priority. His overall fiscal plan remains a work in progress. What is being released this week does not include his proposals to overhaul the tax code. But his campaign promises included cutting the corporation tax and reducing tax rates, including on wealthy individuals. The only way to increase defense spending, therefore, is to go hard after domestic spending.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich, who was chairman of the House Budget Committee at the time of the balanced budget deal, offered this cautionary note. âSlashing is the easiest thing to do,â he said. âReforming is the hardest, but it pays the most dividends.â\n\nTrumpâs proposed domestic cuts come after a period in which those programs have been steadily squeezed as a result of the budget sequester that went into force during President Barack Obamaâs administration.\n\nAlice Rivlin of the Brookings Institution, a former director of the Office of Management and Budget and of the Congressional Budget Office, said domestic spending should be rethought rather than simply cut more. âWeâre spending at record lows in comparison to the size of the economy and the population for all the domestic programs we need,â she said.\n\nTrumpâs order on reorganizing the executive branch could prove significant, if Mick Mulvaney, the new Office of Management and Budget director, fully picks up on the mandate in the directive. âIt is a wide-open invitation for the OMB director to think big and to go after programs and to propose eliminations,â said Chris Edwards of the Cato Institute. âI expect it to be a very bold study.â\n\nElaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution oversaw the government reinvention initiative during the Clinton administration, which was under the direction of Vice President Al Gore. âYou have to tell big pieces of the government to stop doing stuff, and the only way to do that is to overturn statutes,â she said. âThatâs why almost every effort has come far, far short. Despite many Republican administrations and Republican Congresses, the government is bigger than it ever was.â\n\nShe also said that finding substantial savings will be more difficult for the Trump administration than it was for Clinton and Gore. Many of the savings and efficiencies resulted from taking advantage of emerging technology, particularly the Internet. âWe took most of those savings,â she said.\n\nOne priority of the new administration appears to be to change the relationship between Washington and the states and cities by devolving power away from the federal government. That was one of Reaganâs goals.\n\nMany governors are anxiously watching the early moves of the Trump administration, wondering whether changes in programs, whether big-ticket ones like Medicaid or smaller programs targeted for elimination, will put greater burdens on the states unless there is significantly more flexibility built in.\n\nâItâs very much a zero-sum game at the state level,â said Scott Pattison, executive director of the National Governors Association. âItâs not like there are pots of money sitting around that can move in. If grants are cut to state and local governments, something has to give.â\n\nFinally, the priorities of many Republican congressional leaders and Trumpâs more populist supporters may not always intersect. That, too, will be one of the balancing acts the president must manage. Gramm said successful administrations are the ones that follow the process diligently through to the end. Trump is only at the beginning.",
  "latent_17219": "Estonia-based International Centre for Defence and Security (ICDS) has slammed Swedenâs defence, claiming the country would be unable to safeguard its own borders, let alone those of its Baltic neighbours, in the event of a military attack.\n\nA new paper from the think tank flags up increased Russian military activity in the Baltic sea, including last yearâs submarine hunt in the Stockholm archipelago.\n\nâIf we look at the recent incident of foreign submarine near Swedenâs coast in October, then it becomes clear that Swedenâs defence ability is so weak that another country is able to conduct submarine operations in its territorial waters. If Sweden cannot ensure its territorial integrity during peace time, then it is obviously unable to do so during the war,â ICDS deputy head Martin Hurt told Estonian newspaper Eesti PÃ¤eveleth.\n\nSweden's limited defence capabilities also came under fire from critics on home soil.\n\nMilitary expert Johanne Hildebrandt told The Local on Wednesday: \"The downsizing of the military has gone so far that the country's defence abilities are paralysed. That a submarine hunt in the Stockholm archipelago is referred to as an intelligence operation, because there are no resources to chase the intruder violating the country's borders is dismally shameful.\"\n\nRussia has been showing its teeth in the region lately. 9000 troops, 250 tanks and 55 ships were involved in military exercises near St Petersburg and Kaliningrad in December. And the Swedish Foreign Department called in the Russian ambassador after a Russian military plane almost collided with a Swedish SAS plane taking off from Copenhagen airport.\n\nLast year Swedish Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist told The Local that the country's new coalition government was looking into developing a deeper cooperation with other Nordic countries to boost security in the region. He said: âWe have no immediate threat against Sweden but we have a security environment around us that has changed in a negative way and that is why we need to develop and deepen the discussions about how we cooperate with other countries.â\n\nHe added: \"And we also have the Swedish partnership with Nato and the connection to the European Union and the United Nations. It is always important for Sweden to have this transatlantic link that we have developed during the years.\"\n\nRead The Local's interview with Sweden's defence minister\n\nEarlier this year an Ipsos poll for newspaper Dagens Nyheter showed support for Nato membership has gone up. Figures showed 33 percent of Swedes consider Nato membership to be a good idea, up from 28 percent in a similar survey in April last year.\n\nHildebrandt said: \"The strange thing is that the country still has a close relationship with Nato but as non-members we can't affect anything. It is as if we were a mistress who in spite of several proposals refuses to get married, despite the fact that it would be beneficial to us in many ways.\"\n\nBut whether Sweden joins Nato or not, the ICDS paper concludes that the country has lost valuable time. Even if military capabilities are upgrade, the report estimates it would take 7-10 years for the country to reach necessary defence levels.\n\nHurt said: \"There have been reforms for many years, but the new military structures are not properly equipped or manned. Following the Crimea annexation, Swedish politicians have not taken decisions that are backed up by the defence budget.\"",

  "latent_17300": "It may not seem like it, but this week has seen the most significant development yet in the immigration debateâs role in the 2016 election. Iâd go even farther â itâs possible that the entire presidential election just got decided.\n\nIs that an overstatement? Maybe. But hear me out.\n\nFor months, people like me have been pointing to the fundamental challenge Republican presidential candidates face on immigration: they need to talk tough to appeal to their base in the primaries, but doing so risks alienating the Hispanic voters theyâll need in the general election. This was always going to be a difficult line to walk, but a bunch of their candidates just leaped off to one side.\n\nAfter Donald Trump released his immigration plan, which includes an end to birthright citizenship â stating that if you were born in the United States but your parents were undocumented, you donât get to be a citizen â some of his competitors jumped up to say that they agreed. NBC News asked Scott Walker the question directly, and he seemed to reply that he does favor an end to birthright citizenship, though his campaign qualified the statement later. Bobby Jindal tweeted, âWe need to end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants.â Then reporters began looking over othersâ past statements to see where they stood on this issue, and found that this isnât an uncommon position among the GOP field. Remember all the agonizing Republicans did about how they had to reach out to Hispanic voters? They never figured out how to do it, and now theyâre running in the opposite direction.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump released a detailed immigration plan, and its \"great, great wall\" is just the beginning. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)\n\nHere is the list of Republican candidates who have at least suggested openness to ending birthright citizenship, which would mean repealing the 14th Amendment to the Constitution: Donald Trump, Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, John Kasich, Rand Paul, Chris Christie, Lindsey Graham, and Rick Santorum. Thatâs nearly half the GOP field, and more may be added to the list.\n\nThe 14th Amendment states in part: âAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.â It was passed after the Civil War to ensure that former slaves had all the legal rights of other citizens. You canât end birthright citizenship without repealing it. That means that no matter who gets elected in 2016, birthright citizenship is not going to be eliminated. The bar is so high for amending the Constitution that itâs impossible to imagine any amendment this controversial getting ratified, which is as it should be.\n\nBut the political impact is going to be very real, whether or not the idea goes anywhere in practical terms. The simple fact is that if Republicans donât improve their performance among Hispanic voters, they cannot win the White House. Period.\n\nThis discussion about birthright citizenship sends an incredibly clear message to Hispanic voters, a message of naked hostility to them and people like them. Itâs possible to argue that youâre âpro-immigrantâ while simultaneously saying we should build more walls and double the size of the Border Patrol. Indeed, many Republicans do, and while their argument may not be particularly persuasive, itâs not completely crazy. But you canât say youâre pro-immigrant and advocate ending birthright citizenship. You just canât.\n\nI promise you that next fall, there are going to be ads like this running all over the country, and especially on Spanish-language media:\n\nâMy name is Lisa Hernandez. I was born in California, grew up there. I was valedictorian of my high school class, graduated from Yale, and now Iâm in medical school; Iâm going to be a pediatrician. But now Scott Walker and the Republicans say that because my mom is undocumented, that Iâm not a real American and I shouldnât be a citizen. Iâm living the American Dream, but they want to take it away from me and people like me. Well Iâve got a message for you, Governor Walker. Iâm every bit as American as your children. This country isnât about who your parents were, itâs about everybody having a chance to work hard, achieve, and contribute to our future. It seems like some people forgot that.â\n\nWhen a hundred ads like that one are blanketing the airwaves, the Republicans can say, âWait, I support legal immigration!â all they want, but it wonât matter. Hispanic voters will have heard once again â and louder than ever before â that the GOP doesnât like them and doesnât want them. Will it be different if they nominate one of the candidates who doesnât want to repeal birthright citizenship, like Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio? Somewhat, but the damage among Hispanic voters could already be too great even for them to overcome.\n\nNow letâs look at the magnitude of the challenge the Republicans face. A number of analysts have all come to the same conclusion: given that Hispanics are rapidly increasing their share of the population and whitesâ share is declining, Republicans need to improve their performance among Hispanics to prevail.\n\nAnd they may have to improve dramatically. For instance, in this analysis by Latino Decisions, under even the most absurdly optimistic scenario for Republicans â âthat white voters consolidate behind the Republican Party at levels that were observed in 2014; that black participation and Democratic support returns to pre-Obama levels; and the expected growth in the Latino vote does not fully materializeâ â the Republican candidate would need 42 percent of the Hispanic vote to win. As a point of comparison, according to exit polls Mitt Romney got 27 percent of Hispanic votes in 2012, while John McCain got 31 percent in 2008. Under a more likely scenario, with an electorate that votes something like in 2012 but with African-American turnout reduced, the Republican would need 47 percent of the Hispanic vote. In their worst-case scenario for Republicans â an electorate that votes identically to the way it did in 2012, but adjusted for changes in population â the Republican would need a stunning 52 percent of Hispanic votes.\n\nSo to sum up: even in the best possible situation when it comes to turnout and the vote choices of the rest of the electorate, the Republican presidential candidate in 2016 is going to have to pull off an absolutely heroic performance among Hispanic voters if heâs going to win.\n\nThat seemed awfully unlikely a week ago. How likely does it seem today?",

Officials said it was a terrorist attack â the deadliest in New York City since Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nThe man hopped out of the truck and shouted \"Allahu Akbar,\" or \"God is great,\" before firing a BB or pellet gun, four senior law enforcement sources told NBC News. A police officer on patrol in the area returned fire, hitting the suspect in the abdomen and ending the Halloween horror less than a mile from the World Trade Center.\n\nSayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov. St. Charles, Missouri, Corrections Department\n\nLaw enforcement sources said the man left a note in the truck claiming that he committed the attack for the Islamic State terrorist group, although it was not known whether he was imitating other IS-inspired road attacks in Europe or was under the group's control.\n\n\"This was an act of terror and a particularly cowardly act of terror,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a briefing. \"We know this action was intended to test our spirit.\"\n\nThe suspect was identified as a 29-year-old Uzbek immigrant named Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, who entered the United States in 2010, law enforcement officials said.\n\nWhile police rushed the wounded suspect to Bellevue Hospital, six of the victims â all men â were pronounced dead at the scene, and two more died later, Police Commissioner James O'Neill said.\n\n\"Today, there was a loss of innocent life in lower Manhattan,\" O'Neill said. \"This is a tragedy of the greatest magnitude.\"\n\nO'Neill would not comment on whether the suspect lived in New York City or was a \"radicalized American.\" Multiple law enforcement sources told NBC News that the suspect rented his truck from a Passaic, N.J., Home Depot and that his minivan was still parked there Tuesday evening.\n\nRecords revealed that Saipov had lived for a time in Paterson, New Jersey. The weapons investigators recovered turned out to be a pellet gun and a paintball gun.\n\nNYPD Officer Ryan Nash apprehended Saipov, according to a tweet from Councilman Joe Borelli.\n\n\"I want to commend the response of our NYPD officer that was on post near the location who stopped the carnage moments after it began,\" O'Neill said.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the attack appeared to be the work of a \"lone wolf.\"\n\n\"There's no evidence to suggest a wider plot,\" he said.\n\nThe FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force joined the investigation.\n\nPhotos: Terrorist Truck Attack Shocks New York City\n\nArgentina's foreign affairs minister said five of the victims were Argentine, and the group had been celebrating the 30th anniversary of a school graduation. The official identified them in a statement as HernÃ¡n Mendoza, Diego Angelini, Alejandro Pagnucco, Ariel Erlij and HernÃ¡n Ferruch. Belgium's foreign affairs ministry said one of the victims was a national of that country. A woman from Germany was injured in the attack, a spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry said.\n\nKobiljon Matkarov, a friend of the suspect who said he met Saipov five years ago, when they both lived in Florida, told NBC News that \"he is no terrorist.\"\n\n\"He was a very happy guy,\" said Matkarov, who added that Saipov was married with kids and worked as a truck driver. \"He liked the U.S.\"\n\nThe attack began unfolding at 3:05 p.m. when the southbound truck veered onto a bike path on West Street near Houston Street.\n\n\"He entered the bike path at Houston Street and exited the bike path when he collided with the bus at Chambers Street,\" O'Neill said.\n\nTwo adults and two children were in the bus, the commissioner said.\n\n\"You could see cyclists and pedestrians badly injured,\" said MSNBC correspondent and producer Louis Burgdorf, who was outside a building where Canal Street meets the West Side Highway, which is north of Chambers and the highway.\n\nA witness, Tawhid Kabir Xisan, 20, said he saw a man running in the street carrying what appeared to be two guns near Chambers Street.\n\nRelated: NYC Truck Attack Brings Deadly Terrorist Trend to the U.S.\n\n\"He was just running around in the middle of the street,\" said Xisan, a student at Borough of Manhattan Community College nearby. \"I heard five to six gunshots, and then when the gunshots were happening, I didn't see what happened on the road because I was scared.\"\n\nWhen he looked up again, Xisan said, \"I saw the guy that had the two guns on the ground. Three or four officers were holding him down.\"\n\nInitially, the incident was reported as a shooting near Chambers Street and the West Side Highway, which is near Public School 89.\n\nInvestigators inspect the truck used in the attack. Don Emmert / AFP - Getty Images\n\nAnother witness told NBC New York that after smashing into the school bus a man got out of the truck \"and started shooting up the place.\"\n\n\"All the kids were in the courtyard of P.S. 89 and started running,\" another witness said. He said he went to the struck school bus and saw that one side was caved in, with one girl struck above a wheel well and two other children trapped by a window.\n\n\"It was all blown out,\" he said.\n\nIn Washington, White House officials said President Donald Trump was receiving \"ongoing\" briefings about the attack in his hometown.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of today's terrorist attack in New York City and their families,\" Trump said in a statement. \"My Administration will provide its full support to the New York City Police Department, including through a joint investigation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We offer our thanks to the first responders who stopped the suspect and rendered immediate aid to the victims of this cowardly attack. \"\n\nAs detectives continued to gather evidence and extra police were dispatched to the protect the thousands of revelers at the Halloween parade in Greenwich Village, the wrecked pickup sat surrounded by yellow police tape with its hazard lights blinking.",

  "latent_17407": "Yet, despite all the prognosticators predicting it willâchoose the violence level of your metaphorâgo out of style, be put out to pasture, or taken out back and shot, email grinds on.\n\nYou can't kill email! It's the cockroach of the Internet, and I mean that as a compliment. This resilience is a good thing.\n\n\"There isn't much to sending or receiving email and that's sort of the point,\" observed Aaron Straup Cope, the Cooper-Hewitt Design Museum's Senior Engineer in Digital and Emerging Media. \"The next time someone tells you email is 'dead,' try to imagine the cost of investing in their solution or the cost of giving up all the flexibility that email affords.\"\n\nEmail is actually a tremendous, decentralized, open platform on which new, innovative things can and have been built. In that way, email represents a different model from the closed ecosystems we see proliferating across our computers and devices.\n\nEmail is a refugee from the open, interoperable, less-controlled \"web we lost.\" It's an exciting landscape of freedom amidst the walled gardens of social networking and messaging services.\n\nYes, email is exciting. Get excited!\n\n* * *\n\nFor all the changes occurring around email, the experience of email itself has been transformed, too. Email is not dying, but it is being unbundled.\n\nBecause it developed early in the history of the commercial Internet, email served as a support structure for many other developments in the web's history. This has kept email vitally important, but the downside is that the average inbox in the second decade of the century had become clogged with cruft. Too many tasks were bolted on to email's simple protocols.\n\nLooking back on these transitional years from the 2020s, email will appear to people as a grab bag of mismatched services.\n\nEmail was a newsfeed. With the proliferation of newsletters, email alerts, flash sale emails, and other email-delivered content, one's email client became a major site of media consumption. It was a feed as much as an inbox.\n\nEmail was one's passport and identity. Before Facebook became a true alternative for verifying one's identity on the web, the email address was how one accomplished serious things on the Internet. Want to verify a bank account? Email. Amazon? Email. Forums? Email. Even Facebook in the early days? Email. And it meant something where your email address was hosted. FirstName@YourLastName.com signaled you owned a domain. A Hotmail account might indicate you were a beginner and a Well address connoted early Internet connectivity. For a time, Gmail addresses were a sign of sophistication. Now, both the functional and symbolic importance of email addresses is in decline. There are so many more ways to signal who we are online now.\n\nEmail was the primary means of direct social communication on the Internet. Email was how to send a message to someone, period. BBSs, chat rooms, and message boards have existed for as long as email, but email formed the private links between people that undergirded the public channels, which evolved before and with the web. Now, there are a lot of ways to reach someone on the net. There is one's phone, Facebook profile, Twitter account, LinkedIn, Instagram, Qik, WhatsApp, etc., etc. It's telling that in the mobile world, app developers want access to a user's phone's contact list, not her email connections.",

By better understanding the geographic distribution of this trend, we believe the country will be much better prepared to weather the risks and reap the potential benefits of automation,â said Sean Mullin, executive director of BII+E.\n\nBrookfield says the industries with the highest proportion of automatable work activities include:\n\nAccommodation and food services\n\nManufacturing\n\nTransportation and warehousing\n\nAgriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting\n\nMining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction\n\nAbout 62 percent of work activities could be automated within these industries.\n\n46 per cent of work activities across all Canadian industries are currently at risk, when applied to 2011 Canadian census data. While this statistic only represents partial work activities in some cases, as opposed to entire jobs, it still represents the equivalent of roughly 7.7 million jobs across the country.\n\nAn interactive map of this data broken down by community can be found here.",
  "latent_17486": "It has been a long-held assumption that poor nations will not support efforts to protect the environment since their citizens are too preoccupied with meeting basic needs, such as food and housing.\n\nHowever, a new study in The Sociological Quarterly reveals that citizens of poorer nations are just as concerned about environmental quality as their counterparts in rich nations.\n\nRiley E. Dunlap, PhD, of Oklahoma State University and Richard York, PhD, of the University of Oregon compared results from four large cross-national surveys, each conducted in several dozen nations ranging with differing economic statuses. Representative samples of citizens were surveyed in each nation.\n\nResults showed that citizens of poorer nations were equally if not more concerned about the environment compared to citizens in wealthier countries. The citizens of the poorer nations were supportive of efforts to solve environmental problems.\n\nThe authors believe that previous studies failed to recognize that environmental problems are often a threat to material welfare and not just quality of life. For example, deforestation may threaten the livelihoods of people who depend on forests for firewood, food sources, and economic products.\n\nâOur results suggest that well-designed policies to promote sustainable development will have more appeal to citizens of poor nations than is often assumed,â the authors conclude.",

  "latent_17546": "This post originally appeared on The Nation.\n\nOnly 12 minutes into his presidency, Barack Obama reached out to the Muslim world and Iran, offering America's hand of friendship if Iran would in turn unclench its fist. Yet three years later, we are closer to war than we were in the last years of the Bush administration, with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta telling the Washington Post there is a \"strong likelihood\" of an Israeli strike this spring. How did we get here?\n\nConventional wisdom in Washington is that Obama's diplomacy with Iran failed. It did not. As I argue in my new book A Single Roll of the Dice: Obama's Diplomacy With Iran, it was prematurely abandoned. Obama's intention was genuine, but his vision for diplomacy was soon undermined, for four reasons: pressure from Israel and its powerful allies in Congress, and to a lesser extent from Saudi Arabia and France, to adopt a confrontational policy; the June 2009 election mayhem in Iran and the subsequent repression and human rights abuses, which hardened the regime in Tehran and narrowed Obama's space for diplomacy; Obama's early adoption of a contradictory \"dual track\" policy, combining diplomacy with escalating pressure on Tehran; and Obama's unwillingness to create more domestic political space for diplomacy by challenging a status quo in Washington that is set on enmity.\n\nThe Netanyahu government and its Washington allies compromised Obama's vision in four ways. First, they insisted that diplomacy be given an unrealistically tight deadline of 12 weeks. Second, although Obama was potentially willing to accept enrichment of uranium on Iranian soil under strict inspections, Israel demanded complete dismantling of the Iranian nuclear program, an unachievable objective that rendered diplomacy dead on arrival. Third, the Israelis and their hardline U.S. allies pushed for sanctions before diplomacy was even tried. Obama pushed back at first, but after the Iranian election scandal, the pro-sanctions camp got the upper hand.\n\nAnd fourth, the Israelis opposed Obama's view that demilitarizing the atmosphere would help convince Tehran that America was serious about diplomacy. \"My administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us,\" Obama told the Iranians in his March 2009 Persian New Year video. \"This process will not be advanced by threats. We seek instead engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual respect.\" Israel, on the other hand, believed Washington must repeatedly emphasize that the military option remained on the table so Tehran would not see the United States as weak. Thus, when Obama pursued diplomacy, the Israelis sought to undermine him by increasing their militaristic rhetoric.\n\nOver the past three years, Obama has yielded on almost all these points.\n\nEven before succumbing to Netanyahu's pressure, however, Obama had adopted the dual track policy, a holdover from the Bush administration pushed strongly by Israel and France, which set the stage for the ensuing stalemate. That policy assumed that diplomacy with Iran could succeed only if coupled with significant escalating pressure. Vali Nasr, an Obama official who recently left the administration, has said that the current stalemate is a consequence of adopting this \"failed assumption.\"\n\nSince Obama abandoned diplomacy in November 2009 and activated the pressure track, relations have steadily deteriorated. Both sides have escalated bellicose rhetoric, and both have rejected the other's offer of talks. In the late summer of 2010, Obama began sending military signals, combined with increasing sanctions, to give Tehran the feeling it was facing the threat of attack. The intent was not to start a war but to drive the situation to the brink of war to maximize U.S. negotiating strength and extract concessions from Iran.\n\nThis is an extremely risky policy. At best, the United States can control its own actions within this dynamic. But it cannot control Iran's reactions or how Tehran reads Washington's military signals. As a Pentagon official told me in 2010, the administration is very frustrated that its intercepts of Iranian communications in the Persian Gulf reveal that Tehran consistently misreads America's signals.\n\nAdm. Mike Mullen, weeks before leaving his post as chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, pointed to this risk. \"We haven't had a connection with Iran since 1979,\" he said. \"Even in the darkest days of the cold war, we had links to the Soviet Union. We are not talking to Iran, so we don't understand each other. If something happens, it's virtually assured that we won't get it right -- that there will be miscalculation, which would be extremely dangerous in that part of the world.\"\n\nMoreover, the White House either cannot or is not willing to spend the political capital necessary to control Israeli actions. A policy aimed at reaching the brink of war can easily be manipulated by a state that has publicly voiced its preference for military confrontation. In this explosive atmosphere, Israel can manufacture a small spark that could trigger a catastrophic conflict.\n\nI do not believe that the Obama administration wants war with Iran. It is pressing Israel hard not to attack, knowing well that the political cost for Israel -- given the overwhelming, uncritical support for Israeli war fever on Capitol Hill -- is minimal in a U.S. election year. But a policy of brinkmanship may beget a war, especially when not coupled with a much firmer, more sustainable -- and unapologetic -- diplomatic track.\n\nThe Iranian nuclear dilemma is not easily resolved, but neither is it of unprecedented complexity. Humanity has resolved tougher problems. The obvious solution is to accept limited enrichment on Iranian soil under the strictest IAEA inspections, with a transparency and verification regime that renders militarization of the program virtually impossible.\n\nThe difficulty is not necessarily in defining a mutually acceptable solution as much as finding a path to that solution. As Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, recently said, \"If there is strong political will and mutual confidence being established, this issue could be resolved in a few days.\" He added, \"The technical disputes are not so big. The problem is mutual confidence and strong political will.\"\n\nBut strong political will is exactly what has been missing in Washington and Tehran in recent years. It's what prompted Obama to give in to Congress and Israel and adopt a misguided policy, and what caused the divided leadership in Tehran to fear compromise more than escalation. It is lack of political courage that has permitted this looming confrontation. Only courage and will can bring us out of it. The question is whether Obama can muster that will in an election year when any compromise is bound to be cast by Republicans as a betrayal of Israel.\n\nThis post appears in the February 27, 2012 edition of The Nation.",
  "latent_17691": "Deann reached out to me on Fiverr . Her husband Paul is taking a trip to Disneyland with the grandkids soon and wanted some tips on good travel pants. She also wanted to know how to get a good fit in the seat for a guy who doesn't have much of a rear-end. She is considering a tailor. She included two pics of Paul for a critique.\n\nHi Deann,\n\nI hope the trip to Disneyland is fun. Certainly being able to get items tailored solves many problems, especially if you develop a rapport with one who does a good job. Ideally, you'll be able to buy pants off the rack to save money and also know that you can drop by a store anywhere and find brands you know fit well. Knowing you can drop into a chain retail store and grab a backup pair of pants wherever you are at can reduce stress traveling or else one spilt cup of coffee can wreck your whole trip.\n\nIn the case of a guy like Paul who is a bit bigger on top but does not need \"relaxed\" or \"husky\" pants, look for slim fit or straight leg pants, not to be confused with skinny jeans. Slim pants are an overall cut and proportion, so you should be able to find them in large sizes. 44/32 is a pretty common size even in traditional department stores. Obviously, there are going to be variations from brand to brand, so if you know of a particular pair of pants that look great on him, take note of the brand and always go back.\n\nFor travel pants in that size, take a look at Duluth Trading Company's Dry On The Fly Pants. These are a lightweight nylon/spandex pant cut to look like casual khakis. You can wash them in the sink and hang them to dry. They are wrinkle resistant, so putting them on a hanger overnight is all the care they need to look great the next day. There are lots of companies who produce pants like this at various price points, but at $80, they are akin to a nice pair of slacks; I've seen others come in at $120 a pair. If you are only interested in function and aren't concerned with being dressed up, take a look at what some call tech pants. These are lightweight, easy-dry pants you can find at any outdoor or sporting goods store. They are rugged, comfortable, and usually, have zip-off legs so you can convert them to shorts. These run about $50 a pair and are ubiquitous among travelers.\n\nhttp://www.duluthtrading.com/store/product/mn-duluthflex-dry-on-the-fly-nylon-pants-84505.aspx?feature=HL84505 Dry on the Fly Pants\n\nhttps://www.rei.com/product/861660/rei-classic-sahara-convertible-pants-mens-32-inseam Tech Pants\n\nLeisure Look\n\nLet me start by saying if this is Paul just hanging around the house, who am I to critique how a man looks when he's just trying to be comfy, eh? I'll offer some general observations about things I'd point out if he heads out the door in this. First, considering this is a leisure look, it fits fine, so no problems there. Given that Paul has a light complexion and some salt and pepper in his hair, I'd stay away from solid white on top. Think of his skin tone and hair as the outfit he's got to wear all the time, and it's a color he's got no choice about so he should match and contrast with the rest of his clothes in much the same way he'd pick out a tie. Leisurewear comes in lots of colors and patterns and even if he's just hanging out or taking a quick trip to the store, he's going to run into people he knows and can still look great. I would stay away from stark 50/50 contrasts like a white top and black pants. A lighter pant or a darker top, or items that are a bit more complimentary, colorwise, would make the outfit a bit more cohesive. A style I can't wait to try out are pants that look like regular dress slacks but are made of French Terry AKA sweat pant material. They sound like heaven. Perhaps surprise him with a pair for his birthday and see how he likes them. Finally, it's irrelevant if this an around-the-house look, but in general, dark pants, dark socks.

On the contrary, it's growing at a phenomenal rate. This is no wasteland, you may think as you're cruising the eightteen lanes of Information Superhighway. This is Wonderland! Look at all the stuff out there! Why, I can see a dozen amazing websites from right here! What is this idiot Dejawhatsis gassing on about?\n\nI'll tell you what happened. We completed the Superhighway metaphor. We built billboards and service centers all along it. That's what you can see. No trees, no wonders of nature, just mile-high, customer-driven, neon billboards, Exxon stations and McDonald's franchises. The Internet used to be a new frontier that crossed borders and held limitless possibilities. Then the businessmen moved in.\n\nAre you reading a webpage about supernovas? Hey, you must really be into the stars. Why don't we frame that page with a banner ad for the new Star Trek movie, a couple of box ads for telescopes, DVDs about the Challenger disaster and one for a website where - get this, fellow stargazer - you can play a crappy Flash version of Asteroids with HARDLY ANY HIDDEN COST AND GUARANTEED NOT VERY MUCH SPYWARE!!!\n\nAnd since it's pretty easy for to just ignore the frame and read the article you came here for, why don't we pepper the text itself with pop-up hyperlinks to dozens of other things you can buy, and make every one jump out at you every time your cursor comes anywhere near it?\n\nAlso, that page is way too long. Who wants to look at so much boring text? Don't your fingers get tired from scrolling? Take a break, fanboy. Tell you what, we'll put a little stop sign in there to break up that wall of text for you after three paragraphs. Looks a little empty like that, so how about we insert a nice page-width ad for Dell computers there? No harm done, right? Hey, if you don't want a new Dell you just scroll right past it.\n\nAnd if we find that you do that too often, we'll make it into one of those neat animated pop-up ads that scroll with you, blocking the text until you click to make it go away. So everybody wins. Hey, our sponsors have to eat too.\n\nHmm, that's still an awful lot of text. Hey, I know, why don't we break it up into three pages, and that way you can see three times as many ads for the same actual information?\n\nYeah, I like that. Thanks for reading our page(s) about exploding stars. And on your way out, don't forget to click on the handy buttons we've installed for Reddit, Duggit, Hatedit, nas.ty.tast.ing, and Regurgitate.com, so all your friends can know how much you rock. That way we get noticed, you get indy cred points, your friends find out what's cool, and the Web evolves, right?\n\nWEB 2.0: EVOLVING TO THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR\n\nWelcome to the new world. It's a major step forward. It's actually user-created. This is a quantum leap, my fellow Netizen. Finally we're taking control of the Web. No more static content written by people who know what they're writing about. We've got access to Mother now, and we'll get our own answers! Down with Brittanica, up Wikipedia!\n\nYeah, sure.\n\nI like Wikipedia, actually. It's a perfect example of the things I once thought the Web would achieve. I don't write for it because I'm an opinionated bitch who can barely write a single sentence in Neutral Point of View, but I look things up on it all the time. And over the years, the hivemind really has turned Wiki from a niche hobby site riddled with errors and dead zones into a really good writers' resource that you can trust to at least get the basics right on just about every subject. Wikipedia search is built into browsers now. It's done well, it's beautiful, and it's the future.\n\nBUT.\n\nWikipedia isn't the paradigm for Web 2.0, MySpace is. For every Wikipedia-style website you can find in the wild, there are three or four taking pages from MySpace or Facebook. The key element of the new wave of websites isn't user-written, it's social networking. Friend requests! Shared bookmarks! Make Me Popular widgets! What kind of loser wants to spend hours writing a dumb encyclopedia article, when you could be checking Monica's latest camphone self-portraits, finding out who's going to the Fall Out Boy concert, or voting on the new Mountain Dew flavor? And if you're really caught up in that oh-so-2007 blogging stuff and still think writing is cool (what a dweeb!), use Twitter instead of one of those long, boring blogging tools. Hell, 140 characters is more than enough for anybody - and with Twitter, everybody knows how sucky your work day is the very second you get a bathroom break! You're not just writing or hanging out virtually here, dude, you're sticking it to the Man! The Web is ours at last!! You should totally YouTube that shit!!!\n\nTHE BATTLE OF THE BOOB TUBES\n\nRemember when Yahoo was a Web directory? Well, that functionality could still be there for all I know, but I haven't seen it in years, because they've buried it under seventeen layers of MyYahooSpaceBook crap as part of Yahoo's transformation into a modern Internet portal. What \"Internet portal\" apparently means circa 2008 is, your new interactive TV station, with every kind of junk that you used to get on your old-fashioned TV. This, the second most popular gateway into the wonderful Web, now proudly presents a front page full of the very latest in celebrity gossip, diet tips, box office news, love horoscopes, and \"most popular searches\", half of which involve Jessica Simpson (who appears to be some kind of singer, as far as I can tell).\n\nSure, there's information in there, too, just like there are good things on TV. You can find real news on Yahoo if you want it. You can use search to find things that don't involve Jessica Simpson. You can check your e-mail, get a weather forecast, find critiques of great books, just like you could potentially use your TV to watch Masterpiece Theatre and Jon Stewart. But that's not what Yahoo assumes you want, and it certainly doesn't go out of its way to show you those things. By Yahoo standards, Jessica Simpson is more important than Barack Obama. Call me a geek or a pretentiously serious old fart, but that just seems wrong to me.\n\nThe good stuff on the Web is still out there, just like TV still produces the occasional Daily Show, Lost and Deadwood. I still get my news from the Net, and probably still spend more time reading online than reading books. But the signal to noise ratio gets worse and worse every year, and it's becoming unbearable. We turned off our TV in 2002 to protect ourselves and our daughter from the brain-sucking stupidity that passes for entertainment on TV. I'm starting to wonder if we'll make it to 2012 without turning off our Internet.\n\nDejaMorgana\n\nOnline since 1995ish\n\nTV-free since 2002\n\nAuthor of a bunch of stories you never heard of\n\nFather of two\n\nRuler of the Known Universe\n\nChampion of Baby Fieldmice\n\nCurrently reading: \"Excession\", \"The Hidden Family\" and \"Interpretation of Laboratory Results for Small Animal Clinicians\"\n\nCurrently watching: um, Futurama?

  "latent_18132": "Great Cathedral Mystery\n\nPBS Airdate: February 12, 2014\n\nNARRATOR: It is one of the greatest engineering feats of all time, a miracle made of brick and mortar that defied the doubters and helped inspire the Renaissance: the dome of the Florence cathedral, built 600 years ago by a goldsmith, with no training as an architect, who dared to attempt the impossible.\n\nROCKY RUGGIERO (Kent State University): He constructs the dome at a time where the technology should not have permitted it. It just should not have been possible.\n\nNARRATOR: Constructed of over four million bricks, weighing 40,000 tons, it's the largest masonry dome the world has ever known, yet the methods used to build it remain a mystery.\n\nNow, a professor obsessed with the dome's secrets joins forces with a team of American bricklayers to put his theory to the test.\n\nMASSIMO RICCI (University of Florence): You put there the bricks.\n\n(Translated) I had to figure it out myself, because the builder didn't write anything down, and he didn't leave anything behind.\n\nDAVE WYSOCKI (International Masonry Institute): This must be the way they have done it. This would be the only way that it makes sense.\n\nNARRATOR: Secrets of the Duomo, right now, on this NOVA/National Geographic Special.\n\nFlorence, Italy: for centuries, travelers have been coming here to gaze at the wonders of the Renaissance. Six hundred years ago, this city experienced a creative explosion unlike any other. Visionaries like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo flourished here, in an atmosphere that celebrated imagination and innovation.\n\nMany believe the Renaissance began with the completion of the city's most visible landmark, the dome on the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore. Built 60 years before Columbus sailed the Atlantic, without the use of modern machines or materials, the dome is still the largest of its kind in the world. It's an icon shrouded in mystery, because no one knows exactly how it was constructed.\n\nCertain features of the dome stand out. It's in the shape of a pointed arch, with eight sides rising to a central point, topped by an enormous marble lantern. But there is more to it than meets the eye. The exterior tiles conceal walls containing over four million bricks, and what appears to be a single, solid structure is actually two domes, one inside the other.\n\nThe interior dome covers an open space nearly half the length of a football field, while the outer shell rises 10 stories atop cathedral walls, themselves 170 feet high.\n\nQuestions about how the dome was built persist to this day. Six centuries ago, how could builders work at such great heights? How could they know the eight sides would meet in the center? And how did the steep brick walls hold together without collapsing?\n\nTIMOTHY VERDON (Cathedral Foundation Museum): With the dome, Florence moves into an entirely different dimension. The dome becomes the hub of a new city, of a new world. This is so soaring, so daring, so confident, so absolute a structure, it's like a work of God.\n\nNARRATOR: But the dome is the work of a man, one of the most elusive and enigmatic geniuses of all time. His name was Filippo Brunelleschi. Trained as a goldsmith, he had no experience in architecture or building, yet he took on what seemed to be impossible: keeping 40,000 tons of masonry curving through the air without caving in to the floor below.\n\nExperts are still trying to understand how he managed to defy gravity.\n\nROCKY RUGGIERO: He constructs the dome at a time where the technology should not have permitted it. How is it possible that he built the thing when he did? It just should not have been possible.\n\nNARRATOR: By all accounts, Filippo Brunelleschi was a suspicious and secretive man. Unlike Leonardo, he left behind no notebooks, no drawings, no blueprints for later generations to study. So, for centuries, scholars have been trying to uncover the secret of Brunelleschi's dome.\n\nBrunelleschi is so revered in Florence they hold a parade every year on the anniversary of his death. The destination: his tomb, within the great cathedral itself.\n\nLeading the ceremony is Massimo Ricci, professor of architecture and engineering at the University of Florence. Ricci has spent 40 years of his life trying to understand the master's methods. For Ricci, Brunelleschi has become an obsession.\n\nMASSIMO RICCI (Translated): The study of the dome is so difficult and so daunting, because it forces you to deal with the mind that created it. It's a direct relationship with a way of thinking that existed outside the norm. That engagement inspires a kind of fear, but at the same time, a great respect for him that is beyond measure.\n\nNARRATOR: The mystery of the dome has taken such a hold on him that for nearly 25 years, Ricci's been building a dome of his own, in a park, in a residential neighborhood in Florence, employing what he believes to be Brunelleschi's methods.\n\nHe began construction in 1989. Since then, the model has served as an open-air laboratory, with Ricci playing the role of Brunelleschi, and crews of architecture students putting his ideas into effect.\n\nRicci insists his approach is the only way to answer questions that have mystified scholars since the Renaissance.\n\nMASSIMO RICCI (Translated): I was the only one who felt the need to build a model on such a grand scale, to understand more deeply all of the secrets hidden within the dome.\n\nNARRATOR: Now Ricci's experiment is at a crucial point in the process. With over 400 tons of masonry in place, the walls are beginning to bend inward, the pull of gravity is unrelenting, and the danger of collapse is very real. Soon, it could be too risky for students to continue the work.\n\nMASSIMO RICCI (Translated): To understand the dome, you have to go through the problem of the bricklayers. Whoever doesn't do this is going to make a big fool of themselves.\n\nNARRATOR: In the Renaissance, there were no lasers, computer-animated models, or detailed blueprints to guide the process. Builders relied on ropes to control the progress of the work. Ricci is convinced that the secret to the dome has something to do with a special way Brunelleschi used rope lines to establish how each brick should fit into place.\n\nANGELA: Non, troppa, troppa, troppa.\n\nNARRATOR: Ricci's dome is one-fifth the size of Brunelleschi's, but still huge, large enough, he hopes, to prove his theory of the secret of the dome correct.\n\nROCKY RUGGIERO: I think, oftentimes, when you have an artist whose personality remains as vague as Brunelleschi's, inevitably what scholars do is to almost assume the role of the artist. What you're trying to do is to put yourself into the mind of the architect. Trying to find the secret of the dome is trying to find the secret of Brunelleschi.\n\nNARRATOR: The search for that secret begins in the years just before the Renaissance. At the dawn of the 14th century, a kind of medieval arms race is raging between Florence and other emerging city-states, like Siena and Pisa, each trying to outdo the other by building bigger and bigger cathedrals.\n\nTIMOTHY VERDON: Florentines are very creative people. They are also very competitive people. That means, among other things, they want to do what no one else has done.\n\nROSS KING (Author, Brunelleschi's Dome): And they decided that other cites in Tuscany, other cities in Italy, had grander temples than they did, and so they wanted to compete with them and, more especially, they wanted to outdo them.\n\nNARRATOR: In 1293, the city leaders of Florence form a committee to oversee the construction of a new cathedral. They want theirs to be different from any other. Florentines dislike the look of the Gothic cathedrals that have been spreading across Europe for over a hundred years. They consider them too cluttered, with their walls propped up by flying buttresses and their many tall, pointed spires.\n\nFor inspiration, the committee looks to ancient Rome, in particular, to the classical temple honoring all Roman gods: the Pantheon. It was famed for its unrivaled dome, made of poured concrete. But such engineering technology had been completely erased by centuries of war, and it's the accepted wisdom of the time that no culture will ever rival the Romans in the building arts.\n\nFlorence is determined to surpass all architectural glories, past and present. Through the 1300s, the cathedral committee's vision for Santa Maria del Fiore keeps expanding: longer, wider, higher. Eventually, the committee's reach begins to exceed its grasp.\n\nROCKY RUGGIERO: They were really presenting themselves with a serious problem, because, in enlarging the church, what they are also enlarging is the crossing area of the church, essentially, where the two arms would intersect.\n\nNARRATOR: Like many cathedrals, Santa Maria del Fiore is in the shape of a cross. The larger the church, the larger the area over the altar place needed to be covered by the dome.\n\nROCKY RUGGIERO: They eventually create a crossing space which measured 143-feet, 6-inches across. Today, in the 21st century, it would be difficult for us to cover, to roof, such a vast space. In the 14th and 15th centuries, theoretically, it should have been impossible.\n\nNARRATOR: A mural depicting the cathedral, years before the dome was begun, shows what the committee had in mind: an enormous pointed dome with eight sides meeting at the top.\n\nROSS KING: There's no question it's going to be spectacular. There is just one catch: no one knows how they are going to build it.\n\nNARRATOR: What was so challenging about building a dome on this cathedral? After all, a dome is nothing more than an arch rotated 360 degrees. And, by 1300, Gothic cathedrals have been using arches and vaulting for over a hundred years.\n\nHow did they do it?\n\nMedieval technology relies on wooden frameworks to hold the masonry until the final piece is put in place, the two sides pushing against each other allow the structure to stand on its own. This method is known as \"centering.\"\n\nROCKY RUGGIERO: In the Middle Ages, if we're building a vault, okay, we build that wooden framework; we put our blocks, our bricks on top of it; we wait for the masonry to dry. Then, we make the sign of the cross, pull the wooden framework away and run like hell, because the failure rate on most of these vaults was about 50 percent.\n\nNARRATOR: But this technology would not work in the Florence cathedral.\n\nROSS KING: The problem with the wooden centering for Santa Maria del Fiore was that it was going to be unprecedented in scale, if they built it. It would have been enormously expensive.\n\nNARRATOR: The area beneath the dome is so high and so wide, just building the wooden framework to support the masonry would have taken hundreds of trees, years of construction and huge amounts of money. Unless someone, someday, invents a way to keep curving walls in place as they rise, the dome will never be built.\n\nROCKY RUGGIERO: I mean, for me, the most extraordinary thing about the construction of the cathedral is undertaking a project that you knew, fully well, you did not have the technology to complete.\n\nNARRATOR: By the time Filippo Brunelleschi is born, the cathedral has already been under construction for 80 years, with no solution in sight to the problem of the dome. Brunelleschi spends his youth being trained, not as an architect or stonemason, but in a trade that continues to flourish in Florence to this day: precious metals.\n\nIt's a path followed in later years by many artists, including Donatello and Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nSHOP KEEPER (Translated): He began in the workshop when he was 14 years old, his father's friend's workshop. He apprenticed until he was 17 or 18 and learned all the techniques typical of the Florentine tradition.\n\nROSS KING: To us, in the 21st century, that may seem a slightly odd way to get your start in architecture. But, in fact, you could have had no better training in the 15th century, to become an architect or a sculptor or a designer of any sort. They worked with gold, they worked with silver. They used their minds as well as their hands. They had to figure out how to make things work both practically and also aesthetically.\n\nNARRATOR: Brunelleschi first attracts public attention in the year 1401. Just 23, he enters a competition to decorate the most revered building in all of Florence: the Baptistery. For centuries, Florentines, including Dante and the Medicis, have been baptized here. And the building needs a new set of ornamented bronze doors.\n\nROSS KING: And Filippo Brunelleschi, being very ambitious and very talented, threw his hat into the ring.\n\nTIMOTHY VERDON: It's the most important artistic competition for a public work that everyone will see, that will immediately create fame and prestige. And he manages to become one of the finalists, along with another beginning master, Lorenzo Ghiberti.\n\nROSS KING: The competition involved casting a trial panel, making an experimental piece to show what you could do. So everyone was given the same amount of bronze and told, \"Go away to your workshop and make us something.\"\n\nMASSIMO RICCI (Translated): They produced two panels, which, luckily, still survive. In these two panels, there's a confrontation between the classical style of Ghiberti and the Renaissance style of Brunelleschi.\n\nThe Abraham of Lorenzo Ghiberti is very beautiful. He has a long, curly beard, flowing hair; the scene is very decorated, it's very rich in detail. The one from Brunelleschi is one of incredible humanism. That's already something new.\n\nLook at the way in which Abraham wants to kill his son. While the Abraham of Ghiberti is just in his pose with the knife, and the son is there casually, almost like he's ready to be stabbed, in the one by Brunelleschi, he's taken his son by the throat, and you can see that he has placed his hand where the blood is flowing, because he wanted to stun the child, because he didn't want the son to feel the pain, when he stabbed him with the knife.\n\nThis is the creation of an incredible genius. Above all, it defines Brunelleschi as an artist. That is the difference this brought to the art of 1400 in the Renaissance. This is the Renaissance.\n\nNARRATOR: Both panels are masterpieces, but Brunelleschi's vision may have been too far ahead of its time. The commission goes to Lorenzo Ghiberti.\n\nROSS KING: Losing the commission to Lorenzo Ghiberti, I think there's no question, hurt Brunelleschi very badly and, in many ways, shaped his career and the way that he proceeded after that.\n\nTIMOTHY VERDON: Brunelleschi may or may not have understood why he lost, but certainly, from that point, Filippo Brunelleschi must feel that he has to carve out a new niche for himself.\n\nNARRATOR: Following the competition, the disappointed Brunelleschi leaves Florence. Little is known about his life for the next 15 years, but it's clear he spends time in Rome, studying the ancient monuments. Some believe he's already preparing himself for a future challenge: building the dome on the Florence cathedral.\n\nHere, in the nearby park, Massimo Ricci's dome is at a critical point. He and his helpers are preparing for its biggest test yet. With the walls increasing in height, Ricci is concerned about having his students continue the work, so a new team has arrived in town to help push Ricci's experiment forward.\n\nMASSIMO RICCI: Good morning.\n\nNARRATOR: They are all master bricklayers from the United States.\n\nTOM WARD: Nice to meet you, sir.\n\nDAVE WYSOCKI (International Masonry Institute): Dave Wysocki.\n\nDON HUNT (International Masonry Institute): Don Hunt, nice to meet you.\n\nBOB ARNOLD (International Masonry Institute): I think we're starting here.\n\nNARRATOR: They're members of the International Masonry Institute, an organization that trains workers in the craft of bricklaying.\n\nNATS: Quarter inch.\n\nNATS: Half inch.\n\nNATS: However many millimeters that is.\n\nNATS: No inches here.\n\nNATS: Millimeters.\n\nNATS: Yeah, sorry.\n\nNARRATOR: Each one has more than 20 years on the job. Not in Florence for the food or the works of art, they are here to lay some brick.\n\nNATS: There you go, perfect.\n\nNARRATOR: The bricklayers understand the basic structure of Brunelleschi's plan. The eight corners of the dome, where the walls meet, act like the ribs of the dome. Once these corner ribs meet at the top, they form powerful arches. Together with smaller interior arches, this goes a long way toward holding the 40,000-ton mass together.\n\nBOB ARNOLD: Basically, it's a series of four Gothic arches, arches that come up this way. So, if you see that this rib, hereâ¦the opposite one there is going to come up, you know, like that. So, you've got a series of four gothic arches that all should meet in the middle. That's the key.\n\nNARRATOR: Working on the model, the Americans will be confronting the key mystery of the dome: until the curving walls connect at the top, what keeps them from falling to the ground? And what magic did Brunelleschi use to defy gravity?\n\nJONAS ELMORE (International Masonry Institute): You know, I've built a lot of things, from stadiumsâ¦baseball, football, but I've never ever worked on something like this. We use different mechanisms to hold arches in place. Then, once we are done, we take them out. But this is freestanding, whichâ¦I have never ever seen construction like this before.\n\nNARRATOR: Their first task will be to literally \"learn the ropes\" and begin to understand Ricci's theory.\n\nMASSIMO RICCI: They, they are very okay.\n\nNARRATOR: By 1418, more than 100 years after work had begun, the enormous cathedral is almost complete. It's bigger than any other in the world, but without a dome, it is in danger of becoming the world's largest joke.\n\nMASSIMO RICCI (Translated): It's clear the people of the city were worried about this problem. All the Florentines were talking about it. They knew very well that they risked looking bad in front of their rivals.\n\nROSS KING: They realized the building has got to the point where they cannot put off any longer how they're going to build this. And so they put forth a competition saying that whoever has any ideas about how on earth we can do this, we're open. It's sort of, \"answers on a post card, please.\"\n\nMASSIMO RICCI (Translated): They didn't have any idea what they were going to do.\n\nNARRATOR: Proposals for the dome come pouring into the committee, but they all share a fatal flaw: they depend on using a wooden framework to keep the bricks in place during construction.\n\nOnly one candidate promises to build a free-standing, self-sustaining dome: Filippo Brunelleschi. He tells the committee he's figured out a way for the dome to stand on its own, even as it is curving inward.\n\nROCKY RUGGIERO: The financial advantage of that must have been extraordinary, but the skepticism was probably even greater, in the sense that, how could that be possible, what will prevent that structure from simply sliding out and caving in as we're building it?\n\nNARRATOR: But there is a problem. The 41-year-old Brunelleschi has never built anything.\n\nROCKY RUGGIERO: When they get to that final pieceâI mean this is really the climax of the entire two-century construction history of the churchâwho is this man working in jewelry, who now steps forward and says, \"Look, I have the credentials, I have the knowhow, I have the inspiration to actually design this structure? And, I mean, would you have trusted him? I mean, I would not have.\n\nNARRATOR: Perhaps, Brunelleschi's supreme self-confidence impresses the committee, because he clearly does not have all of the problems worked out in advance.\n\nROCKY RUGGIERO: I think that Brunelleschi had a very clear idea of how to build that dome, but realized that there were certain construction details that he could only figure out as the work was in progress.\n\nROSS KING: Filippo, being extremely secretive and not wanting anyone else to know his plan, said, \"I'll show you how to do it when you give me the job. Give me the job and I'll begin doing it and you'll see that it works.\"\n\nTIMOTHY VERDON: Everyone else had shown his plan. Brunelleschi refused. He said, \"I know how to build it. Only I know how to build it. I've studied the ancient Roman structures. I already see it built.\" And so they said, \"Well, you have to tell us something.\"\n\nSo he said, \"Bring me an egg.\" And he said, \"Anyone who can keep this egg standing upright on the marble tabletop will understand how I'm going to build the dome.\"\n\nROSS KING: Imagine all of these eminent master masons from all over Europe trying to get it to stand upright on its own. All of them fail.\n\nTIMOTHY VERDON: And so they give the egg to Brunelleschi and say, \"Show us what you mean. And Vasari, who tells this story in the 16th century, uses a very vulgar term. He says, \"Pipo rupel cule vovo.\" \"Pipo,\" Filippo's nickname, \"broke the egg's ass.\"\n\nSo he breaks the bottom of the egg and they say, \"Well, we could have done that, too.\"\n\nROSS KING: And Brunelleschi says, \"Yes, and you would be able to build the dome if you know what I know.\"\n\nNARRATOR: Seventeen years earlier, his radical vision may have cost him the competition for the Baptistery doors. This time, Brunelleschi keeps his idea secret for as long as possible, asking the committee to trust him.\n\nROSS KING: Had he told the assembled company his secret, it would have been something that they wouldn't have understood: a special brick pattern, a special kind of brickwork that he was going to use in the interior of the dome.\n\nNARRATOR: In April, 1420, the committee comes to a decision. They choose Brunelleschi, along with two others, including his old rival, Ghiberti, to build the dome.\n\nROSS KING: If he ever was going to have a moment of doubt, I think that would have been the one, because he would have seen, up close and personal, the magnitude of the task that literally lay before him at that point, because he would have looked across this chasm, this yawning gap. He must have, at some level, gulped and thought, \"Am I going to be able to do this?\"\n\nNARRATOR: Brunelleschi quickly emerges as the leader and takes on his first challenge: lifting the building materials 170 feet to the work platform above.\n\nROCKY RUGGIERO: Technologically, the means did not exist. Up until Brunelleschi's time, lifting devices were referred to generically as the \"rota magna,\" or as the \"great wheel,\" which was a large wooden wheel that looked very much like a modern gerbil cage, inside of which human beings would walk causing the wheel to turn. And as that wheel turned, it would coil a rope and that coiling would gradually then lift an object based on the lifting power of the people who are actually walking inside.\n\nNARRATOR: Brunelleschi realizes that the old method could not be used in a project this large and a worksite this high. He invents a hoist that uses oxen, rather than people to raise and lower the loads.\n\nROCKY RUGGIERO: This is really Brunelleschi as the engineer, Brunelleschi as the inventor. They're turning a wheel that would turn a vertical shaft, and it, in turn, would have a series of cogged wheels that would then interlock with other cogged wheels, and so, as the oxen are moving in one direction, they could of course lift weight upward, okay?\n\nBut more importantly, Brunelleschi realized, \"We're not going to have to only lift weights up, we're going to have to lower those weights, as well.\" And so, he introduces what is the first ever reverse gear, in history.\n\nNARRATOR: Keeping the oxen moving in the same direction saves valuable time. The hoist raises or lowers material depending on which of two horizontal wheels locks into a vertical wheel on the drum holding the rope. When a load needs lifting, the bottom wheel engages, and the drum gathers rope in. When a load needs lowering, the top wheel is set in place to turn the drum in the opposite direction.\n\nROCKY RUGGIERO: By simply changing which of the wheels interlocked with the larger vertical one, you could then change the direction, technically, of actually lifting or actually lowering of the material down to the ground.\n\nNARRATOR: The oxen could walk all day long in the same direction, keeping materials flowing to and from the workplace above.\n\nROSS KING: In 3,000 years of engineering, no one had ever done that. He pushed beyond a boundary that no one else had crossed. No one else had even got to that boundary; Brunelleschi crossed over it.\n\nNARRATOR: Brunelleschi had solved the problem of lifting nearly 40,000 tons of material up to the worksite. Now, the former goldsmith has an even bigger challenge: connecting eight massive walls together to form the world's largest dome.\n\nFlorence holds its breath as the walls begin to rise. Around 1425, five years into the project, the bricks, by design, start to curve inward. Without a wooden framework to hold the weight, the project is entering dangerous, uncharted territory. The old methods of bricklaying would no longer work.\n\nMost walls are built by simply laying bricks along straight lines, one after another, layer upon layer.\n\nRussell Gentry, a professor of engineering at Georgia Tech, has studied Brunelleschi's methods.\n\nT. RUSSELL GENTRY (Georgia Institute of Technology): So, if Brunelleschi had built the wall in the simple way you see here, you would have layers of brick and layers of mortar. And the layers of brick and layers of mortar are very simply separated by one another, and the layers of mortar represent planes of weakness through the wall.\n\nWhat we see, here, is that the wall is leaning in, gravity is pulling it in towards me. And so a crack could form in one of the layers of mortarâthe mortar is weaker than the brickâand the whole thing could rotate, and all of this brick could fall in.\n\nNARRATOR: The time had come for Brunelleschi to share part of his secret plan with the world.\n\nROSS KING: That's the point in the building where support of some sort was always needed. And Brunelleschi had to begin using this special pattern of laying bricks that he, himself, seems to have invented.\n\nNARRATOR: In Brunelleschi's new design, horizontal bricks are interrupted by others set vertically. Instead of continuing in one straight line, the bricks zig-zag. In the area between the two domes, that pattern is visible today, but only in small patches that remain unplastered.\n\nIn Italian, the design is called spina pesce, \"spine of the fish.\" English speakers call it \"herringbone.\"\n\nBOB ARNOLD: I think we're having some spina pesce for dinner.\n\nNARRATOR: The herringbone design is even easier to spot in Massimo Ricci's dome. The pattern is simple, and it's a method the American bricklayers catch on to rapidly.\n\nDAVIDE: Okay. Perfetto.\n\nNARRATOR: They lay the vertical bricks first. These are the spines. Once the spines are set, the horizontal bricks are then wedged in between the spines, row after row. In all their years of working, the Americans have never seen bricks laid quite this way.\n\nTOM WARD: It's completely different. The techniques are definitely, definitely way different than what we're used to. This system is pretty amazing really.\n\nNARRATOR: The vertical bricks in the spina pesce pattern block the mortar's planes of weakness. This prevents large sections of wall from separatingâor sheeringâand tumbling to the ground.\n\nDON HUNT: If everything was laid horizontally, and you just brought it in slowly, each time, you would always have a sheer point, the sheer plane, where that could slide off; where, here, you don't have any single sheer point anywhere. It's all tied together a million times.\n\nNARRATOR: The herringbone brick pattern is so untested at the time, Brunelleschi has to convince the cathedral board and the workers to allow him to use it. Once again, Brunelleschi is going against convention. He's also asking his workers to trust him with their lives.\n\nROSS KING: They were working around about 220, 230 feet in the air, and they were literally hanging over an empty space, where, if they fell, it was certain death. And, so, Brunelleschi certainly needed to have his men have faith in him. And they, they needed to believe that Brunelleschi knew what he was doing.\n\nNARRATOR: Brunelleschi must have done something to convince the workers to trust this new method. But what?\n\nThe answer may lie in a building that sits just behind the cathedral, in the very shadow of the dome. It was built as a theater in the 1800s. Many years later, it was converted into a parking garage.\n\nWhile renovations were going on to build a new wing of the cathedral museum, archaeologists dug out centuries of landfill, and discovered buried treasure: what now appears to be a hole in the ground would have been a free-standing structure in the 15th century, the remains of a dome, perhaps left there by Brunelleschi himself.\n\nProfessor Francesco Gurrieri of the University of Florence is overseeing the discovery.\n\nFRANCISCO GURRIERI (University of Florence/Translated): Here it is.\n\nROSS KING: It's amazing.\n\nFRANCISCO GURRIERI (Translated): This is the famous little dome. It was discovered in November, 2012, and it surprised the world of architecture.\n\nNARRATOR: The top has been lost to time, but the inward curve of the walls remains. The little dome's base is constructed of sandstone; the brickwork only begins a third of the way up the wall. This proportion mirrors exactly the design of the cathedral dome, and the brickwork is done in a herringbone pattern.\n\nFRANCISCO GURRIERI (Translated): I was immediately excited about it, because, having recognized the presence of the herringbone, I immediately connected it to Brunelleschi's technique.\n\nROSS KING: And do you think Brunelleschi stood here and said, \"This is how I'm going to do it, this is the secret to building the dome?\"\n\nFRANCISCO GURRIERI (Translated): Yes, it's very probable that during the construction, Brunelleschi was here to demonstrate the use of the herringbone method. Yes, I think this is the model.\n\nNARRATOR: But the new discovery features one obvious difference: it's round, while the cathedral dome appears to have eight individual walls. But appearances can be deceiving. Brunelleschi uses the spina pesce pattern to create a dome that looks like an octagon, but is actually one continuous spiral.\n\nRUSSELL GENTRY: So, we're here looking at the corner of Massimo's dome, and what we can see behind the corner is we see the start of the bedding of the masonry, and as we go up, we can see the bricks in the spina pesce pattern. And if you watch carefully, you can see that they start here and they wrap up around, behind the corner, and continue uninterrupted from one face of the dome to the other face of the dome.\n\nNARRATOR: By simply turning some bricks on their sides, Brunelleschi establishes a new patternâand achieves two important goals: preventing cracks from spreading and binding the eight walls into one unified mass.\n\nThe spiral form resists the forces of gravity more effectively than an eight-sided dome. For many, spina pesce is the secret of the dome, but the construction of the dome involved many secrets, something the American bricklayers have come to understand from their time with Massimo Ricci.\n\nNATS: Look at that! That's one piece.\n\nNARRATOR: After two weeks on the job, they're ready to compare their work to the real thing.\n\nThe interior dome is completely covered by a religious mural.\n\nNATS: Wow!\n\nNARRATOR: The area between the shells offers only glimpses of key elements.\n\nNATS: This is a corner rib. See that?\n\nNATS: Yes.\n\nNATS: This would be, and that would be an interior rib.\n\nNARRATOR: And plaster conceals all but a few patches of brickwork.\n\nNATS: You can still see, here, here's a good illustration of spine pesce.\n\nNATS: Oh, man. This is unbelievable.\n\nNATS: This is scary looking, isn't it?\n\nNATS: It really is.\n\nNATS: We can't be complaining about anything over our little one-fifth scale about 10 feet off the ground anymore.\n\nNATS: No.\n\nNARRATOR: On the way down, the workers notice something that escapes all but the most experienced eye.\n\nNATS: You see this, guys? See how this is coming up to the center, just like on the model? See that? Both of these? That's the horizontal arch right there.\n\nNARRATOR: The bricks are sloping down from the corner ribs toward the centers of the walls. The massive scale of the dome makes it difficult to see, but the Americans recognize its significance from Massimo Ricci's model.\n\nThe important feature, barely visible in Brunelleschi's dome, becomes clear in Ricci's model. The tops of the walls don't follow a straight line as they go up; they dip from corner to corner. Within each wall, this creates an inverted arch, one of the most stable forms in architecture. These arches, combined with the spina pesce pattern, keep the bricks firmly in place, directing the weight of the masonry downward through the walls, preventing them from collapsing inward.\n\nIt's an ingenious design, and Ricci struggled for years to figure out how Brunelleschi made it work and how he insured that the walls all met perfectly at the top, nearly 300 feet above the ground.\n\nRicci was sure the answer lay in one of the primary building technologies of the time, rope lines, which Renaissance builders used to guide their work. If Ricci could figure out how Brunelleschi set up his ropes, he could unveil one of the dome's most overlooked secrets.\n\nHe knew the guide ropes must have been attached to a large platform built into the base of the dome, but in what pattern?\n\nMASSIMO RICCI (Translated): I had to figure it out myself, because Brunelleschi didn't write anything down and he didn't leave anything behind.\n\nNARRATOR: Ricci sketched out hundreds of possible designs, trying to unlock Brunelleschi's secret. Then he heard about a 600-year-old document stored in the Florentine State Archives.\n\nIt's a drawing done on parchment, about five years after work on the dome began. It's the only surviving eye-witness sketch of the dome's construction, and it's a scathing criticism of Brunelleschi's methods. The critic, named Giovanni di Prato, detailed what he considered to be Brunelleschi's mistakes. The dome, he warned, was doomed to collapse.\n\nMASSIMO RICCI (Translated): He's really tearing him apart. He's trying to tear apart Brunelleschi, but, in effect, Giovanni di Prato wasn't able to understand much of what Brunelleschi was doing.\n\nNARRATOR: Di Prato may not have understood Brunelleschi's system, but he was thorough in his observations. He carefully sketched the rope lines Brunelleschi was using to guide the construction. More importantly for Ricci, di Prato also drew the work platform to which the ropes were attached. Here, Ricci noticed something unusual: a thin line curving around the platform. To Ricci, it looked like a flower. And he immediately saw it as the key to Brunelleschi's system.\n\nMASSIMO RICCI (Translated): When I saw the platform with the flower drawn on it, I said, \"Well, I'm at the right place!\"\n\nNARRATOR: Ricci incorporated the flower into the work platform of his model, using it to guide each wall's construction. Rope lines are important building tools even today, and the Americans catch on quickly to Ricci's system.\n\nOne worker, stationed on the platform, hooks a line to the flower. Another, on the top of the wall, handles the other end of the rope. The rope controls the angle and the height of the bricks.\n\nTOM WARD: Can you see now?\n\nHey, can you hold that there for a second? Concentrate on this one, right here, that's moving, the one that Bob has a hold of. It sets the line up for that spina pesce, so it's, essentially, their guide.\n\nNARRATOR: And that's why the shape of the flower is so important. As the platform worker moves the line along the flower, the rope transfers the curve of the flower to wall. This creates the inverted arch.\n\nThe walls may be strong, but for the dome to work, they must meet together at the top. One small miscalculation, repeated hundreds of thousands of times, would lead to disaster.\n\nBOB ARNOLD: Here's the angle. And as you go up, it should follow that all the way up.\n\nSay, if this one's not correct, as you get that dome closing up to the top, it's not going to want to hit in the middle. So you might, you know, the dome might be this way or it might be this way.\n\nNARRATOR: How could Brunelleschi know his dome was on the right track? The answer is in the lines. Criss-crossing from wall to wall, they establish the center point. And before any rope line guides a brick into place, it must pass through that center.\n\nBrick by brick, the walls of Brunelleschi's dome rise until they meet at the top. Nearly 300 feet in the sky, and the dome is complete.\n\nFor Ricci, the ropes guiding the bricks provide the real key to the mystery of the dome.\n\nMASSIMO RICCI (Translated): I can say with utmost certainty this is the true secret of Santa Maria del Fiore.\n\nNARRATOR: After two weeks of working on Ricci's dome, the Americans seem convinced by his experiment.\n\nDAVE WYSOCKI: This must be the way they have done it. Without putting a support underneath there, this would be the only way that it makes sense.\n\nDON HUNT: It's the flower and it's the herringbone pattern; those are the two things that solve the puzzle. You wouldn't be able to build a dome like that without those control measures.\n\nNARRATOR: Massimo Ricci has now been working on his dome longer than it took Brunelleschi to build the original. His model will remain an open laboratory for those studying Brunelleschi's methodsâand as an argument for the importance of the flower.\n\nIt's possible that Ricci, unlike his hero, will never see his work finished.\n\nROSS KING: If you look at the dates of the building, 1420 to 1436, 16 years. That's the blink of an eye. That's very, very quick. And it's wonderful to think that he saw it completed. He was able to look at it. He was able to walk past the building and think to himself, \"I built that. I did that.\"\n\nTIMOTHY VERDON: With the dome, Florence moves into an entirely different dimension. The dome becomes the hub of a new city, of a new world. It is the expression of a self-confidence that it no longer knows limits.\n\nPeople need works that can speak to them of their own capacity to dream. Brunelleschi's dome is perhaps the biggest of those works in the history of world art.",
  "latent_18210": "In most if not all contexts, I don't really think wearing makeup is a \"choice.\" At least, it's not a choice in the sense of a decision where the branching options are neutral and equally weighted and carry few, if any, negative social consequences, the way making a ham sandwich or a veggie wrap for lunch is a choice. Culturally speaking, the playing field is tilted pretty heavily in makeup's favor.\n\nThe New York Times is hosting an online roundtable discussion of the question of makeup and women's self-esteem today. Makeup is a consumer product, but rather than thinking about who profits from it and how it is sold to us, let's think about how it makes us feel. Okay. Inevitably, one talking head writes:\n\n\"The point is that a harmless touch of makeup makes me feel better. I wear it for myself, not for anybody else.\"\n\nI find this way of thinking about makeup so exotic that I almost â almost â cannot conceive of it. As a kind of thought experiment, sure, I can imagine there are women who wear makeup truly and only \"for themselves,\" who would continue to do so even absent any the miasma of social programming and cultural pressure to wear makeup, subtle and not-so-subtle, that women face in mainstream contemporary western culture. Maybe there are women who truly indeed wear makeup \"for themselves,\" such that if our culture happened to transform overnight into one where the wearing of makeup by women was stigmatized, they'd continue to do it. Because it's their choice! It's just that I don't think I've ever met any of these women.\n\nAnd I'm certainly not one myself. I don't wear a lot of makeup â I favor the \"natural\" look â and I don't always wear makeup, but I'm honest enough to tell you that when I do wear it, it is not my \"choice.\" I wear it because a lifetime of being a woman and of bearing the fusillade of advertising and Hollywood and fashion imagery â when was the last time you saw a woman not wearing makeup on a billboard or on T.V.? â has left me with no illusions about the fact that makeup is, for women, considered standard in 21st Century America. A certain amount of makeup is \"good grooming.\" It's the default. As women, we don't have the choice to engage with the beauty industrial complex: it's so ever-present in our lives that women who don't wear makeup are commonly taken as defining themselves against it. To not wear makeup, for many women, is to invite misunderstanding or, worse, judgment.\n\nI wear makeup because I recognize that I live in a culture where makeup is normalized for people of my sex, age, and profession. And that's pretty much the only reason. When I don't need to live up to that cultural standard â when I'm camping, say, or at the beach, or going to the laundromat on a Tuesday afternoon â I don't wear makeup. I don't wear makeup \"for myself.\" I wear it because of who I am and where I live and what my job is. The end. And if you don't believe me that wearing makeup is considered standard here in the West, I would direct you to any of the myriad recent studies demonstrating that people associate women who wear makeup â especially, the \"natural\" makeup with which we are all familiar â with greater competency in the workplace, greater attractiveness, greater trustworthiness, and greater likability than women who are without.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don't think that acknowledging the overwhelming contemporary social bias in favor of women wearing makeup as a factor in the motivation to wear makeup is problematic. An act doesn't have to fit into the paradigm of personal \"choice\" in order to have value, or in order to be worthwhile, or even in order for it to be personally enjoyable. (I don't hate wearing makeup. Far from it, in fact. It's a skill I can even take a certain pleasure in exercising.) But I do think it's telling that society encourages women to frame wearing makeup only as a matter of simple personal choice â and as something that indicates self-love (\"Because You're Worth It\"). (The pressure to frame the use of cosmetics within the discourse of individual choice reminds me, a little, of the pressure on women to never admit the lengths to which they may go to embody our culture's equally stringent and fraught physical ideals: every skinny actress is always supposed to tell her interviewers that she eats burgers and milkshakes and never really works out. The ideal is always supposed to be \"natural,\" a matter of sheer, unperspiring excellence.) We're only supposed to appreciate or be interested in makeup as a form of play and personal expression; we're supposed to ignore the social and political contexts of makeup. I'm not interested in that narrative. I think it's overly simple, and it does a disservice to the varieties of women's lived experience in the complicated and politically inflected arena of what the women's magazines refer to, grandly, as \"beauty.\"\n\nI have a meeting with an editor this afternoon. I have to go put on some concealer and mascara.\n\nDoes Makeup Hurt Self Esteem? [NYTimes]\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock/Seprimor",
  "latent_18217": "\"Wearable\" is a stupid term, when you think about it. If we're saying Google Glass, the Apple Watch, and a pair of workout-tracking socks are wearables, then wouldn't the Tesla Model S, the iPhone, and the Microsoft Surface Hub all count as PCs because they have screens and browsers? If wearables are things you can wear, are VR headsets wearables? If you put your phone in a holster on your belt, is it a wearable? For years, we didn't have a term for the coming world in which everything we wear, own, and touch will be connected in some way. Now we don't need one.\n\nThis past year, companies from nearly every industry proved \"wearables\" isn't a category. It's everything. Whether it was Ralph Lauren launching the PoloTech shirt ahead of the US Open, diamond giant Swarovski turning the techie Misfit Shine into a fashion week-ready accessory, or Karl Lagerfeld 3-D printing a line of Chanel clothes, fashion and tech spent 2015 checking each other out. You can buy the Apple Watch in elite fashion stores; Tag Heuer brought Android Wear to classy businessmen everywhere. These things aren't invented from nothingâthey're a step in an evolution, part of the technologization of everything. Wearables achieved a level of cool in 2015 unlike anything they've ever had beforeâwe've come a long way since Robert Scoble killed Google Glass with one slightly NSFW shower pic.\n\nWearables are disappearing even as they're conquering the Earth. Analysis firm IDC found that nearly three times as many wearables shipped in the third quarter of 2015 than in the same period of 2014, and because fitness trackers and smartwatches tend to be hugely popular gifts, that number should grow in the next quarter. Then it's going to more than triple in the next few years.\n\nFor now, sales are dominated by tech companies: Fitbit, Apple, Motorola, Xiaomi, Samsung, and the like. That segment of the market is going to continue to grow, too: As insurance companies get on board and even begin to incentivize people to use fitness trackers, and as the trackers get better and tracking data and offering personalized recommendations, we'll get more value out of these devices.\n\nThe Swarovski Shine is a little tech and a lot jewelry. Alex Washburn/WIRED\n\nAll these tech companies spent the last handful of years creating ever-nicer versions of their wrist gadgets. You can probably recognize a Fitbit from across the room, and you certainly notice the blank square of an Apple Watch the moment it peeks out of a shirt sleeve. They're getting nicer, but still scream \"technology!\"\n\nIf you were at Fashion Week, though, you saw what's next. You saw technology vanish inside the seams of clothing that looks like clothing. You saw wearablesâwell, no you didn't. You saw high-tech jewelry. You saw companies like Ringly and Misfit start experimenting with how to make devices work when they no longer have screens, when all the Technology! is reduced to a single blinking LED. This is all due in large part to Intel and its tiny Curie module that designers can embed almost invisibly in a vast range of devices. It's easy, now, to put fitness tracking and Bluetooth into just about anything.\n\nRick Yang, a partner at New Enterprise Associates, told CNBC that 2016 will be the year of \"the disappearing wearable.\" Look for fitness and fashion companies to integrate sensors and trackers in a way most people never notice. From the Withings Activite to the Fossil Q line, designers are integrating cool features and functionality into things you'd want to wear even if it couldn't tell you whether you slept well last night.\n\nThe wearables we've seen so far are the first of three steps. First, they look like technologyâGoogle Glass, the Apple Watch, and Fitbit are getting better-looking all the time, but they all still look like gadgets. Next, they look betterâthe wearable companies that matter most are the ones who already make things you wear, like Fossil and Swarovski. 2015 was the beginning of that transition from fashionable technology to technological fashion.\n\nAriel Zambelich/WIRED\n\nThe third step is when the technology simply becomes part of everything. Google's Project Jacquard is an example. When designers weave a touch sensor into yarn, is that even technology anymore? Maybe it's the evolution of yarnâYarn 2.0. You'll have sensors in your shoes, your shirt will track your heart rate, and your socks will know they need to be washed, you filthy animal.\n\nNot long after that, maybe you'll have a tattoo or RFID chip embedded in your arm that can do all that and more. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Right here, right now, here's what we learned in 2015: The most exciting wearables won't look like computers. They won't look like anything. Look down at whatever you're wearing now. That's the future of wearables.",

Multinational brands and technocrats are concocting supranational policies to hold poor patients hostage to pharmaceutical markets across the Global South through elaborate intellectual property schemes in international trade. Protest against the unaffordability of Novartis drugs (Carlos Capote, 2007, Flick creative commons)\n\nAs our television screens toggle between pundits squabbling over Obamacareâs insurance rules and ads for erectile dysfunction remedies, another health care battle rages in village clinics and corporate boardrooms. Behind the seductive commercials for breakthrough treatments, multinational brands and technocrats are concocting supranational policies to hold poor patients hostage to pharmaceutical markets across the Global South through elaborate intellectual property schemes in international trade. And while the industry sutures the future of medicine to the business of exploiting disease, poor countries serve as an incubator for neoliberal policies that boost the industryâs power in Washington, capitalizing on regional inequality to degrade public health on a global scale.\n\nThe struggle for access to medicine presents a legal and ethical minefield for rich and poor countries alikeâone that is being fought out as humanitarians challenge corporations over intellectual property rights. A recent landmark decision by the Indian Supreme Court thrust that conflict into popular awareness. The ruling blocked a request by the global pharmaceutical giant Novartis for a patent on a Leukemia drug, Gleevec. The company claimed to be introducing a new formulation of the drug that warranted a fresh patent. But the court determined that the new Gleevec was virtually identical to the old one. This cleared the way for mass production of a much cheaper generic version. While a cancer patient in the United States might spend around $70,000 for Gleevec, Indiaâs version could cost as little as $2,500.\n\nThe defeat of Novartis sent shockwaves across the drug industry. Companies have long structured their profit systems around an obscure set of intellectual property controls, and the ruling represented a growing global pushback against their political and commercial hegemony. The case raised a preeminent question in the struggle for global health equity: when the laws of commerce override the human right to medicine, can society protect public health from unbridled private markets?\n\nThough the Novartis case jarred drug makers, their lobbyists have been working for years to secure their global market share with regional and bilateral âfree tradeâ agreements aimed at erecting draconian transnational intellectual property regimes. Just as the ink was drying on the Novartis decision, the European Union was hammering out a pending free trade deal with India that would harden intellectual property protections. Commercial rules etched into the deal would encourage the âevergreeningâ of medicine patents, where companies can repeatedly extend patents (often by inserting, for instance, a new inert ingredient) and thereby undermine efforts to sell the same drugs at cheaper pricesâprecisely the kind of corporate practice that the Indian court rebuffed.\n\nIndiaâs patent landscape is pivotal because it is one of the worldâs largest generic drug producers, supplying much of the Global Southâs medicine markets with cheaper analogs of their exorbitantly priced Western counterparts. The Indian generics industry is on track to grow from about $11 to $74 billion by 2020, according to industry financial estimates, making up for low prices with sheer volume. And since Indiaâs patent law structure is still developing, many Western brand-name drugs like Gleevec were first marketed there without a patent and are finding local health authorities resistant to those drugsâ conversion into pricey, brand-name equivalents.\n\nThe struggle for access to medicine presents a legal and ethical minefield for rich and poor countries alikeâone that is being fought out as humanitarians challenge corporations over intellectual property rights.\n\nIn April Cambodian activists issued a statement in opposition to the EU trade deal with India, warning that the price of medicine would skyrocket and cost lives. The coalition of self-described representatives of âgarment workers, sex workers, entertainment workers, people living with HIV, LGBTs, university students, feminists and human rights activists from different networks and organisationsâ told the European negotiators of the importance of made-in-India drugs for millions of people. The trade deal, they argued, âmust stop right now. It is a true example of putting profits before peopleâs lives and [taking] advantage of peopleâs illness for corporate profits. Our lives should not be regarded as a business opportunity.â\n\nTheir protest comes in the face of an even larger pending agreement: the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TTP), a free trade scheme central to the Obama administrationâs âpivot to Asia.â Intellectual property provisions in the leaked draft of the agreement seem designed precisely to preempt âtrade barriersâ that protect access to medicines. Covering twelve countries in the Pacific Rim (Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States), the TPP has triggered worldwide opposition, with many anti-globalization groups warning that it would entail an array of neoliberal policies aimed at undermining the autonomy of national governments, eviscerating protections for local industries, and attacking health and environmental regulations.\n\nNegotiators are now weighing numerous provisions that could dramatically impact future access to affordable drugs. According to an analysis by public health advocates with MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res, the proposed policies âwould make it extremely difficult for generic competitors to enter the market, keeping prices unaffordably high, with devastating public health consequences.â\n\nThe pharmaceutical industryâs chief aim, activists fear, is to establish a new global standard for governing the control of patents, empowering companies to control medicine markets more expansively and for longer periods of time.\n\nThe TPP would set a broad standard patent term of twenty years, with opportunities for extensions. Moreover, at the behest of U.S. negotiators, it could tighten the exemptions allowed under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, a set of rules governing patents, intellectual property, and copyright set by the World Trade Organization (WTO). Expanding TRIPS is a key plank in Washingtonâs market-liberalization agenda to dismantle trade barriers and encourage corporate consolidation in emerging markets in technology and medicineâironically, under the banner of making trade more âfree.â\n\nThe âU.S. proposal for the TPP would make it more difficult to rejectâ evergreening patents such as the one involved in the Novartis case, says Krista Cox, a staff attorney with the intellectual property policy think tank Knowledge Ecology International. That would pave the way for drug industry giants to avoid the kind of public interest challenges at issue in the Indian court, thus easing market expansion throughout the Pacific Rim.\n\nOne especially harsh proposal raised in the ongoing trade talks would bar a legal mechanism known as âpre-grant opposition,â which currently enables civil society groups to oppose pending patent applications by challenging the validity of the proposal. Without pre-grant opposition, a patent would typically have to be challenged via the courts, which could stymie generic competition for years as the litigation is pending, even if the patent is ultimately found to be invalid.\n\nThough the TPP has not been finalized, U.S. and EU negotiators are working to shape a framework that would affix in international law the structural asymmetries in health care access between rich and poor nations. Activists say these deals aim not only to penetrate âemergingâ pharmaceuticals markets in participating countries, but to spread neoliberal policies around the world that would bolster corporate power.\n\nâWeâre concerned that the TPP is, in part, a closed-door hemispheric rule-making against public health,â says Peter Maybarduk, director of Public Citizenâs Global Access to Medicine program. The Obama administrationâs free trade agenda, he adds, actually threatens to unravel some of the hard-fought gains in access to medical treatment that were initiated under the Bush administrationâs international HIV/AIDS initiatives.\n\nFrom an economic development perspective, âmiddle-incomeâ countries that produce generics, like India, could face a double blow: patients would be hit with overpriced brand-name drugs in domestic markets, and their generic medicine industries would face an assault from multinationals.\n\nBut the politics of free trade in drug markets have a way of creeping northward from the Global South as well. Health advocates say free trade deals enable rich states to implement pro-corporate policy frameworks abroad and then import them back home under the guise of neoliberal âreform.â\n\nWhen it comes to the trade in medicine, the Global Southâwith an anemic regulatory infrastructure and legions of desperately poor patientsâmakes a perfect petri dish for such âpolicy laundering.â Intellectual property rules that expand the already enormous U.S. and European drug industry might provoke opposition if aired on the floor of the U.S. Congress, but might be eased through in a closed-door session among non-elected international trade representatives. This kind of shadow politics is illustrated in Washingtonâs promotion of âanti-counterfeitingâ protections in trade deals, which parallel similar digital piracy policies that lawmakers unsuccessfully tried to push in Congress amid fierce public outcry. Even though digital-rights activists prevailed against the Stop Online Piracy Act on Capitol Hill, the same kinds of structures are at play internationally in more shadowy political arenas: insider negotiations over intellectual property rules in pending U.S.-backed trade accords, including the TPP, have threatened to bolster transnational monopolies in software and other products.\n\nâThatâs one of the things that sometimes people in the U.S. donât realize,â says Brook Baker, a senior policy adviser at the Health Global Access Project, an HIV/AIDS-focused advocacy group. âThese trade agreements not only tie our trade partnersâ hands, they tie our hands, too, in terms of policy. Itâs really a back door effort by big pharma and other IP [intellectual property] industriesâ¦[T]hey seek all these heightened IP protections in trade agreements, and then they come back and bite us.â\n\nFree Trade Rules\n\nThe purported idea behind intellectual property protections is to create market incentives for innovationâin the case of the pharmaceuticals industry, guaranteeing a return on sales for drugs. The value proposition gets muddy when humanitarian needs and market dynamics divergeâwhen malaria treatments for a rural village, for example, turn vastly less profit than the hot new anti-depressant. Or when a drugâs price is derived almost entirely from the label on the box.\n\nThe generic drug sector operates on a different tier of the market. With production driven in large part by India-based firms, it still operates within a market-based system, but generics are exponentially more affordable for poor communities compared to the prices charged by dominant pharmaceutical brands. Cheap generics are the crux of global campaigns to expand HIV/AIDS treatment and other medical solutions for patients in poor countries, supplying UNICEF and the U.S.-sponsored PEPFAR program.\n\nThe medicine-related provisions of TRIPS, crystallized in the 2001 Doha Round of WTO talks, ensure some political flexibility for governments to circumvent patent protections on public health grounds. The agreement exempts poorer countries from regular patent enforcement rules so that governments can expand access to affordable medicines by granting compulsory licenses to produce generics, which override foreign companiesâ patents. For now, the poorest countries are generally exempted from the WTOâs major patent enforcement policies, thanks to an interim grace period that allows governments to adjust their regulatory systems.\n\nNonetheless, TRIPS sets the framework for future drug marketing and manufacturing in poor countries. Public health advocates, including World Health Organization (WHO) officials, contend that TRIPS and related free trade agreements containing various âTRIPS-plusâ provisions are designed to expand monopoly power and maximize profits, deepening the health gap between nations where new treatments are developed and poor regions where preventable scourges still flourish.\n\nThe HIV/AIDS epidemic is one such âmarketplaceâ for drugs. While movements have grown to expand treatment access, corporations have bulked up artificial barriers through intellectual property laws. Today, 26 million people worldwide are still not getting proper treatment, and the WHO has recently pressed wealthy donor states for a major infusion of aid for treatment programs. Yet those same programs are sliding on a collision course with powerful pharmaceutical monopolies. Activists warn that existing TRIPS protections for access to basic anti-retrovirals will not cover newer, more advanced therapies, including âsecond-lineâ anti-retrovirals, which are deployed when patients develop drug resistance.\n\nOther emerging disease threats may similarly intensify under the industryâs commercial barriers. Health experts warn that obstacles to treatment access for non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and cancer (which are spreading rapidly in the Global South but tend to attract less political attention than do infectious epidemics), will engender the next crises in global medicine in poor countries.\n\nPerhaps most insidiously, new cutting-edge medical technologies, like genetic material, have already become new prospects for enrichment for multinationals. Legal scholars have warned that the systemâs public interest protections do not adequately protect against abuse of gene patents. A recent U.S. Supreme Court decision restricts but does not ban the commercial patenting of genetic material, which may complicate the regulatory scope of TRIPS.\n\nAccording to Knowledge Ecology Internationalâs analysis of the draft TPP proposals, though the agreement has not explicitly tackled gene patent issues, âthe U.S. has proposed very low patentability standards and also would require patents for diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods,â which might affect policies on using genetic information in diagnostic testing.\n\nSo who will police these new medical frontiers? In the TPP negotiations occurring as of this writing, business representatives are granted special access to negotiators. Cox explains that designated âadvisersâ from the drug industry are able to âsee the text, make proposals, and comment on proposals.â Yet on the advisory committee for intellectual property issues, âNot a single academic or civil society group is representedâ¦.As a result, the secretive trade negotiations make it easier for pharmaceutical companies to get the provisions they are lobbying for.â\n\nCourtroom Battlegrounds\n\nInternational trade deals have set up powerful legal structures to seal corporate power into the enforcement of trade rules.\n\nTo ensure âfreeâ access to domestic markets, corporations can litigate patent claims through opaque supranational investor-state tribunals. Since patent protections are designed to protect drug monopolies, public health advocates say the legal arenas that review patent disputes are inevitably rigged to serve industry at civil societyâs expense.\n\nFree trade deals enable rich states to implement pro-corporate policy frameworks abroad and then import them back home under the guise of neoliberal âreform.â\n\nWhile these quasi-courts have often operated outside of public purviewâeven when their arbitrations relate to public welfare issues like environmental protectionâthey can change public policy through legal settlements that interfere with domestic court rulings or regulations. Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, for example, recently announced plans to use NAFTAâs extra-judicial dispute-settlement system against the Canadian government, in order to seek taxpayer compensation following the governmentâs invalidation of patents on the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medication Strattera, along with another lost patent for the schizophrenia drug Zyprexa. For those two patent cases, the company now seeks a total of $500 million in payback, claiming that Canadaâs legal basis for reviewing patents violated NAFTA treaty obligations by using overly stringent requirements for proof of the medicineâs efficacy. In other words, the company is wielding trade rules to punish a government for regulating its drug sector too tightly.\n\nSome trade agreements have also established special âdata exclusivityâ legal restrictions that preempt generic competition. As a report from Public Citizen explains, this mechanism enables incumbent drug makers to bar other producersâ access to crucial research data needed to obtain authorization to market a medicine. Without that regulatory data, a big-name manufacturer can simply stonewall or delay the entry of a generic competitor.\n\nAccording to a recent study on Colombiaâs generics market, data exclusivity has allowed drug companies to siphon an extra $412 million from consumers compared to what they would have paid in a drug market with more price competition.\n\nSince TRIPS was enacted, bilateral trade deals between the United States and Chile, El Salvador, and various other Global South countriesâwhich build on the WTOâs baseline trade rulesâhave led to agreements to adopt data exclusivity policies that could preempt or delay generic entry into the market for years.\n\nAs an alternative to compulsory licensing, some companies have tried to establish so-called voluntary licensing agreements, which enable generics to be sold in designated countries in exchange for royalty payments to the company. Still, such arrangements, which might impose tight coverage restrictions, have sometimes been criticized as a tool for corporations to retain influence over domestic markets that are opening to generic competition.\n\nTo the humanitarian organizations doing frontline medical work in poor regions, all these efforts to limit the availability of generic medicine are effectively pricing patients out of survival. âGeneric competition has proven to be the best way to reduce prices and improve access,â says Rohit Malpani, Director of Policy and Analysis with MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨resâ Access Campaign. âWith restrictions to generic competition, as potentially imposed by the TPP, costs for treatments may go up and fewer people will have access to treatment.â\n\nStephanie Burgos, a policy adviser with Oxfam America, said that when trade agreements are allowed to dominate domestic intellectual property policy, âmonopoly protections for corporations are codified in a countryâs legislation.â She added that in some cases, âDepending on the specific provisions in the trade deal, it may be technically possible for a government to invoke a public health safeguard, such as a compulsory licenseâ¦.However, most governments are intimidated by pharmaceutical companies into refraining from even considering such action.â\n\nReclaiming Medicine\n\nWhile the WTO has long militated against the sovereignty of vulnerable countriesâ health systems, some governments in the Global South are learning to resist monopolies while working within the market to keep medicines affordable.\n\nIn recent years, public health groups in Asia, Latin America, and the United States have launched campaigns to break the monopoly of Abbott Laboratories, a major manufacturer of anti-retrovirals Kaletra and Aluvia, and to promote access to generic versions of these critical medicines. Some advocates have filed formal requests for generic licensing; in Brazil and India, health organizations have waged legal challenges to the companyâs patent claims in order to break its monopoly. Treatment providers and health groups in China, Malaysia, and Vietnam have also formally requested permission for generic manufacturing. Public Citizen notes that Ritonavir, one of Abbottâs lucrative AIDS drugs, is in fact a product of U.S. governmentâsupported research, underscoring the fact that many of the innovations that have been monopolized by pharmaceutical brands were cultivated in publicly financed laboratories.\n\nIndonesia, home to some 380,000 HIV/AIDS patients, enacted a presidential decree in March authorizing compulsory licenses for medications not only for HIV but also Hepatitis B. Predictably, the Switzerland-based International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations criticized the move as an abuse of compulsory licensing rules that could âreduce the incentive to investâ in future research and development. Activists have nonetheless continued to campaign for Indonesiaâs prerogative to determine how medicines are priced in accordance with its public health priorities.\n\nAnd in South Africa, officials are considering an overhaul of domestic intellectual property regulations to stop patent evergreening, with the aim of preventing the kind of IP trickery that the Indian courts struck down in the Novartis case.\n\nThe pushback against corporate patent regimes is just one facet of an emerging public debate about global health justice. Seeking more radical solutions to corporate drug hegemonies, some advocates envision alternative systems for developing medicines to serve the highest-need communitiesâfocusing on, say, children with untreated HIV instead of middle-aged consumers of brand-name sleep aids.\n\nSome health activists are envisioning democratized pharmaceutical production systems. A global âpatent pool,â for example, would safeguard public access to scientific discoveries and technologies that could be used for developing treatments. The system would be based on open-access medical publishing and free exchange of research, without the traditional proprietary restrictions. One alternative research model, proposed to the WHO by Bangladesh, Barbados, Bolivia, and Suriname in 2009, is a centralized innovation fund, which would pool research and develop treatments like antibiotics and vaccines aimed at serving vulnerable communities. For HIV/AIDS drug development, the Medicines Patent Pool, based in Switzerland and funded by the United Nations, has already established a global knowledge-sharing platform to expand production of low-cost medicines.\n\nSince so many treatments are generated through publicly funded research, some say the corporations that eventually commercialize those innovations should be forced to reinvest in public, open scientific research, thus returning some of their profits to the public institutions.\n\nâCan we do better than the existing system,â asks Public Citizenâs Maybarduk, âwhere we treat pharmaceutical company interests as proxies for the public interest, and allow those companies to design the rules that they find most appropriate and charge the prices that they find necessary, and [to] set that out as the deal?â\n\nA truly global health system would invert that profit structure and move medicine back into the control of the public trust.\n\nBut today, the idea of medicine as a social good is overshadowed by the commodification of health itself. Under the global intellectual property regime, the worldâs poorest patientsâthose who pay their life savings for a life-saving cancer treatment, or line up to vaccinate their children from diseases that more fortunate nations eradicated generations agoâare priced out of a medical market that thrives on the pathology of capital.",

  "latent_18694": "August 15, 2017 by Anand Gaurav\n\nWe are happy to announce an update to the NuGet client that comes bundled with Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 RTW and .NET Core 2.0 SDK. This release introduces support for new scenarios such as .NET Core 2.0/.NET Standard 2.0, some new features, a series of bug fixes and performance improvements. You can see more details, known issues and workarounds associated with this release in our release notes.\n\nHere are some links to get started with using the latest NuGet functionality:\n\nTL;DR\n\nOur major focus for this release was adding support for .NET Core 2.0. In addition, we made some other improvements:\n\nFor Visual Studio 2015, you can now start using .NET Standard 2.0 packages by installing the latest NuGet client (v3.6.0) for Visual Studio 2015.\n\nWe are also happy to announce that we have integrated the NuGet.org facelift we had previously previewed back into the NuGet.org site, and results in the following improvements available to all NuGet.org users:\n\nSupport for new TFMs\n\nWe have added support for the following TFMs - netcoreapp2.0 and netstandard2.0 . We also enabled Tizen as a supported TFM that helps integration of Tizen .NET libraries with Xamarin Forms. The complete list of supported TFMs is reflected in this documentation.\n\nMSBuild integration of NuGet warnings and errors\n\nWe have integrated NuGet warnings and errors with MSBuild so you can use existing MSBuild properties to suppress certain warnings or elevate them to errors. In addition, we have also improved warnings and errors to output relevant information and thereby making them more actionable. All NuGet warnings/errors now have a unique number associated with them as documented here.\n\nNote: These improvements are only available to project systems that support expressing NuGet dependencies using PackageReference.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nAs an example, when you install a .NET Framework package (say RestSharp) into a .NET Core 2.0 project, you will see the following NU1701 warning:\n\nWarning NU1701 Package 'RestSharp 105.2.3' was restored using '.NETFramework,Version=v4.6.1' instead of the project target framework '.NETCoreApp,Version=v2.0'. This package may not be fully compatible with your project.\n\nIf you are okay with the risk as stated by the warning and do not want to see it in future restores/builds, you can do one of the following:\n\nSuppress the warning in the project on a PackageReference basis\n\nTo suppress the warning, you can go to the package properties window and add NU1701 to the NoWarn property: This results in the following entry being created in the project file:\n\n<PackageReference Include=\"RestSharp\" Version=\"105.2.3\"> <NoWarn>NU1701</NoWarn> </PackageReference>\n\nSuppress the warning at a project level\n\nIf you do not want to see the warning at all in the project irrespective of the package reference that introduces it, you can suppress it in the projectâs build properties: This results in the following entry being created in the project file:\n\n<PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|AnyCPU'\"> <NoWarn>NU1701</NoWarn> </PropertyGroup>\n\nElevate a warning to an error\n\nIn case you want to elevate a specific warning to an error, you can do so by specifying the same in the Build properties: This results in the following entry being created in the project file:\n\n<PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|AnyCPU'\"> <WarningsAsErrors>NU1605</WarningsAsErrors> </PropertyGroup>\n\nA word of caution!\n\nIf you have set your projectâs build property to treat all warnings as errors, you may start to see your builds fail because of the NuGet warnings now being flagged as errors. You can choose to either fix these warnings and/or suppress them using one of the mechanisms specified above.\n\nSupport for Semantic Versioning 2.0.0\n\nSemantic Versioning 2.0.0 specification has been out for a long time and we have gotten multiple requests to support it. We have been listening to your requests and feedback and are happy to announce SemVer 2.0.0 support for NuGet starting with our latest client releases including NuGet 4.3.0, Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 and dotnet.exe 2.0.0. We are also making this support available for Visual Studio 2015 as a separate download.\n\nA word of caution!\n\nIf your package version contains one of the following, they will not be visible from the older clients (NuGet clients before 4.3.0 or Visual Studio before 2017 version 15.3):\n\nThe pre-release label is dot-separated, e.g. 1.0.0-alpha.1 The version has build-metadata, e.g. 1.0.0+githash\n\nWe recommend you consider this to be a beta-feature until a significant majority of our users are on these latest clients that understand Semantic Versioning 2.0.0. Read more on Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 NuGet support, here.\n\nWe wanted to ensure that developers using Visual Studio 2015 can use packages targeting .NET Standard 2.0, and have created an update to the NuGet client in Visual Studio 2015 that adds the following improvements:\n\nSupport for consuming .NET Standard 2.0 packages into the compatible projects\n\nSupport for Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 packages\n\nFix for UI hang bug as described in NuGet #4976\n\nThe facelift to NuGet.org site is live!\n\nA month ago, we had announced a significant redesign of the NuGet.org site. We got a ton of great feedback, and for that, we are always grateful.

  "latent_19213": "What did you do when you \"became a man\"? - No, I don't mean losing your virginity, though in many cultures, coming of age is intricately linked to sexual maturity. Did you celebrate by buying a Lotto ticket? Drink a yard glass full of beer? Become a Bar Mitsvah?\n\nWell, weaklings, be thankful that you didn't grow up as an aborigine in Australia, in the Satere MawÃ© tribe in the Amazon, or in the Sepik River tribe of Papua New Guinea. As you can see below, some cultures take the rites of manhood very, very seriously.\n\nLet's take a look at six of the Strangest Coming of Age Rituals in the World:\n\nWalkabout\n\nIn the walkabout, adolescent Aborigine boys are sent to live in the wilderness for as long as six months. It's not just about camping - they go on a spiritual journey to trace their ancestor's songlines, which include navigation instructions and other ancient wisdoms encoded in songs.\n\nInitiation with Bullet Ants\n\n[YouTube Clip]\n\nTo become men in Amazon's Satere MawÃ© tribe, boys as young as twelve have to first wear ceremonial gloves filled with stinging bullet ants. They're called not bullet ants without a very good reason: being stung by these suckers feels very much like getting shot. Each ant packs neurotoxins that cause pain 30 times more agonizing than the sting of a common wasp.\n\nAnd if you think that's bad enough, wearing the gloves once just doesn't cut it - you have to wear it for 10 minutes 20 times to become a man ...\n\nSteve Backshall went through the ritual and described it in The Sunday Times:\n\nI had suffered several hundred stings, and all of a sudden I went beyond pain. The sensations are not describable using simple words or metaphors, so Iâll just try to describe how I reacted. First, I started wailing, then, once that had passed, the floodgates opened â deep, guttural sobbing, uncontrollable shaking, writhing, convulsing. You could see the neurotoxin kicking in, my muscles starting to palpitate, my eyelids becoming heavy and drooping, my lips going numb. I started to drool, and suddenly I wasnât responding to anything at all. My legs wouldnât hold me up, and our doctor was shouting at me to keep moving and not to give in to the urge to lie down and let it take me. If thereâd been a machete to hand, Iâd have chopped off my arms to escape the pain. The other boys were in a similar state, but, interestingly, my host, who had been through the ritual before, seemed far more in control. It took three hours for the pain to ease a little, and shortly after that I was back playing footie with the kids â though with a hand clasped in each armpit and a pause every few minutes to scream a bit. Twelve hours later, my hands were swollen up like inflated washing-up gloves. If I pressed a thumb into them, it took two minutes for the impression to disappear from the fluid-swollen flesh.\n\nAdolescent Circumcision\n\n[YouTube Clip]\n\nYou don't have to go to remote corners of the world to find this next ritual. Circumcision, the cutting of the foreskin of the penis, is practiced (or forced upon, depending on your perspective) by as many as 1 in 3 males in the world.\n\nThere is a lot of controversy about circumcising a male infant right after birth, but at least the baby is too young to remember the painful ordeal. Nay, as a coming of age ritual in Turkey (amongst other cultures), circumcision is practiced on adolescent boys.\n\nThe origin of circumcision is lost in time. The most commonly accepted version is that circumcision came from ancient Egyptians, who noticed that a snake is reborn after it sheds its skin. And what part of the male anatomy is closest to a snake? You got the general idea ...\n\nBritish zoologist Desmond Morris noted in the documentary \"The Human Sexes\" (clip above) that \"I can't help feeling that if male circumcision didn't exist today and someone tried to introduce it, they'd be arrested for child abuse. But it's traditional role as a major rite of passage is too entrenched to bow to common sense or objective medical opinion.\"\n\nLand Diving\n\n[YouTube Clip]\n\nIn the tiny South Pacific island of Pentecost, boys as young as five years old engage in a tradition that can be best described as the ancient precursor to modern day's bungee jumping.\n\nIn Naghol (N'gol) or the land diving ritual, suicidally brave men jump from makeshift rickety towers as high as 100 feet up in the air with vines tied around their ankles. Land diving is kind of a multipurpose ritual: a rite of passage, a way to appease the gods to ensure a good yam harvest, and now, a tourist attraction.\n\nSo it's like bungee jumping - big deal, you think. Well, actually it's a little bit more complicated than that. The whole point of land diving is that the jumper's head touch the ground. But obviously if you're the jumper, you'd want that to be as briefly done as possible: if your head doesn't touch the ground, then it'll be a bad yam harvest. If your head touch too much ground, the yam will be blessed but you'll die. The difference between a good jump and a fatal one is about 4 inches of vine. It's no surprise then, that a jumper is allowed to say anything he wants to anyone before the jump and not be held responsible for his words (Source).\n\nBlood Initiation\n\n[YouTube Clip]\n\nIn the highlands of Papua New Guinea, the Matausa tribesmen believe that in order for timid boys to become brave men and attract women, they have to expel the contaminating female blood that they got from their mothers during childbirth. In order to do that, they undergo a brutal bloodletting rituals that involve shoving canes down their throats, sharp reeds up their nostrils and plunging sharp arrows repeatedly into their tongues.\n\nCrocodile Scars\n\n[YouTube Link]\n\nIf you think that the initiation rites above are bad, this one is downright horrifying: the crocodile scarification of the Sepik River tribe of Papua New Guinea (what is up with Papua New Guinea?!)\n\nI'll leave the National Geographic video clip above to fill you in on the details (warning: it's TERRIFYING!), but suffice it to say it involves getting hundreds of razor cuts on their bodies to get that fashionable \"crocodile skin\" look.\n\n______\n\nObviously, the article above only covered coming of age rituals for men. This doesn't mean that women don't have it rough - many coming of age rituals for girls are very physically demanding, like Na'ii'ees or the Apache Sunrise Ceremony, or the downright horrible ones like the Sunna circumcision or female genital mutilation practiced in many parts of Africa.\n\nI'd be the first to admit that the article is woefully incomplete (Cracked also has an article on this - I've taken steps not to repeat many of theirs) - if you know of any other strange coming of age rituals, please add them to the comment.",
  "latent_19234": "CRPF camps in Saranda\n\nRanchi, Oct. 14: More than a year after the success of the all-brawn Operation Monsoon that flushed out rebels from Saranda, women in uniform are set to launch another battle soon, this time to win friends and conquer hearts.\n\nAn all-woman CRPF platoon of 35 jawans â eight of whom are local girls trained by officers â will be posted at Saranda, the first such move in a rebel-hit pocket in the country.\n\nThe women jawans will be an addition to the over 2,000 CRPF personnel already deputed in seven camps in the densely forested territory that has stayed in the national spotlight thanks to the sustained interest of Union minister Jairam Ramesh.\n\nIn all, 24 CRPF camps have been proposed for the area covering the Rs 250-crore Saranda development project â 56 villages across six panchayats of Manoharpur block.\n\nThe mahila jawans will not patrol or âsanitiseâ the terrain, rather, they will strike the right chord with villagers, especially women.\n\nCRPF DIG Bhanu Pratap Singh told The Telegraph that formalities of deputing the first mahila platoon were over. âIt will debut soon. The purpose behind deploying a full-fledged mahila outfit now is to specifically sensitise Saranda women and address their needs,â he said.\n\nThe mahila jawans are anchored in Ranchi right now.\n\nMembers of the womenâs platoon, who will make inroads in village homes, will speak to rural homemakers and adolescent girls about health, hygiene and education.\n\nThe CRPF DIG said that women would be needed specifically for this uphill task.\n\nâRural women form the majority of the estimated 7,000 population. As rebels had a free reign for over a decade, the area was inaccessible and untouched by development. After Saranda was liberated last year, the Centre rolled out a special package. But villagers, especially women, need to open up more to avail the full benefits of the schemes,â Singh said, adding that mahila jawans would act as the key bridge between the community and the state.\n\nThe platoon may be later turned into a full-fledged mahila battalion depending on âresponse and needâ, said the CRPF DIG.\n\nOn the profile of the mahila jawans, the CRPF DIG said they had sought help from state director-general of police G.S. Rath requesting him to part with some persons from their cadre.\n\nâHe readily welcomed this idea. Some of the women jawans comprise local girls whom we had trained during our course of stay here,â said Singh.\n\nHe added that women and girls in the region faced unique problems, thanks to the years of cowering in a conflict zone. âAwareness on health and education is very low. Most women are grossly anaemic. Confidence is low as women have never felt secure before. Mahila CRPF jawans will hold health and education awareness camps and also visit homes daily to find out the needs of women and children. Our main aim is confidence building,â said Singh.",
  "latent_19376": "Despite the colonists being comparatively wealthy, with some very wealthy, the cost of this protection was nearly all being borne by the British taxpayer and the seven-year war had added 150 million pounds ($280,500,000) on top of an already crippling debt, incurred while defending Hanover from the French, Austrian, Saxon, Swedish and Russian Alliance.\n\nThis deficit was made worse by corruption in the colonies actually causing tax revenue to cost Britain Â£8000 in order to collect Â£2000 tax, and this at a rate of only sixpence a year each.\n\nThe British had repeatedly tried to get the colonists to pay towards their protection, by introducing various taxes, but all were unpopular.\n\nSo after the seven-year war the British had a massive debt with few ways to reduce it, so they had to limit expenditure and as the colonists had been the beneficiaries, it was decided:\n\n1. The settlers were to stop taking more and more Indian land, to limit spiralling defence costs and adding to the debt burden\n\n2. The settlers were to stop murdering the Indians (many of which had helped defeat the French), so as not to upset the only money maker in America, that of trading for Furs\n\n3. They had to stop endemic corruption such as smuggling and bribery, that was costing the exchequer so much money\n\n4. They had to find a way of introducing a tax system that worked to help with the debt burden.\n\nNo taxation without representation, the rebels said, but they did have representation through the colonial legislature/governor and had only been paying one twenty-sixth of the tax that a British tax payer paid, who were effectively subsidizing them by bearing the burden of their protection.\n\nDespite its notoriety, the objection to tax levied on tea was a ruse; the real issue was the British had, in an attempt to curtail their activities, under-cut the price of tea offered by smugglers, so itâs not surprising that most of the revolutionary leaders were in fact smugglers. But what is less well known is these same leaders had become wealthy dealing with the enemy during the Seven-Year-War, while fellow Americans were fighting to help save the colonies from the French.\n\nAnother reason not often mentioned is that the local legislatures for their own ends, kept devaluing their currencies to the point of making them virtually worthless. This cheated creditors out of money; but also created large numbers of debtors in the colonies.\n\nThe money owed wasnât theirs to lose, so by promising to absolve these debts, the rebels devised a powerful incentive for support.\n\nThe British had also drawn a proclamation line along the Appalachian Mountain peaks, honouring agreements to limit further encroachment onto Indian land and arrest the spiralling cost of protecting the colonists from Indian reprisals.\n\nTherefore those that settled beyond this line were the cause of a lot of problems as not having any money; they just became adept at murdering the Indians in order to take their land. Such people put extra strain and expense onto the British defences and were of course the natural allies of those powerful colonists, such as George Washington who wished to benefit from Indian land speculation.\n\nThen a Habeas corpus case (having to justify the reason for someoneâs detention) was started in London 1771, which found that slavery was contrary to the laws of England. This verdict ultimately led to the abolition of slavery in Britain. The ramifications of which was not lost on the future rebel leaders as most being slave owners would have considered it a threat to their livelihoods.\n\nThe rebel leaders or founding fathers (all quasi-atheists e.g. Deists) only represented about 27% of two and quarter million colonists (although they said it was 33%), but even if this was correct they knew they would have never won power through a referendum, so as they possess considerable propaganda skills, they called themselves Patriots, contrived incidents like the so called ' Boston massacre', portrayed their own vested interests as philanthropic ideals, and incited a reign of terror, aimed at civil authorities to disrupt society.\n\nIn reality Hancock was a very weathly smuggler, but the British had undercut his overpriced business and sommoned him to appear in court at a time he and Samuel Adams were known to have been in Lexington, where the shots of unknown source were fired at both sides resulting in several Militiamen being killed.\n\nThe others including Sam Adams (a failed businessman accused of embezzlement), Allen, Paine, Franklin, Jefferson, and Madison were bitter men, who for various reasons held grievances against the British.\n\nThe British only really wanted the smuggling and bribery to stop.\n\nThe rebel's strategy of attacking Loyalists, tarring and feathering them etc. to force them to resign their posts could have provided a role model for Hitler in the 1930's, as they also took advantage of unemployment to form their own militia, training them to take on the army (redcoats) while at the same time as appealing to everyone's sense of 'freedom', were really manoeuvring to dominate the colonists, majority of which were apposed to them.\n\nThey were in fact, what we consider today as insurgents/terrorists and those that most loudly espoused 'freedom', were controlling the largest number of slaves.\n\nWashington had become one of the wealthiest men in the Americas by marrying into as much money as he could and was anxious to gain even more through land speculations, if the Indian's land, which was being protected by Britain could be seized, so it's not surprising he wasn't the type to want to pay any taxes.\n\nBut it could be concluded that this motivation of greed had transformed him from a mediocre general under the British into an outstanding General, but he was at least as harsh on his troops as any British commander or even more so, as he would extend any lashing over several days for those he disapproved of, waiting for wounds to scab over before having them opened up again, then time and time again.\n\nThe one-sided accounts generally given by American historians, websites and film makers don't often mention the Battle of Penobscot Bay, probably because a mere 50 British redcoats held off 3000 Rebels for several days, until the Royal Navy arrived, at which point they embarked their 40 ships, but only to sail up river where they managed to shipwreck themselves and disappear into the Maine's wilderness never to be seen again.\n\nThe Loyalists were about 40% of the population overall, (Long Island was 90% Loyalist) and those that just didnât want to be on the losing side (including 'late' loyalists), made up the remaining 33%.\n\nThe Loyalists being law abiding were originally passive relying on the British for protection, but after they became increasingly persecuted, terrorised and humiliated by the rebels, about 15,000 joined as provincials with the British Army and another 10,000 served part-time with the various Loyalist militias. Many of who became highly motivated after experiencing rebel brutality, an example of such a person is Thomas Brown the son of a merchant, who had tried to confront a gang of the Sons of Liberty, but they attacked him, fracturing his skull, then partially scalped him, tarred his legs and held him over a fire with which he lost toes. The evil behind this revolution apparent, he went on to recruit hundreds of men to serve bravely with the East Florida Rangers, the unit that held off Mad Anthony Wayne for 6 months allowing everyone to evacuate Savannah safely. But as usual with such a determined leader, he has since been vilified by US historians. Those Loyalists that remained passive and the Non-aligned were forced under the threat of death to swear and sign oaths of allegiance to the rebel cause.\n\nThis turning it more into a civil war the rebels put their propaganda machine into overdrive, claiming things like âToriesâ took babes from the breasts of their mothers to dash their brains out and the alleged Tarletonâs quarter. Also the rebels recruited reprobates who had evolved a Presbyterian religion that as good as justified carrying out inhuman war crimes against Loyalists and keeping redcoat prisoners in such appalling conditions that most died.\n\nAnglican clergymen give testimony to this, as when they had previously ventured to into places such people had settled, they found their lives âlow, lazy, sluttish, heathenish, hellish and when trying to perform a church service, they always would turn it into a drunken singing revelling and dancing orgy.\n\nAn example of what these 'From over the mountain' people were capable of, was at the battle of Kings Mount where having surrounded a heavily outnumbered Loyalist unit, whose position had became hopeless so had (despite rebels not usually taking Loyalist militia as prisoners), tried to surrender; they just cut Major Ferguson to pieces and violated his body and this to a man whose chivalry in battle had prevented him from shooting Washington in the back. Also if any other examples of barbarity were required, they then used this distortion of religion to justify firstly starving those prisoners that they did take, only to hang or shoot most of them later.\n\nWhile the British won most of the battles, (despite often being outnumbered ), the conflict was really won by France Spain and Holland who also declared war on Britain with Russia Sweden and Denmark also denying trade. The coup-de-grÃ¡ce was when French ships blockaded Chesapeake bay denying Cornwallis any relief and then a storm prevented him from retreating across the river, giving him no choice but to surrender. These same French ships then went on to the West Indies where Rodney's fleet (who were one week too late to save Cornwallis), caught up with them and smashed them to pieces.\n\nThe French officers that had fought alongside the rebels were surprisingly conciliatory towards Cornwallis's men on their surrender at Yorktown, it's as if they knew their hypocrisy would rebound on them, they had fought a devious war to first aid the American rebels to remove the British, then (which isnât well known) to try later on to regain lost territory by going to war with the Americans themselves. Although an undeclared war, the French did actually try this in the Quasi-War but luckily for the Americans, Britain changed tactics and left them too stretched to finance it beyond inflicting terrible losses on American shipping.\n\nBritain could have fought on in America, but with her very existence under threat, wisely decided to consolidate her forces to fight France and Spain directly and in doing so defeated them, which actually protected the Americans.\n\nThe French people were left so impoverished by all this that their leaders, who had decided to fight with the American rebels, then suffered by their own example when having made inevitable the rebellion against King Louis XV1 and his entourage, they where duly executed in the French Revolution Spain would also suffer a considerable loss when later her own colonies followed the American example.\n\nDuring their rebellion the American republicans had relinquished almost universally their religion and morality, to a point that they drove most true church ministers out of the country which mitigated recriminations when the vast majority of ordinary Americans did not gain as a result of the rebellion, in fact most lost out, with the soldiers not receiving the land or the amount of pay they were promised, the Blacks remained as slaves and the Indians were subjected to ethnic cleansing. Only some of the rebel leaders gained and they imposed far more taxes upon the people than Britain would have done and also set up the monopolies that was the real cause of the north v south civil war, emancipation of slaves only became an issue to defeat the south.\n\nBut what happened to the Loyalists was similar to what happened in Europe to the Jews during the 2nd World War and would have probably experienced the same fate, had the most venerable of them not fled, (mainly to Canada). The expression âLynch Mobâ comes from the American Patriot Judge Lynch who hung anyone suspected of being a Loyalist with impunity. Such was the zealous behaviour of some rebels they not only forced mothers to witness the hanging of their Loyalist sons, rebel fathers would actually hang their own Loyalist sons. Black Loyalists were not only hung but their bodies were also publicly burnt. The USA had even attempted to cut off a retreat for the Loyalists, by invading Canada with a large force, but a combination of the US troopâs long march through Maineâs wilderness led by Benedict Arnold; Carletonâs defensive tactics and a blizzard fortunately thwarted them.\n\nThose loyalists that hadn't fled to the relative safety of British held areas e.g. New York hoping to avoid being dispossessed, ran the risk of torture or even murder.\n\nAt the formal end of the war at treaty of Paris, the British gave the Americans very generous settlement terms on the understanding that they would earnestly recommend that the Loyalists would have their land returned to them or receive fair compensation for such, the Americans reneged on this, with only South Carolina making any real effort to compensate them. Unbelievable excuses were given why they broke this agreement, e.g. there was no national government so the states had no need to accept any recommendations from Congress, despite it being the same people in Congress making the recommendations that when in the national government they rejected it â Another was: it gave opportunities to others, which is the same as saying a theft gives opportunities to others.\n\nBut the consequence of this mentality was pathetic wagon trains of Loyalist women and children moving north and a bigoted sense of freedom its legacy.\n\nAny that returned to seek redress found their persecution was as fierce as ever.\n\nSo about 100,000 of them that would not live in fear of their lives or with no rights fled mainly to Canada to set up enduringly loyalist towns in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Cape Breton and of course the Bay of Fundy where descendents of 'loyalists par excellence' will still fly the union flag along side their own Provencial flags.\n\nThe Loyalist's descent were made up approx of 28% German (the name New Brunswick may reflect this), 23% Scottish, 18% English, 12% Irish, 8% Dutch, 5% French, 4% Welsh, 2% from Switzerland, Denmark and Sweden.\n\nAbout as many again of African origin were on the loyalists side that shouldn't be forgotten and contrary to popular belief a high proportion of the Irish fought with the British.\n\nAbout 4000 Loyalists, mainly the types most able to survive, but few with the quasi-urban background of their eastern brethren, went up through New York state to settle Kingston and Niagara and being better suited to the frontier struggle which faced them, formed the nucleus of what is now Ontario. Their provincial flag incorporates a union canton, showing their loyalist heritage and their motto 'Ut incepit Fidelis sic permanent' means Loyal she began loyal she remains. Others fled to either Florida (then British), Bermuda, Bahamas/ Abaco/ Eleuthera/ Exuma, Turks & Caicos, Jamaica, Dominica, St Lucia, the Miskito Coast (later to British Honduras now Belize) and Sierra Leone. Those that arrived in Britain were in a pitiable situation, so much so that Lord North the Prime Minister, intended to arrange for them to be given passage and land in Australia as free settlers, even to introduce them to potential Tahiti wives, but his government was defeated in a general election before this could take place.\n\nHis successor the hard-nosed Lord Sydney had different ideas and decided, following a period of locking up mere petty criminals, to send them instead, to both reduce the 'self-induced' overcrowding problem in HM prisons and (one must conclude) to conveniently have less independent settlers for a new colony.\n\nMost people in Vermont did not take part in the rebellion and wanted to remain independent or even part of Canada, but were threatened by Washington and forced to join the USA, so 8000 of its settlers moved just across the border into Canada, where they set up the eastern townships in order to escape the chaos, taxes and anarchy that had become rife in the new US.\n\nAn indication of what life was like in the new USA is an armed uprising took place in Massachusetts from 1786 to 1787 against crippling taxation which had caused most to fall deeply in debt and then as a consequence faced them with either imprisonment or their property confiscated for the state to sell. This popular rebellion led by Daniel Shays, was crushed when nearly all of its leaders were caught and sentenced to death, Daniel Shays died in dire poverty.\n\nIn 1796 the British tried again to get compensation for the Loyalists by agreeing to withdraw from forts in Ohio country, if the Americans would agree to act more effectively on Loyalists claims. The British withdrew on schedule but the Loyalist claims were never settled, even though the British did all they could to pacify the Indians\n\nThe final injustice was that the loyalists were made to disappear and what force of arms could not erase, US historians have so diligently buried, so that their persecution remains ignored and forgotten.\n\nIn 1812, while Britain was at the height of her struggle with a Napoleon led Europe, that Madison and his party were aiding, Britain's very survival was at stake, so she naturally tried to impound this aid.\n\nIn response the anglophobic US War Hawks knowing Britain was unlikely to be able to reinforce her meagre 5000 man force in Canada and as the total population of Canada was only appox. 500,000 against around 7,500,000 million in the USA, thought it was a good time to take advantage of Britainâs preoccupation.\n\nSo they claimed the British were arming the Indians, (when the truth was they didnât have enough arms for themselves), grossly inflated the number of American sailors seized in error while boarding their ships to retrieve (poached) enlisted seamen and persuaded Madison, despite the suffering already inflicted on the Loyalists, to declare war and try to annex Canada which would effectively steal their land again.\n\nAmerica used its considerable skill of propaganda to try to get the Canadians to switch allegiance and join the USA, but the Loyalists knew the worthlessness of President Madison's pompous proclamations and promises and wisely remained deeply distrusting of the US and its brand of republicanism.\n\nThe US attacked with 2500 troops at Fort Malden where the only men General Brock had available was 150 British, 150 Indians and 300 Canadian militia (Loyalists), who knowing their fate if they failed, fought with such determination that another 700 Indians and former slaves joined in to help out repelling the invaders. Upper Canada would have been vitally under siege, but for the Federalists in New England and Vermont who wanted nothing to do with this war and continued to trade and supply the British and along with the loyalists in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick helped them to continue to hold out.\n\nOver the next two years the USA deployed considerably more resources than struggling Britain and Canada were able to, (whoâs only ace was a naval blockade) and as a consequence gained territory.\n\nAn interesting factor was that some US troops, mainly those that had travelled all that way from the southern States, then used their right on several occasions not to cross into Canada, maybe they saw through their leaders rhetoric ?\n\nAs one would expect, the audacious USA employed a range of warring tactics, including proving (while on raiding parties) that they were still not above, their old tricks of committing atrocities against loyalists, at such places as York (Toronto), Port Dover, Port Talbot, Turkey Point and Long Point.\n\nBut itâs a tribute to the defenders that the US never achieved a decisive tactical advantage.\n\nWhen Napoleon bit off more than he could chew and suffered a major setback in Russia, Britain could at last reinforce her beleaguered Canadian army, to at least match the USAâs and allow it to go on the offensive. Firstly to regain lost territory, then to take Maine. As a reprisal for York, they set fire to all public buildings in Washington, badly scorching the Presidential Mansion, so much so that it had to be whitewashed, they now call it the White House. Then because British shipping had been suffering at the hands of pirates operating out of Baltimore, the Royal Navy was sent to curtail their activities. The pirates however had anticipated this and took the initiative by scuttling all their ships themselves to seal off the harbour from attack.\n\nSo to make sure they had got the point the British treated Fort McHenry to a rocket bombardment which together with Mary Pickersgillâs splendid ensign, gave Francis Key the inspiration to write a poem to the melody of an old British drinking song that is now the US national anthem\n\nThereafter with no sensible land objectives left, the British went on to lose a pivotal battle at Lake Champlain, where Captain Downie was badly let down and killed, then with the sudden disappearance of a covering mist while advancing through boggy ground they took heavy losses at New Orleans, just a day before news arrived that a peace treaty had been signed weeks earlier, making this the most tragic battle of this ill-conceived war.\n\nThe war was considered a disaster, predictably the US claimed they had won (as Madisonâs neck was on the line), peace was declared and relations were normalised.\n\nIn an effort to try again, to get the Loyalist issues settled, the British gave up most of Maine (the exception was a disputed border area). The US not being content with this then indulged in some posturing and declared the phoney Aroostook war.\n\nBritain then even conceded most of this disputed area on the solemn understanding that the USA would make every effort and to earnestly resolve the lingering Loyalist issues.\n\nBut true to form they not only reneged on this again, they exposed their vindictive nature by persecuting those amongst them (Federalists) that had opposed the war.\n\nSince then US historians have largely ignored the existence of Loyalists, if mentioned at all, they underestimate their numbers (to typically 15-20% of population) by conveniently ignoring that, those robbed of everything, made homeless, reduced to mere survival, would have lacked the time or means to record their experiences and as their existence passes from memory, any papers that do exist are scattered and buried under a barrage of opposing jingoism. Therefore an honourable people subjected to the cruellest treatment, forcing all too many of them into suicide, continue to be victimised by a negative portrayal.\n\nThe Loyalists are demonised or dismissed as simply obtuse and their crime of not wanting to live under mob rule, chaos, insecurity, huge debts and the certainty of an ensuing civil war for the next 100 years or so, has in the eyes of the USA, forfeited them any rights.\n\nAnd their only 'crime' is remaining the âGood Americansâ.\n\nRelated Links\n\n& Bibliography\n\nYou are visitor\n\nBack to the Top",

He reiterated his opinion over the weekend.\n\nâMy Kristallnacht analogy does evoke the Nazi period in Germany. And thatâs what Iâm worried about: a slippery slope,â he added.\n\nKristallnacht or The Night of Broken Glass was a Nazi rampage which resulted in the destruction of thousands of Jewish homes, businesses and synagogues and at least 91 deaths.\n\nIt got its name from the shards of broken glass that littered streets in its aftermath and is considered to be the beginning of the âFinal Solutionâ which culminated in the Holocaust, during which some six million Jews were exterminated.\n\nWhen pushed on whether he believed Trump was a Nazi or fascist he said no.\n\nâI wouldnât call Mr. Trump either a fascist or a Nazi, Iâm just saying, we got to watch it when we get exclusionary about people on account of their status as a member of a group.â\n\nWeld told CNN Sunday that he stands by his remarks and does not believe it to have been too strong a statement.\n\nâNo, I don't think so. I served five years on the US Holocaust Commission by appointment of President George W. Bush ... I'm absolutely certain that, as we said in those years, if we don't remember, we absolutely will forget.â\n\nâAnd you got to forget a lot of things to think it's a good idea to round up and deport 11 million people living peaceably, most of them working in America, in the middle of the night,â he added. âNo, not the United States.

Not just in Islam, but also within Judaism and Christianity and other religions. And we would like to challenge that,â she said.\n\nReactions from the cityâs Muslim community have mostly been positive, with negative feedback âmoderateâ, she said.\n\nKhankan, a well-known commentator and author in Denmark, said there was âan Islamic tradition allowing women to be imamsâ and that most of the criticism was based on ignorance.\n\nSimilar projects by Muslim women exist in several other countries, including the US, Canada and Germany.\n\nImam Waseem Hussein, the chairman of one of Copenhagenâs biggest mosques, questioned whether there was a need for the project. âShould we also make a mosque only for men? Then there would certainly be an outcry among the Danish population,â he told the daily Politiken.\n\nA Danish newspaper report wrongly claimed that the location of the mosque was to be kept secret due to security concerns.\n\nâWe havenât received any threats whatsoever,â Khankan said, adding that she wanted to collaborate âwith everyoneâ within the Muslim community, and that the project was not about judging or excluding anybody.\n\nThe first Friday prayer has yet to be held as another eight female imams, in addition to the two currently involved, have to be found. âItâs a big responsibility and we all work as volunteers,â she said.\n\nThe longstanding political influence of the anti-immigration Danish Peopleâs party (DPP), as well as the row over prophet Muhammad cartoons that led to deadly protests in Muslim countries, have strained relations between Denmarkâs largest religious minority and the majority population.\n\nDenmarkâs largest purpose-built mosque, including the countryâs first minaret, opened in 2014 in a district of north-western Copenhagen after receiving a 150m kroner (Â£16m) endowment from Qatar.",
  "latent_19620": "AS RICH countriesâ economies slump, brave investors looking for fast returns may be tempted to look further afield. Which of the worldâs more exotic markets offer the best returns? Mexico has developed a following among investors bored of Brazil. The Philippines has been on a roll too, recently winning its first ever investment-grade credit rating. But virtually everywhere is beaten hands down by the tiny Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE), which has risen by 40% so far this year in local currency terms. Of stock markets tracked by The Economist, only Japanâs has performed better.\n\nThis may not be what most people associate with Pakistanâs most populous city, which is more famous for terrorist explosions than economic booms. The exchangeâs strong performance is partly due to improving conditions in Pakistan, including a reasonably free and fair election in May which was followed by a peaceful handover of power. Meanwhile, the slowing down of the BRIC economies has driven investors to try out ever more exotic markets. All the same, the KSEâs soaring growth is surprising: Pakistanâs economy is expected to grow by only about 3.6% this year, much less than many other emerging economies. And the stock exchange itselfâwhich has a market capitalisation of just $52.7 billionâis a tricky place to invest, with only 60 of its 569 listed companies trading regularly.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nPart of the Karachi exchangeâs lightning growth is due to an unusual amnesty enacted in January 2012. The authorities declared that from that date, investors would be allowed to buy shares with no questions asked about where their money came from. The amnesty, which is due to last until June 2014, is designed to encourage people with undocumented funds to invest them in the market, thus bringing the cash into the formal economy and within reach of the taxman. It seemed to work: after the amnestyâs introduction, the average daily volume traded on the KSE more than doubled.\n\nThe boom is good news for investors. But some wonder if there may be a downside to relaxing the rules on checking the origins of the money being pumped into the bourse. Pakistan has more than its fair share of corruption: it falls within the bottom quarter of a worldwide ranking compiled by Transparency International, an anti-graft watchdog. If people want to launder their ill-gotten gains, the authorities have their work cut out to stop them: flagging up suspicious activity is left to banks and brokers. The KSEâs growth is real enough, but the source of the rupees fuelling its boom is not always clear.",

The company makes a chip that goes into the handle of a regular firearm and transmits data over a cell-phone network connection. The data transmitted includes the location of a gun and whether it has been unholstered or discharged. The company is also working to track the direction in which a gun is pointing. The data can be fed to a police dispatch system or viewed on a smartphone.\n\nFounded in 2013, YardArm started out making a consumer product for monitoring a firearmâs location. But since many American gun owners object to technology or policies aimed at regulating firearms, it did not find many customers.\n\nâYou have a social demand for smart gun technology, but not necessarily a market demand,â says Jim Schaff, YardArmâs vice president of marketing. âAs a consumer product, itâs going to be a long road.â\n\nGun owners didnât flock to YardArm, but law enforcement remained interested. Technology that tracks officersâ action is slowly gaining acceptance as police chiefs and officers realize that the data can help clear them of wrongdoing and save litigation costs. Meanwhile, it is becoming increasingly common for many ordinary objects and devices to come with Internet connectivity.\n\nThis schematic shows the YardArm chip slotted into the handle of a Glock handgun.\n\nThe gun industry is gradually taking notice of these trends. The gunmaker Beretta already offers the i-Protect, a sensor that goes on the front of the gun and captures data on the weaponâs use. Meanwhile Taser, which makes a gun that delivers a nonlethal electric shock, also sells head-worn cameras to help police and security workers document events in the field.\n\nâDash-cams really set precedent,â Schaff says. âWhen it comes down to it, monitoring technology helps more than it hurts.â\n\nYardArm is holding tests to hone the tracking accuracy with police departments in Santa Cruz, California, and Carrollton, Texas. The technology has been tested at firing ranges, but not during active police duty.\n\nâIt is going so well we donât even know itâs there,â says Santa Cruz sheriff Phil Wowak. âThe product brings so much data that weâre going to have to figure out how to respond to every element.â\n\nYardarm plans to start selling the hardware and tracking service in mid-2015. The next goal is to capture the direction in which a gun was fired, but Schaff says this aspect of the technology needs to be improved. And despite the rebuff, YardArm has not given up on consumers. âWe absolutely believe thereâs a market of consumers perfectly happy deploying the technology,â Schaff says.",

Never mind that it was youth football on a field near the Houston suburb of Humble, Texas. Johnson was 9 and it was 1997. He might as well have been the Patriots' Drew Bledsoe to his best friend's Brett Favre. Jerrod was better than most of the kids his age. He didn't lose much. He did that day, and his helmet went for a ride when it was over.\n\nJerrod Johnson's father taught him what being an Aggie is all about. Aaron M. Sprecher/Getty Images\n\nHis coach and father, Larry Johnson, who also coached for Humble's high school team, saw it. He could live with his quarterback throwing interceptions -- helmets were a no-no.\n\n\"He just told me that I can never conduct myself that way,\" Johnson said. \"If you want to be a leader, you can never be too high, you can never be too low. Just try to stay even-keel.\"\n\nMost of his father's lessons began with Jerrod's tears fogging up his goofy glasses as a kid. Dad was always teaching; Jerrod was always learning. There were plenty of lessons about football, more about life, but a lot about what it meant to be an Aggie. Larry wore the maroon and white as a receiver and defensive back in the 1970s, and passed on his passion to Jerrod and his oldest son, Marquis.\n\n\"He grew up from Day 1 learning about this stuff. Me, I only learned about this stuff at A&M through recruiting,\" said Von Miller, Jerrod's teammate. \"He's been born and raised to be an Aggie, and he's gonna die an Aggie. And his kids are gonna be Aggies and their kids are gonna be Aggies.\"\n\nJerrod watched the time come for those before him at Humble. Players such as Jackie Battle and David Boston embraced it and worked their way into college and eventually the NFL. Others were sidelined by mistakes along the way. Johnson saw how to do both and made his choice.\n\nJohnson's time is now. He worked to earn a scholarship offer from the Aggies. He worked to hang on to his starting job after Stephen McGee returned from the injury that gave Johnson his first opportunity after two years on the bench. He worked to become the conference's best quarterback after just one season as a full-time starter. Now he's Texas A&M's best hope for a Big 12 title, their first since 1998.\n\n\"I put so much into football. It's a huge priority for me,\" said Johnson, who graduated in May with a degree in kinesiology and hopes of teaching and coaching after football. \"It goes family-faith-football for me, now that I'm graduated.

Rowling's children's charity to publish the Tales of Beedle the Bard 31 July 2008 ** Exclusive deal with Bloomsbury, Scholastic and Amazon will generate millions of pounds to help de-institutionalise vulnerable children ** In celebration of Harry Potter's birthday today, the Children's High Level Group (CHLG), the English charity co-founded by J.K. Rowling and Emma Nicholson MEP to help children suffering in institutions, announces that it is to publish The Tales of Beedle the Bard. Fans around the world have been clamouring to read the wizarding fairy tales - created, handwritten and illustrated by J.K. Rowling - since last December, when Amazon famously bid Â£1.95 million / $4 million for the charity copy, one of only seven in existence, at Sotheby's in London. The Children's High Level Group will publish three editions of the book, all in the English language, to be printed and distributed by Bloomsbury, Scholastic and Amazon. The Bloomsbury and Scholastic editions (Â£6.99 / $12.99) will feature additional commentary on each fairy tale from Professor Dumbledore and an introduction by J.K. Rowling. Amazon will produce up to a maximum of 100,000 Collector's Edition copies (Â£50 / $100), which will aim to closely replicate the look and feel of the original 'Beedle'. All editions will go on sale on Thursday 4 December 2008.\n\nTales of Beedle the Bard Collector's Edition\n\npictured with the original J.K. Rowling manuscript (smaller) All net proceeds from the sale of the books - expected to be in the region of Â£4 million / $8 million - will be donated to CHLG. The charity works to make life better for vulnerable children across Europe, where over a million children and teenagers are growing up in unacceptable conditions in large residential institutions. In most cases they are without adequate human or emotional contact and stimulation, while many only just survive without life's basics such as adequate shelter and food. Emma Nicholson says: \"We are so thrilled to be publishing such an exclusive and special book. This unique project will raise vital funds for the work of CHLG, to help us change the lives of hundreds of thousands of marginalised and institutionalised children who are living in appalling conditions, and make sure that no future generation suffers in this way.\" J.K. Rowling says: \"There was understandable disappointment among Harry Potter fans when only one copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard was offered to the public last December. I am therefore delighted to announce that, thanks to the generous support of Bloomsbury, Scholastic and Amazon (who bought the handwritten copy at auction) - and with the blessing of the wonderful people who own the other six original books - The Tales of Beedle the Bard will now be widely available to all Harry Potter fans. Royalties will be donated to the Children's High Level Group, to benefit institutionalised children in desperate need of a voice. The new edition will include the Tales themselves, translated from the original runes by Hermione Granger, and with illustrations by me, but also notes by Professor Albus Dumbledore, which appear by generous permission of the Hogwarts Headmasters' Archive.\" Containing clues that were to prove crucial to Harry Potter's final mission to destroy Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes, The Tales of Beedle the Bard is the volume of five wizarding fairy tales left to Hermione Granger by Albus Dumbledore in the seventh and final book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Only one - The Tale of the Three Brothers - is recounted in the book. In The Tales of Beedle the Bard, the four remaining stories are revealed for the very first time.\n\nPublished July 31, 2008 Sponsored Links",

  "latent_20202": "2016 has been a really great year â the year of the midrange phone. Never before have we had so many compelling devices available to us for below $400. If I may be so bold, this may be the beginning of the end of smartphone flagships in the $650 and up range. Weâre not quite there yet, but with so many great options at such a low price point, itâs a great time to pay attention to the industry.\n\nAnd then thereâs Google.\n\nJust when you thought you had everything figured out, Google goes and drops some Pixels on us startingâ¦STARTINGâ¦at $649. Remember Google? Google was the company that pretty much started the affordability trend in the âsmartphones that donât suckâ category. Going back as far as the Nexus 4, Google has been producing (or âorderingâ I guess if you want to be technical) borderline flagship phones for silly low prices. Even the Nexus 5X and 6P were significantly lower than the typical flagship price of $650. Of course it was significantly higher than previous generations, but still, both phones were pretty good deals.\n\nStrike that. Reverse it.\n\nWhat we have seen here is a bit of a role-reversal with Google shooting for the stars, and other OEMs severely undercutting them. This is an interesting turn in the industry, especially for phones that personally, I donât find very attractive. I will take the back of an Honor 8 long before the two-toned back of a Pixel. I mean, seriously, what is up with that? But anywayâ¦\n\nThis is (read: has to be) the primary reason Google rebranded its phones as Pixels, abandoning the Nexus line. Well, that and Google ran out of numbers for the Nexus â Nexus 7 has already been used â twice no less. But Google really decided to shoot for premium in its iPhones , er I mean Pixel phones. No longer is the Pixel phone just a showcase for new Android software â itâs a premium device all its own which is taking its place among the Google platform of devices and services.\n\nCan you assist?\n\nLook no further than Google Assistant to see what Google is really up to. Google wants to start selling its own ecosystem of mobile devices, and IoT, and Chromecasts to work together seamlessly. But in order to do that, it needs a phone that non-geeks will buy. Thatâs another reason for the rebranding. Nexus phones are largely unknown except for the few of us who are craving a stock Android experience, or fast updates, or both. But the Pixel is designed to be perceived as just as good as the Apples and the Samsungs out there.\n\nBut is it too late for that? Weâre living in a world that is dominated by Android, sure. But itâs mostly dominated by Samsungâs Android. Unless Google is ready, willing, and able to fight the long fight against the marketing machine that is Samsung, Google wonât make a whole lot of headway into its own space, which is deliciously ironic. Google basically has to fight not only itself, but its chief ally in order to push Pixels out the door.\n\nWhere are we going?\n\nBut maybe Google isnât in this for the money? Then whatâs the point? The Pixel is no proof-of-concept phone, nor is it an effective developer device like the former Nexus line. Google is pushing its own brand out into the water and hoping it floats. Make no mistake, this is Googleâs phone. Google has abandoned its old stance on the Nexus devices in favor of building a high-quality phone and tablet line (donât forget about the Pixel C) in order to increase its presence in this space.\n\nBut getting back to the whole price issue, it is doing so at a time when other OEMs are making damn good hardware and software at a fraction of the price. And is that a fight Google is willing to fight as well? Iâd be willing to bet these are confusing times over at Mountain View. Just who is the Pixel for? Naturally, weâll try to answer that question in our reviews once we get the devices in hand. But Google has taken a mysterious step with the Pixel phones and Iâm not sure anyone has any real idea how this is going to turn out. Or perhaps I should say, no one has any idea how this could possibly turn out well for Google.",
  "latent_20269": "After crushing the establishment and delivering a series of blows to globalism, President Donald Trump's winning spree against the powerful forces that opposed him appears to be slowing down. In fact, with his recent selection of Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster as National Security Adviser and Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court â both of whom have been listed as members of the establishment globalist swamp known as the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) â concerns are growing even among Trump supporters and grassroots conservative activists. There were already several CFR-linked officials before the latest additions â the very same forces that viciously libeled and attacked him in their failed bid to stop the swamp draining.\n\nThe controversial CFR group's agenda is rarely discussed openly in the media, despite the fact that much of the establishment media is actually listed as âcorporateâ members of the CFR. The outfit's membership is often quoted as supposedly dispassionate sources in the media, too. But evidence of the organization's agenda â global governance, open borders, Big Government, surrendering sovereignty, attacking self-government, and more â is hardly difficult to find.\n\nIndeed, prominent patriotic Americans, including CFR members, have been sounding the alarm for generations. The late U.S. Admiral Chester Ward, for example, who served as the Judge Advocate of the U.S. Navy, was a CFR member for 16 years before resigning in disgust. âIn the entire CFR lexicon, there is no term of revulsion carrying a meaning so deep as America First,â said Admiral Ward, whose comments on the CFR shed light on why the group would be entirely hostile to Trump's central promise as a pro-America, anti-establishment political candidate.\n\nBut it's even worse than that. âThe main purpose of the Council on Foreign Relations is promoting the disarmament of U.S. sovereignty and national independence, and submergence into an all-powerful one-world government,â the admiral warned, adding that âthis lust to surrender the sovereignty and independence of the United States is pervasive throughout most of the membership.â In other words, not everyone in the CFR is a fanatical globalist determined to sell out America's sovereignty, but most are.\n\nThat sinister agenda becomes clear from reading the CFR's own magazine, known as Foreign Affairs. In April 1974, for example, Richard Gardner, former deputy assistant Secretary of State, explained how the agenda for world government would be pursued. âIn short, the âhouse of world orderâ will have to be built from the bottom up rather than from the top down,â he wrote. âAn end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish much more than the old fashioned assault.â The magazine also regularly promotes regional government, war, and attacks on national sovereingty.\n\nFor some additional perspective, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admitted in a speech that the CFR gives her instructions on âwhat we should be doing and how we should think about the future.â Bush's Vice President Dick Cheney once bragged: âI've been a member [of the CFR] for a long time, and was actually a director for some period of time. I never mentioned that when I was campaigning for re-election back home in Wyoming.â Countless similar statements exist acknowledging the CFR's deceptive practices, its dangerous agenda, and its hijacking of U.S. policy.\n\nAnd yet, on the campaign trail, Trump blasted what he described as a âcabalâ seeking âglobal governmentâ and vowed to put an end to such machinations. âAmericanism, not globalism, will be our credo,â Trump said, adding that âAmerica Firstâ would become U.S. policy across every sphere of government activity including foreign policy, economic policy, trade policy, national security, immigration, and much more.\n\nOf course, it is true that Trump's administration and cabinet has less establishment globalists and CFR members than any White House in recent memory, of either party â Obama, Clinton, and both Bushes have each installed hundreds of CFR members in top positions within their administrations. But with some of Trump's most recent appointments, the trend toward adding more and more CFR members has raised questions and concerns even among some of his most ardent supporters.\n\nDid the so-called Deep State find a way to get to Trump? Is Trump simply unaware of the CFR's well-documented agenda to undermine U.S. sovereignty, liberty, and prosperity? Are there globalist CFR operatives who have burrowed their way into senior positions in the administration, and are now working to bring in more swamp creatures to mislead and sabotage Trump? The months and years ahead should make that more clear.\n\nFirst, Gorsuch. Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, assuming he is confirmed, will have immense influence on the future of America â far more than America's founding fathers ever intended. As soon as the announcement was made, many well-known conservative and establishment voices sprang into action to support the nomination. Some prominent voices expressed hesitation â both on pro-life issues and gun rights â but overall much of the Republican Party was pleased, ranging from constitutionalists and conservatives to the neocon and establishment wing of the GOP.\n\nA number of concerns ended up being raised about him, though. And more than a few liberals, including some far-left pseudo-journalists, have applauded the choice. The headline at the anti-Trump hysteria factory known as the Washington Post, for example, reads: âSimply stated, Gorsuch is steadfast and surprising. The Supreme Court nominee resides on the right, listens intently to the left and often finds a homespun truth somewhere in between.â An opinion piece at The Hill, meanwhile, suggested approvingly that Gorsuch might even be a secret liberal.\n\nHowever, one crucial point on his rÃ©sumÃ© has flown largely under the radar, even among many usually well-informed voices that would have promptly sounded the alarm. That is the fact that Gorsuch was listed as a term member of the CFR in the organization's 2008 Annual Report Membership Roster. He was also listed as a member in his 2006 nomination by President George W. Bush. And aside from Internet commentators in comment sections, the only major analyst who seems to have noticed is Kelleigh Nelson.\n\nCFR operatives must have noticed, too, though, recently calling Gorsuch âwell qualifiedâ for the spot â while perhaps inadvertently sending out a major warning sign for conservatives and constitutionalists. âTrump arguably had one good day in his first two weeks, on Jan. 31, when he rolled out the nomination of the well-qualified Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court,â the CFR's warmongering neoconservative Max Boot wrote in an oped published in Foreign Policy viciously attacking Trump and his agenda. Boot and other globalist neocons, often called RINOs (Republicans In Name Only), viciously smeared Trump during his campaign, too, abandoning the GOP for Hillary Clinton.\n\nThen there is Lieutenant General McMaster, Trump's new national security adviser who took over after non-CFR member Mike Flynn resigned amid what appeared to be a well-orchestrated hit job by the so-called Deep State. By all accounts, McMaster is a superb soldier, officer, and military man. He has received a wide array of awards, medals, and recognition for his service in the U.S. Army. His insights into the failures of U.S. military leadership in Vietnam have received widespread praise, too.\n\nHowever, McMaster is listed as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, too â and his membership is current as of February 24, according to the CFR's online roster. And while there are undoubtedly some non-globalists who have joined the CFR over the years for reasons other than believing in its anti-American, anti-freedom agenda, McMaster's record suggests he may not be among that small group.\n\nA decade ago, he joined the globalist-minded International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in London as a âSenior Research Associate.â According to the organization itself, his mandate was described as âconduct[ing] research to identify opportunities for improved multi-national cooperation and political-military integration in the areas of counterinsurgency, counter-terrorism, and state building.â\n\nThere are a number of terms and phrases there that are cause for alarm â including standard globalist rhetoric such as âmulti-national cooperationâ and âpolitical-military integration,â which sounds a lot like sovereignty-stealing schemes such as NATO and the European Union. There was also the term âstate building,â which critics pointed out resembles the ânation buildingâ that Trump specifically vowed to stop under his administration following costly and deadly failures by Obama and Bush.\n\nThe New American's Warren Mass reported on the developments this week. âOne would have expected an interventionist, neoconservative CFR member such as John McCain to have appointed a man such as McMaster to his inner circle,â Mass wrote. And indeed, true to form, globalist neocon McCain, who has expressed nothing but contempt for Trump and his supporters, was very pleased with McMaster, calling him âan outstanding choice for national security advisor â man of genuine intellect, character and ability.â\n\nMcMaster and Gorsuch are only the two most recent CFR additions to the Trump Team. Others have already been documented in the pages of The New American. And a regular commentator in the comments section of this magazine's online portal, who goes by the username St_Robert_Bellarmine, has compiled a significant list of Trump's senior CFR-linked and globalist-tied appointees, some of whom have attended the globalist Bilderberg summit or have ties to globalist billionaire David Rockefeller's Trilateral Commission, a CFR-type body focusing on America, Europe, and Japan.\n\nAmong them are Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, who is listed as a current member of CFR, despite the globalist outfit's key role in imposing the very multilateral âfree-tradeâ regimes that Trump has opposed for harming America and undermining U.S. sovereignty. Another is Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, a CFR member with troubling links to the Communist Chinese dictatorship. She also happens to be married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and may have been a bargaining chip in getting other nominees approved by establishment Republicans in Congress.\n\nThen there are a number of non-members who nevertheless have troubling ties to the CFR and other globalist organizations. Exxon-Mobil, of course, is a âfounderâ corporate member of the CFR. And despite not being an official member himself, Rex Tillerson boasted to CFR members in a speech that he shared their views on globalism. âLike the Councilâs founders, I believe we must choose the course of greater international engagements,â Tillerson said in a 2007 event at the CFR.\n\nAnother controversial figure is Steven Mnuchin, Trump's treasury secretary and a former executive with âvampire squidâ international bank Goldman Sachs. Like Exxon-Mobil, the globalist bank is also listed as a âfounderâ corporate member of the CFR. And Mnuchin, while not listed publicly as a member of CFR, was a member of the secret âSkull and Bonesâ society at Yale that has been exposed for being involved in dark and deeply disturbing rituals. George W. Bush and John Kerry were also members, though both refused to talk about it while running against each other for president.\n\nThen there are at least two cabinet members in the Trump administration who have attended the annual Bilderberg summit, where top globalists, politicians, bankers, communists, royalty, and crony capitalists meet once a year to plot policy behind closed doors and recruit useful idiots to their globalist cause. The first is former Texas Governor Rick Perry, a Republican who serves as Trump's energy secretary. The other is Secretary of Defense James Mattis, a military man who attended the 2015 Bilderberg meeting in Austria as a âdistinguished fellowâ of the Hoover Institution.\n\nThe name Rothschild â the unfathomably wealthy banking dynasty â often pops up in connection with Bilderberg, billionaire George Soros, and other organs and individuals associated with the globalist establishment and the central banking cartel. And it just so happens that Trump's commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, was a senior managing director at Rothschild, Inc., before joining Trump's team. Soros, the extreme left-wing agitator, was also a Rothschild protege.\n\nOf course, hoping for a cabinet entirely devoid of people with links to the establishment swamp â at least for now â might be a bit unrealistic. After all, the nominees had to get through Senate confirmation, and there are more than a few CFR operatives and globalist shills still haunting the halls of Congress. And to be fair, on the campaign trail, Trump did say he had ârespectâ for CFR boss Richard Haass, a leading globalist operative who has publicly grumbled about Trump and his agenda. Trump's team has also said publicly that all cabinet members agreed to go along with the president's America First agenda.\n\nHowever, at this point, it is starting to seem like there are too many swamp creatures in the White House for comfort. His supporters have expressed hope the president will keep them on a short leash, and utter the famous âyou're firedâ phrase from his TV days if any of the appointees get out of line. And to be fair, again, Trump has taken a number of actions that clearly upset the globalist establishment and the CFR, ranging from dismantling Obama regulations to withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But being surrounded by globalists and establishment operatives gives them the chance to mislead Trump, sabotage his agenda, and more.\n\nHe does have many excellent people working for him, many of whom have been highlighted in these pages. To avoid becoming another victim of the establishment, though, Trump should probably exercise extreme caution when getting advice or information.\n\nPhotos of Lt. Gen. H.R.

Itâs a chocolate egg with a plastic egg inside, and the interior egg includes a moderately cool toy. As many Americans learn the hard way while traveling home from Canada every year, the Surprise is illegal in the United States. This Easter, though, chocolate eggs hit the market that are thoroughly American-proof and legal. Meet Choco Treasure.\n\nUnlike the rest of the world, we Americans arenât allowed to have a ânon-nutritive objectâ thatâs encased entirely in food. Itâs a choking hazard: the Food and Drug Administration says so. The Choco Treasure gets around this rule by having two egg halves that wrap around a toy capsule that is fully visible. You are extremely unlikely to try to eat it. We hope.\n\nToy lines include dinosaurs, sports balls, and Spiderman. Theyâre supposed to be available at major candy-selling retailers by Easter.

  "latent_20552": "EXCLUSIVE: Homeland executive producer Howard Gordon and writer Josh Friedman have teamed for a high-concept drama project, which has landed a rich premium script deal at NBC. The untitled project, from 20th Century Fox TV and Gordonâs studio-based Teakwood Lane, is described as a thriller soap set in a world much like ours, where human-looking robots are commonplace. After a routine homicide explodes into the first robot-on-human murder, the lead detective must solve the case and investigate a growing robot rebellion while dealing with the impact on his own fractured family. This marks the first project to come out of Teakwood Lane, which Gordon launched last month.\n\nFriedman will write the script with Gordon supervising. The two will executive produce with Teakwood Laneâs head of TV Hugh Fitzpatrick. This marks a familiar territory for Friedman who helmed another series of projects about a world where humans and robots co-exist, Foxâs Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. His pilot scripts the last two years both went to pilot at Fox, Locke & Key and The Asset. UTA-repped Friedman also co-wrote the 2005 alien invasion movie War Of The Worlds. This marks Friedmanâs first project at NBC and Gordonâs return to the network where he executive produced Awake last season.\n\nA 25-year veteran Gordon, repped by WME and attorney Michael Gendler, first gained attention for his work on the hit Fox/20th TV series The X-Files and was the showrunner and executive producer of 24 for which he received both the Golden Globe and the Emmy for Best Drama Series. His other credits include Angel, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Beauty And The Beast, Sisters and Spenser: For Hire.",

John McCain (R-Ariz.) will return to his home state to undergo treatment for brain cancer.\n\nâIn accordance with the guidance of his physicians, Sen.

Try to get him to Lv 20 as soon as possible by putting him up against axe-users. Then you can leave him until his VERY late promotion. After promotion, however, he'll rock, especially with the Sword of Seals. His Speed and Skill will rise nicely, though he may have some trouble with Strength. 2. Marcus ãã¼ã«ã¹ Joins At: Chapter 1: Start of battle Class: Paladin Usable Weapons: Sword, Spear, Axe Initial Statistics (Lv 1) HP: 32 Def: 9 Str: 9 MDf: 8 Skl: 14 Mov: 8 Spd: 11 Con: 11 Luc: 10 Rsc: 14 Promotion Stat Additions (Already promoted) Stat Growth Rate HP: C Luc: D Str: D Def: F Skl: D MDf: F Spd: F Stat Expectations (Paladin Lv 20) HP: 44 Def: 12 Str: 13 MDf: 11 Skl: 17 Luc: 13 Spd: 16 Supporting Characters Roy, Allen, Lance, Wolt, Lilina Comments 2/10 Marcus is back and he's worse than before. Much worse. I mean, look at those stats. I think they're pretty self explanatory. 3. Allen ã¢ã¬ã³ Joins At: Chapter 1: Start of battle Class: Social Knight >> Paladin Usable Weapons Before Promotion: Sword, Spear After Promotion: Sword, Spear, Axe Initial Statistics (Lv 1) HP: 21 Def: 6 Str: 7 MDf: 0 Skl: 4 Mov: 7 Spd: 6 Con: 9 Luc: 3 Rsc: 16 Promotion Stat Additions HP: +3 Def: +2 Str: +2 MDf: +3 Skl: +2 Mov: +1 Spd: +2 Con: +2 Luc: +0 Rsc: -2 Stat Growth Rate HP: A Luc: B Str: B Def: D Skl: C MDf: D Spd: B Stat Expectations (Paladin Lv 20) HP: 56 Def: 16 Str: 25 MDf: 6 Skl: 19 Luc: 18 Spd: 24 Supporting Characters Lance, Thito, Marcus, Wolt, Ward, Roy Comments 8/10 Great Strength but not-so-great Skill makes Allen the exact opposite of Lance. He and Lance balance each other out, however, so it wouldn't be a bad idea to use them both. Another notable attribute is his Magic Defense. Just keep him away from spellcasters, and he'll do fine. 4. Lance ã©ã³ã¹ Joins At: Chapter 1: Start of battle Class: Social Knight >> Paladin Usable Weapons Before Promotion: Sword, Spear After Promotion: Sword, Spear, Axe Initial Statistics (Lv 1) HP: 20 Def: 6 Str: 5 MDf: 0 Skl: 6 Mov: 7 Spd: 8 Con: 9 Luc: 2 Rsc: 16 Promotion Stat Additions HP: +3 Def: +2 Str: +2 MDf: +3 Skl: +2 Mov: +1 Spd: +2 Con: +2 Luc: +0 Rsc: -2 Stat Growth Rate HP: A Luc: C Str: C Def: D Skl: B MDf: D Spd: B Stat Expectations (Paladin Lv 20) HP: 53 Def: 15 Str: 20 MDf: 9 Skl: 25 Luc: 15 Spd: 24 Supporting Characters Marcus, Wolt, Roy, Allen, Lott, Clarine Comments 8/10 Great Skill but not-so-great Strength makes Lance the exact opposite of Allen. He and Allen balance each other out, however, so it wouldn't be a bad idea to use them both. I got *a little* more Magic Defense out of Lance than Allen, but don't hold your breath. It's still pretty low. 5.

Compared to Dorothy, however, his stats are weaker overall. But his stats are still more than enough to make him useful, so it isn't a bad idea to use him if you don't want to use Dorothy. 6. Bors ãã¼ã«ã¹ Joins At: Chapter 1: Start of battle Class: Armor Knight >> General Usable Weapons Before Promotion: Spear After Promotion: Spear, Axe Initial Statistics (Lv 1) HP: 20 Def: 11 Str: 7 MDf: 0 Skl: 4 Mov: 4 Spd: 3 Con: 14 Luc: 4 Rsc: 13 Promotion Stat Additions HP: +4 Def: +4 Str: +3 MDf: +3 Skl: +2 Mov: +1 Spd: +3 Con: +2 Luc: +0 Rsc: +2 Stat Growth Rate HP: A Luc: B Str: C Def: B Skl: C MDf: D Spd: B Stat Expectations (General Lv 20) HP: 58 Def: 28 Str: 21 MDf: 7 Skl: 20 Luc: 22 Spd: 19 Supporting Characters Wendy, Barth, Asthor, Oujay, Lilina Comments 8/10 A typical General with great Defense, crap Magic Defense, and average Strength, Skill, and Speed. He's pretty useful as a wall to block hoardes of Mercenaries, Swordmasters, and whatnot. He's probably better than Barth because of the big Speed and Skill advantage, but he'll lose out to a well built-up Wendy. 7. Merlinus ããªãã¹ Joins At: Chapter 2: Start of battle Class: Transporter Usable Weapons: None Initial Statistics (Lv 1) HP: 15 Def: 3 Str: 0 MDf: 0 Skl: 3 Mov: 5 Spd: 3 Con: 25 Luc: 10 Rsc: 24 Promotion Stat Additions (No promotion) Stat Growth Rate HP: A Luc: A Str: F Def: D Skl: A MDf: F Spd: B Stat Expectations (Transporter Lv 20) I have no idea because I never tried building him up. Supporting Characters (None) Comments 8/10 He won't die too easily in the early chapters, but later on, if he gets targeted, expect him to get defeated. Frankly, in the later chapters he just becomes a waste of a space where you could instead put another fighting unit. It's possible to level him up by dodging 100 times per level, but that would mean dodging 1900 times to get to Lv 20. I don't believe anyone has the time or patience to do that. 8. Ellen ã¨ã¬ã³ Joins At: Chapter 2: Start of battle Class: Cleric >> Bishop Usable Weapons Before Promotion: Staff After Promotion: Staff, Light Magic Initial Statistics (Lv 2) HP: 16 Def: 0 Mgk: 1 MDf: 6 Skl: 6 Mov: 5 Spd: 8 Con: 4 Luc: 8 Rsc: 3 Promotion Stat Additions HP: +3 Def: +2 Mgk: +3 MDf: +3 Skl: +3 Mov: +1 Spd: +2 Con: +1 Luc: +0 Rsc: +1 Stat Growth Rate HP: C Luc: A Mgk: B Def: F Skl: C MDf: A Spd: C Stat Expectations (Bishop Lv 20) HP: 34 Def: 4 Mgk: 23 MDf: 30 Skl: 20 Luc: 30 Spd: 19 Supporting Characters Saul, Miledy, Zeiss, Lou, Chad Comments 8/10 She's unusually slow, so she won't make a very decent dodger against melee weapons because of her pathetic defense. However, she's a perfect barrier against spells. She'll get higher Magic than Saul, but falls behind in Skill and Speed. 9. Dieck ãã£ã¼ã¯ Joins At: Chapter 2: Automatically at 3rd turn Class: Mercenary >> Hero Usable Weapons Before Promotion: Sword After Promotion: Sword, Axe Initial Statistics (Lv 5) HP: 26 Def: 6 Str: 9 MDf: 1 Skl: 12 Mov: 5 Spd: 10 Con: 13 Luc: 5 Rsc: 12 Promotion Stat Additions HP: +4 Def: +4 Str: +2 MDf: +2 Skl: +1 Mov: +1 Spd: +2 Con: +1 Luc: +0 Rsc: +1 Stat Growth Rate HP: A Luc: D Str: C Def: D Skl: C MDf: D Spd: D Stat Expectations (Hero Lv 20) HP: 57 Def: 13 Str: 22 MDf: 10 Skl: 27 Luc: 10 Spd: 20 Supporting Characters Ward, Lott, Thany, Claine, Clarine, Rutgar Comments 7/10 Maybe I'm just unlucky, but I never got decent stats out of Dieck. Basically his HP and Skill were all that impressed me. However, everyone around me gets godly stats with him, forcing me to the conclusion that Dieck's RNG hates me. I don't care what anybody says; Oujay is waaaay better. 10. Ward ã¯ã¼ã Joins At: Chapter 2: Automatically at 3rd turn Class: Fighter >> Warrior Usable Weapons Before Promotion: Axe After Promotion: Axe, Bow Initial Statistics (Lv 2) HP: 28 Def: 3 Str: 8 MDf: 0 Skl: 3 Mov: 5 Spd: 5 Con: 13 Luc: 4 Rsc: 12 Promotion Stat Additions HP: +8 Def: +3 Str: +3 MDf: +0 Skl: +3 Mov: +1 Spd: +2 Con: +2 Luc: +0 Rsc: +2 Stat Growth Rate HP: A Luc: D Str: B Def: C Skl: B MDf: F Spd: D Stat Expectations (Warrior Lv 20) HP: 60 Def: 20 Str: 30 MDf: 1 Skl: 21 Luc: 15 Spd: 18 Supporting Characters Lott, Dieck, Thany, Echidna, Allen Comments 6/10 His Strength is great, but his Speed and Magic Defense really suffers. He's pretty crappy before he's promoted, but once he becomes a Warrior, the ability to use bows makes him a bit more useful. But your Archers are more than enough for your bow attacks anyway, so I wouldn't bother with Ward. 11.

He's basically the same as Ward with better Speed and much lower Strength. The Warriors in FE6 are pretty bad all around, unlike in FE7. 12.

Pegasus Knights tend to be frail to begin with, but Thany is especially so. You never know when she's going to get defeated, so you always have to keep an eye on her. Also, she will have trouble in the later maps against high level enemies with high defense, so you might give her some Energy Rings if you're planning on using her. 13.

You can't count on him to be a fighter, and you can't leave him alone either because his defense area is devastatingly weak. But his Speed maxes out fairly quickly, so he'll be useful as a stealing unit throughout the game. It's either him or Cath, who has equally high Speed. 14.

Lilina will have much higher Magic, but Lou has a large Skill/Speed advantage, making him more useful. His Magic will seem low at early levels, but just be patient because it will rise eventually. Also, since there are many enemies in this game with low magic defense, Lou will prove to be useful no matter what map you use him in. 15.

Only the most accurate of units such as Heroes, Swordmasters, and Snipers will have a chance to hit her. Anything else will have 0% accuracy against her. She is also a great rescuer/healer who can reach people far away and get them out of harm's way or heal them. Her only drawback is her pathetically low Magic. She'll do fine against melee units, but she will have a lot of trouble damaging enemies like Druids or Bishops that have high magic defense. 16.

Rutgar indeed does get impressive gains in Skill and Speed, but his other stats aren't that great. The other Myrmidom, Fir, is in fact better because she gets higher Luck, allowing her to dodge more attacks. Don't get me wrong; Rutgar is a great unit to have, but I just think Fir is better. Using both is an option, but Swordmasters aren't my favorite class, so one is enough for me, and it's usually Fir. Rutgar gets Hard Mode stat bonuses. 17.

Other than that, however, his stats are nice. He's slightly more durable than Ellen, but he's frail all the same, so it doesn't really matter who you use. 18.

Once you get her going, she becomes unstoppable with her high Strength, Skill, and Speed. You might be worried about her defense area, but her Speed allows her to dodge most attacks, so it won't matter. 19.

However, again that low Strength gets in the way. She will have trouble damaging things in later chapters because enemies generally tend to have more Defense than Magic Defense. Shin has higher Strength, so he's better to have. 20.

He can soak up vast amounts of damage and his high Luck prevents critical hits as well. He's also a pretty good fighter because his Strength gets fairly high. I may be the only one, but I think he's better than Allen/Lance. 22.

This isn't good for Asthor because stealing depends on high Speed. Stick to Chad/Cath for Thieves. 24.

But her Skill and Speed suffer greatly instead. She won't stand a chance against powerful melee enemies because of her low defense and speed. However, she'll be a wall against spellcasters. She's the perfect unit to kill Mamkutes without wasting your Divine Weapons, but if you're going to use her, you'll need to use lots of Secret Books and Pegasus Feathers to boost her Skill/Speed. 25.

It may be difficult at first to get her up to par, but it's definitely worth it. She'd be perfect if not for that low Magic Defense... Pair her up with another useful unit like Oujay or Lilina to bring out her maximum potential. 26.

His Skill and Speed are just pathetic, and even though he'll max out Strength and Defense, there isn't much point if he always misses and can't do double attacks. If you just want to use him as a wall, however, he's your choice (but not against spellcasters). 27.

He dodges all oncoming attacks with his high Speed and Luck, and he makes accurate, high-damaging dual attacks no matter what he's up against. He is by far the best candidate for the Durandal. 28.

Her lack of Strength can be compensated with a good support. Her critical hit rate will go crazy after promotion, allowing her kill just about anything in one turn. She could easily take out her own father ;) Fir's stats will start out higher in Hard Mode. 29.

However, compared to other bow-users both Shin and Sue lose out stat wise. I never thought that Nomads were worth using because I have enough Archers already, and I never liked Nomads to begin with. If you plan on using a Nomad, choose Shin over Sue. Shin's stats get Hard Mode bonuses. 30.

He'll max HP and Strength very quickly, and his other stats grow nicely as well, with the exception of Skill and Magic Defense. His low Skill can be fixed by giving him loads of Secret Books, but nothing can be done about having ABSOLUTE ZERO for Magic Defense. Just have him stay away from spellcasters and he'll be a natural tank/killing machine. The critical hit bonus is also nice. What's more, he gets Hard Mode stat bonuses as well. 31.

Geese and Gonzales sort of cancel each other's disadvantages out, so it's best to use them both. These two are always in my team because Berserkers are my favorite class and because nobody (except magicians) can stand in their path and survive. Too bad they can't support each other; then they would have been truly invincible. 32.

If you don't feel like going through the effort of building up Wolt or Dorothy, then Claine is for you. Still, he won't come close to Wolt/Dorothy stat-wise, so I would still recommend that you stick to them. Also, Claine gets stat bonuses in Hard Mode. 33.

Thito's not made of glass like Thany, and she's better than Yuno (no explanation necessary). Her defense area might still seem a little weak, but her Speed and Strength make up for it. Thito also won't have trouble damaging things while Thany can barely scratch them. Also, Thito will get Hard Mode stat bonuses. 34.

His high-damaging attacks don't make a difference if they don't hit in the first place. Looks like his prime was in his youth, like so many other characters in this game. Thankfully, his daughter is a very useful unit, so we can praise him for that, though. 38. Ray ã¬ã¤ Joins At: Chapter 12: Speak with Lou Class: Shaman >> Druid Usable Weapons Before Promotion: Dark Magic After Promotion: Dark Magic, Staff Initial Statistics (Lv 10) HP: 23 Def: 5 Mgk: 12 MDf: 10 Skl: 9 Mov: 5 Spd: 9 Con: 4 Luc: 6 Rsc: 3 Promotion Stat Additions HP: +3 Def: +2 Mgk: +4 MDf: +2 Skl: +2 Mov: +1 Spd: +2 Con: +1 Luc: +0 Rsc: +1 Stat Growth Rate HP: B Luc: F Mgk: B Def: F Skl: B MDf: C Spd: B Stat Expectations (Druid Lv 20) HP: 41 Def: 10 Mgk: 28 MDf: 21 Skl: 24 Luc: 10 Spd: 21 Supporting Characters Lou, Chad, Sophia, Hugh, Niime Comments 10/10 A great Shaman, Ray lines right up with his brother in terms of usefulness. He has one minor drawback of having terrible Luck, but that can be compensated with a support that increases evasion. He's quite fast and accurate for a Shaman, and he has great Magic as well, making him a great spellcaster. After promotion, he can use staves as well, adding on to his usefulness. He also gets Hard Mode stat bonuses. 39. Cath ã­ã£ã¹ Joins At: Chapter 12/16/20/22: Speak with Roy. She'll join if it's the 3rd time Roy has spoken to her. Class: Thief Usable Weapons: Sword Initial Statistics (Lv 5) HP: 16 Def: 2 Str: 3 MDf: 1 Skl: 7 Mov: 6 Spd: 11 Con: 5 Luc: 8 Rsc: 4 Promotion Stat Additions (none) Stat Growth Rate HP: A Luc: A Str: B Def: F Skl: B MDf: D Spd: A Stat Expectations (Thief Lv 20) HP: 31 Def: 5 Str: 11 MDf: 5 Skl: 16 Luc: 17 Spd: 20 Supporting Characters Chad, Hugh, Geese, Garret, Bartre Comments 9/10 Cath will max Speed faster than Chad, and she has higher Luck, making her a bit more useful. However, she's still frail, so watch over her if you're sending her off on her own. I always use her because she's one of my favorite characters personality/storyline wise. I would have liked to see her as an Assassin. Oh well. Cath gets Hard Mode stat bonuses. 40. Miledy ãã¬ãã£ Joins At: Chapter 13: Automatically at 3rd turn Class: Dragon Knight >> Dragon Master Usable Weapons Before Promotion: Spear After Promotion: Spear, Sword Initial Statistics (Lv 10) HP: 30 Def: 13 Str: 12 MDf: 3 Skl: 11 Mov: 7 Spd: 10 Con: 8 Luc: 5 Rsc: 12 Promotion Stat Additions HP: +5 Def: +2 Str: +2 MDf: +2 Skl: +2 Mov: +1 Spd: +2 Con: +1 Luc: +0 Rsc: -1 Stat Growth Rate HP: A Luc: D Str: B Def: D Skl: B MDf: F Spd: B Stat Expectations (Dragon Master Lv 20) HP: 56 Def: 21 Str: 25 MDf: 5 Skl: 26 Luc: 12 Spd: 23 Supporting Characters Zeiss, Treck, Lou, Ellen, Yodel Comments 10/10 Simply put, awesome. She'll max Strength, Speed, and Skill, and her Defense will become high as well. After her promotion she can uses swords, allowing her to charge head-on into just about any melee enemy without losing the weapon triangle (and even if she does have the disadvantage with the weapon triangle, it doesn't really matter because her stats are so high). Miledy is a definite candidate for your team. 41. Percival ãã¼ã·ãã« Joins At: Chapter 13 or Chapter 15: Speak with Elphin/Lalam Class: Paladin Usable Weapons: Sword, Spear, Axe Initial Statistics (Lv 5) HP: 43 Def: 14 Str: 17 MDf: 11 Skl: 13 Mov: 8 Spd: 18 Con: 12 Luc: 12 Rsc: 13 Promotion Stat Additions (Already promoted) Stat Growth Rate HP: B Luc: D Str: C Def: D Skl: C MDf: D Spd: C Stat Expectations (Paladin Lv 20) HP: 54 Def: 17 Str: 21 MDf: 12 Skl: 17 Luc: 14 Spd: 23 Supporting Characters Cecilia, Douglas, Lalam, Elphin, Dorothy, Claine Comments 7/10 He starts with mediocre stats, and his stat gains are better than Marcus and Zealot, making him much more useful. Still, he's nothing compared to Allen/Lance or Treck/Noah. You might want to use him if you're lacking in Paladins and don't want to start building up the Social Knights. His stats start out higher in Hard Mode. 42. Cecilia ã»ã·ãªã¢ Joins At: Chapter 14: Start of battle Class: Valkyuria Usable Weapons: Staff, Anima Magic Initial Statistics (Lv 1) HP: 30 Def: 7 Mgk: 11 MDf: 13 Skl: 7 Mov: 8 Spd: 10 Con: 6 Luc: 10 Rsc: 14 Promotion Stat Additions (already promoted) Stat Growth Rate HP: B Luc: D Mgk: C Def: D Skl: B MDf: D Spd: D Stat Expectations (Valkyuria Lv 20) HP: 40 Def: 10 Mgk: 17 MDf: 17 Skl: 15 Luc: 15 Spd: 15 Supporting Characters Roy, Percival, Douglas, Saul, Elphin, Lilina Comments 4/10 Though not as bad as Marcus/Zealot, Cecilia's stats are still pretty sad. When I first got her, I thought that she might become strong because her stats start out so low. But I was wrong; her stats start out low and will remain low throughout the game. I know some people who think she's good, but I have yet to understand why. 43. Sophia ã½ãã£ã¼ã¤ Joins At: Chapter 14: Start of battle Class: Shaman >> Druid Usable Weapons Before Promotion: Dark Magic After Promotion: Dark Magic, Staff Initial Statistics (Lv 1) HP: 15 Def: 1 Mgk: 6 MDf: 8 Skl: 2 Mov: 5 Spd: 4 Con: 3 Luc: 3 Rsc: 2 Promotion Stat Additions HP: +2 Def: +2 Mgk: +4 MDf: +2 Skl: +2 Mov: +1 Spd: +3 Con: +1 Luc: +0 Rsc: +1 Stat Growth Rate HP: B Luc: D Mgk: A Def: D Skl: C MDf: B Spd: C Stat Expectations (Druid Lv 20) HP: 39 Def: 10 Mgk: 29 MDf: 29 Skl: 19 Luc: 10 Spd: 18 Supporting Characters Roy, Fae, Igraine, Ray, Niime Comments 9/10 Building up Sophia is a really painful process because she starts out with practically no Speed or Skill. Once she's up to par and promoted, she'll start doing her job properly. However, her Skill and Speed will remain low throughout the game, so if you want to use her, make sure you use stat boosting items. You probably wouldn't have Ray adequately built up yet at the point you get Sophia, so decide based on your preferences. If you want power, go for Sophia. If you want accuracy, go with Ray. You probably won't need both of them. 44. Igraine ã¤ã°ã¬ã¼ã Joins At: Chapter 15: Start of battle Class: Sniper Usable Weapons: Bow Initial Statistics (Lv 5) HP: 32 Def: 11 Str: 16 MDf: 10 Skl: 18 Mov: 6 Spd: 15 Con: 7 Luc: 9 Rsc: 6 Promotion Stat Additions (Already promoted) Stat Growth Rate HP: B Luc: D Str: C Def: F Skl: C MDf: F Spd: C Stat Expectations (Sniper Lv 20) HP: 46 Def: 11 Str: 23 MDf: 10 Skl: 23 Luc: 12 Spd: 21 Supporting Characters Fae, Sophia, Saul, Douglas, Asthor Comments 8/10 She's like Claine, but she starts with higher stats and has almost the same growth rates, so she'll turn out better than Claine in the end. She'll sometimes turn out better than Wolt (but never better than Dorothy) so you can try using her instead. 45. Garret ã¬ã¬ãã Joins At: Chapter 10: Speak with Lilina Class: Berserker Usable Weapons: Axe Initial Statistics (Lv 2) HP: 49 Def: 9 Str: 17 MDf: 4 Skl: 13 Mov: 6 Spd: 10 Con: 13 Luc: 12 Rsc: 12 Promotion Stat Additions (already promoted) Stat Growth Rate HP: A Luc: D Str: B Def: D Skl: D MDf: F Spd: D Stat Expectations (Berserker Lv 20) HP: 60 Def: 11 Str: 25 MDf: 5 Skl: 17 Luc: 14 Spd: 14 Supporting Characters Gonzales, Cath, Geese Comments 6/10 This Berserker is nothing compared to Gonzales/Geese. His stats are all poor besides HP and Strength. Just stick to Gonzales/Geese for Berserkers. He might be a little more useful in the Hard Mode, where he gets stat bonuses. 46. Fae ãã¡ Joins At: Chapter 16: Start of battle Class: Mamkute Usable Weapons: Dragon Stones Initial Statistics (Lv 1) HP: 16 Def: 2 Str: 2 MDf: 6 Skl: 2 Mov: 5 Spd: 3 Con: 1 Luc: 7 Rsc: 0 Promotion Stat Additions (none) Stat Growth Rate HP: A Luc: A Str: A Def: C Skl: A MDf: C Spd: A Stat Expectations (Mamkute Lv 20) HP: 40 Def: 7 Str: 19 MDf: 15 Skl: 18 Luc: 30 Spd: 15 Supporting Characters Igraine, Sophia, Niime, Elphin, Sue Comments 9/10 Fae can be one heck of a killing machine once her stats get going. However her weapon, the Divine Dragon Stone, has only 30 uses and is the only one in the game. Therefore, you can use a glitch in the system to sort of fix this problem and make Fae immensely useful. See IV. Additional Information for details. 47. Hugh ãã¥ã¦ Joins At: Chapter 16: Speak with Roy and pay him either 10000, 8000, 6000, or 5000 G Class: Mage >> Sage Usable Weapons Before Promotion: Anima Magic After Promotion: Anima Magic, Staff Initial Statistics (Lv 15, assuming you paid the highest amount) HP: 26 Def: 9 Mgk: 13 MDf: 9 Skl: 11 Mov: 5 Spd: 12 Con: 7 Luc: 10 Rsc: 6 Promotion Stat Additions HP: +4 Def: +2 Mgk: +4 MDf: +2 Skl: +2 Mov: +1 Spd: +1 Con: +1 Luc: +0 Rsc: +1 Stat Growth Rate HP: A Luc: B Mgk: C Def: D Skl: C MDf: D Spd: B Stat Expectations (Sage Lv 20) HP: 48 Def: 15 Mgk: 24 MDf: 15 Skl: 21 Luc: 16 Spd: 23 Supporting Characters Ray, Chad, Ellen, Hugh, Miledy Comments 9/10 Hugh is often forgotten because he joins late and by then, you've already built up and promoted either Lou or Lilina. However, Hugh is a pretty nice unit to have if you're lacking in spellcasters. He lies somewhere in the middle of Lou and Lilina stat wise. Hugh has a big vitality advantage over Lou and Lilina with much higher HP and good defense and magic defense. So just because you have the other Magi promoted, don't ignore Hugh. He will Hard Mode stat bonuses, too. 48. Zeiss ãã¡ã¤ã¹ Joins At: Chapter 16: Speak with Miledy Class: Dragon Knight >> Dragon Master Usable Weapons Before Promotion: Spear After Promotion: Spear, Sword Initial Statistics (Lv 7) HP: 28 Def: 12 Str: 14 MDf: 2 Skl: 9 Mov: 7 Spd: 8 Con: 10 Luc: 6 Rsc: 15 Promotion Stat Additions HP: +5 Def: +2 Str: +2 MDf: +1 Skl: +2 Mov: +1 Spd: +2 Con: +1 Luc: +0 Rsc: -1 Stat Growth Rate HP: A Luc: D Str: A Def: D Skl: B MDf: F Spd: C Stat Expectations (Dragon Master Lv 20) HP: 58 Def: 22 Str: 26 MDf: 4 Skl: 26 Luc: 12 Spd: 20 Supporting Characters Miledy, Ellen, Shin, Bartre, Karel Comments 10/10 Zeiss, like his sister, is awesome as well. Their stats end up around the same because they both come so close to maxing the same stats. Therefore Zeiss and Miledy can both be used in the same way. They're both great units to have, so it is better to use them both. Give them both good supports and watch them decimate legions of enemies. Zeiss also gets Hard Mode stat bonuses. 49. Douglas ãã°ã©ã¹ Joins At: Chapter 16G: Start of battle, only if he survived Ch 16 Class: General Usable Weapons: Spear, Axe Initial Statistics (Lv 8) HP: 46 Def: 20 Str: 19 MDf: 5 Skl: 13 Mov: 5 Spd: 8 Con: 17 Luc: 11 Rsc: 16 Promotion Stat Additions (already promoted) Stat Growth Rate HP: B Luc: D Str: C Def: D Skl: C MDf: D Spd: C Stat Expectations (General Lv 20) HP: 53 Def: 22 Str: 22 MDf: 6 Skl: 16 Luc: 22 Spd: 11 Supporting Characters Elphin, Geese, Percival, Cecilia, Lalam, Igraine Comments 4/10 He's even worse than Barth; lower stats all around. His low Speed is especially fatal. I wouldn't waste my time on him. 50. Niime ãã¤ã¡ Joins At: Chapter 19B/20A: Start of battle Class: Druid Usable Weapons: Dark Magic, Staff Initial Statistics (Lv 18) HP: 25 Def: 5 Mgk: 21 MDf: 18 Skl: 20 Mov: 6 Spd: 16 Con: 4 Luc: 15 Rsc: 3 Promotion Stat Additions (none) Stat Growth Rate HP: D Luc: F Mgk: F Def: F Skl: F MDf: D Spd: F Stat Expectations (Druid Lv 20) HP: 25 Def: 5 Mgk: 21 MDf: 18 Skl: 20 Luc: 15 Spd: 16 Supporting Characters Fae, Ray, Sophia, Yodel, Hugh Comments 6/10 If her stats grow at all, you're lucky. Her Magic and Skill actually aren't that bad, but her Speed is kind of low, pulling her down. You might want to use her only if you don't have Ray or Sophia built up. 51. Dayan ãã¤ã³ Joins At: Chapter 20A: Speak with Roy Class: Nomadic Trooper Usable Weapons: Bow, Sword Initial Statistics (Lv 14) HP: 43 Def: 10 Str: 14 MDf: 12 Skl: 16 Mov: 7 Spd: 20 Con: 9 Luc: 12 Rsc: 16 Promotion Stat Additions (already promoted) Stat Growth Rate HP: B Luc: D Str: D Def: F Skl: D MDf: F Spd: D Stat Expectations (Nomadic Trooper Lv 20) HP: 46 Def: 10 Str: 15 MDf: 11 Skl: 17 Luc: 13 Spd: 21 Supporting Characters Sue, Shin, Gonzales, Yodel, Rutgar Comments 5/10 His Speed is average, but everything else is only mediocre. I wouldn't waste my time on him, especially if you have Shin or Sue already built up. Even if you don't, he's not worth it, so don't bother levelling him up. 52. Yuno ã¦ã¼ã Joins At: Chapter 20B: Speak with Zealot Class: Falcon Knight Usable Weapons Before Promotion: Spear, Sword Initial Statistics (Lv 9) HP: 33 Def: 8 Str: 11 MDf: 12 Skl: 14 Mov: 8 Spd: 16 Con: 7 Luc: 14 Rsc: 13 Promotion Stat Additions (already promoted) Stat Growth Rate HP: B Luc: B Str: D Def: F Skl: D MDf: F Spd: C Stat Expectations (Falcon Knight Lv 20) HP: 38 Def: 9 Str: 13 MDf: 12 Skl: 18 Luc: 19 Spd: 19 Supporting Characters Thany, Thito, Zealot, Treck, Noah Comments 3/10 Ouch. Those stats speak for themselves. Well, she's Zealot's wife. No wonder. 53. Yodel ã¨ã¼ãã« Joins At: Chapter 21: Start of battle Class: Bishop Usable Weapons: Staff, Light Magic Initial Statistics (Lv 20) HP: 35 Def: 5 Mgk: 19 MDf: 30 Skl: 18 Mov: 6 Spd: 14 Con: 6 Luc: 11 Rsc: 5 Promotion Stat Additions (already promoted) Stat Growth Rate (None) Stat Expectations (Bishop Lv 20) (None) Supporting Characters Saul, Niime, Dorothy, Dayan, Miledy Comments 4/10 He could be an emergency Bishop if you haven't built up Ellen or Saul. However, his stats are pretty low, and his frailness stands out. You're probably better off giving up the idea of Light Magic altogether than using him. 54. Karel ã«ã¬ã« Joins At: Chapter 23: Visit village with Fir Class: Swordmaster Usable Weapons: Sword Initial Statistics (Lv 19) HP: 44 Def: 15 Str: 20 MDf: 13 Skl: 28 Mov: 6 Spd: 23 Con: 9 Luc: 18 Rsc: 8 Promotion Stat Additions (already promoted) Stat Growth Rate HP: A Luc: A Str: A Def: A Skl: A MDf: A Spd: A Stat Expectations (Swordmaster Lv 20) HP: 46 Def: 16 Str: 21 MDf: 14 Skl: 29 Luc: 19 Spd: 25 Supporting Characters Bartre, Fir, Rutgar, Zeiss, Noah Comments 8/10 Karel is back and finally we have a character who doesn't become weak when he ages. He only gains one level, but when he does, you'll see that his gains are crazy. He's fairly useful because you can start using him as soon as you get him. There's one catch, though: he appears in Ch 23, which you can only access if you've collected all the Divine Weapons (= going to all of the Gaiden maps). 55. Narshen ãã¼ã·ã§ã³ Joins At: Usable in Trial Map after beating the game once Class: Dragon Master Usable Weapons: Spear, Sword Initial Statistics (Lv 10) HP: 46 Def: 20 Str: 16 MDf: 12 Skl: 13 Mov: 8 Spd: 16 Con: 11 Luc: 13 Rsc: 10 Promotion Stat Additions (already promoted) Stat Growth Rate (none) Stat Expectations (Dragon Master Lv 20) (none) Supporting Characters (none) Comments 5/10 Narshen is my favorite villain storyline wise. Well anyway, that doesn't make him particularly useful in the Trial Maps, however. His Speed is average, but his Skill is too low to make him useful. He has more Magic Defense than most Dragon Knights, but it doesn't really matter because you wouldn't really send a Dragon Knight into a pack of spellcasters to begin with. 56. Gale ã²ã¤ã« Joins At: Usable in Trial Map after beating the game twice Class: Dragon Master Usable Weapons: Spear, Sword Initial Statistics (Lv 18) HP: 49 Def: 22 Str: 22 MDf: 14 Skl: 15 Mov: 8 Spd: 13 Con: 12 Luc: 11 Rsc: 11 Promotion Stat Additions (already promoted) Stat Growth Rate (none) Stat Expectations (Dragon Master Lv 20) (none) Supporting Characters (none) Comments 5/10 You would think Miledy's lover would be as awesome as Miledy herself, but no. That Speed is MUCH too low, as is his Skill. Use him if you want, but don't expect much. 57. Hector ãã¯ãã« Joins At: Usable in Trial Map after beating the game 3 times Class: General Usable Weapons: Spear, Axe Initial Statistics (Lv 16) HP: 43 Def: 30 Str: 18 MDf: 15 Skl: 20 Mov: 5 Spd: 10 Con: 20 Luc: 15 Rsc: 19 Promotion Stat Additions (already promoted) Stat Growth Rate (None) Stat Expectations (General Lv 20) (None) Supporting Characters (None) Comments 5/10 Pretty useless, actually. Looks like his prime was during FE7. If you're looking for a good point, perhaps it's the fact that his Magic Defense is higher than all of the other Generals in the game. His other stats are noticeably low, however. 58. Brenya ãã«ã¼ãã£ Joins At: Usable in Trial Map after beating the game 4 times Class: Sage Usable Weapons: Anima Magic, Staff Initial Statistics (Lv 20) HP: 38 Def: 18 Mgk: 23 MDf: 25 Skl: 18 Mov: 6 Spd: 18 Con: 6 Luc: 17 Rsc: 5 Promotion Stat Additions (already promoted) Stat Growth Rate (None) Stat Expectations (Sage Lv 20) (None) Supporting Characters (None) Comments 7/10 Out of the other units that the Trial Maps offer, Brenya is noticeably useful because her Speed is decently high, while other Trial Map characters seem to suffer from low Speed. She's also great in the defense area, unlike other Magi in the game. Brenya is also a respectable character storyline wise, so I try to use her as best I can. 59. Eliwood ã¨ãªã¦ãã Joins At: Usable in Trial Map after beating the game 5 times Class: Paladin Usable Weapons: Sword, Spear, Axe Initial Statistics (Lv 20) HP: 48 Def: 24 Str: 25 MDf: 15 Skl: 20 Mov: 8 Spd: 22 Con: 11 Luc: 14 Rsc: 14 Promotion Stat Additions (Already promoted) Stat Growth Rate (None) Stat Expectations (None) Supporting Characters (None) Comments 8/10 He'll do pretty well with high stats in Strength, Skill, and Speed. He can pretty much hold his own in battle. He even seems to slightly better than the Eliwood in FE7 at times, especially in the defense area. 60. Murdock ãã¼ããã¯ Joins At: Usable in Trial Map after beating the game 6 times Class: General Usable Weapons: Spear, Axe Initial Statistics (Lv 20) HP: 60 Def: 25 Str: 27 MDf: 17 Skl: 19 Mov: 5 Spd: 12 Con: 20 Luc: 12 Rsc: 19 Promotion Stat Additions (already promoted) Stat Growth Rate (none) Stat Expectations (General Lv 20) (none) Supporting Characters (none) Comments 7/10 Holy cow, just how big is this guy? A Con of 20?? Man... Anyway, Murdock is sort of useful because his Skill is average, and both his Defense and Magic Defense are fairly high. That Speed is still a problem, but if you just want to place him as a wall, he'll do just fine with that incredible HP and defense. 61. Zephiel ã¼ãã£ã¼ã« Joins At: Usable in Trial Map after beating the game 7 times Class: King Usable Weapons: Sword Initial Statistics (Lv 20) HP: 70 Def: 22 Str: 24 MDf: 24 Skl: 20 Mov: 5 Spd: 14 Con: 17 Luc: 15 Rsc: 16 Promotion Stat Additions (already promoted) Stat Growth Rate (none) Stat Expectations (Dragon Master Lv 20) (none) Supporting Characters (none) Comments 7/10 Whoo! We get Zephiel at last! There is no better wall/meatshield than this individual right here. With 70 HP and great Defense and Magic Defense, this guy cannot be killed. Though his Speed is again very low, you can use him as a fighter if you just want to see that cool spinning move again. Also, he looks and sounds like a General when he walks, but weapons that kill Armor don't work on him. 62. Guinevere ã®ãã´ã£ã¢ Joins At: Usable in Trial Map after beating the game 8 times, including 1 Hard Mode Class: Sage Usable Weapons: Anima Magic, Light Magic, Staff Initial Statistics (Lv 20) HP: 29 Def: 13 Mgk: 24 MDf: 25 Skl: 24 Mov: 6 Spd: 23 Con: 5 Luc: 24 Rsc: 4 Promotion Stat Additions (already promoted) Stat Growth Rate (None) Stat Expectations (Sage Lv 20) (None) Supporting Characters (None) Comments 9/10 Being the hardest character to unlock, Princess Guinevere's stats are indeed impressive, setting aside her HP. She also has the odd ability to use both Anima and Light Magic, making her the only unit in the game that can use two kinds of spells. She'll make a great fighter and healer, so use her when you get the chance. ############################################################################### /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ------------------------- IV.

Maximum Statistics ______________________ [MXST] This is a list of all the class' stat maxes. Note that characters can reach max stats only after promotion. Also, these are the ABSOLUTE maximum stats. Characters will not necessarily reach these numbers. In fact, it is probably impossible to max out every stat on a character even with the aid of items.

Hard Mode Stat Additions ___________________________ [HMSA] Characters noted in III. Characters as having Hard Mode stat bonuses will get higher stats when you recruit them in the Hard Mode. This is because they start out as enemies, and all enemies get higher stats in the Hard Mode. The characters are: Rutgar, Fir, Shin, Gonzales, Claine, Thito, Cath, Ray, Percival, Garret, Hugh, Zeiss, Douglas. For these characters, all stats except Luck will get a bonus between +1 and +6 points. Luck will get a bonus between +1 and +9 points. So if you're really lucky, you'll get a killer character once you recruit them. __________________ 5. Triangle Attack __________________ [TRAT] The three Pegasus Knight sisters (Thany, Thito, Yuno) and the Armor Knight trio (Bors, Barth, Wendy) have a special group attack that you can use once you have all three of them. To unleash this attack, have the three Pegasus Knights or Armor Knights surround a single enemy, like this: X = Pegasus Knight or Armor Knight E = Enemy X XEX Next, have one of them attack. That's it. They'll perform a cool move with a special animation sequence. It doesn't only look good, either; this attack ALWAYS has 100 accuracy and 100 critical hit rate! ________________ 6. Dragon Stones ________________ [FADR] Fae, your only Mamkute in the game, comes equipped with a Divine Dragon Stone, which has 30 uses. It is the only one in the game, and Dragon Stones are the only weapons Mamkutes can use. Now you're thinking, \"Then why should I use Fae? Once the stone is gone, she's worthless!\" Technically, you're right. However, by using a little cheat/bug, you can improve Fae's usefulness immensely. Do you remember how the enemy Mamkutes have Fire Dragon Stones with infinite uses? You probably wished you had them when you got Fae. Actually, you can obtain these, using a glitch in the game. In Ch 23, the chapter where you fight Brenya, there are lots of Mamkutes and spellcasters with the Berserk staff. You probably know that when Thieves go berserk, they start stealing from random targets. So have a Thief go near a Mamkute that's near the range of a unit carrying a Berserk staff. That enemy will then cast Berserk on the Thief. Now, the Thief will go up to the Mamkute and swipe his Fire Dragon Stone. Now all you have to do is revive the Thief so he/she doesn't go charging in to the enemy lines to get killed and give the stone Fae. Note that this highly depends on your luck because there isn't such a convenient area in the map where you can just go and have your Thief steal the stone. It may take a few tries, several if you're unlucky. But it's definitely worth it. Now, Fae has a weapon with infinite uses. Note that this IS a bug in the game, meaning that it may corrupt your save data or cause the game to crash. You have to understand this if you're going to try this technique. ________________________ 7. Support Conversations ________________________ [SPCN] Support conversations boost characters' stats when the supporting characters are within 3 blocks of each other. You'll notice that each character belongs to a certain element: Fire ç Lightning é· Wind é¢¨ Ice æ°· Dark é Light å Nonelemental ç The elements of the characters supporting each other determine which stats get bonuses and how much they increase. Here's a chart, taken from ãããè¶äº­ Kawaki Chatei http://www.pegasusknight.com: Just look for the combination of elements of your two characters to see what bonuses they get. Damage is the amount of damage the character does Defense is the amount of damage the character can resist from an enemy attack Accuracy is the character's hit rate Evasion is the chance of the character to dodge oncoming attacks Critical is the character's critical hit rate Blank spaces indicate a zero.

Q & A ------------------------------------ /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ############################################################################### General questions should be answered here. Read this before sending me emails. Q1. Where can I get this game? A1. a) Import it from an online game store which deals with foreign games. Ebay might have it. b) Find a ROM version. You'll have to ask someone else for where to find it because I have no idea. c) Import it from a Japanese online store which ships overseas. d) Have a friend in Japan buy it and ship it to you. e) If you're going to Japan for the summer, then buy it there directly. Q2. So Roy IS in this FE, right? A2. Yes! One more person to understand this fact. Q3. Then Marth must be too, if he wasn't in FE US. A3. NO! Q4. Then where the hell is he!? A4. FE1 and FE3. Q5. That sucks! A5. Too bad. Q6. Then is Leif-- A6. Enough. Please. Q7. Where's Lyn?? A7. God knows because she isn't mentioned once in this game. You're not going to see her. Q8. _______'s name is spelled wrong. I saw it on the official website! A8. I changed the spelling of some of the characters because the \"official\" translations sound awful. My translations aren't the official ones, but they sound better. Trust me. Q9. My stats for _______ didn't turn out anywhere near as good/bad as you said they would! A9. Stats vary because of the Random Number Generator. The stat expectations are the averages that I ended up with, and while they may not be exactly the same as other people's, they should give a good idea of what to expect. Q10. No Assassins this time? A10. No. Your Thieves will therefore have fairly low stats, making the game more challenging. Q11. What are \"Dragon Knights\" \"Social Knights\" \"Armor Knights\"? A11. Dragon Knight = Wyvern Rider Dragon Master = Wyvern Lord Social Knight = Cavalier Armor Knight = Knight Q12. So who are the best units? A12. That varies for people, so that's up to you.

I do have a life, and I don't want to waste time dealing with pointless email. Feel free to contact me with questions/comments at email and MSN: firelizard98@hotmail.com But please don't do the following. I will not respond to emails like these. -Don't email me with questions about beating the game. There are message boards with lots of friendly people you can ask. It takes less time to get a response that way, and my inbox doesn't get cluttered, which makes both you and me happier. There are also some Walkthroughs posted in the FAQs section, so they are also useful for reference. -Don't ask me questions that are answered in my FAQs or in any other FAQs on the same game. It just makes sense. In fact, Juigi Kario has put up a nicely done FAQ on general game questions and the history of Fire Emblem. Newcomers should look there first. -I am fluent only in English and Japanese. Don't send me emails in French, Korean, Chinese, Martian, or in any language other than English/Japanese. I will not answer emails that I can't read in the first place. -Flaming. Pretty self explanatory. Don't do it. -Don't send me false information. It won't be tolerated, whether it is intentional or not. -Chain letters. Don't even think about sending me them. -Please don't send me anything over 400KB, either. -BOTTOM LINE: GO TO THE MESSAGE BOARDS AND READ OTHER FAQS BEFORE EMAILING ME WITH QUESTIONS.

  "latent_20673": "Mr. Bush, of course, inherited a surplus from the Clinton administration, which he quickly used up on his tax cuts. He then continued cutting taxes after the surpluses were gone and even after launching the war in Iraq â $600 billion and counting. Mr. Bush remains unrepentant. Even now, with the economy â and revenues â slowing, he is pushing to make those tax cuts permanent. That would be fiscally catastrophic.\n\nThe big winner, predictably, is the Pentagon. After adjusting for inflation, the proposed defense budget of $515.4 billion â which does not include either war spending or the cost of nuclear weapons â would be up by more than 30 percent since Mr. Bush took office and would be the highest level of military spending since World War II.\n\nMr. Bushâs war of choice in Iraq, on top of the war of necessity in Afghanistan, has seriously strained the American military â its people and its equipment. Even a new president committed to a swift withdrawal of American troops from Iraq will have to keep asking for large Pentagon budgets, both to repair that damage and to prepare the country to face what will continue to be a very dangerous world.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

As far as anyone can tell, not a single weapons system would be canceled. That means it will be up to Congress â also far too captive to military-industry lobbyists â to start scaling back or canceling expensive programs that donât meet todayâs threats, or tomorrowâs.\n\nThere is one place weâre delighted to see Mr. Bush invest more money: a proposal to hire 1,100 new diplomats. The next president will need all of the diplomatic help he or she can get to contain the many international disasters Mr. Bush will leave behind.\n\nPredictably, the big losers in Mr. Bushâs budget are domestic-spending programs â including medical research, environmental protection and education â which will either be held flat or cut.\n\nEven more predictably, most of Mr. Bushâs touted savings would come from programs intended to protect the countryâs most vulnerable citizens: the elderly, the poor and the disabled. The budget would sharply restrain the growth of spending on the huge Medicare health insurance program, in an effort to save some $178 billion over the next five years. The administration would achieve that primarily by cutting the annual increases in payments to hospitals , nursing homes and other health care providers that are designed to keep up with the rising costs of caring for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nThere is clearly room to restrain the rate of growth in some of these payments. But the size and duration of the cuts are irresponsible. Meanwhile, Mr. Bush â who insists that every answer to the countryâs health care woes can be found in the private sector â has left largely untouched the big subsidies that prop up the private Medicare Advantage insurance plans. Eliminating these unjustified subsidies could save Medicare more than $50 billion over five years and $150 billion over 10 years.\n\nJust as the nation seems on the edge of a recession, the budget would also shave federal contributions to state Medicaid programs by some $17 billion over five years. That is exactly the wrong direction to go in tough economic times, when low-income workers who lose their jobs need Medicaid coverage and states have fewer funds to supply it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAll of this means that Mr. Bush will leave his successor a daunting list of problems: the ever-rising cost of health care, the tens of millions of uninsured, a military that is desperately in need of rebuilding. Thanks to Mr. Bushâs profligate ways, it also means that the next president will have even less money for solving them.",
  "latent_20720": "Richard Garriott. Brian Reynolds. John Romero. They're three of the biggest names in gaming history, designers, respectively, of widely acknowledged classics like Ultima, Civilization II, and Doom. They have also all moved into social games.\n\nGarriott made the move recently, with his new company Portalarium. Reynolds joined Zynga with much fanfare a couple of years ago, designing the megahit FrontierVille, and Romero joined forces with Brenda Brathwaite (herself a veteran of the venerable Wizardry series) to create Ravenwood Fair. The two are now powering through new social titles, including one for Ubisoft, at Loot Drop.\n\nThey're not alone. There's something of an arms race as the enfants terrible of the social gaming world snap up the talent behind classic games. It helps to legitimize them in an industry that often turns up its nose at the terms \"casual\" or \"social\", and of course it also should help them make better games.\n\nDesigners who move into the social/casual game sphere aren't shy about describing their excitement about the change in scenery.\n\nSince his company Portalarium was announced, Garriott has been describing how social games are the \"Third Grand Era\" in game history, after single-player and massively multi-player games, and how he is \"fortunate for a third once-in-a lifetime opportunity in social media\" after playing a crucial role in the first two eras.\n\nBrathwaite described her move into social games saying \"I'd had my eye on the social space both as a player and a developer since its launch, and it was just fascinating to me.\"\n\nHowever, that's only half of the story, one told from the perspective of the social games companies. The other side of the story is equally interesting: if our most famous game designers are making social games, it means they're not making the kinds of games they made famous, for the companies they made popular. What happened, and why?\n\nIt was not a historical inevitability. Looking at designers in Japan reveals that. Many of Japan's most famous game creators are still with the companies they helped build up, such as Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tekuza at Nintendo, or Hideo Kojima at Konami.\n\nAlternately, even some designers who left their initial companies are often making the same kinds of games, like Final Fantasy's Hironobu Sakaguchi, who left Square Enix to form Mistwalker and develop epic RPGs like Blue Dragon and The Last Story. While many Japanese designers have left their companies, it's not as rare for them to stay as it is in the West.\n\nIf there was any comparison to Miyamoto as the English-speaking face of gaming, it was Will Wright, whose SimCity and The Simsare some of the biggest and most enduring hits in the industry. Yet even Wright, who went from Maxis to EA when the former was absorbed by the latter, recently left his position, choosing instead to work on a new kind of game: Hivemind.\n\nOne notable exception is John Carmack, who is still with id Software. In a 2009 interview about the purchase of id by ZeniMax, he made some interesting claims:\n\n\"The two obvious choices [of id buyers] were Electronic Arts and Activision. They're the two giants of the industry. But we knew that we would have to go through big corporate changes if we went with them... (with ZeniMax) we could do our games the same way we have been. The corporate cultures are compatible. And when we go out to publish the games, now we will be doing that.\"\n\nAnd, in a recent Gamasutra interview, John Carmack explained the appeal as a way to let himself get back to doing his work: \"If anything, since the ZeniMax acquisition, it's been great. I don't even have to pretend to be an executive anymore. I don't have to go to board meetings. I don't have to do anything! I can just sit in my office and work.\"\n\nThe history of gaming is riddled with influential studios being purchased by larger publishers and then hemorrhaging talent. EA's purchase of Origin Systems famously led to the gutting of the once-proud studio, as designers like Richard Garriott and Warren Spector left for smaller companies, while Chris Roberts, of Wing Commander fame, left the industry entirely.\n\nThings were arguably worst at Sierra, a major publisher and developer, known primarily for its adventure games. It was purchased by another company in 1996, and then when that company, which became Cendant, had massive financial irregularities, it was sold to French conglomerate Havas. The games, and game designers, suffered.\n\nAccording to Jane Jensen, designer of Gabriel Knight, \"They were sold to another company, and they didn't want to make adventure games anymore. I think I was the last adventure game designer who was still working there. Gabriel Knight 3 was the last big adventure that they did. They didn't want to make that kind of game anymore, so all of those game designers were just out of work.\"\n\nQuest for Glory's Corey Cole gives more details about the financial situation: \"We always had a somewhat rocky relationship with Sierra, between money issues and management putting me on other projects than 'our' games. We left the first time (our contract was cancelled, and I was laid off along with half the company) a few months after Quest for Glory IV shipped [Ed. Note: QFGIV was released in 1993]. We were asked to cut the budget for the next game by 20 percent, and I did not feel we could make a quality game under that budget.\"\n\nHowever, the Coles were asked to return when demand for Quest for Glory V forced Sierra to change its mind. \"Sierra brought Lori back to design the game, and the following year I joined the project as a programmer. After two years of delays (and a complete rewrite of the graphics engine), Sierra managed to ship the game, but it was at best marginally profitable due to the cost overruns...\"\n\nThe irony, to Cole, was that this could have been avoided in the first place: \"I actually don't think management knew that we already had a bare-bones budget, about $750K vs. the $15-20M development cost of an average game today, or the $4-5M QG5 actually cost Sierra when they finally decided to develop it.\"",

  "latent_21243": "NEW MASSES: IRELAND AND ARMENIA\n\nnlr\n\neu\n\ncis\n\nussr\n\ngdp\n\nr&d\n\ngdp\n\ndaniel finn\n\nWATER WARS IN IRELAND\n\nIrelandâs political class has spent the past few years assuring its counterparts in the rest of Europe that no burden is too great for the local population to bear. In 2009, Finance Minister Brian Lenihan bragged about âour capacity to take pain . . . in France you would have riots if you tried to do this.â Lenihanâs Fianna FÃ¡il party may have been wiped out at the 2011 general election, but the new Fine GaelâLabour government kept on whistling the same tune. However deep the cuts might be, there was no danger of civil unrest: that simply wasnât the Irish way. Troika officials mingled the barbs directed at turbulent Greeks with half-ingratiating, half-contemptuous remarks about the solid, dependable Irish, who would do as they were told and ask for nothing in return. The eruption of autumn 2014, which saw huge numbers mobilizing in a struggle against water charges, took these complacent voices entirely by surprise. The emergence of a real anti-austerity movement, making use of a wide range of tactics, from electoral campaigns to civil disobedience, and putting down roots in working-class neighbourhoods all over the state, came just as talk of an Irish recovery was reaching fever-pitch. How can we explain this apparent paradox, and what impact might this sudden upsurge of protest have in the long run?\n\nThe Republic of Ireland was being held up as a model to the rest of the Eurozone at a time when its economy was still mired in recession. Over the past year, however, such talk has become more insistent, as the latest figures appear to give substance to a comforting morality tale. The Irish people sinned (âwe all partiedâ, as Brian Lenihan put it); they did their penance, swallowing the Troikaâs harsh medicine; and now the rewards are beginning to materialize. The headline figures for gdp and gnp that are cited to back up this argument require careful scrutiny, however. us corporations use Ireland as a tax haven, moving vast sums in and out of the country: in 2012, service-related exports from such companies amounted to â¬91 billion, but almost â¬40 billion of that was accounted for by transfer pricing. Insofar as there has been real growth in the Irish economy, it certainly cannot be attributed to greater compliance with Troika diktats. The Fine Gael Finance Minister Michael Noonan has repeated the mantra âIreland is not Greeceâ at every possible opportunity over the past four years. Noonanâs boorish chauvinism obscures the grain of an important truth, for the structures of the two economies are radically different. Ireland has long had one of the most open, export-reliant economies in Europe, and its efforts to attract foreign investment have borne fruit irrespective of Troika-mandated austerity. Ireland is part of the Atlantic region, sharing a language with Britain and the us, and benefits from growth in those much larger states; Greece enjoys no such advantages.\n\nIn any case, we have to look beyond questionable gdp statistics to see whether things have actually been getting better for the majority of Irish citizens. Unemployment, one of the few trustworthy benchmarks, has fallen since it reached a peak of 15 per cent in 2012: by the summer of 2015, the figure was a little under 10 per cent. Mass emigration has kept the dole queues down, with almost 475,000 people having left the country between 2008 and 2014 (the total labour force in 2014 was a little over 2 million). Ireland swapped the highest net immigration levels in Europe for its highest rate of emigration after the crash, overtaking Kosovo and the Baltic states. 17.5 per cent of Irish-born people over the age of fifteen now live abroadâthe highest proportion in the oecd, greater even than Mexicoâs; without this safety-valve, unemployment would have been close to Spanish or Greek levels. But there has been some genuine relief on this front for those who remained behind. Domestic consumption, on the other hand, actually fell in relative termsâfrom 87 per cent of the eu-15 average in 2013 to 85 per cent the following yearâwhile registering a very slight increase overall. So far, there has been a partial and tentative recovery, whose benefits have not been felt by much of the Irish population.\n\nNo bondholder left behind\n\nAll talk of ârecoveryâ must, of course, be set against the backdrop of what came before. From 2008 onwards, the Irish state was saddled with the most expensive bank bailout in European history. The infamous, now-defunct Anglo Irish Bank chalked up losses of â¬35 billion; aib was not far behind, with a â¬28-billion hole in its finances (Irish gdp in 2014 was a little over â¬180 billion). The greater part of this burden was simply passed on to Irish citizens. ecb figures released in April 2015 show that Irelandâs share of the European banking crisis was grossly disproportionate: while the average cost of bank bailouts across the Eurozone was 5 per cent of gdp, in Ireland it was 37.3 per cent. Most of that money will never be recovered, having been spent on toxic assets and bank recapitalization. Under severe pressure from the European Central Bank, and from the us Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, Dublin has continued to make regular multi-billion euro payments to foreign bondholders who invested money in Irish banks on the strength of hocus-pocus assessments by the ratings agencies (and whose identities have never been publicly disclosed). Interest payments on the national debt will rise to â¬9.2 billion in 2016âone-fifth of all tax revenueâand an additional payment of â¬5.7 billion annually will be needed to bring Ireland into line with the euâs fiscal compact when that comes into effect.\n\nTo pay for this crushing burden, deep cuts in public spending were imposed, just as unemployment was beginning to soar, in a country already graced with the second-highest levels of poverty and inequality in the developed world. From 2008 to 2014, austerity budgets took â¬30 billion out of the national economy: two-thirds of that figure came from spending cuts. Every budget was talked up by government ministers as the last of its kind before Ireland âturned the cornerâ, only to be followed by further cuts in social expenditure. The official deprivation rate shot up from less than 12 per cent in 2007 to 30.5 per cent in 2013. These headline figures cannot fully convey the impact of the recession on a society under deep strain. Behind every cut stands another group of people who rely upon benefits for much or all of their income; each âbelt-tighteningâ exercise in the public sector tightens the screws on those who cannot afford to go private.\n\nLabourâs way\n\nThe first stage of the recession was presided over by Fianna FÃ¡il, which paid the electoral price, plunging from 41 per cent of the vote in 2007 to 17 per cent four years later. The 2011 election brought huge gains for Fine Gael and Labour, who went on to form a coalition government with Enda Kenny as prime minister. Both parties had strongly criticized the bank bailout and pledged to impose losses on bondholders. Labour in particular called for a sharp break with the policies of the Cowen government, and with the programme imposed by the Troika at the end of 2010; âitâs Labourâs way or Frankfurtâs wayâ became the most memorable sound-bite of the campaign. This rhetoric melted away like snow in the sun once the election was over.\n\nThere was indeed a break with Fianna FÃ¡ilâs style of crisis management, though not the one promised by Labour: after 2011, economic policy became much more regressive. Up to that point, austerity budgets had taken proportionately more from the top layers of the income scale than from those at or near the bottom. Under Fine Gael and Labour, the trend was reversed: in successive budgets from 2012 to 2014, those on the lowest incomes came out worst. This was accompanied by victim-blaming rhetoric directed against single mothers and the unemployed, with Labour cabinet ministers showing particular gusto on this front, and gestures of national abasement that would turn the strongest stomach (Kenny has sometimes allowed European leaders to pat him literally as well as figuratively on the head). The 2015 âpost-austerityâ budget offered income gains to the top 40 per cent of householdsâthe richest 10 per cent benefited the mostâbut continued losses for the remaining 60 per cent. Kennyâs government has declared its intention to prioritize the comfortable classes when resources become available, dressing up a cut in the top rate of income tax as much-needed relief for an imaginary âsqueezed middleâ. Meanwhile, a health service starved of investment and struggling to cope after losing more than a tenth of its staff has been told to prune another quarter of a billion euros from its budget. The Labour leader and social welfare minister Joan Burton has lately begun to attend the opening of food banks in ebullient form, with no apparent sense of shame or irony.\n\nThere was thus every reason for Irelandâs squeezed majority to protest. A survey of those involved in the movement against water charges revealed some of the material desperation after years of austerity that rarely gets a public hearing:\n\nThere are days I donât eat so that I can pay the bills and my kids donât realize that we havenât got money to buy stuff.\n\nI work, my husband works and we canât give any more; I canât imagine how people who donât work will manage.\n\nI have no more money to give, Iâm on the brink.\n\nMy 65-year-old father has to use a food bank and cannot afford to heat his house. Weâve had enough.\n\nIncessant talk of recovery may have actually contributed to the explosion. Irish citizens were warned repeatedly from 2008 onwards that the state was facing an emergency without precedent in its history: rocking the boat might capsize it altogether. On being told that the worst phase of the crisis was now over, those who had borne its brunt were bound to feel more confident in demanding relief.\n\nLiquid assets\n\nIf the potential was there for an outbreak by the autumn of 2014, why did water charges come to be its focal point? A scheme to impose user fees for household water consumption had been on the books for several years: the Memorandum of Understanding agreed with the imf in 2010 included a pledge to âmove towards full cost-recovery in the provision of water servicesâ, with responsibility for water transferred from local authorities to a national utility. The Kenny government duly established Irish Water in 2013 and prepared to introduce charges by the end of the following year. From the coalitionâs point of view, the idea had several points in its favour. In the short term, it would produce a new revenue stream; further down the line, it would transform a public asset into a profit-making firm that could be sold off to private interests. Most urgently perhaps, setting up Irish Water as a formally independent company would allow them to shave a few points off the national debt, as its borrowings would not be kept on the stateâs books.\n\nThe project had the disadvantage, however, of striking a broad range of people simultaneously, instead of picking them off one by one: tenants and home-owners, private- and public-sector workers, the unemployed and those still in work. Moreover, there was a history of protest against âdouble taxationâ going back more than two decades. A previous campaign against water charges in the late 80s and early 90s, spearheaded by the radical left, had forced their abolition. Trotskyist mp Joe Higgins of the Socialist Party, often referred to as a one-man parliamentary opposition during the boom years, was first elected to the DÃ¡il in 1997 on the strength of his role in that campaign. The argument that local services should be paid for by progressive taxation, not user fees, was deployed again in 2003â04, when a struggle against bin charges that mobilized working-class communities across Dublin reached its peak with the jailing of several activists (including Higgins and other prominent leftists). The bin-tax struggle ended in defeat, but the experience was a valuable one for those at its sharp end. Having seen waivers for low-income households gradually withdrawn once the heat was off, they were unlikely to set much store by assurances from Irish Water that its charges would be capped. The privatization of waste collection in Dublin over the past decade, resulting in a chaotic service for residents and eroded working conditions for staff, supplied another useful lesson. Some of the community groups most active in the campaign against water charges had cut their teeth blockading scab drivers when the Greyhound bin company locked out its unionized workers in early 2014.\n\nIrish Water also managed to condense much of the anger at corrupt ties between political and business elites in the wake of the crash, when a company owned by the stateâs wealthiest citizen, Denis OâBrien, was awarded a contract to install water meters by the Fine Gael environment minister Phil Hogan (Hogan, a thoroughly unpleasant, bovine mediocrity, even by the standards of his party, has since moved to Brussels as Irelandâs eu commissioner). OâBrienâs leg-up in the world of business came from his acquisition of a mobile-phone licence in the late 90s: the Moriarty tribunal later found that the Fine Gael politician responsible for overseeing the tendering process, Michael Lowry, had received large cash payments from OâBrien, and condemned his âvenal abuse of officeâ. OâBrien has gone on to become the dominant player in Irelandâs private media, controlling two national radio stations and a stable of newspapers. Not content with this commanding position, the businessman has repeatedly taken legal action against journalists and politicians who presume to criticize his affairs. Siteserv, the company installing water meters, passed into OâBrienâs hands in 2012; as part of the deal, the state-owned Irish Bank Resolution Corporationâformerly Anglo Irish Bankâwrote off â¬110m of its â¬150m debt.\n\nThere were a few warning signs in the early months of 2014. Reports that Irish Water planned to spend â¬85 million on consultant fees generated the first bout of controversy about corporate greed at the start of the year, and left and independent candidates made opposition to the charges a key plank of their campaigns during the local and European elections in May (the Socialist Party added âStop the Water Taxâ to its name on the ballot paper). Local protests against the installation of water meters had already begun in a number of towns when a broad campaigning front, Right 2 Water, was launched in September, with support from Sinn FÃ©in, the socialist left and a number of trade unions. Right 2 Water built on the foundations laid by an earlier campaign against a flat tax on home-owners, which had organized some big protests in 2011â12 before the government opted to deduct the charge directly from salaries, heading off the threat of mass non-payment. The most important union backing came from mandate, which organizes retail workers, and the Irish section of unite. Both have struck a dissenting profile within the Irish Congress of Trade Unions over the past decade, speaking up against corporatist âsocial partnershipâ deals. This marks them out from the two most important ictu affiliates, siptu and impact, whose leadership teams stand very close to the Labour Party and have done their best to keep things locked down on its behalf since 2011. Right 2 Water was the first major attempt by mandate and unite to organize protests against government policy outside the ictu framework; mandateâs general secretary John Douglas and the unite organizer Brendan Ogle would become prominent spokesmen for the campaign.\n\nTake-off\n\nThe coalition of forces behind the water charges movement had real potential, but even the most optimistic left-wing activists were caught unawares when the campaign of protest suddenly took flight in the autumn of 2014. A national march in October brought more than 100,000 people onto the streets of Dublinâthe equivalent of a million-strong demonstration in Spainâas the first deadline for households to register with Irish Water approached; the organizers had been expecting 20,000 at most. It was followed by a day of action on November 1st, with simultaneous protests all over the country mobilizing well over 200,000. An October by-election in the Dublin South West constituency was dominated by the issue, as Sinn FÃ©in and the Socialist Party competed to offer the most unyielding opposition to the charges. Their candidates won 57.5 per cent of the vote between them, with the Socialist Party edging ahead on transfers; the two government parties managed a little over 17 per cent, down from 64 per cent in the last general election (Labour took the biggest hit). Alarmed by the strength of the protests, the Kenny government made a number of concessions, capping the charges until 2018 and offering a â¬100 bribe (packaged as a âconservation grantâ) to anyone who registered their details with Irish Water. The first of several deadlines was allowed to pass while ministers figured out what to do. In a poll for the Irish Times conducted at the beginning of December, less than half of households declared their intention to pay the charges, and a third big march on December 10th racked up the pressure even further.\n\nAlongside the most high-profile interventions, there was a more diffuse mobilization against the charges in working-class neighbourhoods, where local groups, often organized through social media, held protests and sought to prevent the installation of water meters by occupying the space in front of peopleâs homes. A Facebook search will reveal dozens of such groups, with some variation on âX against water chargesâ or âY says noâ as their handle, scattered throughout the larger cities and regional towns such as Dundalk and Cobh. The activists behind these community-based networks typically have no background in the traditional left milieu, and have sometimes expressed vocal suspicion of the established political parties in the campaign. One by-product of the crisis in Ireland has been intense distrust of âpoliticiansâ as suchâeven those who have long been trenchant critics of the conservative establishment. The local activist groups have also tended to work more or less autonomously from the Right 2 Water steering committee, while mobilizing in support of the national protest marches called by Right 2 Water.\n\nAn academic survey conducted at the beginning of 2015 provided the first real glimpse of opinion among supporters of the campaign. The study was based on an online questionnaire, filled out by 2,500 people, which was likely to have attracted the most highly motivated activists; if read with that qualification in mind, it offers some useful insights into the sentiment behind the protests. 45 per cent of respondents came from Dublin, with a strong bias towards working-class areas like Tallaght, Inchicore and Crumlin; 61 per cent were between 30 and 50 years of age, and just over half were in full-time employment. Asked to give their reason for protesting, the majority (60 per cent) agreed that âausterity has gone too farâ; opposition to water privatization was also frequently cited as a motivating factor. 92 per cent said that they had no intention of paying the charges. The vast majority relied on social media for information about the campaign, and expressed strong distrust of traditional media outlets. Government spokesmen may have convinced themselves that opposition to water charges stemmed exclusively from âprofessional protestersâ (also known as âthe usual suspectsâ), but the survey findings told a different story: 55 per cent had never taken part in a demonstration before. 78 per cent now believed that the most effective way to secure political change was through protesting. The survey also gave a sense of the raw anger directed towards the government parties. 35 per cent had voted for Labour in 2011, 16 per cent for Fine Gael; now, more than 80 per cent declared their intention of voting for Sinn FÃ©in, the socialist groups or left-independents. Labour in particular has paid the price for its duplicity, and was singled out for attack. The partyâs undisguised contempt for the working-class voters who rallied behind its standard in 2011 is now thoroughly reciprocated.\n\nThe Jobstown massacre\n\nPredictably, the backlash against the campaign was not long in coming. The first clumsy attempts to smear the protesters sailed wide of the target. Labourâs Joan Burton thought she could score a telling point by observing that many of those taking part in the protests had âexpensive phonesââwhich is to say, mobile phones with built-in cameras, the only kind now on sale. The comment merely unleashed a torrent of derision. Burton and her supporters found a more robust pretext in November 2014 when she visited the south Dublin area of Jobstownâthe kind of working-class district where, Burton had previously claimed, unemployment was a âlifestyle choiceâ for young peopleâin search of a photo opportunity. Residents organized a demonstration, and asked the recently elected Socialist Party mp, Paul Murphy, for his support; they blocked the ministerâs car with a sit-down protest, and one local wit threw a water balloon in the carâs general direction. With a police escort in tow, Burton was never in the slightest danger, and the fracas would barely have rated a mention in Greece or Spain. Long after the minister had left the area, riot police moved in for a needless but photogenic confrontation with some teenagers, and a solitary brick was thrown, much to the delight of the press pack.\n\nThe hysteria triggered by this minor incident would have sufficed to power a wind turbine for several days. The most surpassingly idiotic comment came from a Fine Gael mp who suggested that an âisis-type situationâ might follow if such things were allowed to happen, although he faced strong competition from a newspaper columnist who believed that the throwing of water balloons was the first step towards the Gulag. Much of the venom was directed against Paul Murphy, who was evidently the wicked ringleader behind the whole affair, and middle-class to boot: Murphyâs refusal to condemn the protesters inspired such fury in certain media pundits that many began to fear for their health. In February 2015, the GardaÃ­, Irelandâs police force, arrested Murphy and other left activists in pre-dawn raids that were spread out over a fortnight to maximize their public impact, also scooping up a batch of teenagers who had been at the protest. For those who find such things persuasive, the arrests were enough to bestow a taint of criminality on the movement, and it might have been considered prudent to let the matter rest there, but the state prosecutor followed through in September with a baffling array of charges for no fewer than 23 of those present, including false imprisonment, violent disorder and criminal damage. The trials to come will generate more heat and sharply polarize opinion, with unpredictable consequences for a government that may come to wish the relevant files had been left to gather dust.\n\nThe protest campaign has shone an unflattering light on the GardaÃ­, a force that had hitherto managed to cling on to an unwarranted reputation for benign, consensual policing. The tactics it used in support of Shellâs gas project in Mayo might have been so egregious that a Dublin-based human-rights organization felt obliged to send observers and compile a report of the kind usually reserved for countries like Mexico or Nigeria. But in that case, the victims belonged to an isolated rural community and could be stigmatized as thugs and terrorists with the help of a compliant media. Deploying the same methods right across the country poses a serious problem for the forceâs standing. A slow-burning corruption scandal has added to the trouble: so far the Garda commissioner and a Fine Gael justice minister have had to resign after trying to smear police whistle-blowers and a batch of left-wing and independent mps who publicized their allegations. By Mediterranean standards (or those of Londonâs Met) this may seem like small-time crookery, but having managed to remain âabove politicsâ for so long, the GardaÃ­ appear genuinely bewildered at finding themselves under scrutiny. Candidates for senior positions in the force now report being quizzed about âleft-wing political extremismâ during interviews. If the state ramps up its effort to break the water-charges movement, things will only get worse for its enforcers on the ground.\n\nRight 2 Power?\n\nThe focus then shifted for several months to tactical differences within Right 2 Water. Sinn FÃ©in and the trade unions were reluctant to call explicitly for non-payment of the charges; the radical left was much less inhibited, as were many of the local campaign groups. The question of non-payment was the main dividing line between Sinn FÃ©in and the Socialist Party in the Dublin South West by-election, and contributed greatly to Sinn FÃ©inâs surprising defeat in one of its established strongholds. In early 2015, some of the trade-union officials involved in the campaign began pushing heavily for a shift towards the electoral stage. Their goal was to put forward a slate of candidates in the upcoming general election, and there was some rather breathless talk of Irelandâs first left-wing government taking power on the back of the protests. Right 2 Water organized a conference of invited delegates in June 2015 to discuss a draft programme that reached beyond the water question to cover housing, employment, health care, education and parliamentary reform.\n\nThis electoral turn was inspired by the dramatic political shifts evident since the last general election. In the 2014 European poll, support for Sinn FÃ©in, independents and two small left parties reached 42.6 per cent, while the combined score for Fine Gael, Fianna FÃ¡il and Labour dipped below 50 per centâunthinkable just a few years ago. Labourâs vote has collapsed; Fianna FÃ¡il has recovered some of the ground lost in 2011, but is still a shadow of the party it once was. A loosely defined âanti-establishmentâ bloc, comprised of Sinn FÃ©in, the radical left and independents of varying hue, has been consistently backed by 40â50 per cent of the electorate in polls. But when that bloc is broken down into its component parts, things become much more complicated. Sinn FÃ©in has been the main beneficiary of Labourâs collapse, standing on a clear anti-austerity platform, but is strongly distrusted by the socialist groups, and with good cause: best described as a left-nationalist party which is more nationalist than left, Sinn FÃ©in is perfectly capable of shifting towards the centre ground if and when it deems that expedient. For its part, the radical left has thus far been unable to overcome internal divisions so that it can present a coherent platformâalthough a joint slate for the next general election has recently been announced.\n\nAs for the independent mps, when we exclude so-called âgene-poolâ independents (defectors from Fianna FÃ¡il or Fine Gael), we can find a very broad range of progressive opinion, from quasi-Marxist to vaguely social-democratic. The âindependentâ brand is popular with the electorate, reflecting a widespread aversion to conventional politics, and the Irish voting system gives non-party candidates plenty of room to win seats (there is no minimum national threshold to enter parliament, and each constituency has several seats in play). But this fragmentation of dissent will ultimately make it harder to displace the conservative parties. Overall, Irish politics increasingly corresponds to a pattern identified by Peter Mair in one of his final essays, when he spoke of âa growing divide in European party systems between parties which claim to represent, but donât deliver, and those which deliver, but are no longer seen to representâ.\n\nThe question of political alliances was not addressed directly by Right 2 Waterâs proposal; indeed, the whole electoral strategy underpinning it remains quite nebulous. For those who insisted that a âprogressive governmentâ was almost within reach, the opinion polls had a clear message: even if Sinn FÃ©in, the hard-left groups and progressive independents did better than expected, and could agree on a programme, they would still need support from one of the pro-Troika parties to put together a majority in parliament. Many on the radical left feared that this was precisely what the Right 2 Water leadership had in mind, and a joint statement argued for clarity on this point, ruling out any coalition with Fine Gael, Fianna FÃ¡il or Labour. The radicals also called for an organized boycott of the water charges, with no let-up in campaigning this side of the general election, and warned that any break with austerity policies would bring a left government into direct conflict with the eu: the statement of principles should therefore include the willingness to break Eurozone rules if necessary, and keep unilateral debt cancellation on the table. Steps were taken to organize a Non-Payment Network that would bring together advocates of a boycott, although the organizers stressed that they were not trying to displace Right 2 Water.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus while these debates played themselves out, with no major demonstrations called by Right 2 Water for several months, the campaign was given a boost by two major setbacks for the governmentâs strategy in July 2015. After months of stalling, Irish Water finally released its own carefully massaged figures, and was forced to admit that well over 50 per cent of households had still not paid the charges. Politicians and newspaper columnists who had depicted the ârefuseniksâ as a tiny, unrepresentative minority were left flummoxed, and those calling for non-payment as a central tactic found their hand strengthened. A second blow then came from an unlikely source, Eurostat, which batted away the governmentâs case for defining Irish Water as a private entity and insisted that its borrowings would have to be counted towards the national debt. At a stroke, this punctured one of the main arguments for imposing water charges in the first place. It may have been the alleged âconservation grantâ that did the most damage: no company on the receiving end of such largesse could truly be considered independent. Kenny, Burton and their allies donât mind appearing callous, but ham-fisted incompetence is a different matter. Another big Right 2 Water march at the end of the summer showed that there had been no decline in mobilization, for all the claims by government spokesmen that the movement was now on its last legs.\n\nThis leaves the ruling coalition in a fix, with an election due within months. They might well prefer to cancel the whole experiment and hope that the energy of the last year fizzles out with the main irritant removed. But this would bring its own problems, as Gene Kerrigan, the only journalist to have consistently supported the movement, recently noted: âScrapping Irish Water before the election would be disastrous. They would appear weak, uncertain and panickyâwhen they most need to seem strong and authoritative.â The campaigners, on the other hand, will need to prepare for a horizon that stretches well past the upcoming vote, which is likely to deliver a Fine GaelâFianna FÃ¡il coalition as the most dependable pro-Troika arrangement. The movement against water charges has already given the lie to half-baked notions of the Irish people as inherently conservative or apathetic. Its next moves will be crucial for the future of Irish politics.",

In one of the articles, he covers his visit to LinkedIn headquarters in Mountain View where he sat down with company engineers and discussed LinkedIn's contribution to the open source community. According to Alex Vauthey, LinkedIn has three key dimensions: the transformation of the self, the company, and the world. Open source is applied to accomplish all three of these dimensions. Infrastructure that has been released as open source by LinkedIn, are, for example: Kafka, Helix, and Voldemort.

Marlow points out that Academia.edu is \"a key player in the movement toward open access scientific publishing.\" One of the two key properties of open science, he says, could be the last obstacle towards open access science. He refers to the need for a new peer review system and claims that if governments and universities push for it, the open access movement will continue to grow.

  "latent_21859": "Georgia Congressman Jack Kingston wants children to learn that there is no such thing as a free lunch.\n\nIn his remarks to the Jackson County Republican Party, the Republican congressman proposed that low-income children should earn their subsidized meals by sweeping the cafeteria floor.\n\nâOn the Agriculture Committee we have jurisdiction over the school lunch,â Kingston (who chaired the House Appropriations subcommittee from 2011 to 2012 that oversees agriculture funding, including the school lunch and school breakfast programs) told party activists. âThe school lunch program has a 16% error rate. The school lunch program is very expensive. Of course it looks good compared to the school breakfast program that has a 25% error rate.â\n\nâBut one of the things Iâve talked to the Secretary of Agriculture about: âWhy donât you, you know, have the kids pay a dime, pay a nickel to instill in them that there is, in fact, no such thing as a free lunch. Or maybe sweep the floor in the cafeteria.ââ\n\nKingston, who is no longer on the Agriculture Committee or the Appropriations Agriculture subcommittee, suggested that the federal school lunch program should not be giving free handouts to children of impoverished families.\n\nâI understand that that would be an administrative problem, and I understand that it would probably lose you money. But think what we would gain as a society in getting people â getting the myth out of their head that there is such a thing as a free lunch,â he said.\n\nChildren from families with incomes at or below 130% of the federal poverty line are eligible for free lunches. Students from families with incomes between 130% and 185% of the poverty level can receive lunches at reduced prices. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 18.9 million students receive free lunches and another 2.6 million receive reduced fee lunches.\n\nAs the hunger crisis in the nation grows, with 83% of polled cities reporting an increasing demand for food assistance in 2013, another study found that three-quarters of U.S. teachers say their students regularly show up to school hungry. The study also shows that free-and reduced-price breakfast programs are hugely under-enrolled, with only half of children eligible for free breakfasts actually receiving them.\n\nLast year, Kingston voted for a bill that aimed to kick 280,000 low-income students off the Free School Lunch and Breakfast Program.\n\nHis office emphasized Kingstonâs own upbringing in a statement.\n\nâIt is sad that trying to have a productive conversation about instilling a strong work ethic in the next generation of Americans so quickly devolves into the usual name-calling partisan hysteria,â Kingstonâs communications director, Chris Crawford, said. âHaving worked from a young age himself, Congressman Kingston understands the value of hard work and the important role it plays in shaping young people.â\n\nKingston is seeking his partyâs nomination for Georgiaâs Senate race next year to replace retiring Senator Saxby Chambliss.",
  "latent_22059": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan has won the highly contentious battle for the stateâs Senate seat, unseating Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte by a razor-thin margin. With Republicans having secured control of the chamber early Wednesday morning, Hassanâs election will not affect the balance of power in the Senate.\n\nThe New Hampshire race was too close to call for most of Tuesday night, with the gap between the candidates narrowing to less than 1,500 votes. Hassan declared victory Wednesday morning, but the results were not made official until later in the afternoon. Ayotte conceded the race shortly after the official results were announced.\n\nWith two of the stateâs most prominent political figures on the ballot, the New Hampshire contest was one of the closest Senate contests of the year. Both candidates entered Election Day in a virtual dead heat. Their debates were often fierce and Hassan and Ayotte both moved to the center in an effort to gather votes from the other party. The race was the second-most expensive Senate contest this cycle, with more than $120 million dollars pouring into the state.\n\nAyotteâs fight to protect her seat was complicated by the rise of Donald Trump. Hassan frequently took aim at Ayotteâs support of the Republican presidential nominee. During a debate last month between the two candidates, Ayotte awkwardly said the Republican presidential nominee âabsolutelyâ would be a good role model for children. Hassan lost no time in attacking her opponent, and Ayotte quickly walked back her comments, saying she misspoke during the debate. Ayotte completely withdrew her support for the nominee after video surfaced of Trump bragging about touching women without their consent, a move that opened the senator up to criticism from her fellow conservatives. The tight contest in New Hampshire extended to the presidential race, with Clinton leading by a slim one-point margin after all precincts had reported.\n\nHassan has touted her ability to work across the aisle during her time in the governorâs mansion, noting that she engaged Republicans to negotiate the stateâs budget, ending up with a $62 million surplus. But Hassanâs call for the United States to temporarily halt accepting Syrian refugeesâsheâs the only Democratic governor to do soâhas put her in hot water with Democrats. (Hassan has not clarified whether she still supports a temporary ban.) In the campaignâs final weeks, Hassan played up her ties with Hillary Clinton in an effort to shore up her support among left-leaning voters.\n\nIn a recent interview with Mother Jones, Hassan said she hopes to secure emergency funding to address the stateâs opioid crisis and reduce the influence of special interests on Capitol Hill.\n\nâWashington has been captured by corporate special interests like the Koch brothers who stack the deck for themselves and against the middle class,â she said. âIâm running for Senate to change that.â\n\nHassan will join three other Democratic womenâRep. Tammy Duckworth (Ill.), California Attorney General Kamala Harris, and former Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Mastoâas first-term senators in 2017.",
  "latent_22156": "Providing an API for extensible-effects and monad transformers\n\nI was recently working on a small little project - a client API for the ListenBrainz project. Most of the details arenât particularly interesting - itâs just a HTTP client library to a REST-like API with JSON. For the implementation, I let Servant and aeson do most of the heavy lifting, but I got stuck when considering what final API to give to my users.\n\nObviously, interacting with ListenBrainz requires some sort of IO so whatever API I will be offering has to live within some sort of monad. Currently, there are three major options:\n\nSo, which do we choose? Evaluating the options, I have some concerns.\n\nFor option one, we impose pain on all our users who want to use a different monad stack. Itâs unlikely that your application is going to be written solely to query ListenBrainz, which means client code becomes littered with lift . You may write that off as syntactic, but there is another problem - we have committed to an interpretation strategy. Rather than describing API calls, my library now skips directly to prescribing how to run API calls. However, itâs entirely possible that you want to intercept these calls - maybe introducing a caching layer or additional logging. Your only option is to duplicate my API into your own project and wrap each function call and then change your program to use your API rather than mine. Essentially, the program itself is no longer a first class value that you can transform.\n\nExtensible effects gives us a solution to both of the above. The use of the Member type class automatically reshuffles effects so that multiple effects can be combined without syntatic overhead, and we only commit to an interpretation strategy when we actually run the program. Eff is essentially a free monad, which captures the syntax tree of effects, rather than the result of their execution.\n\nSounds good, but extensible effects come with (at least) two problems that make me hesistant: they are experimental and esoteric, and itâs unclear that they are performant. By using only extensible effects, I am forcing an extensible effects framework on my users, and Iâd rather not dictate that. Of course, extensible effects can be composed with traditional monad transformers, but Iâve still imposed an unnecessary burden on my users.\n\nSo, what do we do? Well, as Old El Paso has taught us: why donât we have both?\n\nItâs trivial to actually support both a monad transformer stack and extensible effects by using an mtl type class. As I argue in Monad transformers, free monads, mtl, laws and a new approach, I think the best pattern for an mtl class is to be a monad homomorphism from a program description, and often a free monad is a fine choice to lift:\n\nBut what about f ? As observed earlier, extensible effects are basically free monads, so we can actually share the same implementation. For freer-effects , we might describe the ListenBrainz API with a GADT such as:\n\nHowever, this isnât a functor - itâs just a normal data type. In order for Free f a to actually be a monad, we need f to be a functor. We could rewrite ListenBrainzAPICall into a functor, but itâs even easier to just fabricate a functor for free - and thatâs exactly what Coyoneda will do. Thus our mtl type class becomes:\n\nWe can now provide an implementation in terms of a monad transformer:\n\nor extensible effects:\n\nor maybe directly to a free monad for later inspection:\n\nFor the actual implementation of performing the API call, I work with a concrete monad transformer stack:\n\nwhich both my extensible effects ârunâ function calls, or the go function in the iterM call for ListenBrainzT âs MonadListenBrainz instance.\n\nIn conclusion, Iâm able to offer my users a choice of either:\n\na traditional monad transformer approach, which doesnât commit to a particular intepretation strategy by using an mtl type class\n\ntype class extensible effects\n\nAll without extra syntatic burden, a complicated type class, or duplicating the implementation.\n\nYou can see the final implementation of listenbrainz-client here.\n\nBonus - what about the ReaderT pattern?\n\nThe ReaderT design pattern has been mentioned recently, so where does this fit in? There are two options if we wanted to follow this pattern:\n\nWe require a HTTP Manager in our environment, and commit to using this. This has all the problems of providing a concrete monad transformer stack - we are committing to an interpretation.\n\nin our environment, and commit to using this. This has all the problems of providing a concrete monad transformer stack - we are committing to an interpretation. We require a family of functions that explain how to perform each API call. This kind of like a van Laarhoven free monad, or really just explicit dictionary passing. I donât see this really gaining much on abstracting with type classes.\n\nI donât feel like the ReaderT design pattern offers anything that isnât already dealt with above.\n\nYou can contact me via email at ollie@ocharles.org.uk or tweet to me @acid2.

  "latent_22236": "There are a few explanations for this, from a general disgruntlement with excessive Hollywood reboots to the whole Ghostbusters aspect being a feeble cover for what is basically an enraged anti-feminism backlash, something which is a depressing inevitability when women attempt to do anything, in any context, ever. But some people just seem outraged that they dare to âtamperâ with their beloved childhood favourite, in this case Ghostbusters.\n\nAdmittedly, such complaints are often legitimate; to have something that you feel very fondly towards, and to see it be manipulated or changed in often-cynically-motivated ways is very irksome. If they painted âI LOVE TRUMPâ on the Mona Lisaâs forehead to attract a new demographic, nobody would see that as an improvement. But often, the attempted remake/reboot fades from public consciousness without incident. Barely anyone can remember the Total Recall remake (ironically).\n\nHowever, thereâs often a genuine anger over well-known childrenâs entertainments being adapted, expanded or altered in ways that donât meet the approval of the existing fans. I donât deny Iâm susceptible to this too, Iâve based an entire article on one particular grievance . But why do some feel so strongly that they accuse something of â ruining their childhood â?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Attempts to make childhood favourites more modern and realistic can be quite disturbing, in fairness Photograph: Lula Carvalho/AP\n\nObviously, this is an exaggeration. A modern film, no matter how bad, cannot retroactively ruin a childhood, not unless it somehow travels back in time and gets your parents hooked on class-A narcotics (although some would argue that The Phantom Menace did exactly that). Nonetheless, there are several psychological quirks that would mean people get disproportionately angry and defensive about their childhood entertainments and are quick to use hyperbole.\n\nFor one, thereâs a thing called the â reminiscence bump â, where memories obtained during childhood and early adulthood are actually more vivid and easier to recall than others. It makes sense; our brains have developed enough to actually form memories effectively , but everything is still mostly new and vivid to us as weâve not much prior experience, and we are still developing so the things we encounter will have more impact. The things we were drawn towards and enjoyed as children would therefore have a lasting impact, more so than many other things we encounter.\n\nThis doesnât quite explain the ridiculous zeal with which people (mostly men, if weâre honest) often react to any attempt to meddle with their treasured childhood viewing material. However, there are a few potential causes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Why is the CGI Jar Jar Binks clearly defined and Liam Neeson somewhat blurry in this picture? Itâs as if even a still image of an actor wants to distance itself from this character. Photograph: Allstar/LUCASFILM\n\nvery well. The shows and films we liked as kids are, typically, self-contained. Nobody is making them anymore, so we can know âallâ about them. Seeing every episode and iteration, having all the merchandise, that is a relatively simple way of achieving a goal. It can give us a sense of control , especially if we lack the ability to determine events in most other areas of our lives. Then someone who you donât know, who didnât consult you, comes along and adds new stuff, or reboots the whole thing? It may seem churlish or utterly inconsequential, but if youâre invested in your Ghostbusters fandom, then someone coming along and making new stuff can effectively lower your status , reduce your sense of control, add uncertainty that you canât address, all of which are things our brains donât deal with\n\nOn top of this, the prominence in our memories of our childhood entertainment may mean they are a disproportionately large aspect of our identity. So, any attempt at updating or change could, in a weird way, be perceived as an attack on our identity. And people tend to react very negatively to such things\n\nAppeals to logic often donât work. Surely the fans, many argue, will be happy that the thing they love is getting a new lease of life and the opportunity to gain a whole new audience of admirers? This makes logical sense, but overlooks some of the more dubious elements of the human psyche. Namely, scarcity and exclusivity is attractive , so any attempt to make your favourite thing more accessible to the masses effectively devalues it, and therefore the fans will be upset. For examples, see the reaction from current Twitter users to any attempt by Twitter to attract new ones\n\nIt may be that only a minority group of die-hard fans have these extreme reactions to attempts to reboot or expand an existing property or franchise, but weâre all online now, so thatâs all it takes before others will join in with the outrage\n\nIn summary, there are many underlying psychological processes that conspire to make people overreact in weird ways to something that should be innocuous. Or, to put it another way, thereâs something strange, and it donât look good.",

I've always been fascinated by it ever since Ad Finem placed second at Boston. You used to play with them, and it's a lot like NA Dota, where players depart and return to the same roster. So, I'm interested about the Greek scene, it's almost like you are always try to make a Greek version of Alliance, a Greek-only team. Why?\n\nIt's because of the language barrier. If you talk in your native tongue, you are able to communicate faster. And you kind of have the same mindset, if you are, say, all Greeks or all Swedes.\n\nHowever, this time you were on an international roster. How was that different?

At first it was kind of awkward to communicate our ideas but it's kind of OK now.\n\nI am curious what the scene in Greek Dota 2 is like. If you're familiar with NA Dota 2, everyone flames each other. Do you have friendly rivalries, like, between you and ThuG, for example?\n\nI don't think I have a rivalry with ThuG.

You said being on an all-Greek team means that everyone has the same thoughts and opinions but is there more value in having differences in those aspects?\n\nI don't think I learned a lot from them being different nationalities, it was more like them being good players.\n\nWho is the most outspoken player on HellRaisers?\n\nProbably j4 or 33. j4 talks the most.\n\nWhat do you plan to do after TI? Stay with your current team or go back to Greek Dota? Leave Europe entirely?\n\nI think the mousesports guys will stick together, so we'll probably stick together as well, there will likely be no changes. I plan to also go on vacation for one week, because I haven't taken a break yet. Our schedule was busy, playing qualifiers and all.\n\nWhere do you plan to go?\n\nTo some Greek island probably.\n\nYou got a new carry player [Swiftending] just before the TI open qualifiers but you managed to win anyway. Do you think your team has a lot of potential and room for improvement going forward?\n\nYes, I think so. We have not found our identity yet. We have to play a lot and talk a lot with Swift, basically. We can improve a lot as a team.\n\nObviously, Valve announced the major / minor system and there are now 22 events -- 11 minors, 11 majors. A lot of them are three days apart at times. Do you think you will compete in all the qualifiers, no matter how many games per day it will take?\n\nYes, we will compete in every single qualifier. It's really good practice. Playing with your team is always better. And I think the system is really good, because the competition will be a lot higher and that's really good for players.\n\nWhen Dota 2 came out, every Greek, including me, thought the game sucked.\n\nAs a player that's not that well known until now, is there anything you like to say? When did you start Dota 2?\n\nBasically I've been playing since the first grade of mid school, so I've been playing for a lot of time, like 12 years.\n\nWhen Dota 2 came out, every Greek, including me, thought the game sucked. It was kind of new, it didn't have all the heroes, we didn't have all the items, Dota 1 was still better at that time. I started playing Dota 2 one year later, around TI2 and I played some League between Dota 1 and Dota 2.\n\nDo you regret not trying to qualify for TI 2011?\n\nWell, I was playing but our team was not that good back then so we couldn't qualify.\n\nDid you always want to become a professional player, or is that something you discovered after a few years?\n\nWhen I was 12, I was watching and playing some StarCraft 1. I was watching this Flash guy, and he became my inspiration. I wanted to become player when I was that young, so it was the only road after that.\n\nFlash became my inspiration.\n\nSince you remember those days, StarCraft: Remastered is coming out soon. Do you plan to play it on the side.\n\nYeah, I like the game, of course I will play it!\n\nHave you met Day9 yet, just nerding out about BroodWar a bit?\n\nI haven't met him but I'm a big fan.\n\nDo you ever feel like playing Chen after playing BroodWar?\n\nI used to play Chen in Dota 1, but I don't know what happened, I don't like playing Chen now. *laughs*\n\nDo you like playing Dota more than StarCraft?\n\nYes.\n\nIs it the aspect of playing a team game vs 1v1?\n\nBasically that. I still like StarCraft but I prefer team games. They are more dynamic, I like communicating with my team-mates, sharing my experience with them. I enjoy being around people.\n\nThe International coverage hub\n\nMore interviews from TI7:",
  "latent_22298": "Several weeks have passed since the world received Edward Snowdenâs revelations of the massive scope of the U.S. governmentâs invasion of privacy by means of collecting and storing millions of personsâ emails and website visits, as well as information about their telephone calls. The public appears fairly equally divided about whether these revelations constitute a public service or a treasonous act. The U.S. government has revoked Snowdenâs passport and seeks to prosecute him for theft of public property and violations of the Espionage Act, but at present he remains out of the governmentâs reach at the Moscow airport. To my knowledge, no demonstrations in the streets have occurred to express Americansâ outrage with the governmentâs actions in secretly scooping up, without a warrant or a showing of probable cause, vast quantities of information about them and their personal affairs.\n\nThe absence of a great outpouring of opposition amounts to a very bad sign. It indicates that few people regard the governmentâs actions as egregious or as portending great harm to the general public. I strongly believe that they are both, and unless many more Americans rouse themselves to oppose these invasions of privacy and to demand that they be terminated, the people will have stood by quietly while the state captured all the ground it needs to reduce them to utter subservience to their political masters.\n\nWe have now reached a condition in which state authorities know an immense amount about the personal lives of virtually everyone in the United States and many foreigners, as well. Do people suppose that this access to personal information will be used only for the pursuit of terrorists? Anyone who has looked even superficially into previous government information-collection programs knows better. State authorities will, at minimum, employ the communications data and other personal information now at their fingertips to pursue various sorts of criminals, especially persons suspected of tax evasion. Moreover, they will almost certainly use the information for partisan political purposes. These gratuitous extensions of the use of information they ought never to have collected in the first placeâinformation that mocks the Fourth Amendmentâs guarantees in the most serious way imaginableâwill, however, almost certainly be only the beginnings of the stateâs use of the new power it now holds over the general public.\n\nHow many individuals cannot be blackmailed by someone who knows everything about their personal affairs, much less by someone who also controls enormous surveillance agencies, police forces, and the courts? With the information now in their hands, state authorities will be well-nigh certain to augment their powers by using this information to deter or cripple political opponents, to coerce unwilling cooperation (including false testimony) by others, and to silence anyone who might be tempted to criticize or expose their misfeasance and malfeasance. To suppose that American state officials will not act in these ways is naÃ¯ve in the extreme. These politicians are not angels; on the contrary. And their newly acquired treasure trove of information places a resource of heretofore unimagined power in their hands. To trust that they will not massively abuse their control over this resource flies in the face of everything we know about the kind of people they are.\n\nPerhaps much stronger expressions of public outrage will be made before long. I devoutly hope so, because the longer the government gets away with this horrendous criminal action, the greater the chance that it will solidify its new position vis-Ã -vis the citizens, in part by exploiting the potential I have just described, so that a rollback of these invasive programs will become virtually impossible. If the American people have an ounce of capacity for righteous indignation left in them, they must do everything they canâand do it quicklyâto make clear that they will not stand for being treated worse than Big Brotherâs pathetic victims in Orwellâs Nineteen Eighty-Four.\n\nTags: Politics, Power, Privacy, Surveillance, The State, Totalitarianism",

  "latent_22541": "There is a great swell of people pushing the idea of mixed-race people are âmore fitâ or âstrongerâ or âhealthierâ. The language they use for this new mixed race population is strangely belligerent, calling them âstrongerâ and âsuperiorâ. It seems to be a kind of mixed-race supremacism â distinct from the âfolkâ focus of racial nationalist groups â but with very little effort to find real data for their claims.\n\n1. Outbreeding and Inbreeding Depression\n\nOne thing that the public knows about is âinbreeding depressionâ, when people too genetically similar breed, they are more likely to produce multiple copies of recessive alleles that wouldnât normally be expressed.\n\nThese multiple copies tend to harmful. This is because they only get expressed in inbreeding situations, like cousin marriages, and so were never expressed enough in history to be acted upon by evolution and have the harmful ones culled by the process of natural selection.\n\nAnd the result is that genes that would never âpass the test of evolutionâ end up getting expressed in situations like cousin marriages. This is why dominant alleles tend to be more beneficial, because they had to pass the âtest of evolutionâ, and dominant alleles that were harmful died off. But harmful recessive alleles can stick around, hanging in the background, because they rarely ever get expressed.\n\nPreventing inbreeding depression is the only real mechanism by which race-mixing COULD be beneficial in a semi-objective sense by preventing the expression of genes that couldnât pass the test of evolution.\n\nAnother line I hear, which is weird, is that mixed-race people have all of the âbestâ genes from each race. Of course why each offspring doesnât get the âbestâ genes from each parent regardless of race is something they donât really think about, but of course this is dopey, as mitosis and recombination provides no mechanism by which the âbestâ genes could be âpickedâ.\n\nWhat is less known about, likely for political reasons, is outbreeding depression. There are multiple senses in which outbreeding depression exists. The one we are interested in is the breakdown of âco-adaptive gene complexesâ.\n\nGenes in the genome interact with each other. And so which gene variants you have is not just an additive thing.\n\nFor example, among Europeans, gene X might be beneficial, but among Africans, because of the way it interacts with some of the gene variants they have, it might be harmful.\n\nIâm not claiming one effect is, on average, bigger or smaller. Iâm simply saying that there exists a theoretical mechanism for negative effects of excessive inbreeding and outbreeding. But, for reasons we can speculate, the inbreeding depression is the only mechanism that has made it into public awareness.\n\nAnd since there is a mechanism for both, we have to look at the evidence of real-world effects beyond proposed mechanisms.\n\n2. Mixed race life expectancy\n\nHispanics in the United States\n\nNow if I were going to argue for the benefits of race-mixing, I would point to the life expectancy of hispanics in the United States. âLatinosâ in the United States have a life expectancy of 82.8 years, whereas whites only have a life expectancy of 78.9 years, blacks only 74.6, while âAsiansâ are at 86.5 years.\n\nUnfortunately I havenât been able to find any good studies specifically trying to find the life expectancy of mixed-race people. However, I did find the genetic admixtures of hispanics in several states, and I already had the life expectancies of hispanics in those states:\n\nEuropean Mesoamerican African Life Expectancy California 47.325 40.58 12.095 83.2 Nevada 33.95 58.87 8.19 84.7 Florida 71.98 19.91 8.12 83.1 New Jersey 84.49 9.14 6.38 84.7 Pennsylvania 82.88 0.23 17 85.3 Virginia 63.83 21.27 14.9 88.3\n\nNow the data is limited, to test the race-mixing benefit hypothesis, I compared how big the biggest genetic component of hispanics was in each state to their life expectancy.\n\nAnd as it turned out, the correlation between genetic homogeneity and life expectancy was 0.13. A small correlation based on only 6 data points, sure, but the onus isnât on me to âproveâ thereâs no benefit to race-mixing. At first glance, it looks like hispanics would be a good argument for race-mixing, but then a problem emerges when the more homogeneous hispanic populations actually live longer.\n\nAnother problem is that we donât know the genetic propensities to longevity of pure-blooded mesoamericans. Just food for thought: the mid-point between whites and asians in the US is 82.7, so if thereâs no inbreeding or outbreeding depression, we would expect white-asian hybrids to live on average 82.7 years. Now hispanics have a lot more white than mesoamerican admixture, so the mesoamericans would have to be even more genetically predisposed to longevity than the asians, or perhaps itâs a mixture of mesoamerican genetics with hispanics having healthier habits.\n\nOr perhaps thereâs no genetic effect at all, and itâs all down to behavior, as the long lives of Pennsylvania and New Jersey hispanics suggest.\n\nBrazil\n\nI found one study on the life expextancies of whites, blacks and mixed people in Brazil . The life expectancies at birth were as follows:\n\nWhite Males: 71.1 years\n\nMixed Males: 71.08 years\n\nBlack Males: 70.11 years\n\nWhite Females: 77.54 years\n\nMixed Females: 78.8 years\n\nBlack Females: 76.32 years\n\nOkay, so on average mixed females live 1.26 years longer than white females. On average, in this studyâs sample, mixed people lived 0.72 years longer. Of course the first problem is the indigenous admixture; what is the life expectancy of pure-blooded native Brazilians? If itâs longer, we would expect mixed people to live longer than white people without any âhybrid vigorâ effects â just from the effects of native admixture.\n\nThe life expectancies of whites, blacks and mixed people in Brazil is beautifully illustrated in this picture:\n\nThis is a fantastic graph that puts the life expectancies of each group in Brazil in its proper perspective.\n\nScotland\n\nStrangely enough, one of the few studies on the life expectancy mixed race populations I have found came from Scotland. A paper published in the British Medical Journal looked at the life expectancies of various groups in Scotland from May 2001 to April 2004. In it the authors found that racially mixed people in Scotland lived shorter lives than any other group:\n\nNow on this I am an environmentalist â of course genetic equality is impossible, but I donât think much of the gap between the life expectancies of the English and the Scottish is down to genetics. Nor do I think the shorter lives of mixed peoples is down to genetics. Itâs just one piece of evidence against the idea of mixed-race hybrid vigor.\n\n3. Mixed IQ\n\nSo one way to see if there is hybrid vigor is to look at IQ. IQ is one of the best predictors of life outcomes, and is strongly associated with subjective perceptions of âintelligenceâ and the relation between IQ and perceived intelligence increases over time. Some people like to cry about IQ, and even though theyâre wrong there is a large market of people who want to dismiss IQ.\n\nI have two articles, here and here, which shows overwhelming intermediacy of the IQs of mixed-race populations.\n\nOf the 10 admixture studies I found, 9 showed the racially mixed group intermediate between the two races they were a mix of. Even the Tizard study, which showed blacks outperforming whites, still had mulattoes scoring in between the two groups. 1 study from Elise Moore showed blacks outperforming mulattoes. One of the admixture studies was using NAEP data.\n\nOf 5 analyses of Latin American admixture and standardized test scores for the country or district within a country, 3 of which I did, all five of them showed that the more European a population was, the higher they scored â with the most amerindian populations scoring the lowest, and the populations in between scoring, on average, in between.\n\nI also found 4 skin color studies, and in all 4 of them people with intermediate skin color had intermediate IQ. (INB4 âI stopped reading when he mentioned skin colorâ as an excuse to dismiss data)\n\nI also found from Audrey Shueyâs 1966 book âThe Testing of Negro Intelligenceâ 6 studies that compared blacks of at least 3 levels of African admixture. Of those 6 studies, 4 showed intermediately African blacks scoring intermediate between the more African and less African, 1 showed the darker blacks scoring higher than the lighter blacks, and 1 had ambiguous results.\n\nAll of this points to an overwhelming case that mixed-race people score intermediate between the two races they are composed of on average; that there doesnât appear to be any beneficial or detrimental effect of race-mixing on IQ beyond what you would expect from simple gene combination.\n\n4. Hispanic Crime\n\nCity Data\n\nUnfortunately there isnât good federal level on criminality for hispanics. However, there are some cities which treat hispanic as a separate category, and we can look at those numbers from Rubenstein 2016:\n\nAnd so the city data shows hispanics being more violent than their racially homogeneous white counterparts. They are less violent than blacks, but blacks in the US are fairly admixed themselves, but that doesnât prove anything about mixed-race people being better anyway.\n\nFederal Incarceration by Race\n\nWe can also look at federal incarceration statistics from 2001, 2013, 2014 and 2015 and see that hispanics are much more likely to be in prison than whites.\n\nIncarceration of course is going to be weighted by the severity of the crime â but I see this as a feature, not a bug.\n\n5. Mixed Marriages\n\nMixed-race couples in Canada are 2.94 times as likely to have mutual assault than white couples, and 2.34 times as likely as non-white couples.\n\nNow one thing to consider is that in this study, the mixed marriages actually had more schooling and a higher socioeconomic status than the same-race marriages.\n\nIn addition, according to data from the CDC, being interracial is the second highest thing that increases the risk of a marriage in ending in divorce, second only to one of the partners having an anxiety disorder:\n\nCriteria Increased risk of divorce Anxiety Disorder 35.5% Interracial 32.3% Cohabitation before marriage 29.0% High School Dropout 16.7% Low Religiosity 12.9%\n\nSo if you want your marriage to fail, one of the best things you could do is marry someone of another race.\n\nThis is just my speculation, but I imagine that this is due to xenophilic infatuation and lust vs. real personality similarity. I.e. itâs not because youâre truly in love with her, itâs because sheâs a latina and looks âexoticâ or some such nonsense.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere doesnât appear to be any âhybrid vigorâ from different human races mixing. Or if there is, itâs offset by some âoutbreeding depressionâ. I think this is all nonsense and in reality very little is going on other than the populations mixing producing intermediate results.\n\nThe closest thing to evidence for hybrid vigor is hispanics in the US; and that sample falls apart upon closer inspection.\n\nIn addition to having no significant health benefits (as proxied in aggregate by life expectancy) or intelligence benefits, mixed marriages are more likely to fail. Maybe youâre different, maybe you truly have a deep connection with your other-race spouse â but you ignore the general data on this at your own peril. And given how probability curves work, even if you donât get a divorce, itâs more likely to be in the âless satisfyingâ end of how marriages go compared to a monoracial marriage.\n\nThere are certainly no moral or logical grounds on which race-mixing should be promoted; at most it should neither be promoted nor opposed.",
  "latent_22654": "Why Angular 2/4 Is Too Little, Too Late\n\nChris Cordle Blocked Unblock Follow Following Jun 28, 2017\n\nTL;DR â AngularJS was a decent idea in 2012 but in 2017, the JS ecosystem has surged past Angular in maturity, flexibility, and productivity. Thanks to webpack, NPM on the front-end, and a mature ecosystem of tooling and libraries, it is quite easy to maintain a large, flexible, well-engineered SPA with React, Vue, or other lightweight JS libraries, even at enterprise companies with large teams.\n\nIn addition, Angular 2/4âs troubled 3-year development cycle and debatable architecture decisions should give any company pause before considering the adoption of this brand new framework.\n\nâ\n\nItâs 2017. Youâre looking to build or rewrite your front-end architecture. Youâve heard a lot about React vs. Angular and how they contrast and compare. The debates have raged on over the years. A lot of people will tell you that this is a Coke vs. Pepsi debate, framework vs. library, tradeoffs, pros/cons, etc, etc. but in 2017, itâs easy to see that Angular 2/4 will never reach the top-tier status of its popular AngularJS predecessor.\n\n2012: Why AngularJS Got Popular\n\nAngularJS became very popular due to its easy two-way data binding, MVC architecture, built-in module system, dependency injection, and routing package. Initially built as a hobby project by Misko Hevery in 2009, the framework started to take off shortly after its 2012 1.0 release. It quickly became the most popular SPA framework for front-end development.\n\nIn 2012, the JavaScript ecosystem was a very different place. Knockout, Backbone, Ember, Angular, and perhaps a few others were all vying for JS framework market share. ES6 wasnât a thing yet. NPM wasnât used for front end code. Libraries and frameworks werenât mature. Steve Sanderson, of KnockoutJS fame, gave a great assessment of the front-end landscape at the time following the âThrone of JSâ conference.\n\nAngularJS solved a lot of problems for web developers out of the box. For simple SPAs, it hit a sweet spot of productivity. Tooling started to grow, custom directive libraries were released, and the platform grew extremely quickly.\n\nHowever, as developers started to build professional, rich, full-grade applications on the framework with large teams over long periods of time, its limitations began to show. Two-way data binding, watchers, $scope variables, state management, confusing and repetitive abstractions like factory/service, and many other issues inhibited AngularJS in production.\n\nAt the peak of Angularâs popularity, in 2014, the team behind Angular announced that they would be creating a completely new incompatible framework. They would confusingly, perhaps even deceivingly, label this new framework Angular 2.\n\nThis controversial announcement was met with a lot of skepticism and criticism in the developer community. Since no upgrade path would be provided, every application built with AngularJS would need to be rewritten from scratch. The community splintered, and while some would stick around to see if Angular 2 would live up to its promises, others decided to look elsewhere for front-end development.\n\n2013: How React Revolutionized Front End Development\n\nAt the peak of JavaScript fatigue in 2013, Facebook open-sourced React after having used it in production for more than two years. React pitched itself as the V in MVC (Model-View-Controller). It completely shook up the JS front-end community with its one-way data flow and its dead-simple functional component model.\n\nIn 2013, Angular and every other JS framework was pitching two-way data binding as a feature. React came along and told us that was a bad idea. Two-way data binding is great for simple applications but in production, at scale, with large amounts of state, it can easily become spaghetti. Lots of unpredictable side-effects can be triggered. Two way data-binding was a feature in 2013 and Facebook said it was a bug. It turns out they were right. Ember, Angular, Vue, and others would later adopt the one-way model.\n\nFacebook was unopinionated about state management, however. Instead, it offered âFluxâ as a solution, which was more of a pattern than an actual library or framework. Shortly after Reactâs announcement in 2013â¦dozens of Flux implementations arrived on the scene including Flummox, Alt, Fluxxor, MartyJS, McFly, etc, etc, etc.\n\nhttps://facebook.github.io/flux/img/flux-simple-f8-diagram-explained-1300w.png\n\nWe hit peak âFlux fatigueâ when, on June 2, 2015, Dan Abramov released Redux. Inspired by Elm language, Redux brought predictable, functional, maintainable state management to JavaScript. Redux introduced actions and reducers that follow a pattern that shares similarities with Event Sourcing, which is a common software architecture pattern in back-end server technologies. Reduxâs explicit, declarative data management model allowed for state to be managed easily and scales well with the application.\n\nThis allowed for super-powered front-end features like time-travel debugging, hot module reloading, and simple and easy undo/redo capabilities. It also encouraged a functional design pattern, which allows for your code to be easily testable and easily reasoned about.\n\nRedux took the React community by storm. Two years into the Redux hype cycle, we are still seeing enthusiasm. Itâs being used in many enterprise-scale software companies like PayPal, Mozilla, and AirBnB and it forms the foundation for the popular GraphQL client-library Apollo. Itâs even being adopted as a state management solution in other frameworks. Today, itâs the de facto state management solution to be paired with React.\n\nMeanwhile, other innovations in the React landscape continued to transform front-endâ¦\n\nServer-side rendering\n\nBecause of Reactâs functional UI abstraction, it can run in any environment. Many began to realize this in the early days of React and started pairing it with Node.js to provide server-side rendering. React is already extremely fast, but paired with server-side rendering, all the data is loaded into the view and rendered on Node itself before a webpage gets loaded. This allowed for single page applications to be search engine friendly.\n\nMarch 2015: React Native launches\n\nIn March of 2015, Facebook announced React Native for iOS. A landmark announcement, it proved that Reactâs functional UI component abstraction could be leveraged to write native mobile applications for the first time.\n\nRather than promising, âWrite once, run anywhereâ, which is often derided as âWrite once, debug everywhereâ, Facebook pitched âLearn once, write everywhereâ as a philosophy. Inherent in that philosophy is that while it is possible to share a large portion of code between platforms, there are often many nuances between platforms that must be uniquely addressed. React Native provides an interface for addressing those platform differences.\n\nWithin 6 months, they would go on to launch Android support. The productivity gains were astonishing, allowing developers to share 90% or more of the code across mobile platforms with truly native rendering performance.\n\nMicrosoft would later release React Native libraries for building Windows applications: https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-windows.\n\nToday, React Native powers Instagram, Facebook, Wal-Mart, Baidu, Skype, Discord, and a slew of other professional grade applications.\n\nWe can be almost certain that React & React Native are a competitive advantage. We can see evidence in how Facebook simultaneously launched Snapchat-like âStoriesâ across four applications (WhatsApp, Messenger, Facebook, and Instagram) in its product suite.\n\nEffectively blocking Snapchatâs growth:\n\nItâs not hard to infer that React was a key reason why Facebook was able to do this so rapidly.\n\nNPM, ES2015, Babel, & Webpack\n\nWhile Facebook was rapidly innovating on the implications of React, a few key developments were occurring in parallel in front-end JavaScript.\n\nJavaScript had long suffered due to the lack of certain key language features. In particular, classes, modules, and lambdas were all missing. ES2015 introduced a plethora of new language features including these three and many, many, more. One of the long-standing problems with JS is cross-browser support for new language features. Babel gave us the chance to use all of these new language features before IE, Chrome, Firefox, iOS and others could roll-out support by compiling ES2015 down into ES5-compatible JS.\n\nWith Webpack we got a fantastic tool for easily bundling CSS, JS, HTML, and other project assets. Webpack is loaded with powerful features that were not possible just a few years ago. Minification, lazy-loading, tree-shaking and a whole slew of optimization features are now at any web developerâs disposal.\n\nWebpackâs bundling system enabled another powerful feature: NPM for the front-end. As the default package manager for Node.js and as the worldâs largest software registry, NPM is host to virtually every public JS library in existence. Itâs basically the app store for JavaScript.\n\nIn 2013, it was difficult to assemble JS libraries and dependencies and build front-end code in a maintainable way. In 2017, itâs quite easy thanks to the power of these tools.\n\nSeptember 2016: Angular 2 Finally Arrivesâ¦\n\nMarch 2017: Angular 4 Version Bump\n\nAfter a much-delayed and troubled development cycle including the departure of two architects Evan You and Rob Eisenberg from Google, who went on to create their own frameworks Vue and Aurelia, respectivelyâ¦Angular 2 finally arrived on the scene.\n\nIn the interim between September and March, Angular fixed its CLI, released a new version of its router and introduced a few more breaking changes. The team launched Angular 4 as simply Angular and have now committed to new releases every 6 months.\n\nAngular 2/4 & up are completely different, as the team first mentioned in 2014. It is built on TypeScript and RxJS, which are two 3rd party tools for types, decorators, and reactive, observable state management.\n\nAngular 2/4 brings a totally new component system that leans heavily on TypeScript decorators, SystemJS modules, RxJS observables, and Angularâs custom HTML-like syntax.\n\nA component system is the core of modern UI development. React solved components so well that the Web Component W3C standard never really took off.\n\nAngularâs component syntax is demonstrably more verbose than React. It can take 10x as much code in Angular and more wiring and ceremony to describe the same output. Instead of embracing a JS-first philosophy, Angular components instead place logic inside HTML, which makes components harder to test, harder to reason about, and limits you to the functionality of Angularâs custom DSL instead of Reactâs Turing-complete JavaScript XML (JSX). Angular 4âs release notes even went as far to tout âelseâ with *ngIf as a new feature.\n\nAngular 4 arrives on the scene in 2017 in a very different world than AngularJS saw in 2012. It brings a more verbose syntax than React, a heavy weight toolchain that many are having issues with in production, and no discernible gains in performance or maintainability over React.\n\nReactâs first-mover advantage on a slew of technologies, from native apps to VR to server-side rendering to hot module reloading to CSS Modules to Sketch integration means that Angular 4 is struggling to catch up. It has not leap frogged React in any way. In 2017, itâs quite far behind Reactâs ecosystem in capability and maturity.\n\nReact Is Much Simpler\n\nAngular 2/4 introduces over 500 top level API concepts which are ripe for ongoing breaking changes in future versions of Angular.\n\nAngular 2/4 produces heavy code with bloated file sizes. Utilizing Angularâs Ahead-of-Time compiler generates files that are 3â5x larger than source even after Closure compilation.\n\nReact Has Better Performance\n\nBenchmarks for React consistently show its superior performance over Angular 2/4: https://auth0.com/blog/more-benchmarks-virtual-dom-vs-angular-12-vs-mithril-js-vs-the-rest/.\n\nDubious Claim: âAngular is Better For Large Teamsâ\n\nIt is often claimed that Angular is better for the enterprise and this is this frameworkâs alleged sweet spot. However, this claim is not backed up by actual production results or history itself. There are few enterprise Angular 2/4 results in production today. Seeing as it is less than 9 months out of beta, this should come as no surprise.\n\nThere are no examples of some company moving a large codebase from React/Redux to Angular 2/4 and seeing productivity, maintainability or performance gains.\n\nEven after 3 years in development with constant, painful, breaking changesâ¦early reviews are mixed:\n\nI would posit that at this point, the onus is on Angular 2/4 to prove that it achieves superior results and user experiences in production at enterprise scale. This has yet to be seen despite years of promises and tons of hype.\n\nWhat should an enterprise optimize for? It should aim for building maintainable, performant software built with battle-tested, mature tooling.\n\nA good framework should have: stability, activity, ecosystem, community, learning-curve, skills within the job market, and ease-of-migration should things change.\n\nReact has 6 years of maturity and proven maintainability at Facebook scale and it is powering some of the worldâs most complex enterprise systems at companies like Twitter, Slack, Atlassian, Netflix, Salesforce, Microsoft, Apple, Quip, Wal-Mart, WordPress, NYTimes, and many others. People are seeing very real, very clear production advantages in the enterprise. And the user experiences produced by these systems should more than speak for themselves about the results that are achievable with React.\n\nReact has been much more stable than Angular. When it does change, Facebook releases code mods that automatically update your code base.\n\nAngularâs Splintered Ecosystem\n\nItâs important to note that since Angular 2/4 & Ionic 2/3 were completely rewritten in an incompatible fashion, all directives and modules that were written for AngularJS are completely invalid for these new frameworks. This means when you begin with Angular 4 & Ionic 3 in 2017, AngularJSâs rich ecosystem of custom directives are not available to you.\n\nThe JS community has moved onto lightweight frameworks like Vue & React by an order of magnitude over Angular 2/4:\n\nNPM Package Count\n\nReact: 31,654\n\nReact Native: 5,521\n\nVue: 4,657\n\nAngular 2: 4,510\n\nAngular 4: 527\n\nIonic 2: 207\n\nIonic 3: 31\n\nWhen you begin an application in 2017, how much custom work do you want to do? Do you want to roll your own everything and hope the ecosystem grows with you or take advantage of a rich, mature ecosystem of components that have been open sourced by world-class front end talent from the likes of AirBNB, Facebook, PayPal, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, Lyft, and more?\n\nFacebook Heavily Dogfoods React In Production; Google Not So Much\n\nA lot of people choose Angular because they hear itâs a tool created by Google. They assume that because itâs Google, it must therefore be the framework that is predominantly used at Google for front-end applications. Therefore, it must be battle-tested and proven at Google-scale in production. They would be wrong in that assumption. In truth, Google trusts Closure for most of the applications you know and love including Search, News, Gmail, etc.\n\nAnd they use SPF for YouTube:\n\nAngular is used minimally in production at Google. Googleâs web properties depend on quick download and execution and that is something Angular does not shine in.\n\nThe Battle Is Over: React Won\n\nThe Angular team blinked and the entire JavaScript ecosystem surged past them. It is now quite easy to pick from a buffet of options to build an enterprise-grade web application using battle tested libraries that are used in production at large-scale companies.\n\nIn 2017, React has become the dominant choice of front-end development. It is currently the 4th most starred repository on GitHub, making it the most popular JavaScript framework repository of all time.\n\nWith 4.4 million downloads per month on NPM, React has more than triple the use of Angularâs present 1.4 million downloads per month and it is growing at triple the rate.\n\nhttps://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/state-of-javascript-survey-frontend-framework-satisfaction.png\n\nA survey of 9,000 JS developers was done in 2016 and found React had a 92% developer retention rate compared to Angular 2âs 64% retention rate. With React being 3x more popular, growing at 3x the rate and Angular only managing to retain just under 2/3 of its developer baseâ¦itâs easy to see that React has already won.\n\nhttp://stateofjs.com/2016/introduction/\n\nReact and its ecosystem have created a powerhouse, productive front-end stack that lends itself to lightning fast, maintainable development that is not built on hype, but solid production results.\n\nThe future of UI development belongs to React and other lightweight JS frameworks like Vue. Angular 2/4 is too little (perhaps too much), too late.",
  "latent_22872": "A new genetic engineering technique could make it as easy to rewrite a genome as it is to read it.\n\nUsing the process, which grafts pieces of synthetic DNA into the genomes of dividing cells, researchers generated 15 billion different genomic patterns in just three days. The process would normally take years, and could eventually be used to produce industrial chemicals, drugs, fuel and anything else that comes out of bacteria.\n\n\"Automated sequencing really advanced the way we can read genetic information. We hope automated genome engineering will advance the way we write genetic information,\" said Harris Wang, a Harvard University biophysicist.\n\nEarlier methods of manipulating genomes involved a painstaking biological cut-and-paste process, with target genes removed, tweaked and reinserted, one at a time. Alternatively, bioengineers could use a mutagen that turned genomes to hash.\n\nBut Wang and George Church â a co-author of the study, and a pioneer in DNA synthesis, genome sequencing and all-purpose biotechnological wizardry â want to speed that process up.\n\nTheir technique, known as Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering, or MAGE, starts with single-stranded pieces of DNA, custom synthesized to fit on target sections of a genome. In a microscopic remix of the famous Dr. Frankenstein movie scene, a target cell is then jolted with energy, opening holes in its membrane. The DNA flows inside. When the cell divides, it uses the new DNA in copying itself.\n\nIn the MAGE machines, this can be done over and over again with different gene combinations. With each subsequent cell division, even more mutations arise naturally. Researchers can automate the generation of souped-up cells, or study the unexpected effects of changes.\n\nIn a paper published Sunday in Nature, Church and Wang describe how they turned E. coli bacteria into factories for lycopene, an antioxidant that might have anti-cancer properties.\n\nIn just three days, they ended up with billions of cells containing various combinations of 24 lycopene-linked genes. Some cells produced five times more lycopene than usual. According to Church, the process would normally take months, even years.\n\n\"We are interested in applying this technology to cells that are useful in producing industrially useful chemical, therapeutics and fuels,\" from yeast to cyanobacteria, said Wang.\n\nThe technique could also be used to design models of diseases â in tissue cultures, or animals â that have large-scale genomic changes.\n\nChurch said that MAGE might end up being more useful than building entire genomes from scratch. That approach is flashy and powerful, but unnecessarily complicated.\n\n\"There are very few clearly articulated examples where anyone needs to change more than a few dozen genes or base pairs,\" said Church.\n\nSee Also:\n\nCitation: \"Programming cells by multiplex genome engineering and accelerated evolution.\" By Harris H.

We remember fallen soldiers. On this day we hold religious services all over our land and in other countries. This year I watched the memorial services at Gallipoli, Turkey, and then in Villers-Bretonneux, France. As I listened to speakers describe these places as âsacred spaces.â Another area dedicated to remembering brave soldiers is the Kokoda Track in Papua, New Guinea.\n\nAs I thought about these services, my mind went to Mosesâ experience, when the presence of God appeared to him in a burning bush. God said, âCome no closer! Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy groundâ (Exodus 3:5). Moses was in a sacred space in the presence of God. I wondered, âWhere are my sacred spaces?â\n\nAnswers came readily to mindâin my garden surrounded by the fauna and flora revealing Godâs creation and circle of life. I find sacred space when I attend church for worship and the sacraments. There is a designated place in my home where I meditate, study, and write. Sacred space surrounds my family and its abundant love. Itâs there when I share a meal with friends. Another sacred space in our homeâpart of the Open Door Congregationâis our swimming pool, the site of many baptisms.\n\nJesus cherished and used sacred spacesâon mountains and in boats to escape the crowds and pray. After his resurrection, Jesus took Peter, James, and John up to a high mountain. As these disciples looked at Jesus, they noticed a dazzling, bright change come over him and saw him talking with Moses and Elijah. Seeing this, Peter said to Jesus, âLord, it is good for us to be hereâ¦â\n\nHow good it is to be with God in sacred spaces and to receive peace and enlightenment in this time together. May God bless you regularly as you find sacred space to be with God.\n\nPrayer for Peace\n\nEver-present God, thank you for the sacredness of every place in which we meet you. Thank you for the peace you bring to these places.\n\nSpiritual Practice: Develop Disciples to Serve\n\nAs disciples of Jesus Christ, we are called to respond to people and their needs throughout the world. Pray about using your skills to help another person. As you feel affirmed, thank God for the opportunity to be a responding, serving disciple while you move into the outward journey.\n\nPeace Covenant\n\nToday, God, as I move from sacred place to sacred place, I will see sacredness in the spaces between, too.\n\nAdvertisements",

  "latent_23283": "Today, yet again, social media resounds with vilification of an individual who quite unashamedly killed a fellow sentient individual named Cecil. There was a time when I could never even have imagined the howls of indignation and outrage, the cursing, the contempt that such an event would precipitate. I had no idea that there was so much hate in the world. But there is. And in a culture such as ours, underpinned by inflicting violence and death on the vulnerable and helpless while we delude ourselves that weâre kind and caring, I suppose itâs hardly surprising.\n\nIâll get something out of the way here. I despise what this individual did. But then I despise ALL killing of those of other species for pleasure, ALL unnecessary killing. Which means that I also despise my former nonvegan self. And there we have the point that the majority seem to overlook.\n\nBefore I became vegan, I too was a killer for pleasure as are the vast majority of those howling with rage about Cecil, as they did about Marius and many others whose names Iâve forgotten. Oh I didnât see the terrified, heartbroken eyes when I killed. I didnât hear the whimpers of fear or see the huddling together in vain hope of comfort. I didnât smell the slaughterhouse stench or the tang of the blood and steaming entrails, but I definitely killed.\n\nI was a wilfully blind consumer, and I killed.\n\nThe approximately 60 billion nameless individuals who will die this year so that their desecrated remains may be crunched, digested and excreted for the gustatory pleasure of the nonvegan consumer are testament to the power of consumerism. Their deaths are completely unnecessary but still the rivers of blood continue and the whimpers and screams still fall on the deaf ears of those of us who have never questioned our entitlement to kill and torture our way through life; those of us who will continue to crunch and digest and otherwise use the helpless and vulnerable victims of our nonvegan choices while simmering with rage about poor Cecil.\n\nAnd of course the consumption of body parts and secretions is simply the ugly tip of an iceberg that includes using others as commodities and resources for clothing, entertainment, vivisection and as many vile practices as our species can devise. Treading the moral high ground about âcrueltyâ to those of a species other than our own is at best a shaky prospect when every aspect of our own life demands and endorses a system based on horrors that we could scarcely conceive in our darkest nightmares.\n\nThose who shall remain nameless\n\nIn trying to see where the blind spot is, and almost every one of us either has or used to have it, I began to consider the naming of individuals and the way this simple act appears to confer an umbrella of protection over the named individual. Weâve all heard the notion expressed that we should ânever name anything weâre going to eatâ. As a vegan I now reflect on all the times I heard this, all the times it didnât make me feel sick to the pit of my stomach, all the times it didnât fill me with self revulsion and it reminds me that I have not stepped so very far away from my own days of blindness. Itâs a sobering thought.\n\nWhen we share our lives with animals, we name them. Not only do we name them, we deliberate, sometimes for ages about what the most appropriate name will be. It has to be something fitting, something in keeping with the appearance and personality of the object of our affection. This in itself is a very telling concept. The very fact that we all consciously or unconsciously go through this process is absolute proof that we all recognise the individuality of the sentient nonhuman being whose name we seek to choose, but this is a subject for another day.\n\nOnce named, itâs as if our named individual ceases to be âotherâ and instead becomes âone of usâ. He or she therefore becomes, if not exactly sacrosanct (given that named nonhuman companions are still considered property to be bought, sold, abandoned and destroyed as we see fit) at least worthy of some sort of recognition as an individual.\n\nSo let us all consider these images; these death trucks of nameless ones, of numbered individuals, each with a personality, each with thoughts, wishes and preferences. Each one was capable of forming bonds with others, of joy, of feeling pain and terror.\n\nThey were never given names, but if we had known them, weâd have loved them just as we love those who share our lives and our homes. Weâd have deliberated for ages to find a name that suited their personality, their appearance. Weâd have chosen a name that encapsulated their uniqueness, a name which would have cemented their place in our hearts as individuals worthy of our respect.\n\nWe need to extend that concern and recognise that the billions of nameless individuals that our consumer choices kill each year are all Cecil, are all Marius. The only way to align our words and our actions is to be vegan. Why not start today?",
  "latent_23449": "No one churns out the healings like Benny Hinn. His This Is Your Day! show is one of the most-watched Christian TV programs, with viewers in 190 countries. In the US, it runs on paid-for air time more than 200 times a week on 80 stations. It is translated into Spanish, Romanian, Norwegian, Italian, Hindi and Tamil. No one knows how much Hinn makes personally. In 1997 he said it was somewhere between $US500,000 and a million. More recently some documents stolen from his rubbish pointed to a salary close to $US2 million. His lawyers deny this. The \"parsonage\" built for him cost $US3.5 million. It has seven bedrooms, eight baths, a view of the Pacific and room for 10 cars including the odd BMW and his favourite Mercedes-Benz G500.\n\nLast November the US Senate Committee on Finance asked for audited financial statements. It wanted detailed explanations of all compensation to Hinn, housing allowances, clothing, jewellery, personal grooming, loans, credit card statements, and a list of all vehicles and aircraft, including a $US36 million Gulfstream jet that Hinn no doubt used to fly to Australia. Hinn is outraged by these demands and sees the hand of Satan behind them. He claims to have prayed to the Lord repeatedly: \"Before I injure Your name, take me out. Before I harm Your kingdom, kill me.\" We arrived at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre two hours early. Already a press of people was streaming out of the car parks, many like Toohey in wheelchairs. The air buzzed with expectancy. Some walked past offering encouragements. An elderly woman put her hand on Toohey's shoulder and said: \"I have faith that the Lord will be here for you tonight. Do you?\" Toohey replied: \"Yes I do.\"\n\nWe followed the signs to the \"wheelchair entrance\", which took us directly to the floor of the centre and our place with the sick, behind 15 rows for VIPs. Next to us was a young man with his profoundly retarded son of three or four years. His boy showed no reaction to the world around him. With infinite and loving patience this young father tended his son, rarely taking his eyes off him, adjusting his bed in the stroller, lifting and cuddling him, putting in a dummy, offering a bottle of juice. This was a life without respite for him. Behind us a man struggled to assemble a camp bed. Since 2.30 that afternoon he had been working to get his friend to the centre. It was a painful sight. His friend in a wheelchair was desperately sick. He was dishevelled and dirty. He had on wide-legged shorts displaying pathetically thin legs. A colostomy bag balanced on his lap. An inflatable mattress was produced and after an agonising effort it was in place. He was laid on it and his friend tenderly put a pillow under his head and laid a coat over him. Within minutes he was asleep and didn't wake until it was time to go home.\n\nHinn brings a large group of operators with him, veterans of a hundred events like this. A Brisbane crowd of 8000 is small stuff. They have meetings of more than a million in Kenya, Latin America and Indonesia. A couple of men I recognised from Hinn's TV show cruised the rows of the sick like sharks, looking for prospects for healing. They were not interested in the profoundly ill. The man and his boy, the poor fellow asleep on his bed, were of no use to Pastor Benny. One of them saw Toohey and came over, sleek expensive suit, suntanned face shining, reeking of expensive perfume. \"What happened, brother?\" he asked. We had rehearsed this answer. It was osteoarthritis with an infection in the synovial tissue which had deteriorated to the point that he had been confined to the chair for five years.\n\nToohey began: \"It was while I was rock climbing â¦ I fell off a mountain.\" He laughed nervously. The Hinn man laughed with him, but I was worried. I said: \"This man hasn't walked for five years. That's why I brought him tonight.\" He looked at me: \"Who are you?\" \"We're brothers, where ever he goes I go â¦\" He seemed reassured and bent over Toohey and put his mouth beside his ear and whispered. Toohey nodded and bent his head. I put my hand on Toohey's shoulder and also bent my head. For two minutes we were locked together in prayer. Toohey shifted in his chair, and began tentatively straining his left leg. The man stood up: \"Do you feel anything?\" Toohey stared at his leg: \"I feel a sort of tingling?\" The man smiled and moved back: \"Brother, the Lord is going to heal you tonight â¦ praise God â¦ praise God.\" Toohey nodded and muttered: \"Praise God.\"\n\nHinn preached a sermon straight out of Elmer Gantry - 1950s hellfire and damnation from fundamentalist Southern American Protestant Christianity. Several hundred people surged to the front to pray the sinner's prayer and accept the Lord Jesus Christ as saviour. They were given a booklet by Pastor Benny and an invitation to attend a list of churches that sponsored the crusade. Then Hinn moved to money. For 20 minutes he cajoled, prophesied, pleaded, shouted and demanded. This is the engine room of the crusade. No one does this better than Hinn. His white Nehru suit glistened like a halo in the spotlight. He moved urgently around the stage. \"I'm going to tell you something. This is a prophecy. You are about to see the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. You are going to see prosperity like you never dreamed of. Money is being transferred from sinners to the righteous.\" His voice boomed out: \"Are you righteous?\" \"Yes,\" we cried. \"Are you righteous?\" \"Yes,\" we cried a little louder. \"This is money you never dreamed of. Are you righteous?\" \"Yes,\" we thundered.\n\nHinn believes the great cosmic drama of the end of the world is around the corner. Because of these unusual times, when evil will abound and God will call forth extraordinary men to great things, special things are in store. God gives money to people who use it to preach the Gospel and show the world how wonderful it is to be a prosperous Christian. Just as the children of Israel plundered the gold of the Egyptians when they were led out by Moses, the righteous with the right faith in God will plunder the wealth of this world's sinners. That was money argument one.\n\nArgument two: \"The Jews were taught by God how to give. When they brought their gifts to the Lord, it was only the best. We have lost the gift of giving. God deserves the best. You give God the best and you'll get the best from him. Are you here for God's blessing? What are you going to give the Lord tonight?\" Money argument three is used universally in charismatic churches around Australia. It is called \"sowing the seed\". God rewards those who sow seeds of faith. As a grain of wheat is sown in the ground and comes up multiplied by 10, even by 100. \"God will multiply your gift to him. You give him a little he will multiply a little.\" The close: \"The Lord is going to speak to you tonight. He is not asking you to give to Benny Hinn. This is a gift to the Lord. To some of you he will say $1000, to others $2000 or $5000, to some it may be $10,000. Don't turn your back on the Lord â¦ \"\n\nWith a 250-voice choir singing about the joys of faith, and Hinn warning us not to miss the opportunity, the envelopes were distributed around the centre. Visa, MasterCard or bank account details. He is not interested in $20 and $50 notes. Cash is small time. He needs big licks to keep his machine going. I have no idea how much he was collecting that night, but I cannot see how it would be worth it for him to come to Australia without clearing $200,000 a night. One report said his three Brisbane shows raised about $800,000. Then came the healing time. Hinn gave us another 15-minute talk about the healing power of Jesus. His argument went like this: Jesus healed people in the Gospels. Jesus is alive today and Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever. So he is healing today. \"I don't care what your pastor says. I don't care what your doctor says. I can tell you what the Bible says. Jesus is here tonight and is waiting to heal you. DO YOU HAVE THE FAITH?\"\n\nToohey struggled out of the chair and unsteadily took the handles at the back and began to move forward. I whispered: \"We've got to get down the side to the front.\" We found ourselves in a strange melee of people, a sad crowd urging towards the stage. If you made it, Hinn would slay you in the spirit: the final confirmation of divine intervention. Toohey and I were stopped by a large Pacific Islander, who said kindly: \"You need to stay back there.\" He was pointing to white tape on the floor. Why were we stopped when others were moving over? Then I overheard one of the Hinn veterans speak to another volunteer: \"I told you. No one over here who is not 100 per cent healed. Don't just point â¦ move them out.\"\n\nI whispered to Toohey: \"We've got to lose the chair.\" In a couple of minutes we were in with the 100 per centers. The Hinn man grabbed Toohey and pulled him into the open. He put his arm behind him and pushed: \"Come on brother, praise the Lord, come on.\" Toohey responded until he was almost running. The man stopped and put him at the front of the line. He directed a volunteer to get the wheelchair and park it at the bottom of the stage.\n\nI took my place beside Toohey and waited. By this stage he had perfected a stunned wide-eyed look, and was holding his hands in the air. I whispered: \"Have you got a follow-up question if you get the chance?\" He said: \"Yes, the one about Jesus.\" We had in mind: \"Pastor Benny, why do you live in a multimillion-dollar house and drive around in a Mercedes when Jesus lived like a poor person?\" Over the next 15 minutes people struggled over the 100 per cent line and joined us along the wall. Suddenly, a huge black security guard came over and said: \"You're up first.\" He looked at me: \"You can go up with him.\" We were herded to the stairs and started up. I looked at Toohey and something worried me. I grabbed him hard on the arm and whispered: \"Don't you bloody fall over, Toohey.\"\n\nWe burst into the dazzling light and there was Pastor Benny. Up close he looked soft, almost feminine. His skin is smooth but flabby. His hands were small and the nails were highly manicured and polished. He walked towards Toohey and asked: \"What has the Lord done for you?\" Toohey began muttering about falling off a mountain again. Hinn looked annoyed: \"What has happened?\" Toohey returned to his story about the mountain. I was muttering to myself: \"The question, the bloody question.\" Hinn reached out and with thumb and first finger pushed on Toohey's neck. The minders behind him reached forward and pulled him back, and Toohey collapsed. Hinn moved up stage to reveal a more obvious miracle of healing. Toohey was dragged to his feet and we left the stage, collected the chair and returned silently to our seat.\n\nSo what happened? Hinn and his handlers are seasoned professionals at the miracle game. Toohey was too contained. They needed the trembling ecstasy of a person overwhelmed by spiritual power. So in a second they had him on his back. Could it be that my scepticism blinded me to the possibility that God was in that place? Were we mocking God's work and, despite the excesses, Hinn is an instrument of healing? It is possible that a very few were healed? But I say that is despite Hinn. I judge him by the measure of the one he claims to be following. Jesus never promised people wealth, or instant healing. He didn't promise his disciples houses on the coast. Pastor Benny has recast Jesus in his own image. He has forgotten that his Lord died, humiliated, tortured, alone and penniless. But how do you sell that? The Reverend Dr David Millikan is a Uniting Church minister. He is a part-time producer with Channel Seven and lectures at Charles Sturt University.",
  "latent_23526": "Todayâs guest post comes from Adam Harstad, a co-writer of mine at Footballguys.com. You can follow Adam on twitter at @AdamHarstad.\n\nOn Saturday, the Hall of Fame selection committee will meet, lock themselves in a room, and debate the relative merits of the 15 modern-era finalists for induction. After an intense discussion, the results will be announced nationally as the final event in the festivities leading up to Sundayâs Super Bowl.\n\nWhile the list of 15 finalists includes several names who have been waiting longer than they should for their call, the one that stands out the most to me is Terrell Davis, who has been a semi-finalist more than anyone else in this yearâs class, reaching the top 25 ten times in his ten years of eligibility.\n\nHopefully the Hall of Fame committee can manage to make room for him in what could easily be a stacked class. Whatever they do this Saturday, however, will not change one simple fact: Terrell Davis should have long ago been elected to the Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Case for Terrell Davis\n\nThe positive case for Terrell Davis is already widely known, but I suspect many underestimate just how strong it really is.\n\nTerrell Davis, in his first four seasons in the NFL, was named to three pro bowls, was a three-time first-team AP All Pro, won two AP Offensive Player of the Year awards, and was named MVP by the Associated Press. Davis was also a seven-time AP Offensive Player of the Week, including four times in 1998 alone; with the caveat that it appears the AP has only been issuing that award since 1990, Davisâ total is bettered by only three Hall of Famers (Barry Sanders with 11, Emmitt Smith with 10, and Marshall Faulk with 8).\n\nHis âtrophy caseâ compares favorably to any other running back. Since the merger, (and discounting fullbacks or players who received honors for their work as a returner), Davis is one of 11 running backs to earn three first-team AP All Pro honors; the other ten are Barry Sanders (6); Eric Dickerson, Walter Payton, and O.J. Simpson (5); Adrian Peterson and Emmitt Smith (4); Earl Campbell, Marshall Faulk, Priest Holmes, and LaDainian Tomlinson (3). With the exception of Holmes and, (perhaps to some), Earl Campbell, thatâs essentially a âwhoâs whoâ of modern âinner circleâ Hall of Fame running backs. Again with the exception of Holmes, each of those backs was either elected to the Hall of Fame on their first ballot of eligibility, or else are not yet eligible but are widely expected to earn first-ballot status when they are.\n\nDavis joins Peyton Manning, Drew Brees, Marshall Faulk, Barry Sanders, Jerry Rice, and Earl Campbell as the only repeat winners of the APâs Offensive Player of the Year honors, (and if not for a 2,000 yard season by Sanders in 1997, Davis might have joined Campbell and Faulk as the only players with three consecutive).\n\nThese are some impressive accolades, and Davisâ production on the field was worthy of them. One method I like to use to compare production is an adaptation of baseballâs âblack ink testâ and âgrey ink testâ. The idea is to count how many times a player led the league or ranked in the top ten in certain key statistics. This test in a single stroke can level the playing field between players who were very good for a long time, (thus having many different chances to add a little bit of black ink / grey ink), and those who were exceptional for a short time, (thus accumulating a lot of black ink / grey ink at once).\n\nThere have been fifteen post-merger Hall of Fame running backs. Here is how Davis compares to those backs in top-3, top-5, and top-10 finishes in what I believe are the six key statistical categories for running backs: carries, rushing yards, yards per attempt, rushing touchdowns, yards from scrimmage, and total touchdowns.\n\nRsh RYd YPC RTD YFS TTD Tot t3 t5 t10 t3 t5 t10 t3 t5 t10 t3 t5 t10 t3 t5 t10 t3 t5 t10 t3 t5 t10 Sanders 3 5 10 7 10 10 5 6 9 4 6 8 7 8 10 3 4 5 29 39 52 Payton 6 9 11 6 9 11 1 1 5 4 4 7 7 9 11 3 4 7 27 36 52 Smith 5 6 9 5 7 9 1 2 6 5 9 10 5 5 7 6 7 9 27 36 50 Dickerson 5 6 7 6 6 7 2 2 5 4 5 7 5 5 6 3 3 5 25 27 37 Dorsett 2 4 8 3 3 8 1 2 4 2 2 3 2 2 9 1 1 3 11 14 35 Martin 4 5 8 4 4 7 0 0 1 2 3 6 1 4 8 1 1 4 12 17 34 Thomas 4 5 6 4 4 6 2 2 4 0 2 4 5 5 6 0 3 4 15 21 30 Allen 1 1 3 1 2 4 0 0 2 5 6 9 2 3 5 4 5 6 13 17 29 Harris 1 4 7 1 3 5 1 3 4 3 3 4 0 1 4 1 2 5 7 16 29 Faulk 0 0 2 0 3 5 3 3 4 3 4 5 4 5 6 2 3 6 12 18 28 Simpson 5 6 6 5 5 6 3 3 3 2 2 3 4 6 6 1 2 2 20 24 26 Campbell 4 5 6 3 4 5 1 1 2 3 4 5 1 3 4 3 3 4 15 20 26 Bettis 3 3 7 3 3 5 1 3 4 1 1 4 1 3 3 0 0 2 9 13 25 Riggins 2 3 6 0 1 4 0 0 1 3 3 5 0 0 1 2 3 4 7 10 21 Csonka 0 0 2 1 4 4 1 3 6 1 3 5 0 1 1 0 0 3 3 11 21 Davis 3 3 3 3 3 4 1 3 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 16 18 20\n\nUnsurprisingly, Davis ranks last in career top-10 finishes. He finishes right at the median for career top-5 finishes, though, (tying Faulk for 8th with 18 each), and ranks 6th in the sample in career top-3 finishes, despite accumulating all sixteen of them in a three-season span . Davis might be light on grey ink, but he sails through the black ink test with flying colors.\n\nThe grey ink and black ink test are simplistic, but they do a phenomenal job of matching our intuitions; they clearly highlight Sanders, Payton, and Smith as a class unto themselves at the top, they clearly highlight Csonka, Riggins, and Bettis as a class unto themselves at the bottom, and they clearly illustrate the divide between the players in the middle who were very good for a long time (Dorsett, Harris, Martin), and players who were exceptional for a short time (Davis, Campbell, Simpson).\n\nPerhaps most interestingly, we can look at the players who fared the worst on the âgrey inkâ, (Davisâ weakness), to see what factors allowed them to overcome their liability and earn enshrinement.\n\nThe 10th, 11th, and 12th ranked Hall of Famers in âgrey inkâ are Marshall Faulk, O.J. Simpson, and Earl Campbell. All three made it into the Hall of Fame based on nearly unmatched dominance at their peak; the three combined for seven AP Offensive Player of the Year awards and each was named league MVP once by the Associated Press, (with Faulk collecting MVP awards from non-AP organizations in two years, and Campbell doing it three times).\n\nThe 13th, 14th, and 15th ranked Hall of Famers in âgrey inkâ are Jerome Bettis, John Riggins, and Larry Csonka. All three made it into the Hall of Fame in large part based on their postseason narratives; Riggins and Csonka both had one of the best postseasons of all time, becoming two of just four players with 300 rushing yards and 6 touchdowns in a single postseason. In 2009, Chase calculated that they had the 1st and 7th most valuable individual postseasons of any running back, respectively. Jerome Bettis was born in Michigan.\n\nAs the black ink and awards case demonstrate, Davis clearly belongs alongside that first group of backs in terms of peak performance. And while Riggins and Csonka were excellent postseason backs, (and Jerome Bettis was born in Michigan), Terrell Davis was arguably the best postseason back of all time; he owns two of the top five postseasons, and by Chaseâs calculation, trailed only Emmitt Smith in career postseason value. Smith accumulated 891 points of value in 17 career games. Davis accumulated 865 points in just 8 games.\n\nIn fact, how good was Terrell Davis in the postseason? Better than you think, even accounting for the knowledge that Terrell Davis was better than you think in the postseason. In his eight career playoff games, Davis rushed 204 times for 1140 yards and 12 touchdowns, (at 5.6 yards per carry), adding 19 receptions for 131 yards through the air. Pro-rated over a 16-game season, that 2280 rushing yards and 2542 yards from scrimmage would both break the existing NFL records, the former by a full 175 yards. And remember, these numbers came against postseason competition, the best the NFL had to offer.\n\nIf that sounds like a huge 8-game total, it is. Itâs more than O.J. Simpson ran for in any 8-game stretch during his 2,000 yard season in 1973. But lets put it into better context. Pro Football Reference has game logs going back to 1960. If we remove overlapping stretches, there have been 18 times where a back has topped 1,100 rushing yards in 8 games. And, if you were to include touchdowns and rushing yards in such a stretch, Davisâ accomplishments would look even better.\n\nHereâs the complete data for all 18 stretches, plus Terrell Davisâ postseason career. Iâve also added a column showing how many games above .500 each backâs opponents were during their stretch.\n\nTerrell Davisâ 8 playoff games register as one of the greatest 8-game stretches from any running back in NFL history, (or at least since 1960), even without the additional context about the quality of the opposition or the fact that every single game was a âwin or go homeâ contest.\n\nIf you prefer the data in per-game form, Davisâ 142.5 career rushing yards per game in the postseason laps the field; with a five-game minimum, John Riggins (110.7 yards per game) is the only player within 33% of Davisâ total. Of the 75 running backs with at least 100 career rushes in the postseason, Davisâ 5.59 yards per carry is likewise head-and-shoulders above the rest of the field; Marcus Allen, (5.04 yards per carry), is the only other player over 5.0 for his career.\n\nIn Terrell Davisâ âworstâ playoff game, he still rushed for 91 yards. In NFL history, there have been 144 backs who appeared in at least 4 games and rushed for at least 200 yards; of those 144 backs, only four, (Arian Foster, John Riggins, Eric Dickerson, Emmitt Smith), averaged more yards than Davis had in his least productive game. There have been 188 backs with at least 4 playoff games and at least 200 yards from scrimmage; similarly, only four, (Arian Foster, Marcus Allen, Eric Dickerson, John Riggins), have an average better than Davisâ lowest total, (115 yards).\n\nIf we prefer not to divide up those playoff games and treat them as a separate âseasonâ unto themselves, but rather to add them on to his existing seasons, Terrell Davisâ 1997 and 1998 become easily two of the greatest years by any running back in history. The only back with more rushing yards in a single season, (regular and postseason combined), than Terrell Davisâ 2331 in 1997 wasâ¦ Terrell Davis, with 2476 in 1998. According to Chaseâs methodology from 2009, Terrell Davisâ 1998 and 1997 were the 1st and 5th most valuable running back seasons in history.\n\nAnd Chaseâs system was hardly the only advanced statistical system to love Terrell Davis. Before the 2013 season, Football Outsiders looked back at their data, (which dated back to 1991). They found that despite his abbreviated career, Davis ranked 3rd in career rushing value, just a tenth of a percent behind LaDainian Tomlinson for second. Davisâ 1998 season the best they had measured and his 1997 season tied for second, (despite Football Outsiders not including any postseason production for either).\n\nTerrell Davis at his best was clearly one of the greatest running backs to ever play football. Despite his shortened career, he packed so much production into such a short time that his regular-season resume is still Hall of Fame caliber. Advanced stats went nuts for him. He supplemented all of this with two Super Bowls and a track record as the greatest postseason running back, (and potentially the greatest postseason performer at any positionâ Lynn Swann has nothing on him), in NFL history.\n\nSo why isnât Terrell Davis in the Hall of Fame yet? While the case in his favor is exceptional, the case against him is strong, as well.\n\nThe Case Against Terrell Davis\n\nPart 1: Longevity\n\nDue to an injury-abbreviated career, Terrell Davis ranks 55th in career rushing yards, behind names such as Chris Warren, James Brooks, and Garrison Hearst. Even the much-maligned Larry Csonka finished his career with nearly 500 more rushing yards than Terrell Davis. How can a player who doesnât even rank in the top 50 at his own position be a Hall of Famer?\n\nThe problem with this argument? Longevity, by itself, means nothing. Vinny Testaverde and Drew Bledsoe rank 9th and 10th in career passing yards, yet neither will ever even be a finalist for the Hall of Fame. Playing for a long time isnât enough; a player must be adding substantial value during that time.\n\nAllow me to demonstrate with a comparison. While I hate when people argue for one player to make the Hall of Fame by comparing him to one of the worst players at his position who has already been elected, I think a comparison between Terrell Davis and Jerome Bettis, member of the class of 2015, can be illustrative.\n\nBettis was a Hall of Fame finalist four times from 2011 to 2014, while Davis was cut at the semifinalist stage each time. Both backs were finalists in 2015, but Bettis was inducted over Davis. The Hall of Fame voters pretty clearly expressed a preference for Bettis in each year he was eligible, so a comparison seems fair.\n\nBettis made the Hall of Fame in large part because of his remarkable longevity. When Bettis retired in 2005, he ranked 5th in NFL history in career rushing yards. By the time he was eligible for the Hall of Fame, he still ranked 6th, (having been passed by LaDainian Tomlinson, who retired with 22 more rushing yards).\n\nHow much more need Davis have done to match Bettisâ remarkable longevity? Letâs investigate. During his peak, (1995 to 1998), Terrell Davis played 61 games, amassed 1343 carries, gained 6413 yards and 56 touchdowns, and added 152 receptions for 1181 yards and 5 more scores. In addition, as mentioned, he added 204/1140/12 rushing and 19/131/0 receiving in the postseason. While we could discuss whether the postseason performance was more valuable than the regular season performance, thatâs not importantâ at a bare minimum, hopefully we can agree that it was equally valuable and deserves to be counted.\n\nCombining those totals, Davisâ âpeak productionâ spanned 69 games and consisted of 1547/7553/68 rushing and 171/1312/5 receiving. We can subtract those totals from the career production of Jerome Bettis, (including his own postseason games), then divide by the additional number of games Bettis played, and that will tell us exactly what Davis would have had to average, and for how long, to precisely match Bettisâ career totals.\n\nDoing this, we find that Davis would have needed to play roughly 8.5 more seasons, and during those 8.5 seasons he would need to average roughly 249 carries for 792 yards, (3.2 yards per carry), catch an additional 4 passes for 23 additional yards, and score roughly 3.5 touchdowns.\n\nImagine Davis had given us an extra 8-9 years like this. Would this make him more of a Hall of Famer? Certainly not. Those are the definition of âreplacement levelâ seasons; weâre far more concerned with how much value a player provides above and beyond that.\n\nBettis is, admittedly, an extreme example, (though as I said, I believe he is a fair one, given how he and Davis directly competed for a spot and the committee explicitly preferred him). Few backs have had as many âfillerâ seasons as Bettis, who was below 1,000 yards from scrimmage in five different years, accumulating 3758 total yards during that span. Had I chosen Curtis Martin as the point of comparison, Davis would have needed 1400 yards for about 7 more years. Had I chosen Thurman Thomas, Davis would have needed 1200 yards for about 8 more years.\n\nWithout the rushing yardage from those five filler seasons, Bettis falls from 6th to 28th in career rushing yards. He falls from 22nd to 90th in yards from scrimmage. Does he make the Hall of Fame without them? I think not.\n\nTheoretically, we never want to punish a player for not having filler seasons. In practice, using career totals always does. Davis gained 983 rushing yards at 4.0 yards per carry in the 13 games he played after his knee injury. Had he added another three seasons at that pace, he would have been over 10,000 career rushing yards.\n\nBut would another three seasons of his post-injury play really have made him more deserving of enshrinement? We must be very careful of what exactly we hope to reward when we discuss âlongevityâ.\n\nPart 2: Replaceability.\n\nMuch has been made of the success of running backs in Denver after Terrell Davis went down. In 1999, Olandis Gary had 1159 rushing yards in 12 games. In 2000, Mike Anderson topped 1600 yards from scrimmage in just 13 games. Clinton Portis rushed for 1500 yards in each of his first two seasons, and then in 2004 Rueben Droughns rushed for 1200 yards in the final 12 games after winning the starting job. The 2005 Broncos very nearly got 1000 yards rushing from both Mike Anderson and Tatum Bell.\n\nThe argument is that the success of all of these different backs prove that it was the system, and not any individual talent, that resulted in Terrell Davisâ incredible production.\n\nBut how successful were these backs, really? Not nearly as successful as Terrell Davis. From 1999 to 2010, Denverâs running backs combined for just one pro bowl appearance, (by Clinton Portis). From Davisâ injury in 1999 to Peyton Manningâs arrival in 2012â a span of 13 yearsâ all Denver running backs combined, (including Portis), won four Offensive Player of the Week awards; thatâs as many as Davis had in 1998 alone.\n\nThe ten seasons from 1995 to 2004 represent four years with Davis as the primary back, two years with Portis as the primary back, and four years with a hodgepodge of players. Of those ten years, the top four seasons in total rushing yards are 2003, (with Portis)â¦ then 1998, 1997, and 1996, in that order.\n\nIn six of those seasons, Denver as a team averaged more than 4.5 yards per carry. They were 2002 and 2003, (with Portis), plus 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998, (with Davis). The traditional statistics suggest that the Davis and Portis offenses were clearly better than the others at running the ball.\n\nAdvanced statistics tell the same story. Per Football Outsiders, hereâs Denverâs year-by-year rushing DVOA rating, (a statistic to measure how much more effective a certain player or unit is relative to league average), as well as where that value ranked among the rest of the league:\n\n1995 â 13.5% (2nd)\n\n1996 â 13.1% (7th)\n\n1997 â 24.0% (1st)\n\n1998 â 31.4% (1st)\n\n1999 â 7.4% (10th)\n\n2000 â 12.8% (6th)\n\n2001 â 2.0% (13th)\n\n2002 â 22.3% (3rd)\n\n2003 â 9.0% (8th)\n\n2004 â 4.0% (13th)\n\nDenver topped 13% DVOA rushing in each of Davisâ four healthy seasons. They only topped it once in the six subsequent years, with Clinton Portis, (who was also pretty good). Denver ranked in the top 5 in rushing efficiency four times, and three of them were with Davis, (the other with Portis). Denverâs average rushing DVOA before Davisâ injury was 20.5%, and its average rushing DVOA after was 9.6%.\n\nMore evidence that Terrell Davis was a lot better than Olandis Gary and Mike Anderson comes from the 2001 season, when a shadow-of-his-former-self Terrell Davis in his final eight games of his career kept both on the bench. In the eight games Davis played that season, he rushed 167 times for 701 yards, (4.2 yards per carry). In the eight games he missed, Anderson rushed 141 times for 537 yards, a 3.8 yards per carry clip (in the games Davis played, Anderson received just 34 carries).\n\nBrian Burke, (formerly of Advanced Football Analytics, now of ESPN), created an âEstimated Points Addedâ, (or EPA), model of production that measures how much each individual play contributes to a teamâs bottom line. Unfortunately, Burkeâs statistics donât go back to before 1999, so we can never know how valuable Davis was by that method. Itâs fairly safe to say that the Broncos would have ranked rather high, though.\n\nIn the 6 years after Davisâ injury, Denver ranked 12th, 9th, 18th, 4th, 2nd, and 9th in rushing EPA. Outside of the two exceptional Clinton Portis years, Denver typically settled in the âabove averageâ range for rushing production. Which means Davisâ Hall of Fame candidacy is being dinged because (A) three years after his injury Denver drafted a genuinely great running back, and (B) Denver got good but unspectacular production from Davisâ immediate replacements.\n\nThis is such a loaded argument, though. The year after Jim Brown retired, Cleveland sent not one but two running backs to the Pro Bowl; one of Brownâs replacements, Leroy Kelly, would make three straight first-team AP All Pro teams, make the All-Decade squad, and eventually make the Hall of Fame.\n\nJoe Montanaâs direct replacement, Steve Young, would likewise make three straight first-team AP All Pro squads, win two league MVPs, and make the Hall of Fame. Steve Youngâs direct replacement, Jeff Garcia, would earn a trip to three straight pro bowls after Young retired. In fact, in his first full year as a starter, Garcia would pass for 4,000 yards and rush for 400 yards, becoming just the second player in history to reach both marks behindâ¦ Steve Young.\n\nIt could be argued that Montana was himself a successor of Ken Anderson, who many consider the best player not currently in the Hall of Fame. Marshall Faulk had two direct successors in his career, (Edgerrin James and Steven Jackson), and both of them accumulated 15,000 career yards from scrimmage. St. Louis finished in the top 5 in passing yards in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 as they moved on from Kurt Warner to Marc Bulger. Two years after Barry Sanders retired, James Stewart had 1400 yards from scrimmage with Detroit.\n\nHow many times was Jeff Garcia mentioned when Steve Young was brought to the floor for debate? Iâm not on the Hall of Fame committee, so I donât know. But Iâd venture it was probably as many times as he deserved to be mentioned: zero. Steve Youngâs Hall of Fame case depended on the merits of Steve Youngâs play and nothing more.\n\nSimilarly, Terrell Davisâ candidacy should rest on how good Terrell Davis himself was, and the answer is âexceptionally goodâ. His peak was incandescent, including two of the greatest seasons in NFL history by any measure. His trophy case is stuffed full and his profile is positively littered with black ink, finishing in the top half of modern Hall of Famers at the position. He was perhaps the greatest postseason performer in NFL history and he retired with two rings and a Super Bowl MVP for one of the most iconic big-game performances the league has seen, a 160-yard, three-touchdown affair, (including the game-winner), where Davis missed literally the entire second quarter to a migraine. Davis did more in his four seasons before injury robbed him of his ability than most backs do in an entire, full career.\n\nThe Hall of Fame has made exceptions for brilliant players with short careers in the past.

  "latent_23723": "A visionary and bizarre slice of Mexican art house cinema, We Are The Flesh is an extraordinary and unsettling film experience, a sexually charged and nightmarish journey into an other worldy dimension of carnal desire and excess, as well as a powerful allegory on the corrupting power of human desire.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nA young brother and sister, roaming an apocalyptic city, take refuge in the dilapidated lair of a strange hermit. He puts them to work building a bizarre cavernous structure, where he acts out his insane and depraved fantasies. Trapped in this maddening womb-like world under his malign influence, they find themselves sinking into the realms of dark and forbidden behaviour.\n\nOverview:\n\nAcclaimed by the Oscar-winning Mexican directors of The Revenant and Gravity, and playing to rave reviews and stunned audiences at genre film festivals around the world We Are The Flesh is that rare beast â an intelligent, beautifully-crafted art house film that is also provocative and deeply disturbing.\n\nMixing the graphic, powerful imagery of Gaspar NoÃ©âs Love and Enter The Void with the surreal, hallucinatory impact of Alejandro Jodorowsky, and taking Mexican arthouse cannibal flick We Are What We Are to the next level, We Are The Flesh is a bizarre, psychedelic head trip, mixing intense, outrageously explicit imagery with a profound allegory on the nature of existence, to make this is an unforgettable, boundary-pushing experience unlike anything youâve ever seen.\n\nVisionary, unrelenting, and certainly not for the prudish or faint-hearted, We Are The Flesh is an erotic inferno of the senses that manages to pack all manner of delirium into its short running time, including incest, necrophilia, and cannibalism.

  "latent_23909": "CLOSE An Alabama church could soon be the first U.S. church to create its own police force. Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\n. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nAn Alabama Presbyterian church may soon become the first in the nation to form its own police force, invested by the state with the rights of âregularâ police.\n\nOfficials at Briarwood Presbyterian Church, which belongs to the smaller and more conservative of the nationâs two major branches of the denomination, say their church, with 4,100 congregants and a 2,000-student school, needs the protection of a church-run police force.\n\nHiring local police, as many congregations do, isnât the best option for Briarwood, they say, because it often needs more officers than local departments can provide. They also cite as a cautionary tale the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, in which a gunman fatally shot 20 first-graders and six staff members in a Connecticut public school.\n\nâAfter the shooting at Sandy Hook and in the wake of similar assaults at churches and schools, Briarwood recognized the need to provide qualified first responders to coordinate with local law enforcement who so heroically and effectively serve their communities,â they said in a statement.\n\nThe state Senate voted 24-4 Tuesday to give Briarwood, located 10 miles south of downtown Birmingham, permission to hire its own police. The measure now goes to the House, and if it passes there as expected, it will go to Gov. Kay Ivey for her signature. Ivey, who was sworn in this week after the sudden resignation of Robert Bentley, did not immediately return calls Thursday about the Briarwood bill.\n\nThe billâs critics, including the stateâs branch of the ACLU, fault the church and the Senate for blurring the line separating church and state and call the bill an affront to the Constitutionâs establishment clause that would not hold up if challenged.\n\nâThe proposal to authorize Briarwood Presbyterian Church to form its own police force places a core governmental function, with all the powers of the state, into the hands or a religious institution to exercise at its discretion with no governmental oversight,â said Randall C. Marshall, legal director of the ACLU of Alabama.\n\nâIt also singles out one particular church out of the thousands of churches, synagogues, mosques, and other religious entities in Alabama that may have similar concerns, thereby favoring one specific religious group,â Marshall said.\n\nThe church, however, likens its proposed police force to those of several Alabama colleges and universities, which are also state-sanctioned.\n\nThe bill has attracted the attention of Muslim comedian and commentator Dean Obeidallah, who notes the death threats sent to Alabama mosques recently, and the stateâs ban of shariah, or Islamic law â a measure opponents called unnecessary and Islamophobic.\n\nChurches have a right to be safe, Obeidallah wrote. âBut do you think if Muslims in Alabama asked to create their own police force to protect their mosque we would see the GOP members of the Alabama Legislature be as supportive as they are to the Briarwood church?â\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2pfreYi",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nMay 4, 2017, 2:52 PM GMT / Updated May 4, 2017, 6:24 PM GMT By Andrew Rafferty\n\nPresident Donald Trump's first foreign trip since entering office will take him to Israel, the Vatican and Saudi Arabia later this month, a senior White House official confirmed to NBC News.\n\nTrump will end his trip in Brussels with a visit to NATO on May 25, followed by a meeting at the G7 summit in Sicily.\n\nIn remarks in the Rose Garden on Thursday, Trump said the trip âwill begin to construct a new foundation of cooperation and support with our Muslim allies to combat extremism, terrorism and violence and to embrace a more just and hopeful future for young Muslims in their countries.â\n\n\"Our task is not to dictate to other how to live, but to build a coalition of friends and partners who share the goal of fighting terrorism,â the president added.\n\nTrumpâs first stop in Saudi Arabia will be vital to that effort. White House officials told reporters that Saudi leaders will bring together Arab leaders to craft a breakthrough down the road on Middle East peace, as well as develop a long-term plan to cut ISIS funding and get those in the region to contribute more to the fight.\n\nThe president's first foreign trip is typically seen as a signal of the new administration's priorities. So it is no surprise the president will visit Israel, which Trump pledged to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with during his 2016 campaign, and he has since promised to help broker a peace deal with the Palestinians.\n\nThe announcement comes on the heels of Trump's meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday. Trump has said he wants to serve as a \"mediator, arbiter or facilitator\" to help Israel and Palestine reach a peace accord but added, \"Any agreement cannot be imposed by the United States or any other nations.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House in February.\n\nThe president has also accepted an invitation from Abbas to meet during his trip, according to a White House statement.\n\nDescribing the president's plan for Middle East peace, one senior administration official described Trump as \"an optimist.\"\n\nThe NATO visit is also a significant stop for the presidentâs first foreign swing. As a candidate, Trump railed against NATO, claiming the United States contributes too much with little in return. But last month Trump said the organization was âno longer obsoleteâ but he is continuing to insist many member countries must spend more on defense as the alliance requires.\n\nTrump has also had a history with Pope Francis, who once said of candidate Trump: âA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.\" The comment drew a sharp rebuke from Trump.\n\n\"If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS's ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president because this would not have happened,\" Trump said in a statement last year.\n\nThe pope later, after Trump was elected, sent the newly minted president well wishes and said he was praying that his âdecisions will be guided by the rich spiritual and ethical values that have shaped the history of the American people and your nationâs commitment to the advancement of human dignity and freedom worldwide.â",

  "latent_24472": "The Wall Street Journal reports on Peter W. Smith's suicide,\n\nand his attempts to acquire Hillary's 33,000 deleted emails.5\n\nKlaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official, has been found dead in a Miami hotel, just days before he was due to testify about corruption in Haiti. The Miami-Dade medical examiner, Veronica Lamar, has ruled it a suicide, stating, âHe shot himself in the head.â Eberwein was due to testify before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission next Tuesday, where he was expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.According to Eberwein, only 0.6% of the billions donated by international donors to the Clinton Foundation for Haiti actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations. 1 At a protest least year outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan, Eberwein said: In light of Eberwein's obvious passion to see the Clinton Foundation brought to justice, it seems strange that he would commit suicide only days before he was due to testify against them.Eberwein's associate, Gilbert Bailly, met with Eberwein only two weeks prior to his death, and said that Eberwein was 'in a good mood' 2 . This raises the question, why would Eberwein, who was in good spirits, commit suicide only days before he would have the chance to testify on the Clinton Foundation's corruption to the Haitian Anti-Corruption Commission?This is the second suicide in recent weeks which could be described as 'convenient' for Hillary Clinton. Eberwein's suicide comes only weeks after the suicide of Peter W. Smith , who had sought to acquire and release Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails prior to his suicide. These were the subpoenaed emails which Hillary Clinton deleted with BleachBit 3 , before then destroying her mobile phones with hammers. 4 In the words of Trey Gowdy, \"When you're using BleachBit it is something you really do not want the world to see.\" 6 Given that Smith was seeking to acquire and release these deleted 33,000 emails which Hillary 'did not want the world to see', Smith's suicide may therefore have seemed suspicious. However, fortunately for Hillary Clinton, Smith left a suicide note stating, âNO FOUL PLAY WHATSOEVER.â 7 Also fortunate for Hillary Clinton is that the suicide note was written in capital letters, making it difficult to verify Smith's handwriting.The average person, if they live a long life, will know one or two people who commit suicide or die in suspicious circumstances. For Hillary Clinton, that figure is now approaching triple figures. 8 With that in mind, I wish to state that, for the record, I am not considering suicide.- - - - - - - - - -",
  "latent_24504": "Carolina Panthers general manager Dave Gettleman continues to be the target of offseason scrutiny surrounding his handling, or non handling, of Kawann Shortâs contract extension. While casual observers may feel Gettleman is just being tight with owner Jerry Richardsonâs money, a closer look reveals he may be simply making smart business decisions.\n\nFirst, let us state the obvious. Kawann Short is a tremendous young player that deserves to be paid. Good, we all agree. Many national pundits stop there, but lets instead think as a good general manager might.\n\nSigning Kawann Short today would lock him up for several years on the Carolina Panthers roster at a premium price. A price so high it would likely effect all remaining contracts this year and next. A price that could make it more difficult to keep other valuable Carolina Panthers players. For example, Kony Ealy, Trai Turner and Andrew Norwell contract extensions will be coming up sooner than you think. All three are currently playing under their affordable rookie contracts. None have fifth year options, as none were first round selections. In other words, three very important Panthers players will soon be paid and extended, likely by this time next year.\n\nWhat does Gettleman risk by not signing Short immediately? He risks a Kawann Short holdout next year if/when he decides to place the dreaded NFL franchise tag on him. Thatâs it, thatâs all. Gettleman delays paying the man what he would have paid him anyways by one year. Dave Gettleman still has the exact same opportunity to sign Short to a long term contract next year.\n\nNow lets look at the benefits of not signing Short to an expensive long term deal today. For starters, 2016 will be a contract year for Kawann. Historically, contract years have provided extra motivation for NFL players, hoping to cash in on their production. Kawann was fantastic in a non-contract year last season. Imagine what he may do this year with the extra monetary incentive.\n\nThen consider the rookie Vernon Butler, who has impressed so far this offseason. What if, by chance, there is little drop off between Butler and Short? Suddenly not extending Kawann Short and keeping Vernon Butler (who as has FIVE affordable seasons ahead of him) looks like a brilliant move. Will Butler be as good as Short? Who knows, but crazier things have happened. If so, extending Ealy, Turner, and Norwell long term next year becomes much easier.\n\nLastly, what happens if Short does regress this in 2016. As unlikely as that sounds, it does happen. If so, his price tag would then drop substantially next year while still having a promising career ahead of him. Gettleman would benefit from having patience to wait and see. Perhaps patience really is a virtue after all.\n\nLooking at the entire picture described above, it appears to me that Dave Gettleman stands to lose very little (if anything at all) by not extending Kawann Shortâs contract today. However, he has plenty to gain by taking a âwait and see approachâ. In other wordsâ¦chess, not checkers.\n\nYou can discus this article with thousands of Panthers Fans in our Panthers Forum.",
  "latent_24807": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Small water frogs marketed and sold as pets are linked to an outbreak of Salmonella infections from 2008 to 2011, according to a report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nUnder a very high magnification of 12000X, this undated colorized scanning electron micrograph shows a large grouping of Gram-negative Salmonella bacteria. REUTERS/Janice Haney Carr/CDC/Handout/Files\n\nThe report published in Pediatrics on Monday found the infection sickened 376 people in 44 U.S. states and sent 29 percent of those infected to the hospital - mostly children.\n\nâThis was the first Salmonella outbreak associated with aquatic frogs, and in this case the frogs are often marketed as good pets for kids,â said Shauna Mettee Zarecki, the studyâs lead author from the CDC in Atlanta.\n\nâThe majority of people didnât realize there were any risks from these amphibians or reptiles, like turtles and snakes,â she added.\n\nWhile most people hear about Salmonella-contaminated food, Mettee Zarecki said reptiles and amphibians also carry the bacteria. Humans can become infected after handling the animals, cleaning their containers or coming in contact with contaminated water.\n\nPeople infected with Salmonella can have prolonged diarrhea, cramps, vomiting and a persistent fever. The infection can be deadly if itâs left untreated, and itâs most dangerous in the young, elderly and people with weak immune systems.\n\nPrevious research has found that reptiles and amphibians are responsible for about 74,000 Salmonella infections in the U.S. every year.\n\nIn the new report, Mettee Zarecki and her colleagues write that researchers from the CDC - along with state and local health departments - investigated an outbreak of Salmonella infections, mostly among children, in 2008.\n\nBy early 2009, the number of cases returned to normal before the researchers could find a cause. The investigation was started again when five more children were infected with the same strain of Salmonella in Utah later that year.\n\nTo find what was behind the outbreak, the researchers interviewed people who were infected with that strain of Salmonella from January 2008 through December 2011. They asked each person what animals and food they were exposed to in the week before they got sick.\n\nThey then compared the data from 18 people with that strain of the bacteria to 29 people who were infected with a different type of Salmonella.\n\nOverall, they found 67 percent of the people in the new outbreak were exposed to frogs during the week before their illness, compared to 3 percent in the comparison group.\n\nThe majority of people who came in contact with a frog during the week before they got sick remembered the type - an African dwarf frog.\n\nâEverything really linked these frogs with the illnesses,â said Mettee Zarecki.\n\nThe investigation eventually led to an African dwarf frog breeding facility in Madera County, California. There, researchers found the same strain of the bacteria in the facilityâs tank water, tank cleaning equipment, water filters and floor drains.\n\nThe facility started distributing frogs again in June 2011, after the owner voluntarily shut down the operation and instituted cleaning measures.\n\nThe researchers write, however, that African dwarf frogs can live for five to 18 years, which means infected frogs may still be in homes and continue to cause illness.\n\nâThe important consideration with any aquatic pet is to provide adequate filtration to keep the water clean and perform regular partial water changes,â said Dr. Nicholas Saint-Erne, a veterinarian for PetSmart, Inc., in a statement to Reuters Health.\n\nSaint-Erne, who was not involved with the new report, added that people with questions should ask veterinarians who specialize in aquatic animals or reptiles to help âensure their pets are healthy and being given the proper care and nutrition.â\n\nâIf these aquariums are in homes, children under five (years old) shouldnât be allowed to clean the aquarium,â said Mettee Zarecki, adding that also applies to people with weakened immune systems.\n\nâPets are wonderful. We think theyâre a great learning tool for children, but some pets just arenât appropriate for children or individualsâ with weakened immune systems, she added.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/HjQ8dI Pediatrics, online March 11, 2013.",
  "latent_24836": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo. -- Doug McDermott put on a one-man show for Creighton.\n\nThe All-America forward scored a season-high 39 points, including all 18 for the Bluejays in the first 7:12 of the second half, and No. 13 Creighton beat Missouri State 74-52 on Friday night.\n\n\"I was just in a zone,\" McDermott said. \"My teammates saw that and they kind of kept giving me the ball.\"\n\nMcDermott, the reigning Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year, was perfect on his first 10 field goal attempts in the second half as he sent the Bluejays (16-1, 5-0) to their 10th consecutive win. He outscored Missouri State 18-5 over the first 7:12 after halftime, hitting from the perimeter and bulling his way in the lane.\n\nHe finally missed from the field with about 5 minutes left and soon his night was done.\n\nMcDermott shot 15 of 19 from the floor and 6 for 7 at the foul line. He also grabbed a game-high 10 rebounds and went 3 of 4 from 3-point range. His 39 points were five more than he had against California last month and five shy of his career high set a year ago against Bradley.\n\n\"It was one of the better games I've ever played in my life,\" McDermott said.\n\nCreighton led 32-27 after a sluggish first half in which Missouri State (5-12, 3-2) deliberately ran a slow, half-court offense and then took advantage when the Bluejays left an opening.\n\n\"They fought us that first half,\" said Creighton coach Greg McDermott, father of the team's star player. \"We were able to get the rebounds, and Doug got on an unbelievable roll, one you don't see too often in college basketball. When that happens with him, we kind of give him the ball and get out of his way.\"\n\nKeith Pickens scored 11 points and Anthony Downing added 10 to lead the Bears, who shot 11 of 31 in the second half as Creighton turned to a triangle-and-2 defense and scuttled their surprising start to the conference season.\n\nWith McDermott leading the way, the Bluejays stifled Missouri State and benefited from the Bears' impatience. They were 3 of 15 on 3-pointers after halftime.\n\nIt was a tough setback for Missouri State, which was playing well after a 2-10 start this season.\n\nCreighton struggled to establish a rhythm in the first half as Missouri State employed a defense that dared the Bluejays to hit 3-pointers while the Bears doubled 6-foot-9 Gregory Echenique.\n\nEchenique, who averages almost 11 points and eight rebounds per game, had only one field goal in 10 minutes of first-half play.\n\n\"That was the focus of the game,\" Downing said. \"Before we came out, Coach said that we needed to dictate the tempo of the game because if we got into a horse race with them, they'd end up scoring 90 on us.\"\n\nThe Bears got a nice lift from little-used reserve Tommie Aromora, who hit a pair of baskets, including a 3-pointer, as Missouri State stayed close throughout the first half.\n\nBut the Bears withered and clearly missed freshman guard Marcus Marshall, a starter who twisted his ankle in Tuesday's surprise win against Illinois State. Marshall, bothered by flulike symptoms in recent days, is Missouri State's second-leading scorer at 10. 1 points a game.\n\nJahenns Maniget scored 11 points for the Bluejays, who shot 57 percent (27 of 47) for the game.\n\n\"I thought we had a pretty good first half and then I thought Creighton just picked it up a notch,\" Missouri State coach Paul Lusk said. \"We didn't guard a couple of guys to start the second half, and it was a domino effect after that and then McDermott got going. He wore us out in every aspect.\"",

  "latent_25070": "The digital currency bitcoin is on another remarkable run, soaring nearly 65% in the last month, and smashing the symbolic $2,000 mark for the first time ever this week. Bitcoin has gone on tears in the past, but never quite like this.\n\nSo whatâs behind the latest bull run? Itâs hard to say for sure, since bitcoin is so unpredictable, but here are three factors that are contributing to bitcoinâs boom:\n\n1. The Worldwide Demand for Digital Currency\n\nThe $2,000 bitcoin milestone comes amid a larger trend of investors clamoring for crypto-currency of all sorts. While digital money was once seen as the province of cranks and computers geeks, itâs now so mainstream that investors see it as a new asset class and are creating hundred million dollar hedge funds to acquire it.\n\nMeanwhile, others see digital currencies as an asset like gold, which can hold its value amid times of government instability. Recent political upheaval in Brazil and the United States, which led to drops in the dollar and the real, may have contributed to the recent uptick in bitcoin buying.\n\nFinally, bitcoin may be benefiting indirectly from a recent explosion in the value of other digital currencies like Lumens, Ethereum and Litecoin. While itâs possible to buy these currencies with dollars or other traditional currencies, itâs often simpler to use bitcoins (which is the easiest digital currency to acquire) to buy them. In other words, more people may be buying bitcoin as a vehicle to invest in more exotic currencies.\n\n2. Japan and China\n\nAt the start of April, regulators in Japan introduced new rules that treated bitcoin less like an outlaw currency and more as a part of the banking system. That change led to a burst of trading activity in the country investors rushed to swap yen for bitcoin. The effect on price has been predicable.\n\nAnd in China, where the authorities have long had a love-hate relation with bitcoin, it appears the country is growing more tolerant once again. As CNBC reported, analysts are pointing to a big drop in the difference in bitcoin prices between U.S. and Chinese exchanges. This suggests bitcoin-related investments in China are less risky:\n\nThe discount that $CNY #bitcoin exchanges trade to $USD exchanges has dropped from 20% to 5% in the period of a week. China awaking? https://t.co/Pr9QJTLLKP â Chris Burniske (@cburniske) May 20, 2017\n\nIn other words, a whole lot of Asian investment is causing bitcoin to soar.\n\n3. Hype and Hoopla\n\nIf youâve followed bitcoin for a while, you know the currency is prone to spectacular crashes. The crashes followed flurries of press reports about the value of bitcoin, which created a hype cycle, and in turn drew the attention of mainstream investors who helped inflate the price.\n\nIt sure feels like weâre in the midst of a hype cycle now. Social media is buzzing about the incredible surge in the value of crypto-currency assets. And this yearâs edition of Consensus, a three-day trade show in New York, promises to be the splashiest yet with big names like IBM and Microsoft appearing alongside a long list of venture capital firms.\n\nThere a lot of good reasons for the hypeânot least because digital currency and blockchain technology (an online ledger system that relies on multiple computers) has gone mainstreamâbut also reasons for caution. As with past hype cycles, there are far more people cheering for bitcoin than against it. This is partly because there are few people who truly understand digital currency, and most of those who do own a large amount of it, so skeptics are in short supply.\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, the value of a bitcoin was $2,020, according to Coinbase.",
  "latent_25216": "Planting\n\nCypripedium prefer soil that is low in organic matter and has good draining properties. Airing the soil is recommended, using a mineral substrate (at least 50%) such as sand, Argex, pouzzolane or ideally lava stone (vulca). As organic matter, a little finely crushed pine bark or some compost based on coconut leaves or fibres could be added.\n\nIt is important not only that the rhizomes of the Cypripedium do not desiccate in summer but also that they are not immersed in winter. The various mineral substrates will ensure good moisture retention in summer while encouraging good drainage during the winter.\n\nExposure\n\nIn the garden, we recommend planting Cypripedium in a cool, shaded or semi-shaded place. Sunlight at the hottest hours of the day is to be avoided.\n\nGrowth Phase...\n\nDuring the winter, the plant persists in rhizome form and does not require any special protection.\n\nThe new Cypripedium shoots usually appear during April. Once started, the vegetation grows very quickly; in 3 to 5 weeks, the foliage has opened out. The flowering extends from the end of April to June. At the end of the summer, the foliage yellows then fades before disappearing completely. Cypripedium then go into their winter dormancy.\n\nOver the years and following the successive growth and dormancy cycles, Cypripedium not only become stronger but also multiply, thanks to the annual appearance of new shoots.",
  "latent_25244": "Every so often, someone asks how I manage my collection. I thought that it might benefit the community at large to share my solution and do a review of sorts. This will be one of the few post that you find on this site that has nothing to do with Pelikan. When you get your first pen, you have no need for spreadsheets. Often times, itâs not long before you add a second pen and then a third. Before you know it, you have a collection and a desire to keep a better accounting of it. I think that it is important for any collector to have a record of past purchases with detailed accounts of those transactions. Weâve all been in a position of having to figure out the best way to do this. Initially I used Microsoft Word in conjunction with Excel. This was a very workable solution in the early days but as my collection grew, I felt that this method lacked flexibility. It became harder and harder to keep track of the variables that I was interested in and data began to become the enemy rather than an asset. I decided to search the web and see what other solutions might be out there. I didnât expect to find something geared for the fountain pen enthusiast but was hoping to at least find a solution that could be retrofitted to that purpose. I wanted an option that wasnât too expensive, provided flexibility, and would allow me to have a birdâs eye view of my collection by being easily searchable. In that quest, I found Recollector, a piece of software designed for the collector of just about anything.\n\nRecollector is put out by MapRecord Publications which was founded in 2002 by Jeremy Pool. Jeremy is a collector of antique maps and became interested in developing a software solution that would organize and catalog his collection. Iâm sure a fountain pen was never even a remote consideration when Recollector was designed nor any number of the odd things that people collect. Despite this lack of specificity, Recollector has proven to be a powerful tool and that power comes from its versatility and ease of customization. When you create a new collection with Recollector, you get a generic template and from there, you can customize it to your heartâs content with fields that are relevant to you. No computer expertise? No problem. While Iâm computer savvy, Iâm certainly no programmer. I found the process of adding fields, rearranging them, and creating pick lists very straight forward.\n\nAvailable for both Mac and PCs, Recollector continues to be actively developed and tested on both platforms. Updates and bug fixes have been regular occurrences and Jeremy is very responsive to user feedback and new feature implementation when deemed appropriate/feasible. There is an online user guide, video tutorials, an online forum, and direct email/phone support when all else fails. All of the support materials are thorough and easy to understand and follow. When first setting up your collection, there is a wizard to walk you through the process. Going through the wizard will establish a collection name, a template, pertinent fields, units of measure/currency, and where your collection will be stored on your computer. There are a few templates but I found that a heavily customized general template worked the best for my purpose.\n\nOnce you have run the wizard, it is easy to begin adding items to the database. Forgot a field or came up with something to add later? It is a very painless process to add additional fields at any time, even after you have entered your entire collection. I particularly like the option to create pick lists which creates a pull-down menu of options that youâve pre-specified. For instance, nib sizes are fairly standard so you can have a menu where you simply select EF, F, M, B, etc. You can make pick list for any field that requires simple text input. If you happen to have a lot of pens of similar size or other characteristics, the input process can be sped up by copying fields from one entry into another. This has been invaluable to me in filling out general information such as dimensions for a lot of similar models that may only vary in color but not size.\n\nOnce you have entered all of your data, the real flexibility of the program shines through. You can view your data either in a list format, as an image gallery, or as individual entries. These views are easily sortable by a variety of criteria giving you a lot of control as to how you view your data. This is great because not everybody values the same variables when evaluating their collection. The search function is powerful and allows you to search the entire database or just a certain field. Taking that one step further, you can actually create subsets, either on the fly with a search or as a standing grouping that can quickly be accessed. For instance, you could create a subset of just piston fillers or of a certain model. You may have hundreds of pens but if you only want to see your red ones listed, the list can be instantly adjusted to just that subset. This is one of the things that puts Recollector well ahead of the Word/Excel solution.\n\nOne of the issues that challenged me previously was how to take my collection on the road, particularly when at pen shows or at brick and mortar shops. Previously, I would put my *.doc or *.xls files in the cloud and then view them when needed. This became a very inelegant solution as the collection grew. Recollector solves this with a companion app for both Appleâs iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch and Googleâs Android platforms. This is a read only program that piggy backs off of Dropbox to upload the Recollector database for mobile viewing on the go. I love being able to have all of the details of my collection within the palm of my hand. I have found this invaluable as I now have all of the fields of the desktop version with all the same searchability. Other features of note include the ability to import/export Excel or CSV files, create a collection via a wizard for upload to a website, and the ability to generate printable reports. The report feature is particularly nice as you can choose which fields get included in the output as well as what order those fields are listed. The file is a PDF and can even include an automatically generated index as well as a total cost if youâre brave enough to look. Finally, it is easy to create a backup of your data as well as place a password on your collection to keep out the prying eyes of significant others.\n\nRecollector is very versatile and easily customized. While not designed specifically for fountain pen collecting, it is fountain pen friendly. Itâs a great cataloging tool though it does lack some polish as far as the graphic interface goes. Thatâs fine by me as Iâd rather have a piece of software that works over one that looks pretty. The program is offered as a free trial which allows you to create and save 25 records before requiring a license. The cost of that license is a one time price of $49 which gets you both the desktop and mobile software along with free technical support and unlimited updates. Given what this can do for your collection combined with the ongoing development and responsiveness of the developer, it is money well spent. I have used the program for several months now and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a collection management solution. Recollector is not the only software out there but it is the one that meets my needs and thatâs the most important aspect of any software. Consider giving it a try if youâre looking for a solution and see if it can help you too.\n\nPros:\n\nEasily customizable fields with pick lists\n\nAbility to create and save subsets or make them on the fly\n\nVery little technical savvy required\n\nReasonable price considering all that your purchase buys\n\nVery responsive tech support from the creator himself\n\nCons:\n\nMobile app is read-only and does not allow data input\n\nMobile app requires a separate (free) Dropbox account\n\nGraphic interface is a little lacking on polish\n\nRecollector can be found at Collectingcatalog.com\n\nEvaluation Platforms:\n\nRecollector for Mac version 1.6.10 & Recollector App for iOS version 1.17\n\nMacBook Pro Retina (Late 2013) with OS X El Capitan version 10.11.6\n\niPhone 6 with iOS 9.3.3\n\n*I have no affiliation with the vendor or the creator of this software.

But adrenaline junkies will want to head outdoors for the newest challenge: the 66-foot-tall Wild Vortex, which debuted in June.\n\nWhile the ride lasts only seven seconds, don't underestimate the rush you can get from its sharp vertical plunge and a gravity-powered loop-the-loop, which riders experience at a 2.5 g-force.\n\nCrazy Fact: Don't like surprises?

After multiple spins, riders are dropped through a central chute and into a large splash pool.\n\nCrazy Fact: A YouTube search of bowl slides turns up videos of unsuspecting riders getting stuck in the \"drain.\" Not on this slide. ProSlide's patented CorkScrewâ¢ exit system is the ride's essential design component and ensures a safe ejection. Phew.\n\nInsano\n\nWhere: Beach Park, Aquiraz, Brazil\n\nBrazil's 135-foot attraction stands out from the crowd, even if it's not quite the tallest waterslide to make our list (Italy's 197-foot Divertical takes that title). Riders are certainly impressed and wait in line to brave that infamous 14-story drop. And you can expect those lines to get longer: In 2011, Brazil's largest water park hosted 788,000 visitors, which represents a 7% increase from the prior year.\n\nCrazy Fact: The singular sharp slope produces a rapid descent; Insano plunges at a speed of 65 mph, taking riders from start to heart-pounding finish in less than five seconds.\n\nDivertical\n\nWhere: Mirabilandia, Ravenna, Italy\n\nSay hello to the world's tallest water ride: the $26 million Divertical, which officially debuted in June. The coaster features a one-of-a-kind elevator lift system that brings 10-person boats to the top of the 197-foot-tall attraction. As they slide along a roller coaster track, riders face drops, hairpin turns and then an oversize splash pool at the finish line.\n\nCrazy Fact: The initial plunge takes you through a 45-degree water flume at more than 65 mph.\n\nWiegand Maelzer Slide Tower\n\nWhere: Area 47, Tyrol, Austria\n\nThis stainless-steel lakeside attraction showcases flawless craftsmanship -- not to mention a handful of pretty extreme slides. After climbing up the 90-foot tower, riders have their pick among five, including a 328-foot-long chute with an added jump section at the bottom.\n\nCrazy Fact: The tower is also fitted with five diving boards (at 6.5, 16, 33, 66 and 91 feet high), though the tallest two are reserved for professional divers.\n\nLeap of Faith\n\nWhere: Aquaventure Water Park, Atlantis Paradise Island, Bahamas\n\nThis 60-foot-tall, nearly perpendicular slide cascades down a life-size replica of a Mayan temple -- the hallmark of the resort's 140-acre waterscape. But for many, the real \"leap of faith\" occurs after the initial drop when you're subsequently propelled through a clear acrylic tunnel in a shark-infested lagoon.\n\nCrazy Fact: In 2008, a female reef shark vaulted out of its tank and landed on the slide. While no resort guests were harmed (the water park had yet to open for the morning), the shark could not tolerate the chlorinated water and died shortly afterward.\n\nCliffhanger\n\nWhere: Schlitterbahn, Galveston, Texas\n\nThe park's crowd-pleasing attraction, which debuted in 2007, was part of a significant expansion -- and Cliffhanger still stands as the tallest and steepest ride among all four Schlitterbahn parks in the U.S. Like Summit Plummet, this single body slide consists of an alarming vertical drop. After being propelled from the top of the tower, riders plunge nearly 81 feet at speeds of up to 35 mph.\n\nCrazy Fact: The Cliffhanger is designed as an open chute, so you'll be fully aware and exposed every second of that free-fall drop.\n\nMammoth\n\nWhere: Holiday World and Splashin' Safari, Santa Claus, Indiana\n\nThe $5.5 million Wildebeest ride, a high-speed hydromagnetic water coaster that uses linear induction motor technology, put this water park on the map in 2011. Holiday World continues to expand with Mammoth, a slide towering seven stories and stretching more than three acres -- making it the world's longest water coaster. (Wildebeest takes second place.)\n\nCrazy Fact: Six-person rafts are propelled up and down hills in 12-foot-wide channels. There are five enclosed slide sections, which means you'll be doing that twisting and shouting in the dark.\n\nAquaDuck\n\nWhere: Disney Dream and Disney Fantasy cruise ships\n\nMeet \"the Duck\" -- the cruise industry's first-ever shipboard water coaster. The 765-foot-long, four-deck-high AquaDuck debuted on Disney Dream in 2011 and has since been added to Disney Fantasy. Atop the aft deck, passengers hop on a two-person inflatable raft that is then propelled forward by high-powered water jets. Expect to be dropped, looped around and accelerated.\n\nCrazy Fact: After the initial drop, riders are thrust through a clear acrylic \"swing out\" flume that extends 12 feet over the side of the ship -- and 150 feet above the ocean's surface.\n\nMount Gushmore's Summit Plummet\n\nWhere: Blizzard Beach at Walt Disney World, Orlando\n\nThe first thing you see when you enter Blizzard Beach is 90-foot snowcapped Mount Gushmore, the world's most photographed faux-mountain and home to one of the fastest free-fall speed slides. From the Summit's ski jump tower, riders take a vertical plunge straight down to the base of the mountain.",
  "latent_25928": "6 hours; thatâs how quickly the Stadio San Paolo sold out for the upcoming UEFA Champions League clash with Real Madrid.\n\nDespite this being the 2nd leg and with the events of the first encounter yet to run their course, anticipation for this clash has gripped the city of Naples with tickets being sold on secondary markets such as eBay for well over the original asking price, and although on Wednesday the club announced a clamp down on anyone presenting tickets bought via these channels, this will do little to dampen the spirits of a support with high expectations.\n\nNapoli is no stranger to big Champions League ties and the rekindling of an on field rivalry that last took place in season 1987/88 is only the next in a long list of huge clashes to rock the Stadio San Paolo. However, when looking back where does this particular tie rank among previous âmust winâ clashes? I took a trip down memory lane to compare:\n\nThe 2011/12 Champions League campaign was Napoliâs first foray into Europeâs top club competition since season 1990/91, and they didnât disappoint as they more than held their own in a group consisting of Bayern Munich, Manchester City, and Villarreal. Having qualified for the knockout phase in second place two points behind Bayern Munich and a single point ahead of Manchester City, their exploits saw them face Chelsea in what remains a tie Napoli fans look back on as one they should have come through.\n\nDespite defeating the Premier League side 3-1 at the San Paolo in the first leg, they went on to lose the second leg 3-1 at Stamford Bridge in 90 minutes, taking the tie into extra time where Chelsea eventually triumphed with a goal by Branislav Ivanovic. In Naples however, the tie should have been dead and buried, as Napoli surged back in the 2nd half to take a 3-1 lead over the Londoners and who could forget that last gasp clearance off the line by Ashley Cole from Christian Maggio in what would have seen Napoli take a 3 goal lead to Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe importance of finishing top of your group in the Champions League was painfully emphasised as Napoli dropped out of the competition at the first knock out hurdle and, to add insult to injury, the final was contested by the side who finished above Napoli in their group and the side who knocked them out of the competition completely, with Chelsea emerging victorious to lift the trophy on penalties.\n\nIt would be two years before Napoli would return to the competition, in season 2013/14 and it would see the club claim the most unwanted of records, becoming the first and only club to be eliminated from the competition despite finishing with 12 points, a single point more than their previous haul in 2011/12âs campaign.\n\nTwo campaigns, two tales of woeful luck, and ironically as we fast forward to present day, it appears nothing has changed. In a cruel twist of fate, Napoli would win every one of their three home ties against Arsenal (2-0), Borussia Dortmund (2-1), and Marseille (3-2) and pick up a solitary win away from home, a 2-1 win over Marseille, as the top three clubs in the group (Dortmund, Arsenal, and Napoli) finished on 12 points. Ultimately, the Partenopei went out with a goal difference of +1 versus +3 of Arsenal; overall goal difference being used because both Arsenal and Napoli had identical head to head records of one win each, 2 goals for and 2 goals against.Two campaigns, two tales of woeful luck, and ironically as we fast forward to present day, it appears nothing has changed.\n\nThis season, despite a few hiccups along the way in the guise of a home loss to Besiktas and a goalless draw with Dynamo Kyiv, Napoli finally did what everyone has said they must; win their group. However in an ironic, some would say unbelievable turn of events, both Real Madrid and Bayern Munich contrived to finish second in their respective groups and turn a supposed dream draw into a potential nightmare.\n\nNo-one who won their group wanted to draw either of the aforementioned sides, and while there are no easy games when you get to this stage of any major competition, you would need to be grossly unfortunate to face a side of that calibre, at this stage of the competition, as group winners. Yet it was with a sigh of disbelief and a borderline chuckle of acceptance that Napoliâs faithful saw âReal Madridâ come out the pot as their last 16 opposition; win your group they said, youâll get an easier draw they said. Suddenly all the statistical talk about 81% of group winners progressing past the first knock out stage was irrelevant, and ironically Benfica, the side who finished second to Napoli, went on to draw Borussia Dortmund, the side who bested Real Madrid. Easy? No. Easier? Yes.\n\nIn 1987/88, back when the European Cup was a full blown knock out competition, way before group stages and elaborate ceremonies to commence the draw, Diego Maradonaâs Napoli, newly crowned champions of Italy for the first time, faced Real Madrid in the very first round of the competition. Napoli lost 2-0 in Madrid before a spirited attempt at overturning the deficit in Naples finished 1-1, and just like that, Europeâs top club competition had lost Napoli and Diego Maradona before September was over. The outcry over two big names meeting so soon would lead to talks which would eventually see the formation of the competition we are familiar with today, but for Napoli that would be no consolation.\n\nToday however, lessons must be learned from past campaigns and especially from the Chelsea tie of 2011/12 when it comes to taking opportunities when they arise. Napoli does hold one advantage; that in the Champions League era at least, they have never had a second leg home tie in the knockout phase\n\nFootball has a funny and ironic way of digging up the past and throwing it in clubsâ faces when they least expect it; 1986/87, for the first time in their history Napoli finally won the Scudetto and were handed a first knock out round tie with Real Madrid. 30 years later, in 2016/17, after another first for Napoli that saw them win their Champions League group for the first time, they have once again been ârewardedâ with a first knock out stage tie with Real Madrid.\n\nNapoli fans will hope that the similarities and ironies end there and that the outcome in February is not as painfully similar to that of Maradona and his side of 1987/88.\n\nJames McGhie (@jrmcghie) is the founder of @SemprePodcast,the original & best SSC Napoli podcast for English speaking supporters across the world.",
  "latent_25938": "This short list of facts is agreed to by police and the public. What's in dispute is the allegation that Clark was already in handcuffs at the time he was shot. Minneapolis police have denied that claim, but amateur video from the moments after Clark's shooting proves eyewitnesses on the scene are convinced it's true.\n\nAs of Monday morning, Clark is said to be on life support. (Earlier reports indicated he had been killed.) The circumstances around his arrest and shooting have already garnered national and international attention, and on Sunday, Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges and Minneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau announced that the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) would conduct a \"thorough, independent investigation\" of what took place.\n\nLocal racial and social justice advocates are already energized and outraged, as evidenced by a Sunday night rally that took place at the scene of the incident. Speaking to an assembled crowd, Nekima Levy-Pounds, president of the Minneapolis NAACP, prayed that God would \"unsettle every spirit of those who control this city, that they will not be able to rest until we get justice.\"\n\nStrong as that statement might seem, it's actually mild compared to some of the utterances from organizers with Black Lives Matter, who suggested the Clark shooting could be a last straw for black residents of a city with huge racial disparities in incomes, outcomes, and interactions with law enforcement.\n\nIn a statement released midday Sunday, BLM recounted stories of black citizens who were cursed, threatened and pepper-sprayed in the tense moments after Clark's shooting.\n\n\"Our city is not too far from burning like Baltimore because as the violence, disparities, and erasure people of color grows, so will the peopleâs rage and desire for justice,\" said Michael McDowell, an organizer.\n\nThat sentiment is closely in line with the angry words from amateur video taken Sunday morning, as a phalanx of police stood watch under the scrutiny of neighborhood residents. The man recording the video calls police \"dirty motherfuckers,\" while others can be heard shouting that Clark had been shot \"for no reason.\" Later, the narrator, who also says Clark had been in handcuffs at the time of the shot, meets calls to \"go home\" by screaming it was time to \"set this shit off, man.\"\n\nSpeaking Monday morning, Levy-Pounds said Hodges and Harteau were quick to react to Sunday's news because the event was \"extremely egregious,\" and needed obvious attention.\n\n\"From witness accounts, Jamar Clark was handcuffed and then shot in the head in front of dozens of witnesses,\" Levy-Pounds says. \"Police essentially threw a corpse in the back of an ambulance, and put him on life support at the hospital. They pulled guns on witnesses and sprayed them with mace. They waited 45 minutes before asking people what had happened there. This is one of the worst examples of what we've seen, recently, with the execution of unarmed black men.\"\n\nLevy-Pounds showed mild appreciation for the unprecedented step of involving the BCA to investigate, but said she and other activists \"don't trust Minnesota law enforcement agencies to hold each other accountable,\" and are calling for FBI involvement in finding the truth of what happened that night.\n\nMeanwhile, city leaders have asked that anyone with information contact the BCA at (651) 793-7000.",
  "latent_26113": "Even those who live far away from the bright lights of Broadway and pay little attention to the goings-on in musical theater have likely heard rumblings of Hamilton.\n\nThere's a reason for that: After a sold-out run off-Broadway that was extended three times, Hamilton quickly and loudly made the transition to Broadway, selling millions of dollars' worth of tickets months before it opened. Now, less than two months after its Broadway bow, it's one of New York's hottest (and most expensive) tickets. That's unlikely to change after 2016's Tonys, for which Hamilton is a sure bet to take home a few statues, if not all of them â possibly even the ones it's not nominated for.\n\nBut even those who don't live in New York, or aren't planning a trip there anytime soon, should pay attention to Hamilton. As far as mainstream musicals go, Hamilton is revolutionary (in multiple senses of the word), a fact that was clarified on Tuesday, September 29, when the show's creator and star, Lin-Manuel Miranda, was awarded a MacArthur \"genius grant,\" the annual $625,000 fellowship extended to \"talented individuals who have shown extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits.\"\n\nHamilton is not Miranda's first successful musical (more on that in a bit), but it is easily his best and most exciting. Here's a primer on what makes the show so audacious, why people are talking about it, and how you can experience it (sort of) from the comfort of your living room.\n\nSo who's this Hamilton guy?\n\nMaybe a glimpse of the show itself will help clear it up:\n\nThat's right â as evidenced by the britches and velvet blazers, we're talking about Alexander Hamilton, the United States' first Treasury secretary and one of its Founding Fathers. Hamilton was also a key adviser to George Washington during and after the American Revolution, and he became one of the main interpreters of the Constitution through the Federalist Papers, of which he wrote a staggering 51 (out of 85 total).\n\nSo it's sort of like 1776?\n\nGod, no. It's 2015, and this is a Lin-Manuel Miranda joint, which means Hamilton is as far away as it gets from that seminal (but fairly musty) musical interpretation of our nation's birth.\n\nFor starters, Hamilton is often described as a \"hip-hop musical,\" though that doesn't quite get at the melange of musical styles evident in the production. But the music, which was all written by Miranda, is certainly rooted in the language of modern hip-hop, as well as in other traditionally black musical forms such as R&B and jazz, with a dash of Broadway traditionalism and Gilbert and Sullivanâstyle patter (which is basically just rapping anyway).\n\nThat seems â¦ different.\n\nOkay, granted, one of this nation's premier old white dudes may seem like an incongruous subject for such a modern-day musical treatment, but Hamilton doesn't merely justify the combination of subject and tone; it brings new shading and nuance to both. As Miranda himself has put it, Alexander Hamilton \"embodies hip-hop,\" which isn't nearly as glib a statement as it may seem.\n\nHamilton tracks the life of Alexander Hamilton from the time he arrived in the US as an immigrant from the Virgin Islands through his (spoiler alert for American history) death in a duel with Aaron Burr. Hamilton was a penniless orphan of illegitimate birth, and his outspoken (and oft-controversial) ascent through the nascent United States government is the sort of rags-to-riches story that not only makes for good drama, but also merges shockingly well with the energy and attitude of modern-day hip-hop culture.\n\nIn fact, Miranda originally conceived of Hamilton as a hip-hop concept album. Back in 2009, he performed a song from that in-progress work at the White House's \"evening of poetry, music, and spoken word\" for Barack and Michelle Obama, who clearly loved it.\n\nI liked that! Is it in Hamilton?\n\nYup! It's the opening number, in fact, functioning as a sort of prologue setting the stage for the events to come. However, the song, \"Alexander Hamilton,\" has been fleshed out considerably in the transition from \"The Hamilton Mixtape\" to Hamilton, incorporating nearly the entire cast of characters, which also includes George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Marquis de Lafayette, and more.\n\nThat's a lot of old white dudes...\n\nIt sure is! But one of the most interesting things about Hamilton is its approach to casting those old white dudes. As you may recall from that earlier photo, Hamilton's cast is decidedly multicultural â in fact, the only actual white dude in the Broadway cast is Jonathan Groff (a Broadway superstar who also starred in HBO's Looking), who plays King George at a narrative remove from the main action.\n\nThe choice to cast actors of color as historical white men (including Miranda himself as Hamilton) sounds like a pointed, potentially distracting choice, but only the former is true in this case. As Miranda told the New York Times, \"Our cast looks like America looks now, and thatâs certainly intentional. â¦ It's a way of pulling you into the story and allowing you to leave whatever cultural baggage you have about the founding fathers at the door.\"\n\nWhile that sounds potentially disrespectful to all the black men and women whose stories aren't taught in American history class, it really does work in the context of Hamilton. There's very little suspension of disbelief required to consider Miranda's Hamilton as a Hispanic man, or Thomas Jefferson (Daveed Diggs) as a black man, or Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton (Phillipa Soo) as an Asian-American woman, because the musical's book and lyrics so masterfully play up the revolutionary spirit and political uncertainty of the time that Hamilton really does feel like it's taking place in the modern day, rather than in the pages of a history book.\n\nThe play also, tellingly, plays up Hamilton and others as \"immigrants\" to this country, which feels like a pointed reminder that no one race or culture can really lay claim to America or its history. (And, in case you were wondering, yes, Hamilton's content does touch lightly on slavery, but it's outside the context of race.)\n\nThe casting of actors of color is undeniably a bold choice, and one of Hamilton's most talked-about aspects. It's also an interesting case study in so-called \"colorblind\" or \"nontraditional\" casting, which is forever a hot topic in all visual media, and in theater in particular lately: Recent imbroglios over \"whitewashed\" casting in high-profile productions of The War of the Roses and The Mikado have highlighted the need for greater diversity in stage casting, something Hamilton functions as a direct response to.\n\nBut for all that loaded context, when you're in the midst of the material, experiencing Hamilton itself, it feels utterly natural, less a political statement than a bold (and successful) artistic choice.\n\nOkay, I'm intrigued, but I can't really afford a trip to New York right now.\n\nThat's okay â neither can I, and neither can a lot of people. Luckily for us, the original Broadway cast recording of Hamilton was released in September, which means at least the audio portion of Hamilton is now available to all.\n\nWhat's more, Hamilton is what's known as a sung-through musical, which means there's little to no dialogue in the play that isn't part of a song. That means you can listen to the Hamilton OBCR and experience more or less the entire show from beginning to end (well, minus the visual element, but still). At nearly two and a half hours long, it constitutes a fairly major time investment, but 20 bucks and 143 minutes for the soundtrack is a lot more reasonable for the casual theater-goer than a trip to see Hamilton onstage.\n\nThere's also the possibility of waiting it out until Hamilton goes on tour or is remounted in a city near you. But that's not ideal for a couple of reasons. First, nothing of the sort has been announced or even hinted at yet, given that Hamilton is still a brand new show; you'll probably need to wait years to see it somewhere other than New York. Second, and more importantly, subsequent Hamilton productions will likely have a new cast, which means seeing the show without its star and driving force: Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nOkay, so what's the deal with this Miranda guy you keep talking about?\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda has been a bright light on Broadway since 2008, when his musical In the Heights became a sensation. Having written the earliest drafts of In the Heights when he was a sophomore in college, Miranda officially became a Hot Young Talent when he took home the Best Musical and Best Original Score Tonys at the tender age of 28. (He was also nominated for Best Leading Actor in a Musical.)\n\nIn the Heights â which also features a book by Pulitzer winner Quiara AlegrÃ­a Hudes â is an ensemble musical that takes place over the course of three days in modern-day Washington Heights, a traditionally Dominican-American New York neighborhood, with music heavily influenced by hip-hop and Latin music sounds. In the original production, Miranda starred as the narrator and main protagonist, Usnavi, and became inextricably linked to the musical's success.\n\nMiranda also played a major part in a couple of other memorable Tony moments, though as a behind-the-scenes player. Even those who pay little to no attention to the Tonys likely remember a moment from the 2011 ceremony that went viral the next day, when host Neil Patrick Harris ended the telecast with a \"rap-up\" of all the highlights from the show that was just ending. It was undoubtedly the highlight of the night.\n\nIncorporating multiple specific references to key events in the ceremony, the rap was clearly composed on the fly, during the ceremony â by none other than Lin-Manual Miranda, with his writing partner Tommy Kail. (Do yourself a favor and watch Miranda's video blog of them writing during the ceremony.) Two years later, they repeated the feat for the 2013 Tonys, and penned Harris's opening number as well.\n\nBetween In the Heights and the Tony raps, Miranda had clearly established himself as a wildly gifted and ambitious lyricist, but the extent of that ambition didn't become fully apparent until Hamilton. Inspired by a book he read while on break from In the Heights â Ron Chernow's Alexander Hamilton â Miranda actually thought to himself, \"What the world needs right now is a hip-hop-influenced retelling of the life of Alexander Hamilton, and I should be the one to write and perform it.\" The chutzpah and vision required to not only think up but also see through such a notion âat age 35, no less â is no small thing, and people are rightly taking notice, including the MacArthur Foundation.\n\nEven more so than with In the Heights, Miranda is Hamilton's defining aspect â and not just because he wrote and stars in it. Miranda and his work represent an exciting and unexpected new course musical theater can chart in the future, one that's strongly informed by but not beholden to years of Broadway tradition.\n\nMiranda, and Hamilton, is clearly influenced by classic musicals â including 1776, for what it's worth â and storied composers like Stephen Sondheim. But there's also a strong vein of pop musicality that runs through his work. He straddles the line between the musical theater establishment and popular entertainment in a way few manage with as much style and substance.\n\nBut ultimately, there's something utterly singular and personal about Hamilton that rises above all that. There's a \"How did this even happen?\" wonder to experiencing this show, which unquestionably stems from Miranda's unique vision.\n\nOkay, I need to see this in person!\n\nThen you better get on it, and quick. Hamilton is currently playing at New York's Richard Rodgers Theatre and is booking through September 2016 (though it should run much, much longer). Tickets are already extremely limited, and range in price from $65 to $156.\n\nHowever, front-row seats for every performance have been set aside for a lottery, where those who enter get the chance to pay only $10 â get it? â for up to two tickets. You can only enter the day of, two and a half hours before the show starts, so it's a long shot. But hey, stranger things â like, say, the mega-success of a hip-hop musical centered on the life of Alexander Hamilton â have happened.",

The rest won't be affected, along with Walmart.com and Sam's Club membership stores, which Lundberg said have never sold modern sports rifles.\n\nThe company's move also apparently has nothing to do with an August 2014 incident, when police officers fatally shot 22-year-old John Crawford III in an Ohio Walmart while he was carrying a pellet gun that he had picked up in the sporting goods section of the store.",

A beta is expected next month.\n\nDestiny is published by Activision, whose Demonware online software and services company has also chipped in to help.\n\n\"They've really learned a lot over the last year, so we take it super seriously and we've been planning for a long time,\" Parsons said.\n\n\"We've been investing to make sure that we have the best experience possible.\n\n\"We will ultimately see what happens but we have every expectation of from moment one having a great experience.\"\n\nThe proof will be in the pudding when Destiny launches in September 2014 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.",

  "latent_26371": "Australian cricketer\n\n\"Bradman\" redirects here. For other uses, see Bradman (disambiguation)\n\nSir Donald George Bradman, AC (27 August 1908 â 25 February 2001), often referred to as \"The Don\", was an Australian international cricketer, widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time.[2] Bradman's career Test batting average of 99.94 has been cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport.[3]\n\nThe story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore.[4] Bradman's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years. Before his 22nd birthday, he had set many records for top scoring, some of which still stand, and became Australia's sporting idol at the height of the Great Depression.\n\nDuring a 20-year playing career, Bradman consistently scored at a level that made him, in the words of former Australia captain Bill Woodfull, \"worth three batsmen to Australia\".[5] A controversial set of tactics, known as Bodyline, was specifically devised by the England team to curb his scoring. As a captain and administrator, Bradman was committed to attacking, entertaining cricket; he drew spectators in record numbers. He hated the constant adulation, however, and it affected how he dealt with others. The focus of attention on his individual performances strained relationships with some teammates, administrators and journalists, who thought him aloof and wary.[6] Following an enforced hiatus due to the Second World War, he made a dramatic comeback, captaining an Australian team known as \"The Invincibles\" on a record-breaking unbeaten tour of England.\n\nA complex, highly driven man, not given to close personal relationships,[7] Bradman retained a pre-eminent position in the game by acting as an administrator, selector and writer for three decades following his retirement. Even after he became reclusive in his declining years, his opinion was highly sought, and his status as a national icon was still recognised. Almost 50 years after his retirement as a Test player, in 1997, Prime Minister John Howard of Australia called him the \"greatest living Australian\".[8] Bradman's image has appeared on postage stamps and coins, and a museum dedicated to his life was opened while he was still living. On the centenary of his birth, 27 August 2008, the Royal Australian Mint issued a $5 commemorative gold coin with Bradman's image.[9] In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.\n\nEarly years\n\nBradman's birthplace at Cootamundra is now a museum\n\nDonald George Bradman was the youngest son of George and Emily (nÃ©e Whatman) Bradman, and was born on 27 August 1908 at Cootamundra, New South Wales (NSW).[10] He had a brother, Victor, and three sistersâIslet, Lilian and Elizabeth May.[10] Bradman was of English heritage on both sides of his family. His grandfather Charles Andrew Bradman left Withersfield, England for Australia.[11] When Bradman played at Cambridge in 1930 as a 21 year old on his first tour of England, he took the opportunity to trace his forebears in the region.[12] Also, one of his great-grandfathers was one of the first Italians to migrate to Australia in 1826.[13] Bradman's parents lived in the hamlet of Yeo Yeo, near Stockinbingal. His mother Emily gave birth to him at the Cootamundra home of Granny Scholz, a midwife. That house is now the Bradman Birthplace Museum. Emily had hailed from Mittagong in the NSW Southern Highlands, and in 1911, when Don Bradman was about two-and-a-half years old, his parents decided to relocate to Bowral, close to Mittagong, to be closer to Emily's family and friends, as life at Yeo Yeo was proving difficult.[10][14][15]\n\nBradman practised batting incessantly during his youth. He invented his own solo cricket game, using a cricket stump for a bat, and a golf ball.[16] A water tank, mounted on a curved brick stand, stood on a paved area behind the family home. When hit into the curved brick facing of the stand, the ball rebounded at high speed and varying anglesâand Bradman would attempt to hit it again. This form of practice developed his timing and reactions to a high degree.[17] In more formal cricket, he hit his first century at the age of 12, with an undefeated 115[1] playing for Bowral Public School against Mittagong High School.[18]\n\nBush cricketer\n\nDuring the 1920â21 season, Bradman acted as scorer for the local Bowral team, captained by his uncle George Whatman. In October 1920, he filled in when the team was one man short, scoring 37* and 29* on debut. During the season, Bradman's father took him to the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) to watch the fifth Ashes Test match. On that day, Bradman formed an ambition. \"I shall never be satisfied\", he told his father, \"until I play on this ground\".[19] Bradman left school in 1922 and went to work for a local real estate agent who encouraged his sporting pursuits by giving him time off when necessary. He gave up cricket in favour of tennis for two years, but resumed playing cricket in 1925â26.[20]\n\nBradman in 1928\n\nBradman became a regular selection for the Bowral team; several outstanding performances earned him the attention of the Sydney daily press. Competing on matting-over-concrete pitches, Bowral played other rural towns in the Berrima District competition. Against Wingello, a team that included the future Test bowler Bill O'Reilly, Bradman made 234.[5][21] In the competition final against Moss Vale, which extended over five consecutive Saturdays, Bradman scored 320 not out.[18] During the following Australian winter (1926), an ageing Australian team lost The Ashes in England, and a number of Test players retired.[22] The New South Wales Cricket Association began a hunt for new talent. Mindful of Bradman's big scores for Bowral, the association wrote to him, requesting his attendance at a practice session in Sydney. He was subsequently chosen for the \"Country Week\" tournaments at both cricket and tennis, to be played during separate weeks. His boss presented him with an ultimatum: he could have only one week away from work, and therefore had to choose between the two sports.[20] He chose cricket. Bradman's performances during Country Week resulted in an invitation to play grade cricket in Sydney for St George in the 1926â27 season. He scored 110 on his debut, making his first century on a turf wicket.[23] On 1 January 1927, he turned out for the NSW second team. For the remainder of the season, Bradman travelled the 130 kilometres (81 mi) from Bowral to Sydney every Saturday to play for St George.[21]\n\nFirst-class debut\n\nThe next season continued the rapid rise of the \"Boy from Bowral\".[18] Selected to replace the unfit Archie Jackson in the NSW team, Bradman made his first-class debut at the Adelaide Oval, aged 19. He secured the achievement of a hundred on debut, with an innings of 118 featuring what soon became his trademarksâfast footwork, calm confidence and rapid scoring.[24] In the final match of the season, he made his first century at the SCG, against the Sheffield Shield champions Victoria. Despite his potential, Bradman was not chosen for the Australian second team to tour New Zealand.[25]\n\nBradman decided that his chances for Test selection would be improved by moving to Sydney for the 1928â29 season, when England were to tour in defence of the Ashes. Initially, he continued working in real estate, but later took a promotions job with the sporting goods retailer Mick Simmons Ltd. In the first match of the Sheffield Shield season, he scored a century in each innings against Queensland. He followed this with scores of 87 and 132 not out against the England touring team, and was rewarded with selection for the first Test, to be played at Brisbane.[20]\n\nTest career\n\nBradman is chaired off the ground by his opponents after scoring 452.\n\nPlaying in only his tenth first-class match, Bradman, nicknamed \"Braddles\" by his teammates,[26] found his initial Test a harsh learning experience. Caught on a sticky wicket, Australia were all out for 66 in the second innings and lost by 675 runs (still a Test record).[27] Following scores of 18 and 1, the selectors dropped Bradman to twelfth man for the Second Test. An injury to Bill Ponsford early in the match required Bradman to field as substitute while England amassed 636, following their 863 runs in the First Test. RS \"Dick\" Whitington wrote, \"... he had scored only nineteen himself and these experiences appear to have provided him with food for thought\".[28] Recalled for the Third Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Bradman scored 79 and 112 to become the youngest player to make a Test century,[29] although the match was still lost. Another loss followed in the Fourth Test. Bradman reached 58 in the second innings and appeared set to guide the team to victory when he was run out.[30] It was to be the only run out of his Test career. The losing margin was just 12 runs.[31]\n\nBradman with his Wm. Sykes bat, in the early 1930s. The \"Don Bradman Autograph\" bat is still manufactured today by Sykes' successor company, Slazenger\n\nThe improving Australians did manage to win the Fifth and final Test. Bradman top-scored with 123 in the first innings, and was at the wicket in the second innings when his captain Jack Ryder hit the winning runs. Bradman completed the season with 1,690 first-class runs, averaging 93.88,[32] and his first multiple century in a Sheffield Shield match, 340 not out against Victoria, set a new ground record for the SCG.[33] Bradman averaged 113.28 in 1929â30.[32] In a trial match to select the team that would tour England, he was last man out in the first innings for 124. As his team followed on, the skipper Bill Woodfull asked Bradman to keep the pads on and open the second innings. By the end of play, he was 205 not out, on his way to 225. Against Queensland at the SCG, Bradman set a then world record for first-class cricket by scoring 452 not out;[34] he made his runs in only 415 minutes.[20] Not long after the feat, he recalled:\n\nOn 434...I had a curious intuition...I seemed to sense that the ball would be a short-pitched one on the leg-stump, and I could almost feel myself getting ready to make my shot before the ball was delivered. Sure enough, it pitched exactly where I had anticipated, and, hooking it to the square-leg boundary, I established the only record upon which I had set my heart.[35]\n\nAlthough he was an obvious selection to tour England, Bradman's unorthodox style raised doubts that he could succeed on the slower English pitches. Percy Fender wrote:[36]\n\n...he will always be in the category of the brilliant, if unsound, ones. Promise there is in Bradman in plenty, though watching him does not inspire one with any confidence that he desires to take the only course which will lead him to a fulfilment of that promise. He makes a mistake, then makes it again and again; he does not correct it, or look as if he were trying to do so. He seems to live for the exuberance of the moment.\n\nThe encomiums were not confined to his batting gifts; nor did the criticism extend to his character. \"Australia has unearthed a champion\", said former Australian Test great Clem Hill, \"self-taught, with natural ability. But most important of all, with his heart in the right place.\"[35] Selector Dick Jones weighed in with the observation that it was \"good to watch him talking to an old player, listening attentively to everything that is said and then replying with a modest 'thank you'.\"[35]\n\n1930 tour of England\n\nEngland were favourites to win the 1930 Ashes series,[37] and if the Australians were to exceed expectations, their young batsmen, Bradman and Jackson, needed to prosper. With his elegant batting technique, Jackson appeared the brighter prospect of the pair.[38] However, Bradman began the tour with 236 at Worcester and went on to score 1,000 first-class runs by the end of May, the fifth player (and first Australian) to achieve this rare feat.[39] In his first Test appearance in England, Bradman hit 131 in the second innings but England won the match. His batting reached a new level in the Second Test at Lord's where he scored 254 as Australia won and levelled the series. Later in life, Bradman rated this the best innings of his career as, \"practically without exception every ball went where it was intended to go\".[40] Wisden noted his fast footwork and how he hit the ball \"all round the wicket with power and accuracy\", as well as faultless concentration in keeping the ball on the ground.[41]\n\nIn terms of runs scored, this performance was soon surpassed. In the Third Test, at Headingley, Bradman scored a century before lunch on 11 July, the first day of the Test match to equal the performances of Victor Trumper and Charlie Macartney.[42] In the afternoon, Bradman added another century between lunch and tea, before finishing the day on 309 not out. He remains the only Test player to pass 300 in one day's play.[43] His eventual score of 334 was a world-record, exceeding the previous mark of 325 by Andy Sandham.[44] Bradman dominated the Australian innings; the second-highest tally was 77 by Alan Kippax. Businessman Arthur Whitelaw later presented Bradman with a cheque for Â£1,000 in appreciation of his achievement.[45] The match ended in anti-climax as poor weather prevented a result, as it also did in the Fourth Test.\n\nBradman (second from the right, middle row) with the 1930 team\n\nIn the deciding Test at The Oval, England made 405. During an innings stretching over three days due to intermittent rain, Bradman made yet another multiple century, this time 232, which helped give Australia a big lead of 290 runs. In a crucial partnership with Archie Jackson, Bradman battled through a difficult session when England fast bowler Harold Larwood bowled short on a pitch enlivened by the rain. Wisden gave this period of play only a passing mention:[46]\n\nOn the Wednesday morning the ball flew about a good deal, both batsmen frequently being hit on the body...on more than one occasion each player cocked the ball up dangerously but always, as it happened, just wide of the fieldsmen.\n\nA number of English players and commentators noted Bradman's discomfort in playing the short, rising delivery.[5] The revelation came too late for this particular match, but was to have immense significance in the next Ashes series. Australia won the match by an innings and regained the Ashes. The victory made an impact in Australia. With the economy sliding toward depression and unemployment rapidly rising, the country found solace in sporting triumph. The story of a self-taught 22-year-old from the bush who set a series of records against the old rival made Bradman a national hero.[47] The statistics Bradman achieved on the tour, and in the Test matches in particular, broke records for the day and some have stood the test of time. In all, Bradman scored 974 runs at an average of 139.14 during the Test series, with four centuries, including two double hundreds and a triple.[48] As of 2018, no-one has matched or exceeded 974 runs or three double centuries in one Test series; the record of 974 runs exceeds the second-best performance by 69 runs and was achieved in two fewer innings.[49] Bradman's first-class tally, 2,960 runs (at an average of 98.66 with 10 centuries), was another enduring record: the most by any overseas batsman on a tour of England.[50]\n\nOn the tour, the dynamic nature of Bradman's batting contrasted sharply with his quiet, solitary off-field demeanour. He was described as aloof from his teammates and he did not offer to buy them a round of drinks, let alone share the money given to him by Whitelaw.[7] Bradman spent a lot of his free time alone, writing, as he had sold the rights to a book. On his return to Australia, Bradman was surprised by the intensity of his reception; he became a \"reluctant hero\".[7] Mick Simmons wanted to cash in on their employee's newly won fame. They asked Bradman to leave his teammates and attend official receptions they organised in Adelaide, Melbourne, Goulburn, his hometown Bowral and Sydney, where he received a brand new custom-built Chevrolet. At each stop, Bradman received a level of adulation that \"embarrassed\" him. This focus on individual accomplishment, in a team game, \"... permanently damaged relationships with his contemporaries\".[7] Commenting on Australia's victory, the team's vice-captain Vic Richardson said, \"... we could have played any team without Bradman, but we could not have played the blind school without Clarrie Grimmett\".[51] A modest Bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying \"I have always endeavoured to do my best for the side, and the few centuries that have come my way have been achieved in the hope of winning matches. My one idea when going into bat was to make runs for Australia.\"[52]\n\nReluctant hero\n\nIn 1930â31, against the first West Indian side to visit Australia, Bradman's scoring was more sedate than in Englandâalthough he did make 223 in 297 minutes in the Third Test at Brisbane and 152 in 154 minutes in the following Test at Melbourne.[53] However, he scored quickly in a very successful sequence of innings against the South Africans in the Australian summer of 1931â32. For NSW against the tourists, he made 30, 135 and 219. In the Test matches, he scored 226 (277 minutes), 112 (155 minutes), 2 and 167 (183 minutes); his 299 not out in the Fourth Test, at Adelaide, set a new record for the highest score in a Test in Australia.[54][55] Australia won nine of the ten Tests played over the two series.\n\nAt this point, Bradman had played 15 Test matches since the beginning of 1930, scoring 2,227 runs at an average of 131.[56] He had played 18 innings, scoring 10 centuries, six of which had extended beyond 200.[56] His overall scoring rate was 42 runs per hour,[57] with 856 (or 38.5% of his tally) scored in boundaries.[56] Significantly, he had not hit a six,[56] which typified Bradman's attitude: if he hit the ball along the ground, then it could not be caught. During this phase of his career, his youth and natural fitness allowed him to adopt a \"machine-like\" approach to batting. The South African fast bowler Sandy Bell described bowling to him as, \"heart-breaking ... with his sort of cynical grin, which rather reminds one of the Sphinx ... he never seems to perspire\".[58]\n\nHundreds of onlookers gather as the Bradmans leave the church after their wedding ceremony in 1932.\n\nBetween these two seasons, Bradman seriously contemplated playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington, a move that, according to the rules of the day, would have ended his Test career.[20] A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son.[20] However, the contract increased Bradman's dependence on his public profile, making it more difficult to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired.[58]\n\nBradman's chaotic wedding to Jessie Menzies in April 1932 epitomised these new and unwelcome intrusions into his private life. The church \"was under siege all throughout the day ... uninvited guests stood on chairs and pews to get a better view\"; police erected barriers that were broken down and many of those invited could not get a seat.[58] Just weeks later, Bradman joined a private team organised by Arthur Mailey to tour the United States and Canada.[59] He travelled with his wife, and the couple treated the trip as a honeymoon. Playing 51 games in 75 days, Bradman scored 3,779 runs at 102.1, with 18 centuries. Although the standard of play was not high, the effects of the amount of cricket Bradman had played in the three previous years, together with the strains of his celebrity status, began to show on his return home.[60]\n\nBodyline\n\n\"As long as Australia has Bradman she will be invincible ... It is almost time to request a legal limit on the number of runs Bradman should be allowed to make.\" News Chronicle, London[61]\n\nWithin the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which administered English cricket at the time, few voices were more influential than \"Plum\" Warner's, who, when considering England's response to Bradman, wrote that it \"must evolve a new type of bowler and develop fresh ideas and strange tactics to curb his almost uncanny skill\". To that end, Warner orchestrated the appointment of Douglas Jardine as England captain in 1931, as a prelude to Jardine leading the 1932â33 tour to Australia, with Warner as team manager.[62] Remembering that Bradman had struggled against bouncers during his 232 at The Oval in 1930, Jardine decided to combine traditional leg theory with short-pitched bowling to combat Bradman. He settled on the Nottinghamshire fast bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce as the spearheads for his tactics. In support, the England selectors chose another three pacemen for the squad. The unusually high number of fast bowlers caused a lot of comment in both countries and roused Bradman's own suspicions.[18]\n\nBradman had other problems to deal with at this time; among these were bouts of illness from an undiagnosed malaise which had begun during the tour of North America,[63] and that the Australian Board of Control had initially refused permission for him to write a column for the Sydney Sun.[63] Bradman, who had signed a two-year contract with the newspaper, threatened to withdraw from cricket to honour his contract when the board denied him permission to write; eventually, the paper released Bradman from the contract, in a victory for the board.[63] In three first-class games against England before the Tests, Bradman averaged just 17.16 in 6 innings.[64] Jardine decided to give the new tactics a trial in only one game, a fixture against an Australian XI at Melbourne. In this match, Bradman faced the leg theory and later warned local administrators that trouble was brewing if it continued.[65] He withdrew from the First Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground amid rumours that he had suffered a nervous breakdown. Despite his absence, England employed what were already becoming known as the Bodyline tactics against the Australian batsmen and won an ill-tempered match.[20]\n\nThe famous duck : Bradman bowled by Bowes at the MCG, in front of a world record crowd assembled to see Bradman defeat Bodyline\n\nThe public clamoured for the return of Bradman to defeat Bodyline: \"he was the batsman who could conquer this cankerous bowling ... 'Bradmania', amounting almost to religious fervour, demanded his return\".[66] Recovered from his indisposition, Bradman returned to the side in Alan Kippax's position. A world record crowd of 63,993 at the MCG saw Bradman come to the crease on the first day of the Second Test with the score at 2/67. A standing ovation ensued that delayed play for several minutes.[67] Bradman anticipated receiving a bouncer as his first ball and, as the bowler delivered, he moved across his stumps to play the hook shot. The ball failed to rise and Bradman dragged it onto his stumps; the first-ball duck was his first in a Test. The crowd fell into stunned silence as he walked off. However, Australia took a first innings lead in the match, and another record crowd on 2 January 1933 watched Bradman hit a counter-attacking second innings century. His unbeaten 103 (from 146 balls) in a team total of 191 helped set England a target of 251 to win. Bill O'Reilly and Bert Ironmonger bowled Australia to a series-levelling victory amid hopes that Bodyline was beaten.[68]\n\nThe Third Test at the Adelaide Oval proved pivotal. There were angry crowd scenes after the Australian captain Bill Woodfull and wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield were hit by bouncers. An apologetic Plum Warner entered the Australian dressing room and was rebuked by Woodfull. Woodfull's remarks (that \"...there are two teams out there and only one of them is playing cricket\") were leaked to the press, and Warner and others attributed this to Australian opening batsman Jack Fingleton, however for many years (even after Fingleton's death) a bitter war of accusation passed between Fingleton and Bradman as to who was the real source of the leak. In a cable to the MCC, the Australian Board of Control repeated the allegation of poor sportsmanship directed at Warner by Woodfull.[69] With the support of the MCC, England continued with Bodyline despite Australian protests. The tourists won the last three Tests convincingly and regained the Ashes. Bradman caused controversy with his own tactics. Always seeking to score, and with the leg side packed with fielders, he often backed away and hit the ball into the vacant half of the outfield with unorthodox shots reminiscent of tennis or golf.[70] This brought him 396 runs (at 56.57) for the series and plaudits for attempting to find a solution to Bodyline, although his series average was just 57% of his career mean. Jack Fingleton was in no doubt that Bradman's game altered irrevocably as a consequence of Bodyline, writing:[71]\n\nBodyline was specially prepared, nurtured for and expended on him and, in consequence, his technique underwent a change quicker than might have been the case with the passage of time. Bodyline plucked something vibrant from his art.\n\nThe constant glare of celebrity and the tribulations of the season forced Bradman to reappraise his life outside the game and to seek a career away from his cricketing fame.[72] Harry Hodgetts, a South Australian delegate to the Board of Control, offered Bradman work as a stockbroker if he would relocate to Adelaide and captain South Australia (SA). Unknown to the public, the SA Cricket Association (SACA) instigated Hodgetts' approach and subsidised Bradman's wage.[73] Although his wife was hesitant about moving, Bradman eventually agreed to the deal in February 1934.[74]\n\nDeclining health and a brush with death\n\nIn his farewell season for NSW, Bradman averaged 132.44, his best yet.[32] He was appointed vice-captain for the 1934 tour of England. However, \"he was unwell for much of the [English] summer, and reports in newspapers hinted that he was suffering from heart trouble\".[75] Although he again started with a double century at Worcester, his famed concentration soon deserted him. Wisden wrote:[76]\n\n...there were many occasions on which he was out to wild strokes. Indeed at one period he created the impression that, to some extent, he had lost control of himself and went in to bat with an almost complete disregard for anything in the shape of a defensive stroke.\n\nCigarette card distributed during the 1934 Ashes series\n\nAt one stage, Bradman went 13 first-class innings without a century, the longest such spell of his career,[77] prompting suggestions that Bodyline had eroded his confidence and altered his technique.[76] After three Tests, the series was oneâone and Bradman had scored 133 runs in five innings. The Australians travelled to Sheffield and played a warm up game before the Fourth Test. Bradman started slowly and then, \"... the old Bradman [was] back with us, in the twinkling of an eye, almost\".[78] He went on to make 140, with the last 90 runs coming in just 45 minutes. On the opening day of the Fourth Test at Headingley (Leeds), England were out for 200, but Australia slumped to 3/39, losing the third wicket from the last ball of the day.[79] Listed to bat at number five, Bradman would start his innings the next day.\n\nThat evening, Bradman declined an invitation to dinner from Neville Cardus, telling the journalist that he wanted an early night because the team needed him to make a double century the next day. Cardus pointed out that his previous innings on the ground was 334, and the law of averages was against another such score. Bradman told Cardus, \"I don't believe in the law of averages\".[80] In the event, Bradman batted all of the second day and into the third, putting on a then world record partnership of 388 with Bill Ponsford.[81][82] When he was finally out for 304 (473 balls, 43 fours and 2 sixes), Australia had a lead of 350 runs, but rain prevented them from forcing a victory. The effort of the lengthy innings stretched Bradman's reserves of energy, and he did not play again until the Fifth Test at The Oval, the match that would decide the Ashes.[83]\n\nIn the first innings at The Oval, Bradman and Ponsford recorded an even more massive partnership, this time 451 runs. It had taken them less than a month to break the record they had set at Headingley; this new world record was to last 57 years.[81] Bradman's share of the stand was 244 from 271 balls, and the Australian total of 701 set up victory by 562 runs. For the fourth time in five series, the Ashes changed hands.[84] England would not recover them again until after Bradman's retirement.\n\nSeemingly restored to full health, Bradman blazed two centuries in the last two games of the tour. However, when he returned to London to prepare for the trip home, he experienced severe abdominal pain. It took a doctor more than 24 hours to diagnose acute appendicitis and a surgeon operated immediately. Bradman lost a lot of blood during the four-hour procedure and peritonitis set in. Penicillin and sulphonamides were still experimental treatments at this time; peritonitis was usually a fatal condition.[85] On 25 September, the hospital issued a statement that Bradman was struggling for his life and that blood donors were needed urgently.[86]\n\n\"The effect of the announcement was little short of spectacular\".[85] The hospital could not deal with the number of donors, and closed its switchboard in the face of the avalanche of telephone calls generated by the news. Journalists were asked by their editors to prepare obituaries. Teammate Bill O'Reilly took a call from King George V's secretary asking that the King be kept informed of the situation.[86] Jessie Bradman started the month-long journey to London as soon as she received the news. En route, she heard a rumour that her husband had died.[85] A telephone call clarified the situation and by the time she reached London, Bradman had begun a slow recovery. He followed medical advice to convalesce, taking several months to return to Australia and missing the 1934â35 Australian season.[20]\n\nInternal politics and the Test captaincy\n\nBradman walking out to bat in the Third Test against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1937. His 270 runs won the match for Australia and has been rated the greatest innings of all time.\n\nThere was off-field intrigue in Australian cricket during the antipodean winter of 1935. Australia, scheduled to make a tour of South Africa at the end of the year, needed to replace the retired Bill Woodfull as captain. The Board of Control wanted Bradman to lead the team, yet, on 8 August, the board announced Bradman's withdrawal from the team due to a lack of fitness. Surprisingly, in the light of this announcement, Bradman led the South Australian team in a full programme of matches that season.[87]\n\nThe captaincy was given to Vic Richardson, Bradman's predecessor as South Australian captain.[88] Cricket author Chris Harte's analysis of the situation is that a prior (unspecified) commercial agreement forced Bradman to remain in Australia.[89] Harte attributed an ulterior motive to his relocation: the off-field behaviour of Richardson and other South Australian players had displeased the South Australia Cricket Association (SACA), which was looking for new leadership. To help improve discipline, Bradman became a committeeman of the SACA, and a selector of the South Australian and Australian teams.[90] He took his adopted state to its first Sheffield Shield title for 10 years, Bradman weighing in with personal contributions of 233 against Queensland and 357 against Victoria. He finished the season with 369 (in 233 minutes), a South Australian record, made against Tasmania. The bowler who dismissed him, Reginald Townley, would later become leader of the Tasmanian Liberal Party.[87]\n\nAustralia defeated South Africa 4â0 and senior players such as Bill O'Reilly were pointed in their comments about the enjoyment of playing under Richardson's captaincy.[91] A group of players who were openly hostile toward Bradman formed during the tour. For some, the prospect of playing under Bradman was daunting, as was the knowledge that he would additionally be sitting in judgement of their abilities in his role as a selector.[92]\n\nTo start the new season, the Test side played a \"Rest of Australia\" team, captained by Bradman, at Sydney in early October 1936. The Test XI suffered a big defeat, due to Bradman's 212 and a haul of 12 wickets taken by leg-spinner Frank Ward.[93] Bradman let the members of the Test team know that despite their recent success, the team still required improvement.[92] Shortly afterwards, Bradman's first child was born on 28 October, but died the next day. He took time out of cricket for two weeks and on his return made 192 in three hours against Victoria in the last match before the beginning of the Ashes series.\n\nThe Test selectors made five changes to the team who had played in the previous Test match. Significantly, Australia's most successful bowler Clarrie Grimmett was replaced by Ward, one of four players making their debut. Bradman's role in Grimmett's omission from the team was controversial and it became a theme that dogged Bradman as Grimmett continued to be prolific in domestic cricket while his successors were ineffectiveâhe was regarded as having finished the veteran bowler's Test career in a political purge.[94]\n\nAustralia fell to successive defeats in the opening two Tests, Bradman making two ducks in his four innings,[95][96] and it seemed that the captaincy was affecting his form.[97] The selectors made another four changes to the team for the Third Test at Melbourne.\n\nBradman won the toss on New Year's Day 1937, but again failed with the bat, scoring just 13. The Australians could not take advantage of a pitch that favoured batting, and finished the day at 6/181. On the second day, rain dramatically altered the course of the game. With the sun drying the pitch (in those days, covers could not be used during matches) Bradman declared to get England in to bat while the pitch was \"sticky\"; England also declared to get Australia back in, conceding a lead of 124. Bradman countered by reversing his batting order to protect his run-makers while conditions improved. The ploy worked and Bradman went in at number seven. In an innings spread over three days, he battled influenza while scoring 270 off 375 balls, sharing a record partnership of 346 with Jack Fingleton,[98] and Australia went on to victory. In 2001, Wisden rated this performance as the best Test match innings of all time.[99]\n\nThe next Test, at the Adelaide Oval, was fairly even until Bradman played another patient second innings, making 212 from 395 balls. Australia levelled the series when the erratic[100] left-arm spinner \"Chuck\" Fleetwood-Smith bowled Australia to victory. In the series-deciding Fifth Test, Bradman returned to a more aggressive style in top-scoring with 169 (off 191 balls) in Australia's 604 and Australia won by an innings.[101] Australia's achievement of winning a Test series after outright losses in the first two matches has never been repeated in Test cricket.[102]\n\nEnd of an era\n\nDuring the 1938 tour of England, Bradman played the most consistent cricket of his career.[103] He needed to score heavily as England had a strengthened batting line-up, while the Australian bowling was over-reliant on O'Reilly.[103] Grimmett was overlooked, but Jack Fingleton made the team, so the clique of anti-Bradman players remained.[7] Playing 26 innings on tour, Bradman recorded 13 centuries (a new Australian record) and again made 1,000 first-class runs before the end of May, becoming the only player to do so twice.[104] In scoring 2,429 runs, Bradman achieved the highest average ever recorded in an English season: 115.66.[103]\n\nBradman (left, with his vice-captain Stan McCabe) walks out to bat at Perth, during a preliminary match to the 1938 tour of England. Bradman scored 102.\n\nIn the First Test, England amassed a big first innings score and looked likely to win, but Stan McCabe made 232 for Australia, a performance Bradman rated as the best he had ever seen. With Australia forced to follow-on, Bradman fought hard to ensure McCabe's effort was not in vain, and he secured the draw with 144 not out.[105] It was the slowest Test hundred of his career and he played a similar innings of 102 not out in the next Test as Australia struggled to another draw.[106] Rain completely washed out the Third Test at Old Trafford.[107]\n\nAustralia's opportunity came at Headingley, a Test described by Bradman as the best he ever played in.[108] England batted first and made 223. During the Australian innings, Bradman backed himself by opting to bat on in poor light conditions, reasoning that Australia could score more runs in bad light on a good wicket than on a rain affected wicket in good light, when he had the option to go off.[109] He scored 103 out of a total of 242 and the gamble paid off, as it meant there was sufficient time to push for victory when an England collapse left them a target of only 107 to win. Australia slumped to 4/61, with Bradman out for 16. An approaching storm threatened to wash the game out, but the poor weather held off and Australia managed to secure the win, a victory that retained the Ashes.[109] For the only time in his life, the tension of the occasion got to Bradman and he could not watch the closing stages of play, a reflection of the pressure that he felt all tour: he described the captaincy as \"exhausting\" and said he \"found it difficult to keep going\".[108]\n\nThe euphoria of securing the Ashes preceded Australia's heaviest defeat. At The Oval, England amassed a world record of 7/903 and their opening batsman Len Hutton scored an individual world record, by making 364.[110][111] In an attempt to relieve the burden on his bowlers, Bradman took a rare turn at bowling. During his third over, he fractured his ankle and teammates carried him from the ground.[110] With Bradman injured and Fingleton unable to bat because of a leg muscle strain,[110][112] Australia were thrashed by an innings and 579 runs, which remains the largest margin in Test cricket history.[113] Unfit to complete the tour, Bradman left the team in the hands of vice-captain Stan McCabe. At this point, Bradman felt that the burden of captaincy would prevent him from touring England again, although he did not make his doubts public.[108]\n\nDespite the pressure of captaincy, Bradman's batting form remained supreme. An experienced, mature player now commonly called \"The Don\" had replaced the blitzing style of his early days as the \"Boy from Bowral\".[114] In 1938â39, he led South Australia to the Sheffield Shield and made a century in six consecutive innings to equal CB Fry's world record.[115] Bradman totalled 21 first-class centuries in 34 innings, from the beginning of the 1938 tour of England (including preliminary games in Australia) until early 1939.\n\nThe next season, Bradman made an abortive bid to join the Victoria state side. The Melbourne Cricket Club advertised the position of club secretary and he was led to believe that if he applied, he would get the job.[116] The position, which had been held by Hugh Trumble until his death in August 1938, was one of the most prestigious jobs in Australian cricket. The annual salary of Â£1,000 would make Bradman financially secure while allowing him to retain a connection with the game.[117] On 18 January 1939, the club's committee, on the casting vote of the chairman, chose former Test batsman Vernon Ransford over Bradman.[117][118]\n\nThe 1939â40 season was Bradman's most productive ever for SA: 1,448 runs at an average of 144.8.[32] He made three double centuries, including 251 not out against NSW, the innings that he rated the best he ever played in the Sheffield Shield, as he tamed Bill O'Reilly at the height of his form.[119] However, it was the end of an era. The outbreak of World War II led to the indefinite postponement of all cricket tours, and the suspension of the Sheffield Shield competition.[120]\n\nTroubled war years\n\nBradman's high backlift and lengthy forward stride were characteristic\n\nBradman joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 28 June 1940 and was passed fit for air crew duty.[121] The RAAF had more recruits than it could equip and train and Bradman spent four months in Adelaide before the Governor-General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, persuaded Bradman to transfer to the army, a move that was criticised as a safer option for him.[7] Given the rank of Lieutenant, he was posted to the Army School of Physical Training at Frankston, Victoria, to act as a divisional supervisor of physical training. The exertion of the job aggravated his chronic muscular problems, diagnosed as fibrositis. Surprisingly, in light of his batting prowess, a routine army test revealed that Bradman had poor eyesight.[122]\n\nInvalided out of service in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due to the extent of the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed stockbroking during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree.[123] Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index finger of his (dominant) right hand.[124]\n\nIn June 1945, Bradman faced a financial crisis when the firm of Harry Hodgetts collapsed due to fraud and embezzlement.[125] Bradman moved quickly to set up his own business, utilising Hodgetts' client list and his old office in Grenfell Street, Adelaide. The fallout led to a prison term for Hodgetts, and left a stigma attached to Bradman's name in the city's business community for many years.[126]\n\nHowever, the SA Cricket Association had no hesitation in appointing Bradman as their delegate to the Board of Control in place of Hodgetts. Now working alongside some of the men he had battled in the 1930s, Bradman quickly became a leading light in the administration of the game. With the resumption of international cricket, he was once more appointed a Test selector, and played a major role in planning for post-war cricket.[127]\n\n\"The ghost of a once great cricketer\"\n\nBradman and Barnes leave the field for an adjournment as both head towards 234.\n\nBradman during an interstate series at Adelaide Oval, 31 October 1946.\n\nIn 1945â46, Bradman suffered regular bouts of fibrositis while coming to terms with increased administrative duties and the establishment of his business.[128] He played for South Australia in two matches to help with the re-establishment of first-class cricket and later described his batting as \"painstaking\".[129] Batting against the Australian Services cricket team, Bradman scored 112 in less than two hours, yet Dick Whitington (playing for the Services) wrote, \"I have seen today the ghost of a once great cricketer\".[130] Bradman declined a tour of New Zealand and spent the winter of 1946 wondering whether he had played his last match. \"With the English team due to arrive for the 1946â47 Ashes series, the media and the public were anxious to know if Bradman would lead Australia.\"[131] His doctor recommended against a return to the game.[132] Encouraged by his wife, Bradman agreed to play in lead-up fixtures to the Test series.[133] After hitting two centuries, Bradman made himself available for the First Test at The Gabba.\n\nControversy emerged on the first day of the First Test at Brisbane. After compiling an uneasy 28 runs, Bradman hit a ball to the gully fieldsman, Jack Ikin. \"An appeal for a catch was denied in the umpire's contentious ruling that it was a bump ball\".[134] At the end of the over, England captain Wally Hammond spoke with Bradman and criticised him for not \"walking\"; \"from then on the series was a cricketing war just when most people desired peace\", Whitington wrote.[135] Bradman regained his finest pre-war form in making 187, followed by 234 during the Second Test at Sydney (Sid Barnes also scored 234 during the innings, many in a still standing 405 run 5th Wicket partnership with Bradman. Barnes later recalled that he purposely got out on 234 because \"it wouldn't be right for someone to make more runs than Bradman\"). Australia won both matches by an innings. Jack Fingleton speculated that had the decision at Brisbane gone against him, Bradman would have retired, such were his fitness problems.[136] In the remainder of the series, Bradman made three half-centuries in six innings, but was unable to make another century; nevertheless, his team won handsomely, 3â0. He was the leading batsman on either side, with an average of 97.14. Nearly 850,000 spectators watched the Tests, which helped lift public spirits after the war.[137]\n\nCentury of centuries and \"The Invincibles\"\n\nIndia made its first tour of Australia in the 1947â48 season. On 15 November, Bradman made 172 against them for an Australian XI at Sydney, his 100th first-class century.[138] The first non-Englishman to achieve the milestone, Bradman remains the only Australian to have done so.[139] In five Tests, he scored 715 runs (at 178.75 average). His last double century (201) came at Adelaide, and he scored a century in each innings of the Melbourne Test.[140] On the eve of the Fifth Test, he announced that the match would be his last in Australia, although he would tour England as a farewell.[141]\n\nAustralia had assembled one of the great teams of cricket history.[142] Bradman made it known that he wanted to go through the tour unbeaten,[57] a feat never before accomplished.[143] English spectators were drawn to the matches knowing that it would be their last opportunity to see Bradman in action. RC Robertson-Glasgow observed of Bradman that:[32]\n\nNext to Mr. Winston Churchill, he was the most celebrated man in England during the summer of 1948. His appearances throughout the country were like one continuous farewell matinÃ©e. At last his batting showed human fallibility. Often, especially at the start of the innings, he played where the ball wasn't, and spectators rubbed their eyes.\n\nDespite his waning powers, Bradman compiled 11 centuries on the tour, amassing 2,428 runs (average 89.92).[32] His highest score of the tour (187) came against Essex, when Australia compiled a world record of 721 runs in a day. In the Tests, he scored a century at Trent Bridge, but the performance most like his pre-war exploits came in the Fourth Test at Headingley. England declared on the last morning of the game, setting Australia a world record 404 runs to win in only 345 minutes on a heavily worn wicket. In partnership with Arthur Morris (182), Bradman reeled off 173 not out and the match was won with 15 minutes to spare. The journalist Ray Robinson called the victory \"the 'finest ever' in its conquest of seemingly insuperable odds\".[144]\n\nIn the final Test at The Oval, Bradman walked out to bat in Australia's first innings. He received a standing ovation from the crowd and three cheers from the opposition.[145] His Test batting average stood at 101.39.[146] Facing the wrist-spin of Eric Hollies,[147] Bradman pushed forward to the second ball that he faced, was deceived by a googly, and bowled between bat and pad for a duck.[148] An England batting collapse resulted in an innings defeat, denying Bradman the opportunity to bat again and so his career average finished at 99.94;[145][149][150] if he had scored just four runs in his last innings, it would have been 100. A story developed over the years that claimed Bradman missed the ball because of tears in his eyes,[150] a claim Bradman denied for the rest of his life.[151]\n\nThe Australian team won the Ashes 4â0, completed the tour unbeaten, and entered history as \"The Invincibles\".[152] Just as Bradman's legend grew, rather than diminished, over the years, so too has the reputation of the 1948 team. For Bradman, it was the most personally fulfilling period of his playing days, as the divisiveness of the 1930s had passed. He wrote:[153]\n\nKnowing the personnel, I was confident that here at last was the great opportunity which I had longed for. A team of cricketers whose respect and loyalty were unquestioned, who would regard me in a fatherly sense and listen to my advice, follow my guidance and not question my handling of affairs...there are no longer any fears that they will query the wisdom of what you do. The result is a sense of freedom to give full reign to your own creative ability and personal judgment.\n\nWith Bradman now retired from professional cricket, RC Robertson-Glasgow wrote of the English reaction \"... a miracle has been removed from among us. So must ancient Italy have felt when she heard of the death of Hannibal\".[32]\n\nStatistical summary\n\nTest match performance\n\n[154] This is the complete graphical representation of the test cricket record of Don Bradman.

When Nelson Mandela was released after 27 years in prison, his first question to an Australian visitor was, \"Is Sir Donald Bradman still alive?\"\n\nPlaying style\n\nBradman hooks English left-arm fast bowler Bill Voce during the 1936â37 series. The position of Bradman's left foot in relation to the stumps is an example of how he used the crease when batting.\n\nBradman's early development was shaped by the high bounce of the ball on matting-over-concrete pitches. He favoured \"horizontal-bat\" shots (such as the hook, pull and cut) to deal with the bounce and devised a unique grip on the bat handle that would accommodate these strokes without compromising his ability to defend. Employing a side-on stance at the wicket, Bradman kept perfectly still as the bowler ran in.[184] His backswing had a \"crooked\" look that troubled his early critics, but he resisted entreaties to change.[185] His backswing kept his hands in close to the body, leaving him perfectly balanced and able to change his stroke mid-swing, if need be.[186] Another telling factor was the decisiveness of Bradman's footwork. He \"used the crease\" by either coming metres down the wicket to drive, or playing so far back that his feet ended up level with the stumps when playing the cut, hook or pull.[187]\n\nBradman's game evolved with experience. He temporarily adapted his technique during the Bodyline series, deliberately moving around the crease in an attempt to score from the short-pitched deliveries.[188] At his peak, in the mid-1930s, he had the ability to switch between a defensive and attacking approach as the occasion demanded. After the Second World War, he adjusted to bat within the limitations set by his age, becoming a steady \"accumulator\" of runs.[189] However, Bradman never truly mastered batting on sticky wickets. Wisden commented, \"[i]f there really is a blemish on his amazing record it is ... the absence of a significant innings on one of those 'sticky dogs' of old\".[2]\n\nAfter cricket\n\nAfter his return to Australia, Bradman played in his own Testimonial match at Melbourne, scoring his 117th and last century, and receiving Â£9,342 in proceeds.[190] In the 1949 New Year Honours, he was appointed Knight Bachelor[191][192] for his services to the game, becoming the only Australian cricketer ever to be knighted.[193] He commented that he \"would have preferred to remain just Mister\".[1] The following year he published a memoir, Farewell to Cricket.[194] Bradman accepted offers from the Daily Mail to travel with, and write about, the 1953 and 1956 Australian teams in England. The Art of Cricket, his final book published in 1958, is an instructional manual.[7]\n\nBradman retired from his stockbroking business in June 1954, depending on the \"comfortable\" income earned as a board member of 16 publicly listed companies.[195] His highest profile affiliation was with Argo Investments Limited, where he was chairman for a number of years. Charles Williams commented that, \"[b]usiness was excluded on medical grounds, [so] the only sensible alternative was a career in the administration of the game which he loved and to which he had given most of his active life\".[196]\n\nBradman was honoured at a number of cricket grounds, notably when his portrait was hung in the Long Room at Lord's; until Shane Warne's portrait was added in 2005, Bradman was one of just three Australians to be honoured in this way.[197][198][199] Bradman inaugurated a \"Bradman Stand\" at the Sydney Cricket Ground in January 1974;[200] the Adelaide Oval also opened a Bradman Stand in 1990, which housed new media and corporate facilities.[201] The Oval's Bradman Stand was demolished in 2013 as the stadium underwent an extensive re-development.[202] Later in 1974, he attended a Lord's Taverners function in London where he experienced heart problems,[203] which forced him to limit his public appearances to select occasions only. With his wife, Bradman returned to Bowral in 1976, where the new cricket ground was named in his honour.[204] He gave the keynote speech at the historic Centenary Test at Melbourne in 1977.[205]\n\nOn 16 June 1979, the Australian government awarded Bradman the nation's second-highest civilian honour at that time, Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), \"in recognition of service to the sport of cricket and cricket administration\".[206] In 1980, he resigned from the ACB, to lead a more secluded life.\n\nAdministrative career\n\nIn addition to acting as one of South Australia's delegates to the Board of Control from 1945 to 1980, Bradman was a committee member of the SACA between 1935 and 1986. It is estimated that he attended 1,713 SACA meetings during this half century of service. Aside from two years in the early 1950s, he filled a selector's berth for the Test team between 1936 and 1971.[207]\n\nCricket saw an increase in defensive play during the 1950s. As a selector, Bradman favoured attacking, positive cricketers who entertained the paying public. He formed an alliance with Australian captain Richie Benaud, seeking more attractive play,[208] with some success.[209] He served two high-profile periods as chairman of the board of Control, in 1960â63 and 1969â72.[210] During the first, he dealt with the growing prevalence of illegal bowling actions in the game, a problem that he adjudged \"the most complex I have known in cricket, because it is not a matter of fact but of opinion\".[7] The major controversy of his second stint was a proposed tour of Australia by South Africa in 1971â72. On Bradman's recommendation, the series was cancelled.[211] Cricket journalist Michael Coward said of Bradman as an administrator:\n\nBradman was more than a cricket player nonpareil. He was...an astute and progressive administrator; an expansive thinker, philosopher and writer on the game. Indeed, in some respects, he was as powerful, persuasive and influential a figure off the ground as he was on it.[212]\n\nIn the late 1970s, Bradman played an important role during the World Series Cricket schism as a member of a special Australian Cricket Board committee formed to handle the crisis. He was criticised for not airing an opinion, but he dealt with World Series Cricket far more pragmatically than other administrators.[213] Richie Benaud described Bradman as \"a brilliant administrator and businessman\", warning that he was not to be underestimated.[214] As Australian captain, Ian Chappell fought with Bradman over the issue of player remuneration in the early 1970s and has suggested that Bradman was parsimonious:[215]\n\nI...thought to myself, 'Ian, did you just ask Bradman to fill your wallet with money?' Bradman's harangue confirmed my suspicions that the players were going to have a hard time extracting more money from the ACB.\n\nLater years and death\n\nAfter his wife's death in 1997, Bradman suffered \"a discernible and not unexpected wilting of spirit\".[216] The next year, on his 90th birthday, he hosted a meeting with his two favourite modern players, Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar,[217] but he was not seen in his familiar place at the Adelaide Oval again.[218] Hospitalised with pneumonia in December 2000, he returned home in the New Year and died there on 25 February 2001, aged 92.[219]\n\nA memorial service to mark Bradman's life was held on 25 March 2001 at St Peter's Anglican Cathedral, Adelaide. The service was attended by a host of former and current Test cricketers, as well as Australia's then prime minister, John Howard, leader of the opposition Kim Beazley and former prime minister Bob Hawke. Eulogies were given by Richie Benaud and Governor-General Sir William Deane. The service was broadcast live on ABC Television to a viewing audience of 1.45 million.[220] A private service for family and friends was earlier held at the Centennial Park Cemetery in the suburb of Pasadena, with many people lining both Greenhill and Goodwood Roads to pay their respects as his funeral motorcade passed by.\n\nLegacy\n\nCricket writer David Frith summed up the paradox of the continuing fascination with Bradman:[221]\n\nAs the years passed, with no lessening of his reclusiveness, so his public stature continued to grow, until the sense of reverence and unquestioning worship left many of his contemporaries scratching their heads in wondering admiration.\n\nAs early as 1939, Bradman had a Royal Navy ship named after him. Built as a fishing trawler in 1936, HMS Bradman was taken over by the Admiralty in 1939,[222] but was sunk by German aircraft the following year.[223]\n\nIn the 1963 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Bradman was selected by Neville Cardus as one the Six Giants of the Wisden Century. This was a special commemorative selection requested by Wisden for its 100th edition.[224] The other five players chosen were: Sydney Barnes, W. G. Grace, Jack Hobbs, Tom Richardson and Victor Trumper.\n\nOn 10 December 1985, Bradman was the first of 120 inaugural inductees into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame.[225] He spoke of his philosophy for considering the stature of athletes:\n\nWhen considering the stature of an athlete or for that matter any person, I set great store in certain qualities which I believe to be essential in addition to skill. They are that the person conducts his or her life with dignity, with integrity, courage, and perhaps most of all, with modesty. These virtues are totally compatible with pride, ambition, and competitiveness.\n\nAlthough modest about his own abilities and generous in his praise of other cricketers, Bradman was fully aware of the talents he possessed as a player;[226] there is some evidence that he sought to influence his legacy.[227] During the 1980s and 1990s, Bradman carefully selected the people to whom he gave interviews,[227] assisting Michael Page, Roland Perry and Charles Williams, who all produced biographical works about him. Bradman also agreed to an extensive interview for ABC radio, broadcast as Bradman: The Don Declares in eight 55-minute episodes during 1988.[228]\n\nThe most significant of these legacy projects was the Bradman Museum, opened in 1989 at the Bradman Oval in Bowral.[229] This organisation was reformed in 1993 as a non-profit charitable Trust, called the Bradman Foundation.[230] In 2010, it was expanded and rebranded as the International Cricket Hall of Fame.\n\nWhen the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame was created in Melbourne in 1996, Bradman was made one of its 10 inaugural members.[231] In 2000, Bradman was selected by cricket experts as one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Century. Each of the 100 members of the panel were able to select five cricketers: all 100 voted for Bradman.[232] The ICC Cricket Hall of Fame inducted him on 19 November 2009.[233]\n\nBradman's life and achievements were recognised in Australia with two notable issues. Three years before he died, he became the first living Australian to be featured on an Australian postage stamp.[234] After his death, the Australian Government produced a 20-cent coin to commemorate his life.[235] On 27 August 2018, to celebrate 110 years since his birth, Bradman was commemorated with a Google Doodle.[236]\n\nIn 1999, Bradman was named in the six man shortlist for BBC Sports Personality of the Century.[237] Asteroid 2472 Bradman discovered by LuboÅ¡ Kohoutek is named in his honour.[238]\n\nFamily life\n\nBradman with wife (left) in 1938 near Maidenhead , England\n\nBradman first met Jessie Martha Menzies in 1920 when she boarded with the Bradman family, to be closer to school in Bowral. The couple married at St Paul's Anglican Church at Burwood, Sydney on 30 April 1932.[20] The two had an impeccable marriage and were both devoted to each other.[239] During their 65-year marriage, Jessie was \"shrewd, reliable, selfless, and above all, uncomplicated...she was the perfect foil to his concentrated, and occasionally mercurial character\".[240] Bradman paid tribute to his wife numerous times, once saying succinctly, \"I would never have achieved what I achieved without Jessie\".[241]\n\nThe Bradmans lived in the same modest, suburban house in Holden Street, Kensington Park in Adelaide for all but the first three years of their married life.[242] They experienced personal tragedy in raising their children: their first-born son died as an infant in 1936,[243] their second son, John (born in 1939) contracted polio,[244] and their daughter, Shirley, born in 1941, had cerebral palsy from birth.[245] His family name proved a burden for John Bradman; he legally changed his last name to Bradsen in 1972. Although claims were made that he became estranged from his father, it was more a matter of \"the pair inhabit[ing] different worlds\", and the two remained in contact through the years.[246] After the cricketer's death, a collection of personal letters written by Bradman to his close friend Rohan Rivett between 1953 and 1977 was released and gave researchers new insights into Bradman's family life, including the strain between father and son.[247]\n\nBradman's reclusiveness in later life is partly attributable to the ongoing health problems of his wife, particularly following the open-heart surgery Jessie underwent in her 60s.[203] Lady Bradman died in 1997, aged 88, from cancer.[248] This had a dispiriting effect on Bradman,[249] but the relationship with his son improved, to the extent that John resolved to change his name back to Bradman.[250][251] Since his father's death, John Bradman has become the spokesperson for the family and has been involved in defending the Bradman legacy in a number of disputes.[252][253] The relationship between Bradman and his wider family is less clear, although nine months after Bradman's death, his nephew Paul Bradman criticised him as a \"snob\" and a \"loner\" who forgot his connections in Bowral and who failed to attend the funerals of Paul's mother and father.[254]\n\nIn popular culture\n\nBradman's name has become an archetypal name for outstanding excellence, both within cricket and in the wider world. The term Bradmanesque has been coined and is used both within and without cricketing circles.[255][256][257] Steve Waugh described Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan as \"the Don Bradman of bowling\".[258]\n\nBradman has been the subject of more biographies than any other Australian, apart from the bushranger Ned Kelly.[259] Bradman himself wrote four books: Don Bradman's BookâThe Story of My Cricketing Life with Hints on Batting, Bowling and Fielding (1930), My Cricketing Life (1938), Farewell to Cricket (1950) and The Art of Cricket (1958).[1] The story of the Bodyline series was retold in a 1984 television mini-series, with Gary Sweet portraying Bradman.[260]\n\nBradman is immortalised in three popular songs from different eras, \"Our Don Bradman\" (1930s, by Jack O'Hagan),[261] \"Bradman\" (1980s, by Paul Kelly),[262] and \"Sir Don\", (a tribute by John Williamson performed at Bradman's memorial service).[263] Bradman recorded several songs accompanying himself and others on piano in the early 1930s, including \"Every Day Is A Rainbow Day For Me\",[264] with Jack Lumsdaine.[265] In 2000, the Australian Government made it illegal for the names of corporations to suggest a link to \"Sir Donald Bradman\", if such a link does not in fact exist.[266] Other entities with similar protection are the Australian and foreign governments, Saint Mary MacKillop, the Royal Family and the Returned and Services League of Australia.[267]\n\nSee also\n\nReferences",
  "latent_26386": "FILE: Student emerges from a voting booth in 2008. (Washington Post)\n\nVoter turnout in statewide primaries so far this year has been historically low, even among states with procedures designing to make voting more convenient.\n\nOverall, voter turnout among the 25 states that have held primaries is down 18 percent from the 2010 election, according a study by the Center for the Study of the American Electorate. There were almost 123 million age-eligible voters in these primary states, but only about 18 million of them voted.\n\nWhat percentage of eligible voters voted in their statewide primary\n\nThe state with the highest turnout was Montana, with 26.3 percent of its eligible voters voting. The lowest was Iowa, with 9.7 percent.\n\nMany states with voting policies designed to make the process more convenient experienced lower turnout than 2010, including the four states that offer election-day registration, eight of the 11 that have early in-person voting, and 11 of the 13 with no-excuse absentee voting that allows a voter to request an absentee ballot without stating a reason and vote by mail.\n\nThe only states where turnout was higher in 2014 than it was in 2010 were West Virginia, Nebraska, and North Carolina.\n\nCurtis Gans, director of the Center for the Study of the American Electorate, wrote in the study that the findings show some measures taken to make voting more convenient have backfired.\n\nâWe have made it easier and easier to vote, at some risk, without having a positive effect on turnout,â he wrote. âThe core problem of participation does not reside in the realm of procedure, but rather in motivation.â\n\nGans believes attack ads that lead voters to believe they have a choice between âbad and awfulâ has contributed to low voter turnout, as has a decline in faith in government, new voters who grew up in households where their parents didnât vote, and technology that has, âmade grazing the Internet a substitute for reading the news.â\n\nHe suggested states should adopt voting hours like those in New York, which run from 6 a.m. on election day to 9 p.m., âoffering citizens a chance to vote on both ends of the work day,â and information pamphlets of the kind many western states send to voters that include descriptions of candidates and ballot measures.",

Itâs probably the single greatest moment I have ever experienced working here,â Mary posted to Twitter.\n\nâAfter the usual Saturday rush, a teenage girl comes in. She looks absolutely terrified and when I greet her she jumped. She starts going up and down the new release wall and the poor thing looks completely overwhelmed.â\n\nMary soon discovered that the young girl was a fan of the Supergirl TV show, in particular its gay character Alex. When Mary agreed that she loved Alex and Maggieâs relationship on the show, the girl burst into tears.\n\nâIâm trying to figure out what the hell I did to upset her. Sheâs crying and Iâm freaking out,â Mary posted to Twitter.\n\nâAfter a minute or so, everything clicks. Iâm staring down a crying baby gay.

Not only that, the young girl was troubled by her same-sex feelings, had been having suicidal thoughts for a long time and had attempted to take her own life.\n\nMary wrote: âBut as Alexâs arc continued she said she realized that she started to see that she could be happy, that she could be loved.

  "latent_26632": "Examining the Cincinnati Bengals' roster:\n\nQUARTERBACKS (3)\n\nThe Bengals were content with having just two quarterbacks on the 53-man roster last season, but expect them to take three this year. McCarron would be the odd man out, but since they drafted him this year and made him a de facto heir apparent to the position in case something happens with Dalton in the next few seasons, they probably won't cut him or place him on the practice squad. In Campbell, the Bengals also get a tried and true veteran who could step in if Dalton's play is unsatisfactory, or if he gets hurt.\n\nRUNNING BACKS (5)\n\nThis grouping includes Charles at H-back, meaning the Bengals are more likely to take four true running backs. I'd argue that neither Burkhead, Peerman nor Charles is a lock right now to make the team, but there are compelling reasons for each being part of the 53-man roster. BenJarvus Green-Ellis and James Wilder Jr. also have real chances to be part of the full roster. Although his carries have been limited early in training camp, Green-Ellis still has made the most of the few he has had. Multiple times on runs over the weekend, you could hear teammates shouting their support as he carried balls into the second and third levels of the defense.\n\nRECEIVERS (5)\n\nThe top three on this list are locks to make the team. The true battle during training camp will be for the other two spots. If this group holds, that means veterans Brandon Tate and Jasper Collins, former Bengals practice squad player Cobi Hamilton, undrafted rookie Colin Lockett, and recently added free agents Jeremy Johnson and Conner Vernon won't make the team. Alex Neutz was released last week. Of the possible cuts listed here, Tate would be the real notable one after performing well as a kick returner and filling in at punt returner last year. With a fully healthy secondary around him, expect Adam Jones to get back to returning punts. While the Bengals will give Tate opportunities to contribute in the passing game (he's had only 14 catches in three seasons with Cincinnati) this preseason, Sanzenbacher can also do much of what Tate can. Sanzenbacher has been more consistent in the passing game and could fill in as a returner on punts or kickoffs. Hamilton's size (6-foot-2) and leaping ability make him a possible pick to make the team, but performance would be a reason for cutting him. Wright's special-teams background and his strong showing in minicamp and organized team activities make him a possibility too.\n\nSo far, Tate has been among the most sound and steady receivers of camp. He's had several noteworthy catches and has been praised by coaches for his route-running. Hamilton has been less impressive, dropping or bobbling mutliple passes.\n\nTIGHT ENDS (3)\n\nGresham is entering a contract year, and expectations have never been higher for him. To meet them, he'll have to first overcome a back injury that has prevented him from practicing so far. Along with Gresham, Eifert and Smith should be part of the main roster. Kevin Brock and Ryan Hewitt also are competing for spots at the position.\n\nOFFENSIVE LINEMEN (9)\n\nIt's possible the Bengals end up taking only nine linemen so they can fit additional players at other positions. For instance, they could end up taking another running back or another receiver. It's common for most teams to have nine or 10 linemen, and this group seems to provide the versatility coaches are seeking. Of the undrafted free-agent linemen the Bengals signed this year, Trey Hopkins -- a versatile guard who was used in a variety of ways this spring -- has the best shot to make the team, but even he's just barely left off this list.\n\nDEFENSIVE LINE (9)\n\nThe only player on this list who wasn't on last year's 53-man roster is Will Clarke. The rookie was drafted in the third round in May. He effectively takes the roster spot of Michael Johnson, who signed with Tampa Bay in the offseason. This may be the most set group on the team. Another name to watch, though, is 360-pound LaKendrick Ross. The defensive tackle was added nearly two weeks ago and could give the Bengals an added run-stopping presence in certain situations. He hasn't played much football, though, so coaches have a tall task teaching him schemes and concepts, and reaffirming fundamentals.\n\nLINEBACKERS (6)\n\nLike the receivers, the top spots at linebacker are pretty much squared away. In this case, it's a veritable lock that Vontaze Burfict, Emmanuel Lamur, Vincent Rey and Rey Maualuga will make the team. The two remaining linebackers, on the other hand, will be part of one of the better position battles on the team. DiManche and Flowers have the best chances among the rest of the outside linebackers to make the team, but they'll have to fend off Sean Porter, Brandon Joiner and James Davidson too. Dontay Moch could make the team because of his versatility as a stand-up defensive end and hybrid linebacker. J.K. Schaffer was snubbed on this list at middle linebacker, but there's a lot about his drive and internal makeup that could make him a repeat roster surprise.\n\nCORNERBACKS (6)\n\nThe top four positions are effectively locked down. Kirkpatrick runs the risk of being cut for performance reasons, but it's unlikely he will be dismissed because the Bengals would take a $1.2 million cap hit if they let go of the former first-round pick. The sixth cornerback spot will be a battle between Hampton, R.J. Stanford, Lavelle Westbrooks, Chris Lewis-Harris and Onterio McCalebb. Hampton has some versatility and ability the Bengals like, as well as special-teams leanings.\n\nSAFETIES (4)\n\nThis may end up being one of the tougher cuts Bengals coaches have, if they end up keeping just four safeties. Taylor Mays would be the odd man out in this situation, which might come as a surprise given how well his spring and summer practices have gone. Nelson and Iloka are virtual locks, Manning seems like a good veteran addition and Williams factors into the team's future at the position.\n\nSPECIALISTS (3)\n\nThese guys aren't going anywhere. The punter, kicker and long snapper will make the team.",

Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nEPA Administrator Scott Pruitt in his Washington, D.C. office. (Photo11: Ledyard King, USA TODAY)\n\nWASHINGTON â EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt isnât just dismantling the Clean Power Plan and other high-profile environmental programs of the Obama era. Heâs on a mission to re-engineer the agencyâs culture by returning power to states and away from the Washington bureaucrats and coastal elites he said have led it astray.\n\nThe EPA, for example, is doing away with the âsue-and-settleâ approach that Pruitt said improperly allowed the Obama administration to circumvent laws by rewriting regulations behind closed doors with friendly environmental groups who filed lawsuits.\n\nThe agency also has rewritten membership rules for the agencyâs advisory boards, so that both industry advocates and academics from Midwestern and Mountain states â which Pruitt said were under-represented â have greater influence when counseling agency leaders on new rules.\n\nAnd heâs adopted a âred team/blue teamâ model designed to challenge climate change assumptions that global warming is occurring and humans are the primary cause â a view endorsed both by the vast majority of scientists and by a massive federal report the White House issued earlier this month.\n\nPruitt, who challenged the Clean Power Plan as Oklahoma attorney general, said heâs plowing ahead with the rollback of the rule designed to curb carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants despite the reportâs conclusions.\n\nAnd he said the red team/blue team approach that promotes âcurious inquiry and continued analysisâ is integral to the rigorous self-analysis he believes the EPA has been lacking in recent years.\n\nâIâm an attorney. I believe in bringing people together in an open process to encourage peer review, thatâs what science is,â Pruitt said during a recent interview in his office. âWe shouldnât run from that ... Thatâs something we ought to embrace as a culture and I think as an agency.â\n\nRed Team/Blue Team\n\nOf all Pruittâs moves to reshape an agency whose authority he frequently challenged in court, the red team/blue team strategy has raised some of the loudest alarm bells among his many critics who consider it an attack on settled science.\n\nThe exercise was designed at the height of the Cold War to assess Soviet reactions to various scenarios. And thatâs where it belongs â not to relitigate the proven facts of climate science, said former New Jersey GOP Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who served as EPA administrator under George W. Bush.\n\nâThat Mr. Pruitt seeks to use the power of the EPA to elevate those who have already lost the argument is shameful, and the only outcome will be that the public will know less about the science of climate change than before,â she wrote in a opinion column for The New York Times entitled \"How not to run the EPA\"\n\nKen Cuccinelli, a Pruitt ally and former Republican attorney general from Virginia, said the EPA administrator rightly believes the agency needs to return to its roots and abandon quixotic pursuits Obama conducted on global warming embodied by the Clean Power Plan and the decision to sign on to the international treaty known as the Paris Accord.\n\nFormer Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli defends how Scott Pruitt is running the EPA. (Photo11: Molly Riley, AP)\n\nâThe previous administration weaponized this agency,â Cuccinelli said. âThey were assaulting America through the EPA. Scott believes in clean water and clean air. Thereâs never been any doubt about that. But all of the other creative stuff is the kind of stuff that political elites want to spend their time on and if it affects Americans all it does is reduce their opportunities.â\n\nChanging a culture\n\nPruitt arrived at EPA under a mutual cloud of hostility.\n\nHe had sued the agency 14 times on behalf of Oklahoma challenging a variety of regulations and billing himself as âa leading activist against EPAâs activist agenda.â A month after he took the helm in February, the budget released by President Trump, an ardent EPA critic, proposed gutting the $8.2 billion agency by nearly a third.\n\nIn turn, Pruitt was opposed loudly by hundreds of former EPA employees, and more quietly by some current ones. They feared he would assist the petrochemical industry he grew close to in Oklahoma while ignoring the carefully constructed science that served as the foundation of many public health protections.\n\nSubsequent cuts in pollution enforcement and the departure of hundreds of veteran EPA staffers through a buyout program have given environmental groups more reason to worry.\n\nNearly a year into his tenure, Pruitt still feels the resistance from employees who have yet to buy into his message that the EPA ought to work more with business to find mutually acceptable solutions when it comes to public health.\n\nâThe most challenging thing that we encounter (at EPA) is this thinking, this attitude that we as a country have to choose between growth and jobs and being good stewards of our environment,â he recently told an audience at the conservative Federalist Society National Lawyers Convention. âWe can do both. But the past few years, weâve been told itâs prohibition, itâs put up a fence, it's do not touch. And frankly I donât think thatâs consistent with the law. I donât think thatâs consistent with how weâve done business as a country.â\n\nHis many critics say thatâs code for giving the energy industry and other polluters carte blanche to maximize profit with little regard for environmental damage.\n\nNormally soft-spoken Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, described Pruitt during his confirmation process earlier this year as âhostile to the basic protections to keep Americans and our environment safe.â\n\nBack to basics\n\nAs part of his effort to change the culture at EPA, Pruitt is touting a âback-to-basics â agenda that emphasizes partnerships with states and issues he calls central to the agencyâs mission when Congress created it in 1970.\n\nHeâs prioritizing cleanup of toxic Superfund sites, lead-tainted drinking water systems, and abandoned mines.\n\nThose issues, he said, took a back seat the previous eight years as the Obama administration engaged in regulatory over-reach on climate change and the âWaters of the U.S.â rule that spelled out that streams, rivers and other bodies can be regulated by the federal government.\n\nMore: Pruitt moves to shake up EPA advisory boards, further antagonizing environmental activists\n\nMore: Exclusive: EPA's Pruitt vows to continue rolling back rules despite alarming climate report\n\nMore: Rollback of Clean Power Plan rule by EPA Administrator Pruitt won't happen overnight\n\nâOur job is to administer statutes,â he said in the interview. âWe have to act based on the authority given to us by Congress. When this agency and other agencies in the past have gone askew is when theyâve created and filled in the vacuum. Thatâs what they did with the Clean Power Plan ... Weâre correcting that.â\n\nPruitt points to Superfund as an area that previous administrators should have taken more time to address. Heâs visited a lead-contaminated site in East Chicago, Ind., and the Gold King mine in Colorado (where a mistake by an EPA contractor in 2015 led to a major spill) to emphasize the programâs importance.\n\nHe often talks about the problems at the West Lake Landfill near St. Louis and how the EPA still hasnât decided how to proceed 27 years after it was tagged as a Superfund site.\n\nâNot clean it up. Not fix the problem. But just simply decide,â he told the Federalist Society.\n\nMore than half of the original 406 sites from 1983 remain on the list. On average, it takes about 19 years for a site to be removed from the list, according to to the Government Accountability Office.\n\nGina McCarthy, who served as EPA administrator during Obamaâs second term, brushed aside the notion that Superfund was not a priority under her watch. And she said Pruittâs view of his agencyâs role is so narrow itâs imperiling public health.\n\nFormer EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. (Photo11: Brian Ach, Getty Images for The New Yorker)\n\nâIt is just ridiculous to think that you can ignore the most significant threats to public health today while chasing Superfund sites that have been around for 20 years,â she said. âYou donât make those choices. You do both.â\n\nShe said Pruittâs plan to address the nationâs most toxic sites will be much tougher if Congress goes along with Trumpâs 2018 budget proposal to slash by $330 million the nearly $1.1 billion Superfund received this year.\n\nâThe challenge has been resources constraints,â she said. âSo for an administrator to say heâs going back to basics and even caring about doing a better job with Superfund while heâs defending a budget that would dismantle the agency and reduce Superfund, it doesnât seem like a very consistent message to me.â\n\nFederalism\n\nCuccinelli acknowledges that it is an odd pairing to have Pruitt, someone from âfly-over country,â heading an agency âfavored by the cocktail party set.â\n\nBut he thinks it will take someone like the Kentucky-born, former Cincinnati Reds baseball prospect to shake up an agency in need of cultural re-orientation.\n\n\"God forbid we have an administrator of the EPA who thinks itâs important to obey the law and Scott does.\" he said.\n\nPruitt doesn't use the term political elites when he describes his predecessors at the EPA but it's clear he considers himself someone attuned to the needs of states, especially the red ones that resented much of the Obama environmental agenda.\n\nEPA Administrator Scott Pruitt holds up a poster showing how his planned changes to the makeup of three key advisory committees will be more geographically diverse. (Photo11: Ledyard King, USA TODAY)\n\nIt's one reason he took the unprecedented step last month of barring scientists who receive EPA grants from serving on any of the agency's nearly two dozen advisory boards. The move to eliminate what Pruitt described as \"political science\" opened up seats for researchers representing industries and institutions based in the middle of the country whose input he said hasn't always been valued.\n\nRobert Johnson, an economics professor at Clark University in Massachusetts and a past member of the EPA Science Advisory Board, criticized Pruitt's decision.\n\nThe advisory board \"has always been bastion of truth and independent scientific advice that withstood changes in political administrations and differences of political opinion,\" Johnson. \"That changed (with Pruitt's act).\"\n\nPruitt also speaks of the importance of restoring \"federalism\" where states have an equal seat at the table when it comes to implementing clean air and water programs.\n\nMcCarthy pushed back on his interpretation.\n\n\"Federalism does not mean that the agency doesn't do its work in accordance with Congress. And Congress, on issues like the Clean Air Act, did not give states the role of primacy,\" she said.\n\nNonetheless, members of Congress who clashed with Obama are clearly delighted that Pruitt is driving an agenda that many of their constituents back home like.\n\nWhen Pruitt last month told an audience of coal miners in Hazard, Ky., that \"the war on coal is over\" as he announced the administration's plan to repeal the Clean Power Plan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., seemed clearly tickled.\n\n\"It's great to have an administrator of the EPA,\" McConnell said as he introduced Pruitt, \"who's not afraid to come to Kentucky.â\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2BcVo0k",
  "latent_26677": "Story highlights Hiring managers find that some parents are overly involved in their kids' first jobs\n\n\"Helicopter parents\" might call to inquire about benefits or job duties\n\nThese parents can diminish their children's credibility and independence\n\nEmployers and behavior experts advise allowing a child to make mistakes and grow\n\nNicole Williams thought she had found the ideal job applicant -- until a phone call came from Mom.\n\nOnly thing was it wasn't her mom; it was the potential employee's.\n\n\"She wanted to know everything from where [the job candidate] would be sitting to a review of her responsibilities,\" said Williams, the career expert for LinkedIn, the professional networking site.\n\n\"I withdrew the offer,\" she said.\n\nThis wasn't the only time Williams had encountered the parental presence of a young employee.\n\nShe previously had a call from a parent who didn't agree with her son's performance proposal and asked if she could come into her office to discuss. In a presentation in front of new clients, Williams also witnessed a new graduate using the phrase \"my dad thinks\" as it pertained to the project.\n\nAs college students and graduates seek entry into the world of 9-to-5 this summer via internships and full-time jobs, parents that previously helped select their child's course load are turning their attention to their child's employer.\n\nHowever, what these so-called helicopter parents might not realize is that their hovering ways can undermine their child's advancement, instead of making them soar.\n\nIn 2012, University of Cincinnati senior Aubrey Ireland filed and won a civil stalking order against her parents after unannounced visits and cyber-monitoring, among other complaints.\n\n\"It's just been really embarrassing and upsetting to have my parents come to my university when I'm a grown adult and just basically slander my name and follow me around,\" Ireland said in a court hearing.\n\n\"She's an only child who was catered to all her life by loving parents,\" Julie Ireland, Aubrey's mom, fired back in court. \"We're not bothering her. We're not a problem.\"\n\nThe term \"helicopter parent\" sealed its fate as part of the American lexicon when it was introduced into the Merriam-Webster Dictionary in 2011 as \"a parent who is overly involved in the life of his or her child.\"\n\nA spring 2013 survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers found that companies expect to hire approximately 2.1% more college graduates from the Class of 2013 than they did from the Class of 2012; a promising outlook that can only add fuel to a helicopter parent's engine.\n\nBut, when searching for that employment, first impressions should be left to the child, not the parent, said consultant and recruiter Stacy Pursell.\n\n\"My thought is if they are too busy to conduct their own job search, then I am too busy to help them find a position,\" Pursell said.\n\nParenting psychologists along with career experts like Williams and Pursell assert that hovering guardians are stalling their kids' hiring future by being hyper-present.\n\n\"You are not doing your kid any favors. Encourage them to share their fears, thoughts and ideas with you after hours and you can absolutely do the same,\" Williams said. \"But make it clear that he/she has to form and express their own opinions and create their own experiences in order to build professional confidence and respect.\"\n\nWilliams says as much as parents would like to, they can't give their children a career -- their children have to earn it.\n\n\"When it comes down to it, as a parent you want to give your child the best and protect them from distress,\" she said. But being overprotective isn't helping them either.\n\nAaron Cooper, a clinical psychologist at The Family Institute at Northwestern University, says mollycoddling mothers and doting dads can become a child's crutch.\n\nCooper says children, for the most part, often experience too many advantages of their omnipresent parents by the time they reach their teen years, so they're not particularly inclined to tell mom and dad to back off.\n\n\"They're more inclined to welcome the help because they are also seeing it as a cheerleader on their team pushing forward toward victory and success,\" Cooper said.\n\nBut \"it's almost like a soft disability in their lives,\" he added, meaning that children become super reliant on their parents and unable to stand on their own.\n\nCooper attributes the growing phenomenon of over-parenting to a variety of factors. The first commonality is feelings of guilt that parents may have short-changed their children.\n\nThis is particularly potent when the parents have had full-time careers and may feel that they never really spent enough time with the children as they grew up. Cooper says it's the \"I'm-going-to-make-up-for-it mentality.\"\n\nCooper also says children have increasingly become an emblem of their parents' success.\n\n\"It's part of our own resume as parents to indicate how accomplished our children are. Their resume is a kind of extension of our resume,\" Cooper says.\n\nThis wasn't the case 50 years ago, he asserts. Parents left their children alone a lot more, and they looked for signs of their own success in life.\n\nToday helicopter parenting, he says, is an increasing sign of the influence of the middle-class. With the median household income in the United States as $52,762, according to U.S. Census Bureau, parents might be able to focus less on their own day-to-day economic struggles and focus more on their children's day-to-day lives.\n\nNot to mention, Cooper says, the 24/7 connectivity now makes it easier for kids and parents to trade resumes, job listings, even human resource contacts with the click of the mouse.\n\nWilliams and Pursell, like Cooper, say while parental advice is always valuable, certain areas of the job search should be considered a no-fly zone.\n\n\"It is OK to do some online research to help their child find a job, but when it comes to actually contacting an employer or a recruiter, the applicant needs to make that inquiry themselves,\" Pursell said.\n\nAs for something solely left up to the parents? Learning how to step away.\n\nNot doing so is \"making it hard to develop resilience, self-sufficiency and autonomy,\" Cooper said. \"If they [children] have not developed the resilience by their teenage years, we don't know if they will ever develop it.\"",

  "latent_27474": "In this May 16, 2017 photo released by China's Xinhua News Agency, gas flare out from a drilling platform that extracted natural gas from combustible ice trapped under the seafloor of the South China Sea. Commercial development of the globe's vast reserves of a frozen fossil fuel known as combustible ice has moved closer to reality after Japan and China successfully extracted the material from the seafloor. (Liang Xu/Xinhua via AP)\n\nBEIJING (AP) â Commercial development of the globeâs huge reserves of a frozen fossil fuel known as âcombustible iceâ has moved closer to reality after Japan and China successfully extracted the material from the seafloor off their coastlines.\n\nBut experts said Friday that large-scale production remains many years away â and if not done properly could flood the atmosphere with climate-changing greenhouse gases.\n\nCombustible ice is a frozen mixture of water and concentrated natural gas. Technically known as methane hydrate, it can be lit on fire in its frozen state and is believed to comprise one of the worldâs most abundant fossil fuels.\n\nThe official Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that the fuel was successfully mined by a drilling rig operating in the South China Sea on Thursday. Chinese Minister of Land and Resources Jiang Daming declared the event a breakthrough moment heralding a potential âglobal energy revolution.â\n\nA drilling crew in Japan reported a similar successful operation two weeks earlier, on May 4 offshore the Shima Peninsula.\n\nFor Japan, methane hydrate offers the chance to reduce its heavy reliance of imported fuels if it can tap into reserves off its coastline. In China, it could serve as a cleaner substitute for coal-burning power plants and steel factories that have polluted much of the country with lung-damaging smog.\n\nThe South China Sea has become a focal point of regional political tensions as China has claimed huge swaths of disputed territory as its own. Previous sea oil exploration efforts by China met resistance, especially from Vietnam, but its methane hydrate operation was described as being outside the most hotly contested areas.\n\nMethane hydrate has been found beneath seafloors and buried inside Arctic permafrost and beneath Antarctic ice. The United States and India also have research programs pursuing technologies to capture the fuel.\n\nEstimates of worldwide reserves range from 280 trillion cubic meters (10,000 trillion cubic feet) up to 2,800 trillion cubic meters (100,000 trillion cubic feet), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. By comparison, total worldwide production of natural gas was 3.5 billion cubic meters (124 billion cubic feet) in 2015, the most recent year available.\n\nThat means methane hydrate reserves could meet global gas demands for 80 to 800 years at current consumption rates.\n\nYet efforts to successfully extract the fuel at a profit have eluded private and state-owned energy companies for decades. Thatâs in part because of the high cost of extraction techniques, which can use large amounts of water or carbon dioxide to flood methane hydrate reserves so the fuel can be released and brought to the surface.\n\nJapan first extracted some of the material in 2013 but ended the effort due to sand from the seafloor clogging machinery, according to the countryâs Ministry of Economy Trade and Tourism.\n\nThere are also environmental concerns.\n\nIf methane hydrate leaks during the extraction process, it can increase greenhouse gas emissions. The fuel also could displace renewables such as solar and wind power, said David Sandalow, a former senior official with the U.S. State Department now at Columbia Universityâs Center on Global Energy Policy.\n\nHowever, if it can be used without leaking, it has the potential to replace dirtier coal in the power sector.\n\nâThe climate implications of producing natural gas hydrates are complicated. There are potential benefits, but substantial risks,â Sandalow said.\n\nCommercial-scale production could be âtransformative for northeast Asia, particularly for Japan, which imports nearly all its hydrocarbon needs,â said James Taverner, a senior energy industry researcher at IHS Market, a London-based consulting firm.\n\nThe consensus within the industry is that commercial development wonât happen until at least 2030. Smaller scale output could happen as early as 2020, said Tim Collett, a scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nâThe path to understanding when or if gas hydrates will be commercially produced will need many similar and more extended testing efforts,â Collett said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Matthew Brown on Twitter at twitter.com/matthewbrownap",

The Spurs now try to win a fourth straight game without Tony Parker while closing out a season-high nine-game road stretch Friday night against the Phoenix Suns, another Western Conference playoff contender that's returned from the break on a high note. While the Spurs (40-15) have won six of the first eight on their annual rodeo road trip, there's been more to it than simply a range of victories spanning the country. The emergence of reserve Patty Mills might be the most encouraging aspect, and it continued Wednesday as the fifth-year guard scored 29 points in a 111-109 win against Portland, his former team, with Parker and Tim Duncan sidelined. Parker is out with Achilles, back, groin and calf ailments, while the 37-year-old Duncan got his typical rest during the second leg of a back-to-back. \"If it wasn't for him the last couple nights, we would have really struggled,\" San Antonio forward Danny Green said of Mills. \"He's doing what Tony usually does, in taking over in that fourth quarter.\" Mills scored 25 on Tuesday in Los Angeles, but his surge dates beyond just the previous two games. He's averaged 21.0 points over his last seven, including a season-high 32 on Feb. 8 at Charlotte, while never logging more than 29 minutes. \"For me, it's just been learning from great guys,\" Mills said. \"We've got three future Hall of Famers and a great coach, so I've just sat back and learned.\" Fellow guard Marco Belinelli added 20 points and was 4 of 6 from 3-point range, while Green and Manu Ginobili each had 16 against Portland. The hobbled Southwest Division leaders got a bit healthier with the return of Tiago Splitter, who added 15 points and six rebounds after a four-game absence due to a calf injury. In addition to Parker, San Antonio remains without small forward Kawhi Leonard, who has missed 13 games with a broken bone in his right hand. He's resumed practicing, though, and is nearing a return. The Spurs have won eight of nine against the Suns (32-21), including four straight on the road and both meetings this season. The most recent came without Parker, who sat out a 108-101 victory at Phoenix on Dec. 18 because of a bruised shin. Duncan had 17 points and 13 rebounds in that one, while Ginobili scored a game-high 24. Channing Frye had 22 points in the loss to lead five Suns in double figures, which they bettered Thursday in a balanced 100-94 home win over Boston. The victory improved Phoenix to 2-0 since the break, both games also coming on back-to-back nights. Markieff Morris scored 18, and Goran Dragic and Gerald Green added 17 apiece as six players reached at least 10. \"Coming off the back-to-back we were a little tired, a little exhausted,\" said Frye, who added 15 points and seven rebounds. \"And I think we had some mental breakdowns, but other than that, I think we just battle and grind it out.\" Gerald Green's solid night followed his career-high 36 points at Denver on Tuesday, and the 6-foot-8 guard is averaging 26.0 over his last four games. The win over Boston was the third in the last four contests for Phoenix, which opened a nine-game stretch that features only one road game Feb. 26 at Utah. The Suns sit 3 1/2 games behind the Pacific Division-leading Clippers.\n\nCopyright 2014 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

So their winter journey ended in Phoenix, against the NBA's top fast-break team with arguably the league's fastest player in Ish Smith. The result was a 106-85 Suns victory. Smith scored a career-high 15 points, matched his career best of seven rebounds and triggered a decisive second-quarter run. \"I'm like Ricky Bobby (from the Will Ferrell movie \"Talladega Nights\"), I want to go fast,\" Smith said. \"The biggest thing with us is we want to play that pace. We want to constantly push the ball, push the ball. That's what makes us really good.\" Markieff Morris scored 21 points and Channing Frye 17 for Phoenix. Gerald Green and Marcus Morris added 13 apiece. Danny Green had 15 points and Tim Duncan 13 for the Spurs, who finished a nine-game road trip, the team's annual sojourn while a rodeo is held back home. The Spurs went 6-3 on the swing. The Suns, 3-0 since the All-Star break, snapped San Antonio's three-game winning streak and climbed to a season-high 12 games above .500. \"You never know how you are going to get a team,\" Suns coach Jeff Hornacek said. \"They have been on the road for a long time, they were probably itching to get back home. They had an off night and we had a decent night. We will take it.\" The Spurs' NBA-best road record dropped to 22-8. \"They made shots, we didn't, and we turned it over,\" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. \"It wasn't bad. Our ninth road game in a row, they played hard and we couldn't stick it in the hole. It happens. It was a great trip. Six and three on that trip under the circumstances of all the guys out and back and forth, I thought they were great.\" The Suns outscored San Antonio 28-12 in the second quarter to lead 47-35 at the break, the Spurs' lowest scoring half of the season With a lineup of mostly bench players, the Suns scored 19 points in a row in what eventually became a 26-3 second-quarter run. San Antonio got the first basket of the quarter, then didn't score again until Duncan's three-point play with 5:11 to play in the period. Frye responded with a 3-pointer, then Smith scored twice inside, the second on a nifty underhanded layup in traffic, and Phoenix had its biggest lead of the half, 45-28, with 3:06 to play. Smith, getting added court time because Leandro Barbosa was out with a sprained left big toe, was 5-for-5 shooting in the second quarter for 10 points with five rebounds, two assists and a steal. \"(Russell) Westbrook is fast, but he's not like dash fast, first step,\" teammate Goran Dragic said. \"Ish is special. It's harder because he's so small and when he goes low, it's even harder to stay in front of him.\" Smith almost singlehandedly speeded up the game. \"The game was kind of their pace,\" Hornacek said. \"I think we were down 21-17 when he came in and he got the tempo going, really pushed the ball, got our guys in that running mode.\" San Antonio's 12-point second quarter matched its lowest-scoring quarter of the season. The Suns outscored the Spurs 17-7 to open the second half, taking a 64-42 lead on Frye's 3-pointer with 5:39 left in the period. About that time, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich sat Duncan and Manu Ginobili for the night. Ginobili, a game-time decision because of a sore hamstring, played 13 minutes. For the Spurs, Patty Mills was 2 of 14 from the field and Marco Belinelli 1 for 8. San Antonio was 2 of 21 from 3-point range. The 21-point loss was the second-worst of the season for San Antonio. The Spurs lost by 23 at the Los Angeles Clippers Dec. 16. NOTES: Phoenix snapped a five-game losing streak against the Spurs. ... Tony Parker missed his fourth game in a row for what Popovich labeled an assortment of ailments. ... Popovich drew a technical seven minutes into the game and the Suns' P.J. Tucker got one in the second quarter. ... The Spurs have five days off before playing their first home game since Feb. 1, against Detroit next Wednesday.\n\nCopyright 2014 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

THE LEAD: The San Antonio Spurs ran out of horsepower at the end of their rodeo trip. In rolling to a 106-85 win, the Suns took advantage of a Spurs' team that played its ninth and final game of the lengthy, annual trip that accommodates a rodeo in their home arena. The Suns moved to 33-21 as they make a push not only for a playoff spot, but perhaps even a shot at a top-four seed and the homecourt advantage in the first round. Backup guard Ish Smith, looking like Magic Johnson against the weary Spurs, put on a running and passing show in leading the Suns on a stunning 19-0 run in the second quarter. That made it 38-25, Suns, who controlled the game the rest of the way. Markieff Morris had a great all-round game for the Suns with 21 points, five rebounds, five assists and three steals. Channing Frye added 17 points. Smith rolled up a career-high 15 points and tied a career high with seven boards. For the Spurs (40-16), who continued to rest star guard Tony Parker, Danny Green had 15 points. The Suns have won 11 of their past 15, including three straight. QUOTABLE: \"I'm like Ricky Bobby. I just want to go fast.\"\n\n-- Ish Smith THE STAT: The Phoenix Suns are 20-6 when playing with one day of rest, including 12-3 at home. TURNING POINT: Trailing 25-19, the Suns got the pace moving early in the second quarter; the result was a dazzling 19-0 run. QUOTABLE II: \"Nine in a row is a bit much by anybody's standard.\"\n\n-- Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, pregame on the end of the rodeo trip QUOTABLE III: \"They were probably itching to get home. They had an off night.\"\n\n-- Suns coach Jeff Hornacek on the Spurs QUOTABLE IV: \"A lot of credit goes to Jeff. He will try to deflect it all because of who he is. He sets a tone and has a lot of credibility for the way he has carried himself through his career. He is persistent...he played a hard-nosed brand of basketball. He played in a system where standards were high in both places, Utah and Phoenix. His players have the character to respond, adjust and buy into his system and the way he wants to play. They don't have any problems or drama. They compete.\"\n\n-- Gregg Popovich on Hornacek and the Suns QUOTABLE V: \"We figured that with out style, Ish would be a good fit. He can push the ball. He's an energy guy that other guys can feed off of.\"\n\n-- Jeff Hornacek on Ish Smith HOT: Smith shot 7-for-9; Morris, 8-for-10. NOT: The Spurs hit 2-for-21 on 3-pointers. GOOD MOVE: Hornacek used Smith extended time, sometimes alongside Goran Dragic, to force a fast pace. IN THE ARENA: Though there scattered empty seats throughout the building, the Suns called the game a sellout of 18,422. That's the Suns' first sellout of the season and first since April 5, 2013 vs. Golden State. ROOKIE WATCH: The Suns' Archie Goodwin had nine points in 14 minutes. The Suns' Alex Len had two points in seven minutes. NOTABLE: The Suns held the Spurs to 35 points in the first half, a Spurs' season low for either half...Even with the easy win, the Suns a lengthy scoring streak snapped. Dragic (eight points) had scored 15-plus in 25 straight games. UP NEXT: For the Spurs, Wednesday vs. Detroit, Friday vs. Charlotte and Sunday, March 2 vs. Dallas. For the Suns, Sunday vs. Houston, Tuesday vs. Minnesota and Wednesday @ Utah.",

  "latent_27651": "Kyle David Whittingham (born November 21, 1959) is the head football coach of the University of Utah Utes. Prior to becoming the head coach at Utah, Whittingham served as Utah's defensive coordinator for ten seasons. He was named head coach of Utah after Urban Meyer left for the Florida Gators in 2004. He won AFCA Coach of the Year and the Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Award in 2008.\n\nPlaying career [ edit ]\n\nWhittingham played linebacker for the BYU Cougars from 1978 to 1981. In 1981, he earned first-team all-WAC and WAC Defensive Player of the Year honors.[2] Whittingham was also named the defensive MVP of the 1981 Holiday Bowl. He played in all of the first four Holiday Bowls. In his first appearance, he played as a running back and the other three as a linebacker, during which he recorded 27 tackles. In 2009, he was inducted into the Holiday Bowl Hall of Fame.[3]\n\nHe graduated from BYU in 1981 and went on to play linebacker for the Denver Gold and New Orleans Breakers of the USFL and the Calgary Stampeders of the CFL. He also played for the Los Angeles Rams' replacement squad in 1987.[2]\n\nCoaching career [ edit ]\n\nEarly coaching career [ edit ]\n\nWhittingham became a graduate assistant for BYU during the 1985 and 1986 seasons. In 1987, Whittingham was named defensive coordinator at the College of Eastern Utah. He coached there for a season before taking a job at Idaho State. After five seasons with Idaho State, Whittingham joined the Utah staff as defensive line coach, working alongside his father, Fred Whittingham. In the 1995 season, Whittingham replaced his father as the defensive coordinator, serving under both Ron McBride and Meyer until being named head coach in 2004.\n\nHead coaching career [ edit ]\n\nThe 2004 season ended with Utah becoming the first BCS non-AQ conference team to make a BCS bowl game, the Fiesta Bowl. After winning the Fiesta Bowl, the Utes' overall record improved to 12â0. After the 2004 season, the Utes lost junior starting quarterback Alex Smith to the NFL and head coach Urban Meyer who left to the University of Florida. After the regular season, and before the Fiesta Bowl, Whittingham was offered the head coaching job at Utah and also the head coaching job at his alma mater, Brigham Young University. After struggling with the decision for four days he chose the Utes.[4] Because Urban Meyer had already officially accepted the head coaching job at Florida before the Fiesta Bowl, Whittingham and Meyer acted as co-head coaches of the 2005 Fiesta Bowl. Utah and the NCAA credit the Fiesta Bowl to both Meyer and Whittingham.[5]\n\n2005 [ edit ]\n\nWhittingham's first season was an up and down ride for Utah as the team not only adjusted to a new coaching staff, including Andy Ludwig, but also a new offense led by quarterback Brian Johnson. Utah struggled early on, going 3â4 in their first 7 games, however, a strong finish gave Utah their third straight bowl invite.\n\nIn the 2005 Emerald Bowl the Utes faced the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Utah beat Georgia Tech 38â10, the Yellow Jackets' worst bowl loss by point margin in school history. Whittingham finished his first year at Utah with a 7â5 record.\n\n2006 [ edit ]\n\nIn 2006, Whittingham's team faced a degree of adversity. Starting quarterback Brett Ratliff struggled through parts of the year, and so did the Utes. Like the year before, the Utes rebounded toward the end of the season, but lost to rival BYU at home by a score of 33â31. The Utes became bowl eligible for the fourth straight year, a school record. Whittingham led the Utes to a 25â13 victory over the University of Tulsa in the 2006 Armed Forces Bowl, running his record to 15â10 (.600) with Utah.\n\n2007 [ edit ]\n\n2007 would provide more adversity. In Johnson's first start since 2005, he broke his collarbone against Oregon State and starting running back Matt Asiata broke his leg as Utah got routed 24â7 by the Beavers. The following week, wide receiver Brent Casteel was lost for the season in an embarrassing 20â12 loss at home to Air Force.\n\nUtah looked as if it righted the ship the following week with a 44â6 rout of No. 9 UCLA, the highest-ranked team ever defeated by the Utes. But the following week represented the worst week of Whittingham's head coaching careerâa 27â0 loss to perennial cellar-dweller UNLV that had many wondering if Whittingham could survive as a head coach at Utah.\n\nBut like past seasons, the Utes regrouped and won seven consecutive games, using a stingy, big-play defense and the sledgehammer running attack of Darrell Mack (253 carries, 1,204 yards and 16 total touchdowns), who had been scheduled to redshirt in what was going to be his junior season. The Utes 50â0 drubbing of Wyoming proved controversial. Up 43â0 in the second half, Whittingham decided to go for an onside kick. An emotional Joe Glenn was caught on camera giving Whittingham the bird after the play. In the season finale, Utah suffered its second consecutive loss to rival BYU to end the regular season, 17â10.\n\nWhittingham and Utah overcame that disappointment to beat Navy, 35â32, in the 2007 Poinsettia Bowl. It marked the Utes' seventh consecutive bowl victory, which placed them second to Boston College in longest active bowl winning streaks.\n\n2008 [ edit ]\n\nIn 2008, Utah completed an undefeated regular season and qualified for the 2009 Sugar Bowl. Along the way were wins at Michigan, late come-from-behind wins over Oregon State and TCU, and a convincing victory over rival BYU. Overall, Utah finished the regular season holding wins over three teams in the final AP Top 25.\n\nUtah defeated Alabama, 31â17, in the Sugar Bowl,[6] completing the fifth undefeated and untied season in school history.\n\nThe American Football Coaches Association selected Whittingham as the 2008 AFCA National Coach of the Year Award.[7] The announcement was made at the football coaches' convention, which Whittingham attended. The AFCA award is the oldest national coach of the year award, dating back to 1935, and is the only one chosen exclusively by the coaches.\n\nHe also won the 2008 Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Award.[7]\n\nThe 2008 Utah football team was chosen by the A&H, MCFR, and W postseason polls as 2008 National Champions, essentially being named Co-National Champions with Florida that year. Florida went 13-1 and won the 2009 BCS National Championship Game over Oklahoma.\n\n2009 [ edit ]\n\nIn 2009, Utah had its second consecutive 10-win season. They finished with a 10â3 (6â2 MWC) record and a 37â27 win over California in the 2009 Poinsettia Bowl.[8] Whittingham helped the Utes reach these benchmarks with two new coordinators: Dave Schramm as the offensive coordinator and Kalani Sitake as the defensive coordinator. Utah's three losses came against teams that finished the season ranked: Oregon, TCU, and BYU who finished the season ranked No. 11, 6, and 12 in the AP Poll, respectively. Utah finished ranked No. 18 in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll.[9]\n\n2010 [ edit ]\n\nKyle Whittingham turned down the head coaching position at Tennessee early in 2010.[10]\n\nUtah started the 2010 season with an upset of then-15th ranked Pittsburgh. The Utes then managed the third 8â0 start in program history, rising to fifth in the BCS rankings. However, during a 68â27 victory over Iowa State, Utah quarterback Jordan Wynn injured his arm and though he continued to play, the injury impacted the remainder of the season. After that 8â0 start, the Utes stumbled badly at home against the TCU Horned Frogs, lost a sloppy contest to Notre Dame and then bounced back to end the regular season with victories over San Diego State and rival Brigham Young University.\n\nDue to the injury, Wynn, who finished the regular season in spite of his injury, missed the Las Vegas Bowl â a 26â3 loss to the Boise State Broncos. It was the program's first bowl loss since the 1996 Copper Bowl and snapped a 9-game bowl winning streak, which was, at the time, the longest active streak in college football.\n\nThe Utes finished the 2010 campaign 10â3 and 23rd in the nation. It marked the first time in program history that Utah produced three consecutive ten-win seasons.\n\n2011 [ edit ]\n\nIn its inaugural season in the Pac-12 Conference, Utah finished with an 8â5 record (4â5 Pac-12).\n\n2016\n\nOn January 29, 2016, The University of Utah announced Whittingham had agreed to a contract extension through the 2020 season. The contract will pay Whittingham $3.3 million per year. This came on the heels of Whitthingham surging past McBride to become the second-winningest coach in school history, behind only Ike Armstrong.\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nWhittingham was born on November 21, 1959 in San Luis Obispo, California. His father, Fred Whittingham, played linebacker professionally for nine years and then coached at the college and the pro level for almost twenty years.\n\nWhittingham graduated from BYU with a bachelor's degree in educational psychology in 1982. In 1983, he married the former Jamie Daniels. Whittingham then earned a master's degree in professional leadership in 1986.[4] Whittingham and his wife have four children.\n\nWhittingham is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[11]\n\nPhilanthropy [ edit ]\n\nIn 2008, Whittingham and former Utah head coach Urban Meyer were the first people to donate money to the Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin Family Scholarship, an endowed scholarship which will benefit the football program.[12][13]\n\nHead coaching record [ edit ]\n\nCoaching tree [ edit ]\n\nAssistant coaches under Kyle Whittingham who became NCAA head coaches:",
  "latent_27666": "A tweet by a city politician advertising an unpaid internship has landed her in trouble with constituents and youth advocates who say the position is illegal. The job posting for work in Councillor Ana Bailaoâs community office created âso much controversyâ that she removed it from her website last week.\n\nToronto councillor Ana Bailao advertised for an \"unpaid intern\" - a choice of words she later changed to \"volunteer.\" ( ANDREW FRANCIS WALLACE / TORONTO STAR )\n\nBut the posting â which includes duties such as social media monitoring, drafting letters and correspondence, research, data cataloguing and community asset mapping â is still on her Facebook page. âI really believe in that engagement and I wanted to particularly have the youth in my ward understand they can come here if they want,â said Bailao. âSometimes, to be honest with you, itâs a bit of work for us.â But the councillor is now categorizing the position as volunteer after advice from a Ministry of Labour hotline.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nâThe last thing I want is to do anything wrong,â she said. âI explained what my intention was and what I wanted to do. And (the ministry) said no, you should describe it as a volunteer.â Lawyer Andrew Langille said the âMinistry of Labour gave her very bad adviceâ and it must have been someone in a junior position. âIt doesnât matter if itâs the word volunteer or intern. It really goes to the duties that one is performing,â said Langille, who just finished a masterâs degree in law at Osgoode Hall on the issue . âIf youâre doing work that people normally get paid for, thereâs an argument that the employer is engaging in employee misclassification.â A spokesperson for the province also says that the work canât be categorized as volunteer. âThe legal test for a true volunteer arrangement looks at several factors, but merely agreeing to work without pay does not in itself make you a volunteer,â Ministry of Labour spokesperson Jonathon Rose wrote in an email.\n\nUnpaid internships are legal only in cases where someone is self-employed, in a co-op placement or a trainee, but there are strict criteria for the latter. The work has to be for the benefit of the intern and the employer should derive âlittle, if any, benefit from the activity,â according to a labour ministry website. The website also says the intern canât take someone elseâs job and canât be promised employment at the end of the training.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nâIf you perform work for someone you are an employee covered under the Employment Standards Act and should be paid â it doesnât matter if you are called an âinternâ or not,â said Rose. Despite the legislation, there are an estimated 100,000 illegal unpaid internships in the province every year, even though employers have a meagre one-in-10 success rate of defending them in court, said Langille. In a letter to Ward 18 residents, Bailao wrote that unpaid positions save taxpayer money and are necessary to âkeep on top of the immense amount of workâ needed to keep residents âinformed and engaged.â She wrote that the positions could lead to paying jobs. âIndeed the majority of my staff began a working relationship with me in volunteer roles.â Another politician, MPP Laura Albanese, recently advertised for an unpaid intern, but it was a mistake that has been corrected, said Rose. âMy understanding is the position was posted by a junior staff member without being reviewed and was later removed â no one was hired,â he said. The issue of unpaid interns was in the news earlier this month when the University of Toronto students union wrote an open letter to Labour Minister Yasir Naqvi asking for tighter controls to end what it called a widespread practice. The letter notes there is an 18 per cent unemployment rate for recent graduates. Rose said the ministry received the letter last week and is preparing a response.\n\nRead more about:",

While viewing the departmentâs ongoing recruitment effort â a smiling officer holding a âHelp Wantedâ sign on the street in front of Ridenhourâs office â the men decide that a recruitment video would be a more effective tool.

Orrin Hatch, Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn speak with reporters Thursday as work gets underway on the Senate's version of the GOP tax reform bill. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Senate GOPâs tax bill points to nasty fight ahead There are dramatic differences between the House and Senate versions of the tax overhaul, imperiling Trump's desire to sign legislation by year end.\n\nYawning divisions have emerged between the House, Senate and White House over tax reform, raising doubts about whether Republicans will be able to achieve their most important political and policy priority before the end of the year.\n\nThe Senate and House are split on some key issues, including the top tax rate and the timing of the corporate tax cut, and also at odds with President Donald Trump in many areas. Hard bargaining, battles between GOP factions and an onslaught of lobbying are the gauntlets Republicans will have to run to get legislation to Trump's desk by the end of the year â and into their mailers and ads for the 2018 elections.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIf one thing unifies Republicans and makes the job easier than it might appear, it's the fear that they will have nothing to take into those contests after the failure of another marquee effort, repealing and replacing Obamacare. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other GOP leaders used the drubbing the party took in Tuesday's election in Virginia as a warning to the rank and file: Pass tax reform or face the wrath of Republican voters.\n\n\"We are going to conference,\" Ryan told reporters Thursday, after the Senate unveiled its long-awaited plan and House tax writers advanced theirs to the House floor. \"Yes, the Senate bill is going to be different than the House bill because that's the legislative process.\"\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee approved its bill on a party-line 24-16 vote, and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the full House would vote on it next week.

The House wants to cut the tax immediately, and has the White House on its side.\n\nCutting the corporate rate is the centerpiece of the GOP plan to lower tax rates and spur faster economic growth. But the Senate is trying to limit the revenue impact to allow a bill to pass with just 51 votes and avoid a possible Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn another break with Trump, neither the Senate bill or the House bill includes a repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate requiring Americans to have health insurance. But Senate Republicans are still considering a repeal to help cover the cost of making some tax cuts permanent.\n\nGOP leaders are talking with rank-and-file members to assess whether they have the necessary 50 votes to scrap the least popular part of Obamacare.\n\n\"I'd sure like to do that,\" said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) \"I think we're counting votes. It sure gives us a lot more flexibility.\"\n\nTrump has pushed for repealing the mandate, along with conservative senators and House members. But many lawmakers said reopening the health care debate would just make passing the tax bill harder.\n\nThe Senate plan would set a top individual tax rate of 38.5 percent, compared to the House's 39.6 percent for annual income above $1 million, and keep deductions for people with high medical bills and for student loan interest that the House wants to discard.\n\nIt would completely eliminate a federal deduction for state and local taxes, while the House had to mollify a group of GOP lawmakers from high-tax blue states by keeping the deduction for property taxes, up to $10,000.\n\nThe Senate kept the maximum mortgage deduction at the interest on loans up to $1 million. The House would cut it to $500,000.\n\nThe House targeted the estate tax â a favorite foil of conservative Republicans â for elimination in 2025, after doubling the current exemptions to about $11 million for individuals and $22 million for married couples. The Senate is proposing only to double the exemptions.\n\nThe House proposed expanding the child tax credit to $1,600 per child from $1,000. The Senate set the increase at $1,650.\n\nBut that is still too low for some senators who want a $2,000-per-child credit because they worry some middle-income people could otherwise see their taxes go up under the plan â and they have an ally in Ivanka Trump. \"While we are glad to see an increase to the child tax credit, like the House bill, it is simply not enough for working families,\" Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah), the main champions of the issue in the Senate, said in a joint statement.\n\nOn another hot-button issue, the treatment of \"pass-through\" businesses that pay individual tax rates, the Senate would set a top rate of 30 percent, while owners of those businesses have been clamoring for parity with corporations. The House is offering a super-low 9 percent rate on the first $75,000 those businesses earn, which attracted praise from the powerful National Federation of Independent Business, which had panned the House bill last week.\n\nBoth bills would shift the U.S. to a \"territorial\" tax system that would largely shield offshore corporate income from U.S. taxation. But they parted ways on a mechanism to discourage more companies from moving abroad to take advantage of the change.\n\nAs the first details were trickling out about the Senate plan, Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) unveiled a new round of changes to the House GOP's plan.\n\nTheir tax plan had ballooned beyond their budget, allowing them to cut taxes by no more than $1.5 trillion, after Republicans earlier this week gutted a plan to crack down on international tax avoidance hated by the Koch brothers and a number of multinational corporations.\n\nThe revisions include hundreds of billions of dollars in new revenue aimed at filling that budget hole. Republicans did it in part by taking back much of the money â $87 billion â they had lost when they watered down those overseas tax avoidance provisions.\n\nAnother $70 billion would come from charging companies more in a one-time tax on their overseas earnings. Under the new plan, they'd pay 14 percent on their liquid assets and 7 percent on illiquid ones like factories overseas. That's up from 12 percent and 5 percent, respectively, under the previous proposal.\n\nHouse lawmakers want to raise another $20 billion by requiring people claiming the popular child tax credit to provide a Social Security number for their child, a provision long sought by Republicans aimed at preventing undocumented immigrants from taking the break.\n\nDelaying their plans to repeal the estate tax by another year saved them $21.5 billion. They'd raise another $109 billion from companies tapping a long-standing break for research and development expenses.\n\nOther House provisions would expand a tax on private university endowments and impose a surtax on life insurance companies.\n\nThe plan also would allow organizations such as charities and churches to engage in political speech without risking their tax-exempt status, and it restored a tax break for adopting children that had been on the chopping block.\n\nSenate Finance Committee aides said the panel was still working to make its bill compliant with the chamber's budget rules, which don't allow the tax bill to add to deficits outside the 10-year budget window.\n\nGiven the GOP's slim majority in the Senate and the danger of a repeat of their Obamacare fiasco, some House Republicans were resigned to more or less having to defer to the Senate.\n\n\"I look at it more as a priority of process and procedure over substance,\" said Rep. Dennis Ross (R-Fla.). \"While there are some very good things, don't get me wrong, substantively in our bill, I think the canvas will probably be painted in its final stage in the Senate once we give them the vehicle.\"\n\nBen White, Josh Dawsey, Colin Wilhelm, Seung Min Kim, Elana Schor and Jennifer Haberkorn contributed to this report.",
  "latent_27759": "Logo of the 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\nThe Olympics are a great sports event. But they also cause great harm. Host cities routinely lose enormous amounts of money on the games, and end up with decaying stadiums that have little or no value. Even worse, governments often forcibly displace large numbers of people from their homes and businesses in order to make room for Olympic venues. Over 1 million people lost their homes for the 2008 Beijing games alone. Brazil has similarly evicted large numbers of people for the currently ongoing Rio Olympics, and even more to build stadiums for the 2014 World Cup. Most of those evicted are the poor and people lacking in political power. The Olympics also often become propaganda showcases for authoritarian regimes, as happened with the 2008 Olympics in China, and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. In an earlier era, the same problem arose on an even more egregious scale with the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Berlin, and the 1980 games in the Soviet Union.\n\nNone of this has to happen. We can reform the Olympics to put an end to it. The forcible evictions are perhaps the easiest problem to fix. The International Olympic Committee and the international community more generally should insist that organizers commit to building the necessary venues without forcibly displacing residents. If a city cannot or will not do that, it should not be allowed to host the games. No sports event is worth the forcible displacement of innocent people from their homes.\n\nWe can also put an end to the economic harm caused by the Olympics by insisting on private funding, instead of government subsidies. The 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, almost the only modern games to avoid massive losses, did so by relying on almost entirely on private funds. Government subsidies for sports facilities have a strong tendency to cause more economic harm than benefit. Private investors have stronger incentives to use resources efficiently, since their own money is at stake. And if they do err, at least the taxpayers wonât be left holding the bag.\n\nFinally, we can end the use of the games as propaganda tool for repressive regimes by limiting host rights to liberal democracies. If the IOC again awards the games to authoritarians, the West should boycott. The mere threat of a large-scale boycott might well disincentivize such regimes from trying to host in the first place, and prevent the IOC from awarding them the games if they do bid.\n\nThere is even a way that all three problems can be solved simultaneously: instead of rotating to a new city every four years, the summer and winter Olympics can each be held at a permanent host site. That cuts down on construction costs and potential evictions by eliminating the need to build new facilities each time. And it should be possible to find permanent homes that are located in liberal democratic states, thus eliminating the problem of authoritarian propaganda.\n\nThe idea of a permanent home for the games is not a new one. It is how the ancient Greeks ran the original Olympics, which inspired the modern games. Modern reformers have at times suggested a similar approach for our own games. For almost a thousand years, the ancient games had a permanent home at Olympia. On this, as on some other issues, we have much to learn from the experience of the ancients.",

  "latent_28077": "Smooth your migration to Kotlin\n\nFirst of all, I would like to give credit to who deserves it, and in this occasion wanna say thanks to @Mauin for taking the leadership on the process and let me join the party. Was a real pleasure. Also, I would like to mention, that in this article there is NO source code involved and here is the reason: It is not about technical implementation, it is about the process, philosophy and all the moving parts involved.\n\nSame principles apply not only when introducing a new programming language, but also any new technology.\n\nActually the motivation behind this writing came from a tweet and a couple of discussions and constructive feedback around it:\n\nSo in this article I will bring up insights (and opinions) on how to introduce Kotlin into your existing Android Java codebase. All this material comes from experiences and real facts, which from my perspective, is the best way to share knowledge and lessons learned. So letâs get started.\n\nThe movitation\n\nLetâs say we heard about this new thing called Kotlin (mainly) being used for Android development nowadays. Many people are talking about it, so we start to dive a little bit deeper and see potential in it, so in the end we decide to bring the topic to the table in our next team meeting.\n\nThere should be always a motivation with strong arguments for betting on new technologies, and those reasons do NOT include:\n\nBecause everyone is using it.\n\nBecause it is trendy.\n\nBecause it is cool.\n\nKeep in mind that we are taking risks at a technical and business level. So if we do not do our homework first, we might run into the unknown with disastrous consequences, which are not easy to rollback, consume development time and, for instance, money for the organization.\n\nTo avoid these issues the first step should be to consider a bunch of basic questions:\n\nIs the technology mature enough?\n\nHas the technology support from the community?\n\nIs out there other companies which have already adopted it?\n\nDo we have experts in the team who can lead/guide us in the process?\n\nIs the team interested in learning this new programming language?\n\nThese are, in my opinion, the first answers we need, in order to move forward to the next stage.\n\nInvolving the team\n\nThe advice here is to involve our team in the process as much as we can. It is important that everyone feels part of it by providing feedback, advice and opinions. We want to make sure we are in the same boat on our path.\n\nThere are a a couple of things we can do to collect such information and participation:\n\nCollective meetings for discussions.\n\nHacker time for spiking.\n\nPair programming on a pet project as example.\n\nRFCs through a shared document.\n\nSome basic workshop or presentation after investigation.\n\nWe want everyone to commit as much as possible which will help the decision making and the collection of information about potential issues we might run into.\n\nSomething we did was to also talk to the iOS Team, since they had gone through a similar process when migrating from Objective C to Swift: super valuable feedback and experience.\n\nResisting the inevitable\n\nIn the past (when Kotlin was not officially supported by Google) we had a few failed attempts which caused uncertainty and frustration in the team due to these doubts:\n\nDoes it integrate well with our current Continuous Integration Pipeline?\n\nWhat about tools availability? Like static analysis for example.\n\nIt is still in Beta and APIs are likely to change without backward compatibility in mind.\n\nButâ¦ I think it is time to invoke Pablo Neruda here which reflects the impact Kotlin is creating in the development community:\n\nWith that being said, nowadays there are not many reasons to NOT introduce Kotlin, or at least the upsides outweigh the downsides. Anyway, that does not mean we do NOT have to focus on the pros and cons of introducing a new technology based on:\n\nOur priorities as a Team/Company: we need time and we might slow down feature development in the beginning, although that is going to pay back in the future.\n\nwe need time and we might slow down feature development in the beginning, although that is going to pay back in the future. The state of our current codebase: in our first attempt we were deep in changing our architecture and killing legacy code. Introducing a new programming language would increase our Lava Anti-Pattern.\n\nAt SoundCloud, after dealing with these 2 aspects we decided it was worth to move forward, so we came up with a bunch of bullet points (a couple of examples below) we would need to address in the next stage:\n\nMake the Java-Kotlin interop as easy as possible.\n\nWhen converting @AutoValue classes to data class , add static factory methods back in the same way. Ex. @JvmStatic functions in companion objects of the data class : Thus, we use the same methods in Java to create those objects. From Kotlin we can directly call the constructor.\n\nclasses to , add static factory methods back in the same way. Ex. functions in of the : Thus, we use the same methods in Java to create those objects. From Kotlin we can directly call the constructor. If data class contains nullable types and those are still used from Java, we should add getters that directly return Optional<T> instead of the Nullable type, which we might miss in the Java context.\n\ncontains nullable types and those are still used from Java, we should add getters that directly return instead of the type, which we might miss in the Java context. Keep in mind: Kotlins types donât always map directly to the Java types. Kotin Long is long in Java, which doesnât have all the compare methods.\n\nThis way, we prepare the terrain by detecting potential issues and solutions to the most common problems in our codebase.\n\nOur First PR\n\nAt this point, we detected possible problems to solve and it was time to officially get our hands dirty. This is an important stage because we are translating our previous investigation into code.\n\nIn my opinion this should be done with Pair Programming. There should be discussions, suggestions and pair reviews from the rest of the team. It is a good idea to put a deadline until when the PR will be open, otherwise discussions become endless.\n\nIf you are wondering what to work on for your first Kotlin PR, I would say that just pick a simple functionality (a screen) in your app and refactor it end to end. This way, you start your job vertically, and gradually move to the rest of features. Divide and conquer, remember?\n\nAlong the way, we did not only write code, but also performed tests, for example compilation time. The more information we collect sooner, the better.\n\nFinally it was time to push the button and commit our first Kotlin PR. It was a real pleasure to presence that moment (again thanks @Mauin!). Now we are happy kotlin coders!\n\nMore power implies more responsibility\n\nEverything does not end up once you merge your first piece of Kotlin code. We are embracing a new language (a new technology) so there should be commitment after it. The main idea is to establish rules we must follow in order to fully transition from the old stack to the new one.\n\nHere are some a few examples to make this process smooth without impacting productivity too much:\n\nEach new piece of code introduced to our codebase should be written in the new language.\n\nEach piece of code touched should be migrated to the new language, unless it is a critical bug and needs rapid reaction.\n\nWhen reviewing PRs, we should enforce the team to follow these rules.\n\nIf newly converted Kotlin code is still called from Java, try to keep the interface changes for the Java callers to a minimum.\n\nMy suggestion is to also allocate time (when possible) every sprint to migrate and refactor features. Maybe it is also a good idea to address technical debt too and write it in Kotlin: kill two birds with only one stone (legacy code and Java).\n\nContinuous Learning\n\nThis an exciting process and we should keep it up by constantly learning, improving and addressing together problems we find along the way. Sharing and transfer of knowledge is key. As mentioned earlier, what worked for us, were discussions in our collective weekly meeting, presentations, pair programming and little workshops.\n\nAs a colleague of mine say, do not put things in cold water and always encourage continuous improvement.\n\nBenefits and key points\n\nHere I wanted to include facts and situations we are getting out of this transition:\n\nBoost to developer morale, karma and motivation.\n\nIncreased null safety in the Android codebase (due to nullable/non-nullable types).\n\nLess boilerplate that has to be written, making Pull-Requests smaller and easier to review and the codebase as a whole easier to understand.\n\nIn the long term, being able to remove some third-party dependencies (e.g. Retrolambda, ButterKnife, AutoValue).\n\nIn the middle/long term, it also keeps us as a competitive and modern organization betting on the latest/new technologies, in order to attract future talent to the Company/Team.\n\nStaying up-to-date with the Android developer community.\n\nTesting in Kotlin might help, it is better than nothing but you will not appreciate the real power until you solve real world problems with it.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we have seen, it is never straightforward to introduce such big changes. Also, the bigger the company is, the more difficult, due to its moving parts, team size and amount of code generated every day.\n\nThat is why it is important to come up with a plan to make the process as smooth as possible.\n\nThis is all I have to offer for now, ping me on Twitter for discussions/feedback.

  "latent_28249": "Â© Unknown\n\nGreensburg - Two Greensburg Salem Middle School students are among the first to be charged under a new state law that regulates sexting among teens.\"A 13-year-old girl took a photo; she was naked from the waist up, took a picture of herself and sent it to a 14-year-old boy at his request,\" said Detective Sgt. Henry Fontana, of Greensburg Police.The boy deleted the photo and did not forward it to friends. It was the girl's mother who later found the photo on her phone and called police.\"Under the new law that just went into effect on Christmas Eve, that is a summary offense,\" said Detective Sgt. Fontana.The new law creates a tiered system for adjudicating sexting cases that differentiates between those who make bad decisions and those who have bad intentions.Under the new law, minors over the age of 12 charged for the first time will get a summary citation. A second offense will result in a misdemeanor charge.Felony child pornography laws remain on the books and could still apply if the photos are distributed with malicious intent.Attorney Anthony Bompiani, who does not represent anyone involved in the Greensburg Salem case, says this is important for young people who may make a bad decision without realizing the potential consequences.\"Now with the times and the technology and the way students interact between each other, they make mistakes, they make bad judgment calls, stupid calls; and instead of having a felony record, they're going to have a summary offense, which is going to be like a traffic ticket - won't be on the record, it won't affect them later in life,\" said Bompiani.The law also provides an important tool for police who previously had no alternative to a child pornography charge when dealing with less serious sexting cases.\"It's still wrong, it's still against the law and the kids need to know that, but this makes it a little easier to cope with,\" said Detective Sgt.

  "latent_28265": "When thirty Republicans lined up against an amendment that would have required defense contractors to allow their employees access to U.S. courts in cases of rape or sexual assault, Jon Stewart ripped them to pieces.\n\n\"I understand we're a divided country, some disagreements on health care. How is ANYONE against this?\" he wondered.\n\nIt's a question, it turns out, best addressed to the White House.\n\nThe vote against the amendment has sparked outrage at the all-male, all-white bloc of thirty Republican senators. HuffPost readers have been particularly infuriated by the GOP opposition and have regularly posted the names of the offending thirty in the comment section of even unrelated stories. A mock website - www.republicansforrape.org -- has sprung up.\n\nThe men had an ally in opposition that has so far gone unreported: the Department of Defense.\n\n\"The DoD opposes the proposed amendment,\" reads a message sent from the administration to the Senate on October 6, the day the amendment passed by a 68-30 vote.\n\n\"The Department of Defense, the prime contractor, and higher tier subcontractors may not be in a position to know about such things. Enforcement would be problematic, especially in cases where privity of contract does not exist between parties within the supply chain that supports a contract,\" reads the DoD note. \"It may be more effective to seek a statutory prohibition of all such arrangements in any business transaction entered into within the jurisdiction of the United States, if these arrangements are deemed to pose an unacceptable method of recourse.\"\n\nThe amendment, sponsored by Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), is intended to address the type of Kafka-esque treatment Jamie Leigh Jones received from the U.S. justice system after she was gang-raped by fellow KBR workers. The defense contractor argued that her employment contract required that her claim be heard in private arbitration rather than in open court.\n\nA White House spokesman said that the DoD opposition is overstated in the message sent to Congress. \"We support the intent of the amendment, and we're working with the conferees to make sure that it is enforceable,\" said spokesman Tommy Vietor when asked about the DoD statement.\n\nHuffPost also asked the thirty Republicans why they opposed the amendment. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) was the only one to provide a statement when this story was first posted. We'll update it with further statements when they come in.\n\n\"This vote has been grossly misunderstood, oversimplified, and misreported. Senator Corker, the father of two daughters, believes what happened to Jamie Leigh Jones is abhorrent and that the culprits should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law; further, he agrees that rape, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress should not be arbitrated, but the Franken amendment went far beyond the ill it was trying to remedy to encompass most possible employment claims,\" said Laura Lefler Herzog, communications director for Corker.\n\nSens. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) and Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) both provided statement to the Sun News in Macon.\n\n\"This would be a major, fundamental change in U.S. labor law and I believe it would be very detrimental to employees to eliminate arbitration as an option,\" Isakson said. The statement inaccurately portrays Franken's amendment: Employees would still be able to elect to use arbitration; they simply wouldn't be forced into it.\n\nChambliss added, also inaccurately: \"If that happens, these employees' only recourse will be to litigate suits in court, which is a very lengthy, expensive and time-consuming process.\"\n\nMike Stark, a blogger with The Crooked Dope, filmed hallway interviews with Sens. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) and John Thune (R-S.D.) and asked them about their no votes. Cochran told Stark that rape victims deserve their day in court, but it's not the government's place to dictate the terms of employment contracts. Thune said that he might have supported the amendment if it had been narrowed to cover rape rather than extended to cover other sexual-related abuses.\n\nOn the Senate floor, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said that he opposed the amendment because it \"would impose the will of Congress on private individuals and companies in a retroactive fashion, invalidating employment contracts without due process of law.\" However, because the amendment applies to the fiscal year 2010 defense bill, it would not apply retroactively.\n\nSessions added one more reason for opposing it. \"I think we should listen to the Department of Defense and vote no on this amendment,\" he said.\n\nWatch Franken pitch his amendment:\n\nUPDATE: North Carolina GOP Sen. Richard Burr's spokesman David Ward sends in this statement: \"Senator Burr believes violence against women is despicable and intolerable, and those who have committed or abetted such heinous crimes should be subjected to the full weight of the law. Unfortunately, the Franken amendment would not do anything to protect women from violence or to punish criminals. If it had, Senator Burr would certainly have voted for the amendment. Instead, rather than protect women from rape, the Franken amendment prohibits contractors who have employment arbitration agreements with their employees from being paid for the work they have done for the military. In fact, the Obama Defense Department opposed the amendment. As current federal law states and the courts have already upheld in the Jones case, arbitration agreements are non-binding when it comes to criminal acts, like rape. Unfortunately, the Franken amendment was a cynical attempt by the trial lawyers to eliminate arbitration agreements, which limit their fees, behind the guise of protecting women.\"",
  "latent_28479": "Beginning in the 1980s, a feverish hysteria swept across America. It was centered in one demographic â the white evangelical subculture â but it wasnât confined to that group, and it came to reshape the wider culture, the agenda of elected officials, and the political landscape of the country in fundamental ways, placing a fear of imaginary monsters at the core of our national identity.\n\nThat same moral panic continues to shape American culture today, decades after it first began making national headlines. It began in the 1980s, but it did not end there. It continues to wreak havoc on individual lives, and its reshaping of American politics has never been undone.\n\nNathanael Rich discusses a parallel hysteria in The New York Review of Books in an essay titled, âThe Nightmare of the West Memphis Three.â\n\nRich is reviewing four documentaries on the infamous case of wrongful conviction, as well as the memoir written by Damien Echols â who was arrested at age 18 and sentenced to death for his role as the supposed ringleader of a âsatanic cultâ responsible for the murder of three young boys.\n\nThe ânightmareâ fueled by fears of imaginary monsters resulted in three poor teenagers spending years in prison for a crime they did not commit. And it meant that whoever did kill those three children remains free â unpunished and unpursued. Thatâs what happens when we become obsessed with imaginary monsters: Real injustices go unaddressed even as new injustices are done to the innocent.\n\nThe existence of a satanic cult turned out to be wholly imaginary â not just in West Memphis, Ark., but anywhere. The central lie of the Satanic Panic is entirely fictional, entirely fabricated. But it persists because it is a lie that many people want to believe. People want to believe that our society is permeated by secret satanic cults practicing all manner of perverse and diabolical rituals. People want to believe that Satanists are out there killing babies.\n\nIf youâre not familiar with the story of the West Memphis Three, Richâs essay provides a good introduction, summarizing the revelations from a series of documentaries produced for HBO Films:\n\nWere it not for HBO Films, there would be no âWest Memphis Threeâ â only three convicted murderers, two serving life sentences and one, most likely, executed. This is not a credit to HBO as much as it is an indictment of the American justice system and one of the founding assumptions on which it stands. Paradise Lostâs directors, Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky, were not lured by a story of wrongful conviction; they went to West Memphis to make a film about Satanic bloodlust and sexual mutilation. The crime occurred at the end of a roughly five-year period, beginning in the late 1980s, in which fears of Satanic ritual abuse had become widespread in American popular culture. The scare extended even into law enforcement, to such an extent that the FBI commissioned a study on the subject in 1991. (The authors concluded that âafter all the hype and hysteria is put aside, the realization sets in that most Satanic or occult activity involves the commission of no crimes, and that which does, usually involves the commission of relatively minor crimes such as trespassing, vandalism, cruelty to animals, or petty thievery.â) Berlinger and Sinofsky spent their first several months in Arkansas interviewing the victimsâ parents. The filmmakers began to question the premise of the suspectsâ guilt only after they went on to interview the young men in prison. They realized then that theyâd stumbled upon a story with even higher dramatic stakes â instead of a real-life Rosemaryâs Baby, they had a modern-day Salem Witch Trials.\n\nRichâs chronology is off. He rightly sees that the West Memphis case can only be understood within the wider context of the Satanic Panic, but he shares the widely held, but incorrect, view that the panic was a brief, 1980s phenomena. He thus tries to compress the Satanic Panic into a âroughly five-year periodâ including the West Memphis case. But the West Memphis trial was in 1994 â more than a decade after the McMartin Preschool hysteria began and nearly a decade after the notorious 1985 20/20 âspecial reportâ on Satanism\n\nRichâs compressed timeline doesnât work. The Satanic Panic began in the early 1980s (the fraudulent âmemoirâ Michelle Remembers was published in 1980), and as the West Memphis case demonstrates, it was still influential well into the 1990s.\n\nThe foremost âexpertâ in that 1985 20/20 report is Mike Warnke â a comic-turned con-artist who made his fortune selling fraudulent stories of his lurid past as the high-priest of a Satanic âcoven.â Warnke was exposed as a fraud by two reporters from Cornerstone magazine in 1992. Mike Hertenstein and Jon Trott published a book-length report on Warnkeâs scam in July of 1993 â Selling Satan: The Evangelical Media and the Mike Warnke Scandal.\n\nAnd yet the following year, a self-proclaimed âoccult expertâ named Dale Griffis was the prosecutionâs star witness in convicting the three teenagers in West Memphis. Griffis was also featured in that 20/20 report, and he cites Warnke as a scholarly authority in his âresearch.â Nearly all such âexpert witnessesâ still do â even now, 20 years after Hertenstein and Trottâs book exposed Warnkeâs expertise as nothing but lies.\n\nIâve only seen one of the Paradise Lost documentaries â the third one, produced after the West Memphis Three were released from prison in a begrudging Alford plea deal. It is by turns heart-breaking and infuriating â a picture of just one case that shows how much real damage is done by the obsessive battle against imaginary monsters.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, a feverish hysteria swept across America. It was centered in one demographic â the white evangelical subculture â but it wasnât confined to that group, and it came to reshape the wider culture, the agenda of elected officials, and the political landscape of the country in fundamental ways, placing a fear of imaginary monsters at the core of our national identity.\n\nMaybe itâs just a coincidence that the Satanic Panic began at the same time, and within the same demographic, and with the same emotional fervor in pursuit of the same emotional rewards. But the two things are too similar for me to accept such an extraordinary coincidence.",

For Sue Jenkins, whose 88-year-old mother Patricia needs round-the-clock care, it is very hard indeed.\n\nTwo years ago, Patricia was diagnosed with dementia. An accident four years earlier broke her back and since then she has been disabled, doubly incontinent and using a wheelchair.\n\n\"I have given up my life,\" says Sue. \"I used to sail a lot. I used to do so many things. I'm a very outward-going person. But I take care of my mother. And that's it.\n\n\"Love is something that drives you to give up those things. You'll give up anything.\"\n\n'Challenging behaviour'\n\nBut she's struggling. She cares for her mother 24 hours a day. Even taking the time to speak to us was difficult.\n\nHer mother calls for her constantly. She can't spend very much time away from Sue before becoming agitated.\n\nThere are professional carers who come to the house to help, but none lives with them full time and it seems a big part of what Sue does is to manage them.\n\nMore than 20 professional carers have come and gone over the last few months because Patricia's behaviour can be so difficult.\n\nImage caption \"Dementia strips the person of their personality,\" says Sue\n\n\"She has a lot of challenging behaviour,\" says Sue.\n\n\"Screaming, hitting out. It's horrible because dementia strips the person of their personality.\"\n\nHer eyes fill with tears as she talks. The physical exhaustion of a life with little sleep is obvious.\n\nBut the emotional strain of watching her mother deteriorate is pushing her to breaking point.\n\n'My best friend'\n\n\"I've lost my friend. My best friend. She's there - somewhere inside. But the person I dearly love and dearly want to talk to about so many things has left me already.\n\n\"And the thought of losing her fills me with complete dread. Because my life is very much her,\" she says.\n\nI ask her what it's like when her mother hits her.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking. It can make you feel useless. As she's saying that, it can make you want to run for the hills and just run into the night.\n\n\"And there have been many occasions when I've wanted to run off, thinking I was a useless carer.\"\n\nImage caption The thought of losing her mum fills Sue with \"complete dread\"\n\nIt costs more than Â£2,800 a week to keep Patricia at home. That money is paid by local care services.\n\nBut the authorities have twice tried to stop the money. Sue says it is an attempt to force her to put her mother in a home.\n\nThat is something she is adamant she will never do.\n\n\"I've seen what goes on in those places. It would kill her,\" she says.\n\n'Chasing and phoning'\n\nShe feels hounded by the authorities and says it's taking valuable time away from her and her mother. She's says she is sometimes up through the night replying to emails, while still caring for her mother.\n\n\"It's been absolutely devastating. The hours that have been stolen from me - email after email after email - chasing and phoning,\" she says.\n\n\"The government wants to encourage people to stay in their own homes and nurse people in their own homes. And say there's support out there. But there isn't.\n\n\"It's the most isolating situation anyone could find themselves in,\" she adds.\n\nImage caption Sue says there are now only \"occasional little laughs\" with her mum\n\nThere are more than 6 million people in the UK who look after sick or elderly relatives full time. Those numbers have been steadily increasing. But so have the pressures on people like Sue.\n\nUK Homecare Association this month said 900 carers are quitting the industry every day.\n\nGovernment ministers say they will spend an extra Â£2bn on social care over three years.\n\nAnd earlier this week, Luke Hall, a Conservative MP on the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, said carers made \"a huge contribution to society\".\n\n\"It's only right that we do everything we can to support the selfless work they do,\" he said.\n\n\"That's why we already increased the rate of carer's allowance, meaning an additional Â£450 a year for carers since 2010.\"\n\n'Occasional laughs'\n\nFor Sue, her dedication to her mother has meant she has sacrificed her own happiness. Her husband left her six years ago when she decided to look after her mother.\n\n\"You find that having any kind of relationship is very difficult. It would take a very understanding man to understand my situation.\"\n\nLife has become increasingly lonely for her. Yet she tries to remain positive.\n\n\"It is worth it. There are occasional little laughs. Not often these days, but they're there. It's love. It's what you do.

One seeks to regulate abortion clinics in the same manner as sex offenders, and the other would require physicians who provide abortion care to disclose information about their personal finances to patients.\n\nSB 205, sponsored by state Sen. Paul Sanford (R-Huntsville), would prohibit the Alabama Department of Public Health from issuing or renewing a health center license to an abortion clinic or reproductive health center located within 2,000 feet of a public school, regulating abortion clinics in the same manner as registered sex offenders.\n\nMia Raven, director of the Montgomery Area Reproductive Justice Coalition, previously told Rewire that âitâs insulting to women to compare a reproductive health-care center to sex offenders.â\n\nSanford told the Times Daily that he didnât want a repeat of last year, when similar legislation passed in the house but stalled in the state senate.\n\nGet the facts, direct to your inbox. Subscribe to our daily or weekly digest. SUBSCRIBE\n\nLawmakers passed that anti-choice measure in the GOP-controlled house in a 79-15 vote. It then passed through a senate committee with three days left in the legislative session. However, the bill failed to reach the senate floor for a vote, despite Republicans holding a 26-8 majority in that chamber.\n\nSanford told the Times Daily that the legislation is not intended to limit the number of clinics that provide abortion services in the state, but he does not think clinics should be located across the street from a school âbecause they do tend to cause a certain amount of commotion on a regular basis.â\n\nThe bill specifically targeted a Huntsville-area abortion clinic that was forced by state legislators three years ago to relocate across the street from a school. The Alabama Womenâs Center, one of five clinics in the state providing abortion care, reportedly spent $550,000 on relocating to comply with a targeted regulation of abortion providers (TRAP) law Republican Gov. Robert Bentley signed in 2013.\n\nâWe can put a restriction on whether a liquor store opens up across the street and make sure pedophiles stay away from schools,â Sanford said. âI just think having an abortion clinic that close to elementary-age school children that actually have to walk on the sidewalk past it is not the best thing.â\n\nRep. Ed Henry (R-Hartselle), who sponsored similar legislation in 2015, told the Times Daily that he will again sponsor the legislation in the house but has yet to file the measure.\n\nSB 205 has been referred to the senate Health and Human Services Committee, where it awaits further action.\n\nRep. Kerry Rich (R-Guntersville) introduced HB 183, which would require physicians to provide a pregnant person seeking abortion with information, including a sonogram, showing the entire fetus and specific information regarding the fetus.\n\nUnder state law, a physician must provide a pregnant person with an ultrasound before performing an abortion, and give the patient the option of viewing the ultrasound image.\n\nSusan Watson, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama, told AL.com that a similar bill in North Carolina has been blocked by federal courts. âThis battle has already been fought,â Watson said. âThe judges said that women should not have to listen to the description of the fetus by the doctor. That was a million-dollar lawsuit.â\n\nHB 183 would require that the physician provide the patient with a conflict of interest disclaimer that would disclose the physicianâs personal financial information.\n\nAmong the financial information the physician would be required to disclose: gross income from the previous fiscal year, percentage of income obtained from providing abortion services, and a statement âconcerning the monetary loss to the abortion provider which would result from the womanâs decision to carry the pregnancy to term.â\n\nRich told AL.com that his goal is to provide pregnant people with more information about abortion.\n\nâSome people have this idea that this is just a gob of mass and thatâs all it is,â Rich said. âI personally have the belief that itâs a living human being, not a future living human being. If people have a better understanding, if they are educated about what they are doing, they might make a different choice.â\n\nWatson said that sheâs not aware of any other legislation requiring abortion providers to disclose financial information. âAbortion opponents often try things in Alabama first to see if they can get them passed here,â Watson said.\n\nHB 183 has been referred to the house Health Committee, where it awaits further action.",

  "latent_28956": "In January 2005, Tomislav IviÄ gave a lecture in Herceg Novi, Montenegro. âHabit,â he said, âis the second nature of man. We need to create habits â not as much physical or technical as mental. And you do that by constant repetition. A change in mentality is needed. You have to prepare your men psychologically for a new logic, so that over time they become eager to embrace it.â\n\nThis wasnât a psychology congress on classic conditioning or applied behaviour analysis, but a seminar in football coaching. IviÄ spoke about the subject of pressing and the sub-heading of his lecture revealed its extraordinary straightforward fashion: it read, quite simply, âHow to beat a stronger opponent.â\n\nAll coaches, especially the good ones, are behaviourists to some extent â such is the nature of their profession. But few of them have ever been so candid about their approach as Tomislav IviÄ was. A rare breed in the football culture of the former Yugoslavia, which traditionally harboured an almost predeterministic appreciation of ânaturalâ talent and lionised individual artistry above all, he was a firm believer in the system. While he never dismissed the importance of natural ability, to him it was merely crude material which meant nothing if not thoroughly processed, refined and given optimal use within a whole. He spoke a lot about âmentalityâ â but whereas in the Balkans that word usually has a negative, defeatist undertone in anything from politics and economy to popular culture, his interpretation was completely different. To IviÄ, mentality was something to be constantly learned, reshaped and altered.\n\nThat he succeeded with these ideas in Split, a city so particular that it appears to be in a perpetual uprising against itself, is a true testimony to his greatness. And he did, winning three championships and four cups there while making Hajduk a force to be reckoned with in Europe. After that, nothing was too hard for IviÄ. He went on to lift league titles in four other countries (with Ajax, Anderlecht, Panathinaikos and Porto; he also won the Copa del Rey with AtlÃ©tico Madrid and the TaÃ§a de Portugal, the European Super Cup and the Intercontinental Cup with Porto. Sometimes heâs also credited with winning the 1992 Ligue 1 title with Olympique de Marseille, but actually he only led them for a few months that season, remaining as an âadvisorâ to his good friend Raymond Goethals for the rest of it. The Belgian coach admitted that IviÄ helped him prepare tactics for the 1993 Champions League final, which he won against Fabio Capelloâs Milan).\n\nLeague titles in five different countries is a feat yet to be matched by any other manager. All this silverware prompted La Gazzetta dello Sport in 2007 to proclaim IviÄ the most successful manager in history. The trophy harvest also inspired JosÃ© Mourinho, one of the three greats who have come closest to matching his feat, winning four â albeit stronger â national competitions (the other two are Ernst Happel and Giovanni Trapattoni). He first met IviÄ back in 1988.\n\nâJosÃ© was a student of sports science and heâd often come to watch my training sessions in Porto,â IviÄ revealed in an interview with the Croatian daily newspaper Jutarnji list. Six years later, IviÄâs second term at the club came to an end as he was replaced by Bobby Robson and Mourinho, his interpreter. Another decade later, the two men met at the Stamford Bridge after Chelseaâs 2-1 win over Barcelona in the Champions League. IviÄ was there as a pundit for Croatian television and, after the Special One had given him a signed copy of his biography, he showed it to the journalists. The inscription read, in Portuguese, âTo the greatest coach of them all â I hope one day to win as much as you.â\n\nMany coaches are egomaniacs. Some are tyrants, some father figures and some try to act as playersâ mates. Tomislav IviÄ was none of these things. You could say that he was a bit like Mr Miyagi from The Karate Kid, though: he always insisted on a set of very simple exercises, which were to be painstakingly repeated until the movements become automatic and instinctive. IviÄ described some of those in that 2005 lecture and they appeared disappointingly banal â something you might expect to see when watching kids train, but not among fully grown professionals. For example, a small (35mx16m) pitch, with a wall at each end, was used for technique training: a player would run with the ball for a few metres, smash it into the wall, control the rebound, turn around, run with the ball, smash it into the other wall, control... And repeat. And repeat.\n\nItâs strange, given what a rationalist he was, how IviÄ ascribed an almost mystical quality to those methods. In Herceg Novi, he told the coaches that most of the exercises he used had been devised by âthe old Hajduk coachâ â he meant Luka Kaliterna, easily the most iconic figure in Yugoslav football. The goalkeeper in the first Hajduk squad, in 1911, and a teacher to generations, Kaliterna is generally considered to be the father of football in Split. He was the first coach to win Hajduk a title, in 1927, and their first local coach after learning his trade from the dozen Czechs who preceded him. Yes, this goes all the way to the early 20th-century Central European football tradition â though, in this case, not to the coffee houses, but to the beer houses of Prague. In one of those, Hajduk was founded by four students from Split, including Kaliternaâs brother Fabijan.\n\nAlthough his idea of playing football was all about modernity, IviÄ drew great pride from the fact that he was a part of this historical line. Himself a Kaliterna disciple â like pretty much every football coach that emerged from Split up until the 1970s â he often quoted his masterâs grains of ancient wisdom, like âSee everything, look at nothingâ or âThe play, not the player, scores goals.â Whenever asked about his biggest influences, heâd always put Kaliterna first, then usually Rinus Michels and Hennes Weisweiler.\n\nThe players must have been less than enthusiastic about IviÄâs methods â just as the Karate Kid Daniel LaRusso initially was when Mr Miyagi made him sweep floors and wax cars. It took them time to realise the value of endlessly repeating simple movements and tasks â but once they did, they became eager to embrace them. DraÅ¾en MuÅ¾iniÄ, a long-serving Hajduk player in the 1970s, admitted he became so infected by the habits he had learned that he began âcatching people in offside trapsâ when talking to them in the street. âI couldnât help it,â he explained. âIt was a reflex action for me.â When MuÅ¾iniÄ was transferred to Norwich City in 1980, he was so useless that Justin Fashanu remarked, âI donât think we got MuÅ¾iniÄ. I reckon they sent his milkman instead.â Besides not speaking a word of English, the player was immersed in IviÄâs logic and found it too hard to function outside it. When Norwich cancelled his contract, he retired aged 29.\n\nAt Ajax, where IviÄ coached from 1976 to 1978, between his two trophy-laden stints at Hajduk, he was initially met with a player rebellion led by Ruud Krol, who was supposed to be his sweeper and the commander of his defence. Had IviÄ not been hand-picked by Rinus Michels himself to succeed him, this might have escalated, but the chairman Jaap van Praag intervened and the squad listened. In his debut season with the club, IviÄ won Ajax their first Dutch title in four years â for the first time after the Åtefan KovÃ¡cs era; for the first time without the likes of Cruyff, Neeskens or Rep. âThe older players like Krol had some trouble in the beginning, but they would later praise in particular his training methods,â said Pim van Dord, a defender in that team. âWhat was special about those was how often heâd repeat certain things. In time we started to believe in his approach.â\n\nIviÄ said that Michels had chosen him as his successor because the way his Hajduk played suited the ideals of Total Football. That may not be entirely so â while he did use the 4-3-3 formation, interchanging positions and intensive pressing, his football was never quite so easy on the eye or as attacking. In part that was down to a lack of extraordinary individuals but IviÄ favoured automatism and a great deal of running, so his teams werenât as playful as the Ajax that conquered Europe. His was a more physical game.\n\nâSplit of the 1970s was not unlike some place in the north of England,â said the Jutarnji list columnist Jurica PaviÄiÄ. âIt was a city of blue collars and factory chimneys, where a company bus would pick up workers in front of their housing estate built by that same company. Split was experiencing a period of industrial growth and increased urbanisation. Football was its binding tissue, something everyone talked about. I cannot help but think itâs no coincidence that Hajduk of that era made their name by playing what people usually call âindustrialâ football.â\n\nAs a young man, Tomislav IviÄ worked at the docks and played for RNK Split, the cityâs second club which â coached by Luka Kaliterna â swept through the lower divisions to reach the Yugoslav top tier in the late 1950s. âTheyâd let him leave work a bit earlier because he was important for the club, but every day he had to walk for more than 10km â first from home to work, then home, then from home to the ground,â Milorad BibiÄ Mosor, the late journalist and author who was probably RNKâs biggest fan, told FourFourTwo Croatia in 2010. So if IviÄ used to lead such a physical and industrial life, is it any wonder that it transferred into his coaching philosophy?\n\nHe was also often accused of playing defensive football. This probably had something to do with his methodology. âItâs much easier to learn how to defend than how to attack,â he used to say. âIt also takes less time.â Once heâd managed to fortify the defence, his teams would grow steadily and become more and more efficient in attack as well. In 1977-78, his Ajax team scored 23 goals more than in the previous season. But for various reasons, including his adventurous nature and in some cases money, he hardly ever stuck around in one place long enough to gain true recognition.\n\nThe time spent in Amsterdam influenced IviÄ. Looking back, it seems that he learned how to manipulate space more efficiently there and that took his ideas to a new level. âIn the second year with IviÄ we started to put his counter-pressing approach into practice at a more fluid rate,â Pim van Dord remembers. âWe started to grow in terms of how he wanted us to play, but he had already indicated to us that he would leave at the end of the season â because of money. He was sad when he left us because he had us playing near to where he felt was the optimum under him.â\n\nIt could be argued that IviÄ returned to Hajduk in 1978 as something of a pressing fundamentalist. He started talking about football in different terms, much to the bewilderment of local journalists. He became fascinated by the (bio)mechanics of team movement: âPressing is the beating heart of our football,â heâd say, describing the teamâs on-field shape as though it were a live organism, a muscle, explaining its contractions and expansions. His team was made to practise defending with a very shallow formation (âIf you looked at it from a plane, the distance between the first and the last player should be about 30mâ), from which they would âorganicallyâ expand in transition to attack, following established and oft-repeated patterns.\n\nIn the late 1970s, IviÄ was a man on a mission: he wanted to bring a European trophy to Split, which was probably the main reason he returned there in the first place. Although Hajduk had been a fearsome team in that decade, real continental success had eluded them â they had beaten Saint-Ãtienne 4-1, then lost 5-1 in the return leg; won 2-0 against PSV in Split, then lost 3-0 in Eindhoven. The coach wanted to change their mentality and shake off the âhome teamâ tag. In 1978, he was furious after being eliminated by Arsenal in the second round of the Uefa Cup. The Gunners parked the bus in the first leg and managed to pull off a promising 2-1 defeat, their away goal a long-range effort by Liam Brady. Two weeks later, Willie Young scored the only goal seven minutes from time at Highbury and Arsenal went through on away goals. In December that year, Hajdukâs star striker, the âKing of Goalsâ SlaviÅ¡a Å½ungul defected to America. It was a shock for everyone, but urban legend has it that IviÄ intentionally sent him on his way because they never saw eye to eye. He replaced him in the team with Zlatko VujoviÄ, an incredibly fast young forward with prodigious stamina.\n\nThe following season, Hajduk stormed to the European Cup quarter-finals, in which they faced the great Hamburg side of Keegan, Hrubesch and Magath. Coached by Branko Zebec, who had been IviÄâs predecessor in the Hajduk hot seat, it also featured Ivan Buljan, a former Hajduk player and a world-class defender. IviÄ had four full months to prepare for the tie (the European break lasted from early November to early March) and became obsessed by it. In later interviews, he confessed exactly how far he took his thinking about this âprojectâ. For example, an article he read about Rod Laverâs psychological preparation for five-set Wimbledon matches gave him an idea of how to prepare his men for the equally exhausting task he was about to give them. He also looked for ideas in other sports, like handball and even horse-racing. People would often see him in the street with one or two of his players, waving his hands frantically like some kind of mad scientist: he wanted to make sure they understood what he was asking of them, so he kept explaining. Over and over again.\n\nThis kind of obsessive behaviour remained a part of IviÄâs character until his death in 2011. Journalists revealed stories on how he would rearrange chairs in their office to explain the MakÃ©lÃ©lÃ© role. An acquaintance of mine told me how he was once on the same flight as IviÄ: within minutes of introducing himself to the coach, he was presented with diagrams drawn on a piece of paper to explain how England should play if they wanted to have a chance of winning Euro 2004. To him, football tactics increasingly became something like a set of problems and equations which could be solved by proper analysis â something that can and needs to be mended. When, due to his deteriorating health, doctors instructed him to retire from coaching, he was still filling up his notebooks with tactical diagrams and new ideas on a daily basis. Even when he was admitted to hospital and banned from watching football on TV, he still drew his diagrams, straight from his head.\n\nWith his immense knowledge, understanding of the game and eye for detail, IviÄ was one of the best TV analysts anybody is ever likely to see. But it was never too long before any football-related conversation with him returned to that 1980 Hajduk match against HSV.\n\nIn the first leg, Ivicâs approach was very cautious, as was the norm for away games those days. Hamburg won 1-0 in an evenly matched game, which was seen as a decent result for Hajduk. Almost everyone in Split believed that the team could turn it around. Two weeks later, 52,000 people at Poljud stadium saw something they would never forget. Hajduk flew all over the pitch: they played one-touch football and swapped positions so quickly that it was hard even for the fans to keep track, let alone Hajdukâs opponents. They moved in unison, contracted and expanded, as though all were controlled by some invisible brain or joystick. And they pressed the ball for the full 90 minutes.\n\nThis was avant-garde football â but it wasnât to be for Hajduk. Hamburg scored from what were their only two chances, while the player who had been the most reliable for IviÄ let him down the most: he gifted Horst Hrubesch a goal after only two minutes and later missed a handful of sitters, including a penalty. That he scored to make it 3-2 four minutes from time was little consolation, by then it was too late and Hajduk were eliminated on away goals as they had been many times before and would be after. That player was Boro Primorac, IviÄâs sweeper â the same Primorac who has been ArsÃ¨ne Wengerâs assistant for almost 20 years now.\n\nIn plain terms, Hajduk were eliminated due to bad luck and human failings that could hardly have been foreseen. There wasnât much more IviÄ could have done and that was the hardest thing for him to accept, especially because he was positive that none of the other three semi-finalists â Real Madrid, Ajax and Nottingham Forest â had an answer for the style he had developed. He was so disappointed that he decided to leave the club once again â this time for Anderlecht, where in his first season he brought them their first league title after a seven-year hiatus. As for Hajduk, they never won another Yugoslav title after 1979. In 1984, they reached the Uefa Cup semi-finals and lost to Tottenham â on away goals, of course.\n\nTomislav IviÄ changed jobs many times in the years that followed and racked up so many wins that he even inspired the likes of Mourinho. But the impression is nothing ever meant as much to him as that one night in Split â not even that one-off game when he got to manage the Croatia national team and beat Italy, who were fresh from reaching the final of the 1994 World Cup.\n\nIn retrospect, that was the match that made Croatia as footballing nation: only their third competitive game ever (the first two were against Estonia and Lithuania). Their regular manager Miroslav BlaÅ¾eviÄ had been suspended by Uefa, so IviÄ took over. In Palermo, he set up a brilliant defensive strategy: Croatia played something like 5-3-1-1, with both Zvonimir Boban and Aljosa AsanoviÄ acting as deep-lying playmakers, the hard-running Nikola JurÄeviÄ alongside them and Robert ProsineÄki as trequartista. Instead of a designated holder, Slaven BiliÄ and Igor Å timac took turns stepping out of the defence to help close down Roberto Baggio; Davor Å uker pulled wide all the time. The team of Arrigo Sacchi, a coach who had his own ideas about pressing, was given the ball but denied any space in attack. Frustrated, they lost balance and were less able to cope with Croatiaâs quick counters, so the visitors scored twice before Italy could manage a consolation goal in the dying minutes of the game.\n\nThe media at home were bowing to the genius of IviÄ, but he didnât seem particularly proud. He set up those tactics against his own doctrine of how football should be played. He merely did what he felt was needed and âmendedâ the team for BlaÅ¾eviÄ. Given the time he had at disposal, that was all he could do, because âitâs much easier to learn how to defend than how to attack.â\n\nHe was a captivating speaker and a visionary. Football of the future, he predicted in 2010, a year before his death, â... will use formations consisting of only two lines, each of them including the best technician as specialist â the deeper one as a modified, new-age libero who can provide the best passes and act almost like a quarterback in American football, and the one up front to spearhead the attack not by power, pace or physique, but by creativity and positional intelligence.â\n\nBut the glory and trophies will belong to those teams whoâll be able to play at high tempo throughout the game, achieve automatism and act on instinct in transition, while constantly pressing on the ball very high up field â IviÄ said that year when FourFourTwo Croatia spoke to him on the phone, trying to get him to write a column for the magazine (sadly, his health never permitted it, although he was very keen). âBut is it possible to maintain that kind of intensity for 90 minutes?â â his rhetorical question was identical to the one in the very climax of that 2005 lecture, and so was his answer: âYes, it is!\n\nâYou know, when Hajduk played Hamburg back in 1980...â",
  "latent_29041": "Last month, on CNBCâs âSquawk Box,â Deepak Chopra described the usefulness of meditation for people on Wall Street. Speaking about a friend who manages a hedge fund, he said, âHis entire staff meditates. I know many others now on Wall Street that we teach, actually. It makes them much more productive, because theyâre centered, theyâre not distracted.â Chopra was appearing on TV to promote a free twenty-one-day online meditation course that he offers with Oprah. Its theme is âManifesting True Success.â\n\nMeditation, like yoga before it, has been fully assimilated into corporate America. Aetna, General Mills, and Goldman Sachs all offer their employees free in-office meditation training. In January, the Times reported on a packed panel at Davos where members of the global Ã©lite âprofessed that meditation gave them a competitive advantage.â Speaking to Bloomberg, a meditation instructor at Goldman Sachs recalled a trader she works with who âgets a twinge in his gut when he senses a move in the markets.â With meditation, the instructor said, he had found an edge âby tuning into that sensation more reliably.â\n\nThe Bloomberg article (called âTo Make a Killing on Wall Street, Start Meditatingâ) described how mindfulness meditation, which has roots in Theravada Buddhism, a predominant school in Southeast Asia, works for corporate types: âIf a dog barks, you might register it before quickly refocusing on inhaling and exhaling. Mental intrusions are treated the same way: Thoughts such as âbook NetJetsâ or âoffload bitcoinsâ quickly pass like leaves floating on a stream.â The point, of course, isnât that you will no longer care about your bitcoin returns but that, by developing greater calm and attention, youâll ultimately get better ones.\n\nThose who are bringing meditation to the American business world often hope that the practice will help workers tune into something a little more transcendent, which itself has become a cause for concern. In a recent Harvard Business Review piece, the executive coach David Brendel wrote, âMindfulness is close to taking on cult status in the business world. But as with any rapidly growing movementâregardless of its potential benefitsâthere is good reason here for caution.â Brendelâs fear is that meditation might make executives too mellow and compassionate; he described one client who asked for assurance that she could embrace Buddhist meditation and still fire people. Brendel expressed hope that âmindfulness cultureâ will remain focussed on âoptimizing work performance,â so that people can achieve âgenuine happiness and fulfillment.â\n\nBrendel neednât worry. American capitalism has had a long and durable romance with Eastern spirituality, and the latter has hardly undermined the former. For well over a century, business-minded Americans have been transforming Hindu and Buddhist contemplative practices into an unlikely prosperity gospel.\n\nThese adaptations started with the New Thought movement, founded in the nineteenth century by a Maine clockmaker and hypnotist named Phineas Quimby. Quimby was immersed in the popular spiritualist culture of his day, but he eventually became convinced that the true agent of healing was not the outside forces that spiritualists proclaimed but an individualâs own beliefs. This faith in the power of the mind to shape physical reality has had a deep effect on American culture, from the New Age movement to motivational business literature. Quimbyâs most famous disciple was Mary Baker Eddy, who merged his ideas with Christianity to create Christian Science. Another student, Warren Felt Evans, incorporated concepts derived from Hinduism and Buddhism into the movement.\n\nHindu and Buddhist contemplative traditions are also concerned with harnessing consciousness, but in New Thought and its variants the desires you work so hard to let go of are ultimately fulfilled. William James, who appears to have regarded the movement with affectionate skepticism, wrote about New Thought in âThe Varieties of Religious Experienceâ: âGive up the feeling of responsibility, let go your hold, resign the care of your destiny to higher powers, be genuinely indifferent to what becomes of it all, and you will find not only that you gain a perfect inward relief, but often also, in addition, the particular goods you sincerely thought you were renouncing.â\n\nThen as now, there was a great deal of interplay between motivational business writing and what was presented as the eternal wisdom of the East. Consider the work of Yogi Ramacharaka, whose popular and influential books included âThe Hindu-Yogi Science of Breathâ (1903) and âFourteen Lessons in Yogi Philosophy and Oriental Occultismâ (1904). Writing in Advanced Thought, a New Thought magazine, Ramacharaka emphasized that his ideas coincided with those of its editor, William Walter Atkinson. âThe editor of this magazine has frequently told you that the Touchstone of any teaching is this: âDoes this make me Stronger, Better and More Efficient?â I cheerfully support him in this statement, for the same truth is given (in other words) in the best Hindu teachingsâin fact, as he, himself, would freely admit, he obtained the idea from such sources.â\n\nIts not surprising that Atkinson and Ramacharaka claimed the same Hindu sources, because they were, in fact, the same person. Ramacharaka was one of Atkinsonâs several noms de plume, and, as the historian Carl T. Jackson points out, Atkinson was âby no means the only New Thought writer to masquerade as an Oriental teacher or to offer an âauthenticâ course in Eastern wisdom.â These writers genuinely believed that they were attuned to the wisdom of the East, but Eastern wisdom, refracted through New Thought, tended to sound a lot like practical business advice. Jackson notes that one New Thought book, âKarma on the Job,â by Frank Fall, interpreted karma as the principle that businessmen âget exactly what they earn.â\n\nA similar alchemy has made mindfulness meditationâonce an esoteric, monastic Buddhist practice aimed at renunciationâsuitable for Davos. According to Jeff Wilson, the author of âMindful America: The Mutual Transformation of Buddhist Meditation and American Culture,â mindfulness in traditional Buddhist commentaries was âpresented as a strenuous, lifelong task, one that occurs within a framework of renunciation and detachment.â It is meant to put distance between the monk and his experience. âIn the premodern Theravada tradition, it was decidely not a process of inhabiting the present moment so that one connects with the immanent wonder of the sacred,â Wilson writes.\n\nMindfulness as we know it today was born out of a meeting of pragmatic, modernizing Asian teachers looking to make Buddhism accessible to the West and Western seekers who fit the practice into an Occidental psychological framework. (Particularly important among the latter was Jon Kabat-Zinn, who, in 1979, founded the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, which offered an eight-week course on Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction.) A technique once meant to help monks grasp the unreality of the self became the inspiration for a new sort of self-help tool, and from there it was just a short leap to mindfulness becoming a business tool. By all accounts, mindfulness does help people feel more focussed and less frazzled, but it resembles New Thought far more than it does any Eastern religion.\n\nâWith business meditation, we have a practice that is extrapolated from Buddhism and secularized so that all of the theological underpinnings are swept away,â Catherine Albanese, the author of âA Republic of Mind and Spirit: A Cultural History of American Metaphysical Religion,â says. âSo we have Buddhism stood on its head. Mindfulness meditation has been brought into the service of a totally different perspective and world view.â By now, thatâs part of a venerable American tradition.\n\nA previous version of this post misattributed William James's quote about New Thought.",

  "latent_29714": "The Trump administration wants to write into the North American Free Trade Agreement the very measures that made the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) questionable from a free-trade viewpoint: labour and environmental standards. The Canadian government agrees wholeheartedly. Using the TPP as a model in this way could turn NAFTA, which is on the whole favourable to free trade, into a managed-trade hodgepodge.\n\nSurprised to find Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, in the same camp as President Donald Trump and his cohorts? You shouldnât be. Both camps avowedly want to replace free trade with âfair trade.â They donât exactly agree what fair trade is (typically, nobody can), but they at least agree that it includes trade rules for labour and environmental standards. The objectives revealed by the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) in July made robust use of buzzwords frequently deployed by the fair-trade crowd, such as âthe right to collective bargaining,â âstakeholder,â and âsustainable.â\n\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnershipâs labour provisions were officially inspired by the standards of the International Labour Organization, a UN agency that promotes the agenda of big unions. What a small world: Trumpâs NAFTA-renegotiation demands also pay their respects to the International Labour Organization. Under the TPP, signatory states would have guaranteed âacceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and healthâ â a formulation repeated word-for-word by the U.S. Trade Representativeâs new NAFTA demands. If seriously enforced, the TPPâs labour regulations would have attenuated the main advantage of poor countries: their relatively low price of labour. But more on that in a minute.\n\nLabour regulations would attenuate the main advantage of poor countries: their relatively low price of labour\n\nThe website of Barack Obamaâs USTR boasted that the TPP contained âthe strongest labor and environment provisions ever included in a trade agreement, and they mark a sea-change from earlier trade agreements like NAFTA.â Some might have assumed thatâs what Trump disliked about the TPP, which he killed. But lo and behold, it seems to be the only thing he loved (assuming he read it).\n\nThe TPPâs environmental standards were weaker than its labour standards â probably because the environmental rules were mostly driven by political correctness, and not the full force of government-supported organized labour. But they would have been a mission creep waiting to happen.\n\nNeither labour nor environmental standards were included in the main text of NAFTA. They were instead the object of side agreements with much less punch. Adding stronger such standards inside a renegotiated NAFTA would undermine one of the main reasons for the benefits of tree trade.\n\nConsider carefully what higher labour standards would do to NAFTA\n\nConsider carefully what higher labour standards would do to NAFTA. By increasing the cost of labour in the poorest of the three partners â Mexico â they would remove part of what economists call its âcomparative advantage.â Wages are lower in poorer countries because labour there is less productive, which is exactly the reason why these countries are poor. For certain goods, productivity will be even lower than the low wages, and, for those goods, the poor country has no comparative advantage. But in sectors where productivity is higher than low wages â for instance, in Mexicoâs case, manufacturing semiconductors â the goods are produced at prices attractive to foreign buyers, and the poor country is said to have a comparative advantage. A poor country can compete internationally where it has a comparative advantage, and get progressively richer.\n\nWhat international labour standards do is to slow down or stop this process, by raising the cost of low-wage labour until it overcomes productivity. These standards thus protect rich workers in rich countries (like the U.S. and Canada) from the competition of poor workers in poor countries (like Mexico). Where are the social justice warriors to attack this ignominy?\n\nThis is supposed to be a free-trade agreement!\n\nThe tragedy is that the Mexican government accepted labour standards in the stillborn TPP, so it may have to yield to them in the NAFTA renegotiation.\n\nMs. Freeland says she also wants to add âgenderâ to the regulatory standards in the renegotiated NAFTA. Why not? And why not simply write that all politically correct ârightsâ are protected? But for Gaiaâs sake, this is supposed to be a free-trade agreement! (It all brings to mind an article published last year in the journal Progress in Human Geography, written by serious academics, titled âGlaciers, Gender, and Science: A Feminist Glaciology Framework for Global Environmental Change Research.â The authors claimed that âstereotypical and masculinist practices of glaciologyâ are linked to âimperial and hegemonic capitalist agendas,â and thus that âIce is not just ice.â)\n\nThere is much ignorance and political stupidity in the world. The project of adding to NAFTA politically correct regulations â or âstandards,â as weâre supposed to call them â is yet another illustration.\n\nPierre Lemieux is an economist affiliated with the Department of Management Sciences of the UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec en Outaouais.

  "latent_29819": "The political leader of exiled Tibetans is calling on Canada's ambassador for religious freedom to investigate religious repression and suicide in his homeland, squeezing the week-old post into a tricky diplomatic position.\n\nLobsang Sangay, the head of the Central Tibetan Administration (also known as the Tibetan Government in Exile), made his plea while visiting Ottawa this week to seek support for Tibetan autonomy. He argued that growing business connections between Canada and China should not silence Canada's concern for human rights in Tibet.\n\nHis challenge could prove an acid test for the Conservative government's new Office of Religious Freedom: Any attempt to send such an envoy to China would be bound to cause offence.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMr. Sangay's visit comes amid a series of self-immolations in Tibet, where 106 people have set themselves on fire in the past three years to protest Chinese rule, the latest on Monday.\n\nMr. Sangay wants the Harper government to send its newly created ambassador for religious freedom, Andrew Bennett, to investigate.\n\n\"I would really like to see, and request, that the ambassador of religious freedom visit Tibet. Because religious freedom is very much at the core of self-immolation â as well as other issues â in Tibet,\" Mr. Sangay said. \"And now, the office is established, there's an ambassador. If he could go to Tibet and investigate the situation, that would be a welcome gesture.\"\n\nThe self-immolations are a sensitive political matter in China, which has responded to the gruesome protests with a crackdown, arresting 12 people accused of encouraging them. Mr. Sangay and his Tibetan Government in Exile have repeatedly said they discourage self-immolations, but Chinese authorities have accused the Dalai Lama â the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists â and the Central Tibetan Administration of instigating them.\n\nNow Mr. Bennett, a former civil servant and Christian college dean, faces a call to take on a mission that could test the effectiveness of his new office.\n\nThe Harper government established the Office of Religious Freedom to promote freedom of worship around the world. But plans for the office, announced before the 2011 election, have been controversial. Some have complained it is a vote-getting nod to the religious right, while others argue it has little chance of being effective because it will be shunned by countries where religious freedoms are given short shrift.\n\nEven if the Conservatives agree to send Mr. Bennett to Tibet, it's not clear whether China â which often warns other nations against interference and considers Tibet a \"core interest\" â would accommodate such a visit.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"They should, because they always say we have nothing to hide, anyone can come and see things for themselves,\" Mr. Sangay said.\n\n\"If that is the basis of their argument, then the Canadian government should say, 'Then we would like to see what is going on inside Tibet. And we will report to you objectively, as a friend, and also report to the world what is going on.' \"\n\nMr. Sangay, born in a refugee camp in India, was elected as the Sikyong, or prime minister, of the Tibetan Government in Exile in 2011 â just as the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, gave up his political role.\n\nMr. Sangay said the rising number of self-immolations stems from the repression of political and religious freedoms, and crackdowns on other forms of protest.\n\n\"The cause of self-immolation is clear: political repression, economic marginalization, environmental destruction, cultural assimilation and denial of religious freedom. It's very clear. And occupation is the main cause,\" he said.\n\n\"Religious freedom is one of the most important components. Many of the self-immolators are also monks and nuns.\"\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe request for Canada to send an envoy to Tibet also raises a potential headache for Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government, which initially backed the Tibetan cause assertively, but in recent years has been more concerned with warming relations with Beijing to promote trade.\n\nMr. Sangay said Canada has remained supportive, noting that it has issued statements about Tibetan political freedom, most recently in December, and that Mr. Harper has met several times with the Dalai Lama. Some other heads of state shy away from such meetings, he said, and he hopes that Canada's business interests with China do not lead Ottawa to silence its concerns about Tibet.\n\n\"I always say, just because you keep quiet, don't expect the Chinese government to give you a better deal. They're good business people. And then, if you don't speak out on these core issues â¦ they'll take you as weak.\"",
  "latent_29964": "The Gains from Getting Rid of \"Run Amok\" Occupational Licensing By David Henderson\n\nIn my discussion with Alan B. Krueger on NPR on Wednesday, I pointed out that governments in the United States hamper or prevent entry into many hundreds of occupations. I gave as an example the taxicab monopoly in Monterey and I pointed out that someone who wants to put a sign on his car and operate a cab canât legally do so without government permission and canât easily get permission.\n\nAlan replied:\n\nOn some things, David and I do agree. I actually think occupational licensing is a bit run amok. I wouldnât want an unlicensed doctor to touch me. On the other hand, I think there are too many restrictions for entry. But I think thatâs a small part of the problems that weâre facing.\n\nAfter the show, I wondered why Alan thought that this is a small part of the problem. I recalled that an economist named Morris Kleiner had done some work in which he found occupational licensing to be a huge problem. So I did a search and found by an article by Kleiner titled, âAnalyzing the Extent and Influence of Occupational Licensing on the Labor Market.â Itâs NBER Working Paper 14979, May 2009. Itâs co-authored.\n\nRemember when I said on NPR that about 800 occupations that are licensed? I remembered well. The working paper says, âGovernments estimated that more than 800 occupations were licensed in at least one state.â\n\nThis is from the abstract:\n\nEstimates from the survey indicated that 35 percent of employees were either licensed or certified by the government, and that 29 percent were fully licensed. Another 3 percent stated that all who worked in their job would eventually be required to be certified or licensed, bringing the total that are or eventually must be licensed or certified by government to 38 percent. We find that licensing is associated with about 14 percent higher wages, but the effect of governmental certification on pay is much smaller. Licensing by multiple political jurisdictions is associated with the highest wage gains relative to only local licensing. Specific requirements by the government for a worker to enter an occupation, such as education level and long internships, are positively associated with wages. We find little association between licensing and the variance of wages, in contrast to unions. Overall, our results show that occupational licensing is an important labor market phenomenon that can be measured in labor force surveys.\n\nSo these authors are saying that occupational licensing is important.\n\nOf course, theyâre not saying that itâs important for the issue of income inequality. But letâs do a back-of-the-envelope calculation.\n\nIf licensing causes pay to be about 14 percent higher, how would it do that? I think almost any economist, including the authors, would answer that it does so by restricting entry into those licensed occupations. Indeed, the authors state:\n\nSome evidence suggests that licensing does restrict the supply of workers in regulated occupations. One application focuses on the comparison of occupations that are licensed in some states and not in others. The occupations examined were librarians (licensed in 19 states), respiratory therapists (licensed in 35 states), and dietitians and nutritionists (licensed in 36 states) from 1990 to 2000 using Census data (Kleiner, 2006). Using controls for state characteristics, the multivariate estimates showed that in the states where the occupations were unlicensed there was a 20 percent faster growth rate than in states that did license these occupations. Another study found that the imposition of greater licensing requirements for funeral directors is associated with fewer women holding jobs as funeral directors relative to men by 18 to 24 percent (Cathles, Harrington, and Krynski, 2009).\n\nSo what happens to the people who donât get into those occupations? The authors write:\n\nThe results of these wage equations are consistent with the interpretation that licensing policy enables the individuals in a licensed job to obtain a degree of monopoly control, or the ability to âfence outâ competitors for a service, which results in increased wages for licensed workers.\n\nThese other workers presumably choose what they regard as a less-good option and that less-good option will typically pay less, often substantially less. This wonât have much effect on the 1% vs. 99% issue, but it could certainly increase income inequality. You could have a plumber who is in the second from-highest plumber and the guy who didnât get to be a plumber being in the middle fifth. You could have a hair braider (an example they mention on page 6) kept out of that occupation by cosmetology barriers so that she is in the bottom fifth rather than the second-from-the bottom fifth. Etc.\n\nWith 29 percent of workers being in restricted occupations, that would amount to over 41 million workers earning higher wages. Thatâs good news for them but bad news for two groups: consumers of those goods and services and people who are excluded from those occupations. If the laws kept the number of people in those occupations lower by even ten percent (which, along with a 14% higher wage, would imply an elasticity of demand of only 0.7), then 4 million people are worse off and possibly substantially worse off. With a higher elasticity of demand, you get an even bigger number of people who are worse off.\n\nSo, now that Iâve looked at it, I think Alan B. Krueger was wrong to minimize the effect of occupational licensing. The effect is potentially quite large.\n\nOh, and by the way, the name of the co-author of the Kleiner piece quoted above? Alan B. Krueger.",

  "latent_30166": "âEvery time I watch Pep Guardiolaâs Barcelona, they remind me of Konstantin Beskov. He cultivated this magical style, now widely recognised as the best in the world, 30 years ago. Like a true creator, he showed the way ahead of time.â\n\nThose words, written in 2010 by Aleksandr Weinstein, one of Russia's most respected Russian journalists, might seem a bit weird. You could well even ask â Konstantin who? After all, the only name that usually comes to mind when thinking of the Soviet football school is that of Valery Lobanovsky.\n\nBut in Russia, the debate on the identity of their greatest coach will go on forever. For many, it is Beskov who should be remembered as such. Legendary Spartak Moscow chairman Nikolai Starostin claimed: âWhen asked who is the best ever writer, Victor Hugo answered âI amâ. Thatâs what Beskov should say if asked who is the best coach in the Soviet Union.â\n\nThe rivalry between Lobanovsky and Beskov went far beyond football. They were somewhat similar in their strict disciplinarian approach â both were called dictators, aspiring to control every aspect of life in their clubs and being extremely harsh with players who dared to disagree with them. Their approaches to the game, however, could hardly be more different. It was a clash of philosophies, in the pure sense of the word.\n\nWhereas Lobanovsky achieved everything in his career putting emphasis on the physical side of football, Beskov always preferred technical brilliance. While Lobanovsky wanted his stars to strictly follow his tactics, Beskov allowed players to think for themselves, especially in the final third of the pitch. The Kiev-born Ukrainian favoured a fast vertical game. The Moscow-born Russian never abandoned the silky short-passing style.\n\nIn short, it was a fight between automatisation and improvisation, between speed of running and speed of thought. Neutral fans usually prefer the latter, and that made the Spartak Moscow of the 1980s one of the Soviet Union's most popular teams.\n\nEuropean pioneer\n\nTrue, as far as titles are concerned, Lobanovsky wins the duel hands down. He spent almost two decades at the helm of Dynamo Kiev in the Soviet era, winning eight league titles and six cups, and even more significantly winning the European Cup Winnersâ Cup in 1975 and 1986.\n\nBut Beskov was the first Soviet coach to lead his team to a European final. In 1972 his Dinamo Moscow met Rangers in Barcelona on an unforgettable night for the Ibrox fans, for better or worse: the 3-2 win was their only continental trophy, but the ending was marred by numerous pitch invasions by Scottish fans who were beaten by the police.\n\nThe Muscovites felt that crowd trouble prevented them from scoring an equalising goal, and for Beskov it was the second heartbreak in the final on Spanish soil. In 1964, he had led the USSR all the way to the European Championship final, losing 2-1 to the hosts in a dramatic game at Santiago Bernabeu. Objectively, that was a massive achievement, but the Communist Party decreed that succumbing to Francoâs Spain was an unforgivable failure, and Beskov was duly sacked.\n\nHis second tenure with the national team also ended on a sour note. After the USSR lost to East Germany in the semi-finals of the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games, the party didnât really trust Beskov. When he led the nation to the 1982 World Cup in Spain â their first competition qualification in a decade â they forced him to accommodate the differing ethnic groups within the squad by taking along two extra coaches: the Ukrainian Lobanovsky and Georgian Nodar Akhalkatsi, who had led Dinamo Tblisi to the 1981 Cup Winners' Cup. The bizarre three-headed \"technical team\" predictably didnât work out, the USSR missing qualification from the second group stage on goal difference, and that was the end for Beskov.\n\nLobanovsky, who was eventually put in charge for Mexico 86, failed at two World Cups but reached the final of European Championships in 1988. In stark contrast to Beskovâs similar experience 24 years previously, that was considered a major success, even though Lobanovsky rarely finished second. Beskov, on the other hand, got quite used to it.\n\nIn fact, he holds a record for runners-up finishes, and that tradition started when at the helm of Dinamo Moscow, his beloved team where he spent the majority of his illustrious playing career as a striker.\n\nFrom Dinamo to Spartak\n\nFar from tall at just 172cm (5ft 8in) and slightly built, Beskov nevertheless scored roughly a goal every two games thanks to his immaculate shooting technique and tactical awareness. As a coach he cherished the same qualities in his players, and Dinamo enjoyed a very successful period under his guidance â but never won the championship title, finishing second in 1967 and 1970.\n\nFor long years, Beskovâs name was synonymous with the blue-and-whites of Dinamo, but in 1977 he was called to rescue city rivals Spartak after they were sensationally relegated. At first he tried to refuse the offer, but eventually couldnât resist the pressure of party officials. He never regretted it.\n\nEver since, Beskov became the legend for the red-and-whites, and his philosophy was best executed during the 12-year spell at the side many considered to be the peopleâs team in Russia. He was the ultimate hero of millions, and Spartakâs attractive short-passing game helped to promote the game all over the country.\n\nThe best-known star of Beskovâs Spartak outside Russia is goalkeeper Rinat Dasaev, but he helped to develop some truly outstanding outfield performers. Clever schemer Yuri Gavrilov, ball-loving sweeper Vagiz Khidiyatullin, midfield turbo Sergei Shavlo and penalty-area predator Sergei Rodionov are less famous around the globe, mostly because they didnât get the recognition they deserved in the national team after Beskov left it. Lobanovsky couldnât stand most of the Spartak stars, and the biggest victim of all was most certainly Fyodor Cherenkov.\n\nOne of the world's most visionary playmakers in the 1980s, Cherenkov easily makes the list of the best players never to compete in the World Cup. He was the brain of Spartak's game â most of the attacking moves went through him â while his passing and dribbling skills were truly breathtaking. For Beskov, he was the perfect ambassador of his philosophy on the pitch, but outside Spartak he was usually disregarded as too weak physically and too slow â especially after the Olympics fiasco in 1980 was mainly attributed to him.\n\nThe force of Cherenkov-inspired Spartak could be devastating. In September 1982 in the UEFA Cup, the Russians demolished Arsenal 5-2 at Highbury to complete an 8-4 aggregate win. A year later, Aston Villa were also beaten 2-1 in Birmingham in the same competition, as Beskov clearly enjoyed better luck in Britain than in Spain. But European success never came, and Spartak were always beaten before the semi-final.\n\nDomestically, too, Beskov didn't get the trophies his team's football deserved. His Spartak were champions in 1979 and 1987, but finished runners-up no fewer than five times, and on three such occasions it was Lobanovskyâs Dynamo Kiev who bettered them.\n\nThus, if you judge on results only, the winner is clear, but results rarely tell the whole story. The legacy of Hungary in 1954, Holland in 1974 and Brazil in 1982 is much more significant than that of the teams who beat them, and arguably that is also the case with the Spartak of the 1980s. The spirit of Beskov is immortal, and Spartak's most notable coach since â Oleg Romantsev, who won a record eight Russian league titles â developed his philosophy as a player in Beskov's team. Since he left, the void seemed to be impossible to fill, and the team gradually lost its identity.\n\nThe longing for the return of Beskov-style is easily felt even today, 25 years after he left the team in very controversial circumstances. His last game on Spartakâs bench was on 19 November 1988, a quarter of a century ago. That season finished with Spartak in fourth place, the team went onto winter vacation, and upon his return in mid-December Beskov found that he had been fired. The decision was taken behind his back, and he never forgot the insult.\n\nHe briefly returned to management in his mid-70s, spending a season and a half at Dynamo and leading them to the 1995 Russian Cup. The legendary coach died in May 2006, aged 85, but his philosophy lives on, and will do so for long decades to come. For many Russians, watching Xavi and Andres Iniesta reminds them of Beskov and Cherenkov, and that is the legacy left behind by the anti-Lobanovsky.",
  "latent_30294": "A fifth-grade teacher and mother of four, Stacy Shaw, of Hastings, Nebraska, started running âbecause it was a way that I could go out the door and shut out the world.â\n\nThen the world intruded.\n\nHobbled by ankle tendonitis that vastly slowed her usual pace, Shaw, 47, reached the finish line of the Boston Marathon just as the first of two explosions went off.\n\nNow sheâs as determined to return to Boston next year as she was to finish the race last week in spite of medical advice that she drop out.\n\nâI teach my students perseverance,â says Shaw, who ran her first 5-K on a lark five years ago. âI teach them to finish what they start.â\n\nTen days before the marathon, Shawâs ankle had swelled so badly she couldnât walk. An MRI revealed severe tendonitis.\n\nHer doctor didnât even try to talk her out of running Boston. He put her on steroids to reduce the swelling and told her to stay off her feet till then.\n\nâI was hoping by some miracle that I could run the raceâ and beat her 3:03:18 PR, set in 2011, she says. âAnd once I got there and was with all those other runners, I thought, âThis is awesome. Iâll find another time to break 3:00.ââ\n\nBy Mile 9, however, Shaw was in pain. Medics wrapped her leg at Mile 13 and again at Mile 21, and encouraged her to drop out. But Shaw kept going, mostly walking, urged on by the crowd who, seeing her Team Nebraska shirt, shouted, âGo Huskers!â\n\nShaw âran-walked,â she says, running a few steps and then slowing. Downhill hurt more than uphill.\n\nâI really just thought I would savor every moment of this course,â she says. âI came all that way. Why would I step off that course? Iâm not too proud to walk.â\n\nShaw had run three marathons before she got to Boston. âEverybody talks about it. Iâve heard about it forever, that you have to do it,â she says.\n\nWhen she turned the corner from Hereford onto Boylston Street, the crowd was even louder.\n\nâThey were all yelling, âYou can do it! You can run!â I was awe-inspired. Because the crowd was so amazing, I had to at least try to run.â\n\nShe hobbled to the finish with a net time of 4:44:14, the slowest of the 17,580 runners who were able to complete the race.\n\nâI hadnât even gotten to the water yet,â she says. âWe heard this sound like a cannon. And the first thing that went through my head was, âIs this part of a ceremony?â Then I turned around and saw the smoke. I think we all in our heads thought it was some sort of an accident.â\n\nVolunteers kept Shaw and other runners moving.\n\nâThey didnât panic. They didnât flinch. They just said, âKeep walking.â They kept handing us our things.â\n\nOne even made sure that she got her medal.\n\nâI forgot about it, and they were practically shoving them in our faces,â she says. âI think most of us would have just kept going on without them.â\n\nHer thoughts were on her son, whoâd come with her.\n\nâThat was the first thing I thoughtâthat I hoped he wasnât back there because of my stubbornness to finish this race.â\n\nNumb, she followed the instructions and kept moving forward. When it was time to claim her bagâand cell phoneâshe had to ask a police officer to read her race number off her bib.\n\nâMy mind wasnât working,â Shaw says.\n\nThe first call didnât go through. But the second reunited mother with son, who put her in a taxi as her leg began to ache again.\n\nLocked down in her hotel for the rest of the day, Shaw waited until the restaurant was finally opened so that guests could get some food.\n\nThe next day, she set out in her BAA jacket to look around.\n\nâI almost felt a little guilty,â Shaw says. But she donned the jacket, she says, âto show respect, that we were still there, and that the Boston Marathon is still a really cool event.â\n\nAs Shaw and her son toured Boston and neighboring Cambridge, they passed people sitting alone with their thoughts on Boston Common. âIt was pretty mellow and pretty quiet,â she says. âEveryone seemed so kind.â\n\nIt bothered her a little when a newspaper story described her as the slowest runner in the marathon, since nearly 5,000 others were behind her, unable to complete the race, when she finished. âBut thatâs not my biggest problem in the world.â\n\nMostly, she avoided the news. âI watched enough to know what was going on, but I donât think thereâs a need to try to watch a horrific event and just relive it.â\n\nStill, says Shaw, speaking about 8-year-old victim Martin Richard, âI was so angry when I heard that little boy died. I wanted to go out and find the guy who did this.â Nor did it escape her notice that spectators like the ones whoâd given her the will to finish were among the maimed and dead.\n\nBack in Hastings, wearing a brace on her sore ankle, Shaw was greeted by handmade placards, flowers, and cookies by her fifth-graders at the Longfellow Elementary School.\n\nâI talked to them about our freedomsâthat you can never let evil people take away your freedom, never let fear dictate what you do. Things like this are going to happen, and we should bring goodness out of it.â\n\nâThey were really scaredâ by what had happened, she saysâespecially because they had been tracking her, excitedly, and her progress in the marathon. Some had called her family in Hastings, worried.\n\nâThese kids will never forget that,â Shaw says.\n\nNeither will she.\n\nâYou should not forget these kinds of things, because it makes you stronger and better.â\n\nSheâs already planning on a marathon this summer to qualify for next yearâs Boston.\n\nâI think people are going to be even more excited and show the world weâre not afraid,â Shaw says. âAnd Iâm going to go back to say, âSee? Iâm not the slowest runner.ââ\n\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this article stated Stacy Shaw was the final, official finisher. That was inaccurate. The final finisher was recorded at 2:57 p.m., seven minutes after the first explosion.",
  "latent_30318": "New App âCo-pilot for Teslaâ Adds Much Needed Alerts To Teslaâs Autopilot\n\nJune 3rd, 2017 by Sponsored Content\n\nWhere did the idea for Tesla Co-pilot come from?\n\nThe idea for Co-pilot for Tesla app came about as a result of founder Jeffâs experiences using Autopilot in his Tesla. He loved the convenience of using Autopilot / auto-steer and was hooked on using it. A few weeks into using Autopilot, however, he had a few close calls with it around town where it responded inappropriately to temporary traffic flow changes that could have ended terribly. The near misses with Autopilot scared him to the point where he was not comfortable using it for quite a few months which kickstarted an innovative period for him.\n\nJeffâs experiences are not isolated, with many users in the Tesla Motors Club forums posting similar experiences with Autopilot. Consumer Reports even went so far as to demand that Tesla make sweeping changes to Autopilot in response to a fatality that occurred while a driver was using the system.\n\nWhile taking time away from Autopilot, Jeff started thinking about what could be done to fix the times when Autopilot misreads, misinterprets or fails to react to a situation in such a way that it results in a dangerous situation. Autopilot asking a driver to take the wheel on very short notice in the middle of a complicated traffic situation does not ensure that the situation will end well.\n\nJeff saw the potential in Autopilot and had an idea about how he could take it to the next level. After months of working through a few options, he created the solution in the form of a smartphone app he called âCo-pilot for Tesla.â\n\nWhat is the Co-pilot app?\n\nCo-pilot for Tesla is a crowdsourced, GPS-powered app that allows users to flag areas where the Tesla Autopilot system has failed for them. These alerts allow users to take control of the vehicle or at least closely monitor the situation to confirm their vehicle handles the potentially risky situation appropriately. With the downside of an Autopilot fail having the potential to be a life-altering event, advance warning of the locations where the system has failed can literally be a lifesaver.\n\nUsers can opt to simply sit on the receiving end of the app and take advantage of the alerts or to actively contribute to the app and enter the instances where autopilot has failed for them. Importantly, the ability for the solution to gather vast amounts of user-generated, real-life data about Autopilot system bugs has the potential to drive improvements in the system with Tesla as well as just provide data to Autopilot users.\n\nHow does the Co-pilot app work?\n\nThe fundamentals of the app, predictably, make use of the crowdsourced user data combined with the GPS location from the smartphone, but it does much more than that to achieve a higher degree of accuracy and functionality.\n\nThe app starts with a solid underpinning of map layers that it merges with crowdsourced insights as the foundational components of the appâs intelligence. To intelligently create Autopilot events, the app utilizes the mic on the smartphone to detect when Autopilot is turned on or off by recognizing the engage/disengage chimes.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the audio from the mic is not sent to the cloud nor is it stored. It simply listens for the Autopilot on/off tones and triggers the start and end of Autopilot events accordingly. In the event that the start or end of a trip is missed, Co-pilot intelligently determines which portions of the trip are valid, if any.\n\nCo-pilot kicks that up to the next level by connecting to the userâs myTesla account, which enables it to pull vehicle data directly from the Tesla Application Program Interface (API). The Tesla API is essentially a way for the app to listen to and talk back to the car using specific predetermined commands.\n\nWhat can Co-pilot do today?\n\nToday, Co-pilot provides alerts to users for known risky areas based on crowdsourced data from other users. The alerts are overlaid on a map showing the roads in the area where other users are using Autopilot to help users see which routes have fewer issues than others.\n\nUsers can also enter their own alerts to contribute to the pool, making the app function better for everyone. It works like unpaid Amazon reviews where the more alerts a single area gets, the higher the likelihood that all users will experience issues in the area. Conversely, one-off alerts can then also be identified and dismissed.\n\nBecause Co-pilot has access to data from the car through the Tesla API, it is also able to compile statistics for all trips in the vehicle. From these trips, the app automagically creates detailed charts with all the data for each including route information (distance, time, route), autosteer info, energy consumption, and battery charge. Additional graphs are displayed when swiped for battery range level, a graph showing speed, and a graph showing elevation.\n\nHow can I get my hands on Co-pilot?\n\nCo-pilot for Tesla is available for iOS devices today for free. Just click the App Store Download button below to pull it up. The Co-pilot team is working on an Android version for release in the near future. For more information about the app and to stay apprised of its progress, head over to the Co-pilot website or email your questions, concerns, or excitement to Jeff directly.\n\n*This post was sponsored by Co-pilot for Tesla.",
  "latent_30606": "Earlier this year, Fox debuted a fantasy drama series based off one of DC Comicsâ cult characters. Lucifer debuted in January 2016 and focused on a character named Lucifer Morningstar from The Sandman. The show is loosely based off the Vertigo imprint, and fans have wondered whether the show would ever introduce some of the comicâs other characters. And, now, one of the showrunners has commented on the possibility of Constantine cameoing in Luciferâs second season.\n\nUP NEXT: Matt Ryan Has A Message For Constantine Fans\n\nOver on TV Line, showrunner Ildy Modrovich answered a fanâs burning question about the possible crossover. The executive said, âNever say never, but right now we have no plans for him.â âWe might invite a little character from the comic books, Cain, at some point,â she continued.\n\nIf you are not familiar with The Sandman or Lucifer, then you can catch-up on the franchises thanks to Vertigo. The former series debuted in January 1989 with Gaiman helming The Sandman. The series told the story of Dream (Morpheus) and his Endless comrades. The anthropomorphic characters all band together when their respective realms are threatened, and Morpheus discovers that change is inevitable after he is taken captive by an occult for nearly a century. As for Lucifer, the character was introduced in The Sandman as a supporting character. The character acts as the Devil, and Gaimanâs iteration of the hellish lord is a complex one. In the comics, Lucifer has ruled over Hell for 10 billion years and become bored with his feared reputation. He eventually decided to hand over the keys of hell to another character so he could explore the world, but he soon learned that his placement in Hell was not a punishment but a gift.\n\nIn his solo series, Lucifer runs a piano bar and learns what exactly free-will means. During his run, Lucifer met up with several different DC characters, and one of them was Constantine. The character is the star of the Hellblazer comics, and the paranormal detective was keen on discovering why Lucifer was hanging around outside of Hell. If Constantine were to come to Lucifer, fans would definitely want to see Matt Ryan return as the hero. The actor played Constantine in the recent television adaptation of Hellblazer over on NBC, but the show was canceled after one season. Earlier this year, Ryan was asked whether he would want to reprise his role as Constantine, and the actor seem optimistic he would don the characterâs coat once more.\n\nMORE: Arrow Creator Addresses Rumors Of Constantine's Return / Could We See An Animated Constantine Series Like Vixen? / Constantine's Entire First Season Is On CW Seed",
  "latent_30674": "Wow. We're almost at the All-Star break? Already? How'd that happen? I could swear I was just rubbing in my spring training sunscreen application like 20 minutes ago. But if it's true that we've really chugged halfway through this marathon, you know what that means.\n\nIt means it's time for our annual midseason awards gala, which once again is being boycotted by Tina Fey, Fay Vincent, Vincent Price, David Price, Price Waterhouse, Tom House, Paul Householder and pretty much the rest of humankind. So I guess I'll just have to present these awards myself. Ready? The envelopes, please.\n\nBryce Harper leads the majors in on-base percentage (.471) and slugging percentage (.709). Tommy Gilligan/USA TODAY Sports\n\nNational League MVP of the half year\n\nBryce Harper, Washington Nationals\n\nWith all due appreciation for the awesome and ridiculously underrated Paul Goldschmidt, this was the easiest choice on the whole board. The Nationals without Bryce Harper this year are the Machine without Florence, the E Street Band without Springsteen. No one else in this lineup has an .800 OPS, a slugging percentage more than .435 or even 10 home runs. Anthony Rendon, Jayson Werth and Ryan Zimmerman haven't spent one day together on the field all season -- including spring training. And meanwhile, the friendly neighborhood 22-year-old right fielder is on pace to crank out 48 home runs, 122 walks, 89 extra-base hits and a slash line of .343/.471/.709. That would merely go down as the greatest season by a player this young in baseball history. Even if we lower some of those bars, just one player in history has ever hit .330 or better, with 40 homers or more, in his age-22 season. That would be Joseph P. DiMaggio Jr. So you know That Year we've been waiting \"forever\" for Bryce Harper to have? Uh, this is it.\n\nApologies to: Goldschmidt, Buster Posey, Anthony Rizzo, Giancarlo Stanton, Andrew McCutchen, Nolan Arenado, Todd Frazier, Max Scherzer, Zack Greinke\n\nMike Trout, the MVP in the American League last year, is having another monster season. Matthew Emmons/USA TODAY Sports\n\nAmerican League MVP of the half year\n\nMike Trout, Los Angeles Angels\n\nWe knew this would happen one of these seasons, right? Harper and Trout, hogging all the MVP hardware, just the way we envisioned it back when they were called up on the same day in 2012. Except that Harper is only 22. And Trout is still just 23. And we've never had a season -- ever -- in which both leagues' MVPs were as young as these two guys. But we're headed in that direction, all right. Hard as I tried to persuade myself to anoint my preseason MVP pick, Josh Donaldson -- or Miguel Cabrera or Jason Kipnis -- it all comes back to the same undebatable principle: Who's better than Mike Trout? And the answer is still nobody. Donaldson is an energizing force who has changed the face of the Toronto Blue Jays and fills up our defensive highlight reels nightly. But Trout beats him by significant margins in slugging, on-base percentage, OPS, hitting with men in scoring position, production in high-leverage situations, etc. And on the other side of the ball, he plays the heck out of a premium position. So as one friend of mine put it, this is the annual LeBron argument. If you're bored with giving the best player in the sport the MVP every year, then you talk yourself into someone else. Well, sorry. Couldn't do that. Not this year.\n\nApologies to: Donaldson, Cabrera, Kipnis, Manny Machado, Albert Pujols, Prince Fielder, Dallas Keuchel, Lorenzo Cain, Brian Dozier\n\nNL Least Valuable Player (LVP) of the half year\n\nMatt Kemp, San Diego Padres\n\nThe Dodgers and Padres have been coexisting, in mutual Southern California bliss, for 46 years now. But to find the last time the Dodgers traded a major league position player to San Diego before they booted Kemp down the freeway last winter, you'd have to go all the way back to April 17, 1969 -- a week and a half into the Padres' first season. Traded by the Dodgers to the Padres that day: a utility guy named Tommy Dean. He went on to hit .176 that year. So judged by that standard, Kemp's first season as a Padre has been awesome. But by just about any other standard, \"disaster\" would be one fine word that comes to mind. The Padres slapped his portrait on their billboards and tried to sell him as the face of their franchise. Instead, he's turned into the face of their descent into one of 2015's biggest disappointments. At last look, Kemp ranked 142nd in the big leagues, out of 162 hitters who qualify for the batting title, in OPS (.649), 133rd in slugging (.367) and 149th in on-base percentage (.281). And amazingly, he's been even worse away from Petco Park (.231/.272/.363) than he's been at home (.255/.293/.373). But the bad news is, the Padres gave up an All-Star catcher (Yasmani Grandal) to get him. And the really bad news is, the Dodgers were paying all but $3 million of his salary this year. But the Padres are on the hook for $72 million from here on out -- through 2019. Wow. Almost enough to make them miss Tommy Dean.\n\nSighs of relief for: Ian Desmond, Chase Utley, Marcell Ozuna\n\nAL LVP of the half year\n\nRobinson Cano, Seattle Mariners\n\nWe all knew Robbie Cano's beautiful 10-year, $240 million arrangement with the Mariners wasn't going to have a happily-ever-after ending. But if you saw this man as an LVP candidate in Year 2 of this deal, you definitely have more extrasensory powers than I do. Well, halfway through this stunningly mediocre season, the face of this franchise has hit exactly six home runs. And he owns a .292 on-base percentage and a .666 OPS -- which is 200 points lower than his average OPS in pinstripes, in case you were wondering. I suppose Safeco Field, his parasite/acid-reflux issues and lousy batting average on balls in play luck might have something to do with that. But this is about expectations. And disappointment. And Cano and his team are the kings of not living up to any of their spectacular expectations. We've heard way too many scouts and opponents talk about all the at-bats Cano has given away this season. And the fact that he's already struck out nearly as many times (61) as he did all last season (67), while walking just 17 times, tells us that isn't just Cano-hater talk. He's slugging .284 against left-handers and .337 away from Safeco. He's gone .218/.273/.256 with runners in scoring position. And his offensive winning percentage is a shocking .364, meaning a lineup of all Robbie Canos would go 59-103. He was brought to Seattle to be The Man. Instead, he's been the LVP. Who knew!\n\nSighs of relief for: Mike Napoli, Melky Cabrera, Stephen Drew\n\nMax Scherzer has a .188 batting average against in 17 starts this season. AP Photo/John Bazemore\n\nNL Cy Young of the half year\n\nMax Scherzer, Washington Nationals\n\nI can't believe I'm picking against a guy with the Maddux-esque ERA of 1.39 in this category -- especially when that guy (Zack Greinke) has a Cy Young trophy of his own lying around the old den. But the truth is, Cy Scherzer has outpitched Cy Greinke this year, no matter what the ERAs say. Scherzer has a better WHIP, a better strikeout ratio, a better fielding independent pitching, a lower opponent average and one of the four best strikeout-to-walk ratios (143-to-14, or 10.21-to-1) in the history of ratios. He's thrown a no-hitter. He just missed throwing two in a row. And he's overmatching even the best hitters alive. Opposing cleanup men are 8-for-52 (.154) against him, with no walks and 16 strikeouts. Opposing 3-4-5 hitters are 25-for-152 (.164), with two walks and 44 strikeouts. And on the rare occasions when someone actually reaches third base, he doesn't seem real anxious to let them score. (Hitters in those spots: 5-for-30, with 15 strikeouts, one walk and one extra-base hit.) So feel free to get back to me in 2028. But at the moment, Max Scherzer is making that $210 million the Nationals are paying him look almost sane. And who thought that was even possible?\n\nApologies to: Greinke, Gerrit Cole, A.J. Burnett, Shelby Miller (with about eight more guys behind them who easily could make this list)\n\nDallas Keuchel leads the AL in wins (11), ERA (2.14) and innings pitched (130 1/3). Bob Levey/Getty Images\n\nAL Cy Young of the half year\n\nDallas Keuchel, Houston Astros\n\nEvery year, there's one award like this, one that wakes me up at 4 a.m. and ping-pongs around my brain when I'm supposed to be dreaming of beaches in Maui or something. I don't know how anyone can fairly separate Keuchel, Chris Archer, Sonny Gray and Chris Sale. Gray has the best ERA. Sale has the best WHIP and strikeout ratio. Archer has the most starts allowing one earned run or none. Keuchel leads them all in wins above replacement. There's not a wrong answer in the bunch. And there's no good way to break the tie. Not with numbers anyway. So how about this for a tiebreaker: Winning. \"Go back,\" said one NL scout, \"to the importance of the games. I always feel like the biggest awards should go to guys on winning teams.\" So if we do that, what do we find? It's Keuchel's team that's in first place. And in six starts against the Angels, Rangers, Royals and Yankees -- the two closest contenders in his division and the two other first-place teams in the AL -- he's 4-0, with a 1.41 ERA. His team is 5-1 in those games. And he's averaged 7â innings in those starts. Beyond that, said the same scout, Keuchel is special because \"he does more with what he has than any pitcher in the game. He's a modern-day Tom Glavine. He's the least likely to strike you out. But he's the best pitcher.\" Yeah, and he's got the best beard, too. Good enough for me!\n\nApologies to: Archer, Gray, Sale, Wade Davis\n\nNL Cy Yuks of the half year\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies' rotation\n\nA radio buddy of mine in Philly asked this question recently: Do the 2015 Phillies have the worst rotation in baseball history? Well, no, actually. But if you subtract Cole Hamels (which is probably about to happen, now that you mention it), it would be in the argument. This group, minus Hamels, has a 6.02 ERA. Yep, 6.02. (That's 243 earned runs in 367 innings pitched.) So if we were allowed to pretend Hamels didn't work there (and I'm sure he'd love not to), that would rank as the fourth worst by any National League rotation in the live ball era. Only the 1999 Rockies (6.19) and two epically bad Phillies rotations from 1930 (6.15) and 1929 (6.05) would beat it. But let's put that what-if thought aside and just consider what this rotation has done. Eight Phillies starters have allowed the hitters they've faced to rack up an OPS of .878 or higher (meaning they've essentially turned the entire league into Albert Pujols). Hamels and Aaron Harang have combined for 22 quality starts. The other nine starters have a total of 12 -- in 54 starts. And then there's this: Between May 23 and Tuesday night, the Phillies played 40 games. Their starting pitchers went 2-23 in those 40 games. And the only two wins came from (A) a guy who hadn't even won a game (0-6) in Triple-A (Adam Morgan) and (B) a rookie they called up to pitch the second game of a doubleheader (Severino Gonzalez) and sent right down after the game! That, friends, is what you call the epitome of Cy Yukkery.\n\nCys of relief for: Matt Garza, Kyle Lohse, Kyle Kendrick\n\nAL Cy Yuk of the half year\n\nRick Porcello, Boston Red Sox\n\nI have to admit I came really close to giving the Red Sox's rotation the same tag-team Cy Yuk I awarded the Phillies. And I have a feeling millions of New Englanders would be onboard. But part of the responsibility of being the world's only Cy Yuk voter involves making the tough decisions. And I'm making the tough call that Porcello has risen above his surroundings to the Cy Yuk pinnacle. Or nadir. Or whatever it is. His 5.90 ERA is threatening to end the 51-year reign of Jack Lamabe (5.90) as the highest single-season ERA in the history of the Red Sox franchise. He has allowed a .297/.343/.466/.809 slash line that is frighteningly close to approximating a whole league of Jose Abreus. His ground-ball rate is at an all-time low. Only one pitcher in the entire AL (Ubaldo Jimenez) has allowed more stolen bases than the 13 he's permitted. And his lack of fastball command is alarming. But not as alarming as the fact that that four-year, $82.5 million extension the Red Sox signed him to this spring hasn't even kicked in yet. Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time.\n\nCys of relief for: Bud Norris, CC Sabathia, Fernando Rodney\n\nJoc Pederson has had a huge impact in his first season in the majors for the NL West-leading Dodgers. AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin\n\nNL rookie of the half year\n\nJoc Pederson, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nIf this were, like, 1967, I could pretty much guarantee you Pederson wouldn't win a rookie of the year award, or even a rookie of the half year award. Why? Because his batting average is .228. And there has never, ever been a rookie of the year with a batting average that low. Not unless he was a pitcher, anyway. But nowadays, we've learned to recognize that truth and meaning can be found in other places. So let's zip past Pederson's average, and his 102 strikeouts, and look at his 20 home runs, his .365 on-base percentage, his .853 OPS, his 57 walks. We look at the fact that only five players in the entire NL have seen more pitches. We look at his excellent defense in center field. And what we see is a rookie of the half year kind of guy. Which is impressive because there's a fellow running around Wrigley Field named Kris Bryant who is having the same kind of year -- except with a .275 batting average and eight fewer home run trots. If you asked me to bet which one becomes the bigger star, I think I'd take Bryant. But if you ask me which has had the more productive first half, I think the answer is Pederson. Just barely. That Humberto Quintero-like batting average notwithstanding.\n\nApologies to: Bryant, Maikel Franco, Matt Duffy, Nick Ahmed\n\nCarlos Correa, 20, has had an impressive start to his big league career. Matt Marton/USA TODAY Sports\n\nAL rookie of the half year\n\nCarlos Correa, Houston Astros\n\nLook, it's crazy to be picking a 20-year-old kid who has played 28 more big league games than I have as the rookie of the year. But I can't help myself, OK? Carlos Correa is going to win this award in five months. Everyone knows that. He's going to be universally regarded as the best shortstop in the American League within 12 months (if it even takes that long). Astros assistant GM David Stearns described him recently as \"the most mature 20-year-old I've ever met in my life.\" And one longtime exec who just saw him for the first time told me this month: \"I think he's a Hall of Fame candidate myself.\" So -- get the impression people around the game are getting a little excited about him? But here's why: He's the first shortstop since 1900 to hit seven home runs in the first 25 games of his career. He's the first 20-year-old in the live ball era to fire 16 extra-base hits in the first 25 games of his career. He's also a Web Gem waiting to happen at short. And as recently as three days ago, he was leading all American League rookies in wins above replacement already -- after four weeks in the big leagues. So is it ridiculous to hand this half-trophy to a player who just showed up? Of course it is -- unless that player is named Carlos Correa.\n\nApologies to: Billy Burns, Nathan Karns, Lance McCullers, Devon Travis\n\nNL manager of the half year\n\nMike Matheny, St. Louis Cardinals\n\nThere's no perfect formula called How to Be the Best Team in Baseball. But I'm pretty sure of this: You're not supposed to keep losing your best players and keep winning games. But apparently nobody briefed the Cardinals. And nobody briefed their even-keeled manager on the perils of operating without the Opening Day starter (Adam Wainwright), two more high-end starters (Lance Lynn and Jaime Garcia), the cleanup hitter (Matt Adams), the No. 3 hitter (Matt Holliday) and the center fielder (Jon Jay) for extended periods of time. But this team has lost all those theoretically irreplaceable cogs, tunnel-visioned its way beyond an FBI hacking investigation and never stopped looking like, well, the Cardinals. So I asked Matheny a couple of weeks ago whether he was amazed by that. His reply: \"I don't put limits on what we can do. I think it's just that mindset, that we believe we can get better. And if each guy buys into that, we just keep going.\" But remember this: Nobody buys in unless the manager sells it as eminently buyable. And so far, Mike Matheny has been the salesman -- and manager -- of the year.\n\nApologies to: Joe Maddon, Matt Williams, Clint Hurdle, Bruce Bochy\n\nAL manager of the half year\n\nA.J. Hinch, Houston Astros\n\nAll right, raise your hand if you expected the Astros to have the second-best record in the American League right now. No, not you, Mr. Luhnow. I'm talking about the rest of the planet. There you go. Before the season, 88 ESPN baseball geniuses made their astute predictions for this season. And how many of us picked the Astros to win the AL West? Right. Zero. So there may be many reasons for what's happened since. But don't underestimate the impact of the manager. A.J. Hinch may not have fared real well in his first gig as a big league manager, with the 2009-10 Arizona Diamondbacks. But he's gotten it right with this team. This group needed a leader who had as keen a feel for people as for the data that makes his team's engine hum. And this guy, said one of his cohorts recently, is a \"great balance of baseball and analytics, in that order.\" Which is the reason we're handing him this esteemed half-trophy, over some incredibly formidable competitors.\n\nApologies to: Kevin Cash, Paul Molitor, Ned Yost, Jeff Banister\n\nInjuries of the half year\n\nFirst prize: We believe in keeping these injuries clean. But Milwaukee Brewers second baseman Scooter Gennett took that just a little too literally in April. He was taking a shower after a game in Pittsburgh, reached for the body wash and sliced up his hand on the body-wash holder. Hey, at least he came clean about it afterward!\n\nCan't believe it! Literally trying to grab some body wash in the shower (post game in Pittsburgh) and... https://t.co/TO1j6BRuQH â Scooter Gennett (@Sgennett2) April 20, 2015\n\nSecond prize: We now know that eating beans is good for you. But beanbag chairs? Not so much. You can ask Oakland A's reliever Fernando Abad. The San Francisco Chronicle's Susan Slusser reports he was trying to ease into one of those beanbag chairs just last week, but the beanbag had other ideas. So Abad didn't stick the landing, hurt his tailbone and was unavailable for several days. Should have sprung for the recliner.\n\nThird prize: Time to stop taking those between-inning, toss-the-ball-around-the-infield routines for granted. A couple of weeks ago, a Taylor Featherston throw went whooshing past the glove of Albert Pujols and conked Robinson Cano on the head. While he was sitting in the dugout. If he and Featherston can't get an Advil endorsement out of that, something has gone totally amiss.\n\nFourth prize: It's become apparent, as we watched Chris Sale turn into the swing-and-miss champion of the world, that he can't be stopped by mortal men with bats in their hand. So what did stop him this year? His truck, of course. He missed his regularly scheduled Opening Day start because he was unloading the back of that truck in spring training, landed funny and fractured a bone in his foot. Suddenly, we're awash in nostalgia for Jeff Kent.\n\nFifth prize (tie): As long as we're delving all the way back to spring training, can't overlook (A) Corey Hart cutting his foot trying to get into a hot tub and (B) Kevin Pillar straining his oblique -- by sneezing. And gesundheit to you, too.",
  "latent_30847": "The immigrant population in the United States has risen to a record 43.7 million, according to a report released on Monday by the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThe figure, which is as of July 2016 and includes both legal and illegal immigrants, shows an increase of half a million since 2015, 3.8 million since 2010, and 12.6 million since 2000.\n\nOther key findings from the report show:\n\nImmigrants comprise 13.5 percent of the U.S. population, the highest percentage in more than 100 years and double the percentage as part of the overall population in 1980.\n\nIn addition to immigrants, there were 16.6 million U.S.-born minor children with an immigrant parent in 2016, for a total of 60.4 million immigrants and their children nationwide, making up nearly 20 percent of the overall population.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2016, 8.1 million new immigrants arrived in the U.S. Subtracting the approximately 300,000 immigrants who return home each year and the death of about another 300,000 among the existing foreign-born population annually, the growth in the immigrant population was 3.8 million since 2010.\n\nAlthough Mexican immigrants were by far the largest foreign-born population in the country in 2016, the overall Mexican-born population has not grown in the last six years due to return migration and natural mortality among the existing population.\n\nThe largest increases in immigrants from particular regions from 2015 to 2016 were the Caribbean at 120,522 and the Middle East at 109,113.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2016 the largest numerical increases were immigrants from India at 654,202, China at 550,022 and the Dominican Republic at 206,134. The largest increases in percentage terms for immigrants living in the U.S. during that period were those from Saudi Arabia at 122 percent, Nepal at 86 percent and Afghanistan at 74 percent.\n\nThe states with the largest numerical increases in the number of immigrants from 2010 to 2016 were Texas at 587,889, Florida at 578,468 and California at 527,234. The states registering the highest percentage of increases during that time period were North Dakota at 48 percent, West Virginia at 41 percent and South Dakota at 39 percent.\n\n\"The enormous number of immigrants already in the country coupled with the settlement of well over a million newcomers each year has a profound impact on American society, including on workers, schools, infrastructure, hospitals and the environment,\" Center for Immigration Studies Director of Research Steven Camarota told the Washington Examiner.\n\n\"The nation needs a serious debate about whether continuing this level of immigration makes sense,\" he added",
  "latent_30976": "Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who chairs the steering board of the new European Cloud Partnership , is convinced that Europe should have its own clouds rather than rely on those from US service providers.\n\n\" Recent months have proven it again : it is very important for Europe to create its own data clouds, operating under EU law and completely safe for users. Right now, 95 percent of the cloud services used in Europe are provided by US companies. EU data protection legislation also needs to be modernised and we should understand that big private firms are able to gather more information than any state,\" Ilves said at a press conference held after a board meeting in Tallinn earlier this month.\n\nAccording to the president, the international spying scandal shows that Europe has to \"do its own thing, its own cloud, its own services, here at a European level, and it is especially important for small countries to do that on a European level, because otherwise the economies of scale will leave us behind\".\n\nIn his speech, the president criticised US technology companies, saying that they have proven not to be trustworthy.\n\n\" As we have found out , if you use Apple, Google Mail, those do not provide privacy and security, or don't guarantee it, whereas with a Europe-based system or with European standards on these issues, we can offer the citizens of Europe something which right now doesn't exist.\"\n\nIlves believes that the PRISM scandal has brought an understanding of the need for security to Europe and it should be used to create fresh regulations and new, secure services.\n\n\"I think it is an opportunity for us and we must use this opportunity instead of beating our breast, saying 'oh, how terrible that United States is following everything we do' .\"\n\nIn her speech at the same press conference, the European digital agenda commissioner Neelie Kroes also pointed put the need for Europe to have its own secure clouds.\n\n\"If I were an American cloud provider, I would be quite frustrated with my government right now,\" she said, adding that if the new EU data privacy regulations hurt US companies, then \"so be it\".\n\nThe CEO of Microsoft in the Baltic states, Estonian Rain Laane, doesn't believe that US cloud service providers will be upstaged in European market.\n\n\"It just has to do with legal nuances. They have the Patriot Act in the USA, which stipulates a lot and which isn't always compatible with the laws of European countries. I believe that a solution which allows the use of other service providers' [including those from the US] technology platforms will be found. The right legal solution has to be found and I believe that our president along with the leaders of other countries will find it.\"\n\nIn his interview with the Estonian newspaper Postimees last week, Ilves said that although he doesn't find the situation where friends spy on friends normal, Europe should still \"tame its indignation a bit\" because since the beginning of July it's emerged that many countries in Europe including Germany, the UK and France have carried out similar activities to the US.\n\nAnd it's not only governments which people should be worried about.\n\nIn his speech at the press conference and also in the interview for Postimees, the president pointed out that a lot of the privacy approaches that have been taken in EU are too focused just on governments instead of global internet companies. \"They are only looking at Big Brother, but the real problem is Little Sister â your Little Sister who knows everything about you and blabs about it everywhere,\" he said.\n\nIlves warned security fears shouldn't encourage the smaller countries of the EU towards the idea of ring-fencing.\n\n\"OK, our data is not secure, we will not allow our data to go out of our country. Now if you're a big country, if you're Germany for example, well, there are plenty of services which are available to you, but if you're a small country like Finland, Estonia, Denmark, then you have problems. For example â Estonia is not a country which can cut itself off with the Great Wall of Estonia'. But that is the threat I think we face today in Europe - that the countries will feel the need to adopt national legislation that will in fact hinder the development of internet and the cloud services.\"\n\nIlves was asked to chair the steering board of the European Cloud Partnership by the EC last November. The function of the committee is to promote the use of cross-border digital public services in European business and the public sector.\n\nAt a meeting in November in Brussels last year, the steering board established two key goals for the project. First, the establishment of a common European cloud data processing framework. Second, promoting the transition of public sector IT into the cloud (and, consequently, promoting the use of the services in the private sector, particularly among small and medium-sized enterprises).\n\nThe steering board also includes Leo Apotheker (former CEO of HP), Christian Fredrikson (CEO of F-Secure), Hans Vestberg (Ericsson's CEO), Werner Vogels (VP at Amazon), Thierry Breton (CEO of Atos), and Bernard Charles (CEO of Dassault SystÃ¨mes).",
  "latent_30996": "Mexico's efforts to get to grips with spiralling drug crime and corruption suffered a blow at the weekend when one of the country's top police officers resigned amid allegations that drugs cartels had infiltrated his department.\n\nGerardo Garay, the head of Mexico's military-style federal police force, stepped down to head off suspicion that he was working for a major drugs cartel. \"I am resigning because the bloody fight against organised crime makes it our duty to strengthen institutions, which means it is essential to eliminate any shadows of doubt regarding me,\" Garay told a press conference. \"I will put myself at the disposal of the judicial authorities.\" He denied any wrong in the federal police force, and an official statement from the chief prosecutor's office at the weekend indicated he is not under investigation.\n\nBut the decision is the latest episode in the government's desperate battle to control the drug gangs who have been infiltrating Mexico's security forces as one prong of their strategy within an increasingly no-holds-barred organised crime war.\n\nPress reports have linked one of Garay's closest lieutenants to the Sinaloa cartel, which is a major protagonist in the drug wars. On Saturday the daily newspaper Reformer said the federal police had effectively \"sold\" control of the customs operations at Mexico City's international airport to the gang. So-called \"narco banners\" have also recently accused Garay of protecting Sinaloa-associated drug lords. Narco banners are propaganda messages purporting to be from different trafficking organisation that usually seek to discredit a rival gang, and are often hung from pedestrian bridges over major roads.\n\nMexico's deepening drugs crisis started four years ago as a fairly straightforward, if brutal, competition between different gangs. They are fighting for control of routes for trafficking cocaine from Colombia, as well as a growing domestic users market.\n\nThen a military-led crackdown launched by President Felipe Calderon in December 2006 both complicated who was fighting who, and triggered a dramatic escalation of the violence. Execution-style murders have risen to close to 4,000 so far this year, including dozens of decapitations as well as a growing number of civilian victims with no obvious association with either drug trafficking or the security forces.\n\nSome analysts believe the cartels have also increased the amount of effort and funds dedicated to corrupting the authorities.\n\nThis is not the first time the federal police have been under suspicion. Garay took over as acting commissioner of the force six months ago, after his predecessor was killed by a hired assassin outside his parents' home in Mexico City. The gunman not only knew the supposedly secret movements of the police chief; he also had a key to the external door.",

Some normally staunch gun-control opponents seem willing to consider new legislation. The NRA, which opposes just about any new regulations, has gone silent.\n\nThat's going to change soon.\n\nThe challenge for gun rights supporters is a bump-stock ban opens the door for a new debate about where to draw the line over limiting a firearm's lethality. For decades it's been at how many bullets can be fired with one trigger pull.\n\nBump-stocks blur that line. Can you outlaw a device that helps squeeze off rounds more quickly but not think about prohibiting quick-change magazines or limiting their sizes? Or banning pistol grips, which make firing easier?\n\nIt won't take many Republicans, with the NRA looking over their shoulder, to grind the process to a halt.\n\nFive reasons US gun control won't happen\n\n\"I didn't even know what they were until this week,\" Mr Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman, said on Thursday of bump-stocks.\n\nHe told talk show host Hugh Hewitt: \"I think we're quickly coming up to speed with what this is.\"\n\nFor years Republicans in Congress, as well as conservative Democrats, have blocked gun control efforts in the wake of violent tragedies.\n\nBut now a liberal Democratic gun control measure appears to have found a receptive audience across the aisle.\n\nSenator Cornyn said on Wednesday: \"It strikes me as odd that it's illegal to convert a semi-automatic weapon to an automatic weapon, but apparently these bump-stocks are not illegal under the current law.\n\n\"I own a lot of guns. As a hunter and sportsman, I think that's our right as Americans.\n\n\"But I don't understand the use of this bump-stock.\"\n\nHe said his colleagues should hold hearings to discuss the legality of the devices.\n\nHow gun control fails\n\nIn the last five years lawmakers have proposed more than 100 gun control measures - not one of them has become law, report CBS News\n\nRepublicans blocked a measure that would have limited the bullet capacity in gun magazines after 32 were shot dead at Virginia Tech university massacre in 2007\n\nEfforts to expand background checks on gun sales and reinstate a Clinton-era ban on so-called assault weapons failed after 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting\n\nCongress rejected a bill aiming to stop suspected terrorists from legally buying guns after 14 people died in San Bernadino, California, in 2015\n\nEfforts to expand background checks failed again after 49 died at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016\n\nCongressman Mark Meadows, who leads the hardline conservative Freedom Caucus, also said that he would be open to a hearing.\n\nSince Congress passed the Firearm Owners' Protection Act in 1986, it has been relatively difficult for civilians to buy new, fully automatic weapons, which reload automatically and fire continuously as long as the trigger is pulled.\n\nBump-fire stocks, also called bump-stocks and slide-fire adapters, allow semi-automatic rifles to fire at a high rate, similar to a machine gun.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How US mass shootings are getting worse\n\nBut the accessories can be obtained without the extensive background checks required of automatic weapons.\n\nThey typically cost less than $200 (Â£150) and allow nearly 100 high-velocity bullets to be fired in just seven seconds, according to one company advert.\n\nOne of the most popular manufacturers of bump-stocks, Slide Fire, said they had sold out \"due to extreme high demands\" since the Las Vegas shooting.\n\n\"I think they should be banned,\" Republican Texas congressman Bill Flores told The Hill newspaper, adding that he had never heard of bump-stocks before.\n\n\"There's no reason for a typical gun owner to own anything that converts a semi-automatic to something that behaves like an automatic,\" he said.\n\nDemocratic California congressman Mike Thompson, who chairs the congressional Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, said Congress must address the \"loophole\".\n\n\"We don't know how many lives could have been spared in Las Vegas had the shooter not had bump-stocks,\" he said.",

It was moderated by late night legend Larry King, and reached over 20 million viewers when it aired on October 23, 2012.\n\nZak Carter is spearheading the coalition and has ambitious plans for the project. Already over 20 members strong, the team is still growing. It includes groups and individuals from across the political spectrum like: Robin Koerner of Blue Republican, talk show hosts David Pakman and KrisAnne Hall, Terry Bain of Occupy America, IVP, Rock the Vote, Media Alliance, and others.\n\nCarter was instrumental in orchestrating the third party debate in 2012. He says itâs time for voters to get a real discussion on the issues:\n\nâThe commission needs a shakeup of their debates. Their debates are shams, there are secret backroom deals, the candidates get questions far in advance, and weâre not getting a real debate, weâre getting a scripted performance.â\n\nHe hopes the debates will rival the reach of the debates held by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), which falls anywhere between 70-100 million people. Disdain for both political parties has grown following the government shutdown this year, so the viewership just might be there.\n\nIn order to foster a substantive discussion, participants wonât receive questions ahead of time and a series of about 10 debates will give candidates a chance to address the issues in depth, diminishing the need to rely on partisan talking points. The top candidates are chosen by voters who will then move on to the subsequent round. So rather than leaving the results up to partisan pundits in the mainstream media, voters would choose who performed the best.\n\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) started administering presidential debates in 1987 when it took the reins from the League of Women Voters (LWV). The follwoing year, the LWV withdrew their sponsorship, stating:\n\nâIt has become clear to us that the candidatesâ organizations aim to add debates to their list of campaign-trail charades devoid of substance, spontaneity and honest answers to tough questions. The League has no intention of becoming an accessory to the hoodwinking of the American public.â\n\nWhat has now become a forum for prepared statements and partisan talking points bears little resemblance to the democratic function the presidential debates are supposed to serve. Coalition member Robin Koerner agrees:\n\nâThe system in my view is corrupted by the fact that it is a legalized duopoly. The two parties have a vested interest in locking it down for two parties. And they have done that in law and with the debate commission, they effectively do that with the thresholds that they move. Now youâve got to get 15 percent before you have a candidate on the stage.â\n\nThe threshold Koerner mentions was upheld in the courts. In a lawsuit brought after Ralph Naderâs exclusion from the debates in 2000, the D.C. Circuit Court ruled in 2005 that there was insufficient evidence that the CPD was controlled by the Democratic and Republican National Committies.\n\nNevertheless, the CPD is operated by former head of the Republican National Committee, Frank Fahrenkopf, and President Bill Clintonâs former press secretary, Michael McCurry.\n\nItâs a form of mass gerrymanderingâ¦ that they would keep these voices out. Robin Koerner\n\nWhile the debates have been under bipartisan control, the only non-major party ticket allowed to participate was Ross Perot in 1992. He entered the debates with 7 percent in the polls.\n\nCarter thinks he can avoid relying on an arbitrary polling percentage by working with the coalition members to build consensus on which candidates should be asked to participate. However, voters will be able to weigh in as well.\n\nâI want 10 candidates to start with,â said Carter. âAnd Iâd kind of like toâ¦ American Idol-ize it as a way to keep people tuned into each debate.â\n\nOccupy America radio host Terry Bain signed on in light of Jill Steinâs arrest outside of a presidential debate at Hofstra University in 2012:\n\nâ[Jill Stein] was arrested, [she was] on the ballot in almost all the states so she was a legit candidateâ¦ Thatâs unacceptable. We cannot have candidates arrested. Thatâs just not the way things are supposed to work.â\n\nBain feels ârealâ issues have been purposefully left out of the CPD-sponsored debates and therefore arenât addressed by either major party or traditional media.\n\nThe last missing link to make Open Debates 2016 a success is some star power. While Carter acknowledges how instrumental Larry King was in making 2012 a success, he also knows there is a high demand out there for a better approach to presidential debates that continues to grow.\n\nâPeople are, by in large, tired of this dog and pony show of Democrats and Republicans and looking for something different. Weâve got a pretty solid plan on how to bring something different to the American people.â\n\nA Must Read on The Presidential Debates Partisan Commission on Presidential Debates Harms Process Check It Out\n\nPhoto Credit: Mint Press News",
  "latent_31849": "Yesterday was the 24th anniversary of the theatrical release of Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. Even if youâve seen the film over the years, thereâs a good chance you didnât see it in theaters. The film opened in 1,506 theaters on Christmas Eve and was met with a resounding âNope.â Sans much in the way of mainstream advertising or even shows scheduled in the evening, the acclaimed feature-film spin-off of the acclaimed television episodic flamed out and became the rare Batman movie to outright bomb. Even with what Iâm sure was a pretty small budget (it was originally intended to go straight-to-VHS), the 72-minute (plus credits) feature earned just $5.6 million domestic.\n\nFor the record, I was among the few (the proud?) who did see the Bruce Timm/Eric Radomski-directed action drama in a theater on opening day. Having been a huge Batman fan and a general movie nerd even at the tender age of 13, I knew plenty about the movie thanks partially to Cinefantastiqueâs huge Batman issue which had detailed episode guides and copious content concerning both Batman: The Animated Series and the 1966 Batman TV show. I was young and stupid enough to assume that my interest would translate to mainstream interest. But I was also old and mature enough not to take it personally when the film tanked over the holidays.\n\nOver the last 24 years, Mask of the Phantasm has grown in critical esteem, and it has become âcoolâ to proclaim it as the best Batman movie ever made. That I find it merely one of the better Batman movies is no insult, and it still stands out as the rare Batman movie (give or take Batman Begins) to be more concerned with offering a Bruce Wayne-centric character drama as opposed to mega-budget razzle-dazzle. It also features, in Dana Delany's Andrea Beaumont, maybe the second-best female character (save for Michelle Pfeifferâs Selina Kyle in Batman Returns and maybe Anne Hathawayâs Selina Kyle in The Dark Knight Rises) in a Dark Knight flick.\n\nBruce Wayneâs former flame, a woman whom he fell for right before he was about to don the Batman identity, gets a meet-cute introductory scene where sheâs shown to be smart, independent, opinionated and witty. Unlike too many male-centric genre films, she gets to remain as such for the duration of the movie. And the filmâs small-scale melodrama is poignant enough that it still works as a drama even when Mark Hamillâs over-the-top Joker (in PG-mode as opposed to the TV-Y7 Batman: The Animated Series) shows up and tries to steal the show. Mask of the Phantasm is a great Batman movie set in the world of a great Batman TV show.\n\nBut, despite the relative popularity of the show and the popularity of the character, the animated offshoot crashed-and-burned. Itâs not the biggest Christmas bomb (I can discuss the underrated Cutthroat Island another day). In a year where Wonder Woman out-grossed Justice League and after Beware the Batman and Justice League Action have both struggled to gain a following, it serves as a reminder that Batman is not a 100% guarantee. To the extent that the feature-length superhero toon is a somewhat rare thing 24 years later (following 80âs spin-offs like Transformers: The Movie and He-Man and She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword), it bears a note that weâre getting a bunch in 2018.\n\nIn the last 24 years, weâve had (give-or-take any I missed) The Powerpuff Girls Movie in 2002, The Incredibles in 2004, Megamind (which played like an adaptation of âGoing Saneâ) in 2010, Big Hero 6 in 2014 and The LEGO Batman Movie. Some of these did better than others, but there has yet to be a situation where an animated movie spun off from of an ongoing animated series has been a big hit (LEGO Batman Movie wasnât based on any of the DC Lego direct-to-DVD features). Warner Bros./Time Warner Inc. hopes to change that this July with Teen Titans Go to the Movies!, a feature based on Cartoon Networkâs most popular show.\n\nTeen Titans Go! is one of the greatest artistic triumphs ever to grace the medium (itâs a hilarious deconstruction of superhero tropes, pop culture nostalgia and fandom) and I have no doubt that the movie will be an Oscar frontrunner. But weâll see to what extent folks will show up for a feature version of something they can get for free on TV. The SpongeBob movies (and The Simpsons Movie) have done well, but weâre just as likely to get an X-Files: I Want to Believe as an X-Files: Fight the Future. I still contend that the deluge of episodics based on DreamWorks Animation properties has somewhat diluted the special-ness of the feature film franchises.\n\nThatâs not a problem for The Incredibles 2 or Sonyâs animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The Walt Disney/Pixar sequel opens in June of next year, and itâs all-but-sure to be one of the yearâs biggest hits. Sonyâs animated Spider-Man movie, which has a somewhat loose connection to the MCU and/or the âSpider-Man universe without Spider-Manâ movies (Venom, Black and Silver, etc.), will open next Christmas, on/around the 25th anniversary of Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. How an animated movie will play in a world filled with Spider-Man animated shows is an open question, but using Miles Morales instead of Peter Parker may be just the thing to make it stand out.\n\nFor Warner Bros., it was just a cash-in slotted between The Pelican Brief, Grumpy Old Men and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. I donât think WB is going to panic if Teen Titans Go to the Movies isnât a mega-hit. But Sonyâs animated Spider-Man is an important release. The superhero sub-genre has become vastly more important since WB dropped Batman: Mask of the Phantasm into theaters almost in secret on a busy Christmas weekend. It stands out today as a rare Batman-centric flop and a time capsule from an era when a geek-targeted comic book superhero movie wasnât the biggest/most important offering on the studio slate and could indeed only play to the cult.",

  "latent_32016": "The last time Wanting Qu spoke with her mother, the call ended on a disappointing note. The platinum-selling Vancouver pop singer was headed to China, but told her mother she was too busy touring to travel to Harbin, where she grew up and learned to play the piano.\n\n\"Oh, that's too bad, because I really miss you. I want to see you,\" her mother, Zhang Mingjie, replied.\n\nMs. Qu didn't think much of it then, because she had plans for a surprise visit. She didn't know it would be the last time she would hear her mother's voice for years.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"I remember this so vividly, because it hurts me every time I think about it,\" said Ms. Qu in her first interview about her mother since Ms. Zhang disappeared Sept. 22, 2014.\n\nThat same day, when Ms. Qu arrived in Beijing, her mother did not answer her phone or reply to text messages. After days of anxious calls, a relative told Ms. Qu that Chinese authorities had detained her mother.\n\nSoon after, Ms. Zhang, who built her career by taking on increasingly powerful municipal roles, was formally arrested for abuse of power and stripped of her job titles. Chinese media have accused her of selling state land on the cheap to a company in which her brother held a senior role.\n\nNow, after nearly two years of detention, Ms. Zhang expects to soon face trial for a list of charges expanded to include corruption and taking bribes. The most serious possible sentence is the death penalty.\n\nMs. Qu is speaking out in part to increase scrutiny on her mother's case. Chinese courts are controlled by the Communist Party and boast a 99.92-per-cent conviction rate.\n\n\"I'm worried, but I am keeping my fingers crossed. And I trust that there is still justice out there,\" said Ms. Qu, who, while still a Chinese citizen, has lived in Canada for 16 years and is dating Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson. But she has reason to be anxious.\n\nMs. Zhang was barred from seeing lawyers for 210 days, and has since complained of sleep deprivation and poor access to medicine.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"There were a few times she said, 'I can't handle this anymore,'\" said Ms. Qu, who wrote a letter to the Chinese consul-general last November begging for better medical treatment after a lawyer reported that Ms. Zhang, a diabetic, had grown swollen and feverish.\n\nBy the time her mother sees trial, she will have been in detention for more than 650 days. The trial itself is a subject of uncertainty, initially set for Wednesday but then shifted to a week later. It will be held in a detention centre rather than a courtroom.\n\n\"This is a very serious matter, and it's my mother's life on the line here,\" Ms. Qu said.\n\nMs. Qu said her mother, born in 1956, was a hard-working, ambitious figure who started working at 16 and rocketed through the administrative hierarchy in Harbin, a petrochemical and agricultural centre 400 kilometres from the Russian border.\n\nShe served as a deputy mayor of a city district, and then deputy director of the Harbin Municipal Development and Reform Commission. Ms. Qu thought of her mother as a politician, although it was never something that interested her.\n\n\"She was always a workaholic. I sometimes disliked her for that reason,\" Ms. Qu said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMeanwhile, her parents' relationship deteriorated (they are now separated), and home life was tense.\n\n\"I grew up not happy,\" she said.\n\nIn 2000, Ms. Qu left for Canada. Her family financially supported her as she cycled through a series of schools before her music career took off.\n\nChinese functionaries are not well-paid. Even in 2014, the salary baseline for a central government worker at Ms. Zhang's seniority level stood at about $1,400 a month after tax.\n\nCould Ms. Zhang have turned to illicit means partly to fund her daughter in Canada?\n\nMs. Qu says no, recalling a conversation with her mother about Chinese President Xi Jinping's campaign against corruption. \"I'm not doing any of that, don't worry,\" Ms. Zhang said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"My mom â she finds her ways. She borrows money from friends and family to support me,\" Ms. Qu said. \"She makes me know it's hard work making money, and I should not waste it.\"\n\nBut in China, according to a lengthy report in National Business Daily last year, Ms. Zhang was placed in charge of a farm redevelopment as part of a broader state-owned enterprise reform effort. Under her watch, the property changed hands several times, eventually ending up at a company where Ms. Zhang's brother worked as deputy general manager. A former employee of the farm told the newspaper it had been sold off for a small fraction of its value.\n\nMs. Zhang's case was investigated in part by the feared internal Communist Party graft-busting organization, the paper reported.\n\nMs. Qu is concerned her mother's arrest is politically motivated. Ms. Zhang has been an active member of the China Democratic League, an officially sanctioned minority political party.\n\nOfficials at the court in Harbin did not answer calls from The Globe and Mail; Ms. Zhang's lawyer declined comment, as did Ms. Qu's label, Vancouver's Nettwerk Music Group.\n\nMs. Qu, who sings in both Mandarin and English, worries that it was her career and the fame she gained in China that brought attention to her mother.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe singer's strongest sales have been in China, but she has not returned since Ms. Zhang's arrest, fearing for her own safety.\n\nAnd Ms. Qu is rethinking her long-standing refusal to apply for a Canadian passport. \"I just believed in China. I believed that one day it will become like America or Canada â we'll have a passport we Chinese will feel proud of,\" she said.\n\n\"With my mother's situation, it definitely didn't help me with that belief. I kind of doubted.\"",
  "latent_32021": "Population by region\n\nHistory\n\nGlobal demographics\n\nLargest populations by country\n\nFluctuation\n\nMathematical approximations\n\nIn 1975, Sebastian von Hoerner proposed a formula for population growth which represented hyperbolic growth with an infinite population in 2025.[124] The hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s was later correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development. This feedback can be described as follows: technological advance â increase in the carrying capacity of land for people â demographic growth â more people â more potential inventors â acceleration of technological advance â accelerating growth of the carrying capacity â faster population growth â accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors â faster technological advance â hence, the faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on.[125] The transition from hyperbolic growth to slower rates of growth is related to the demographic transition. According to the Russian demographer Sergey Kapitsa,[126] the world population grew between 67,000 BC and 1965 according to the following formula: N = C Ï arccot â¡ T 0 â T Ï {\\displaystyle N={\\frac {C}{\\tau }}\\operatorname {arccot} {\\frac {T_{0}-T}{\\tau }}} where N is current population\n\nis current population T is the current year\n\nis the current year C = (1.86Â±0.01)Â·10 11\n\n= (1.86Â±0.01)Â·10 T 0 = 2007Â±1\n\n= 2007Â±1 Ï {\\displaystyle \\tau } Years for world population to double According to linear interpolation and extrapolation of UNDESA population estimates, the world population has doubled, or will double, in the years listed in the tables below (with two different starting points). During the 2nd millennium, each doubling took roughly half as long as the previous doubling, fitting the hyperbolic growth model mentioned above. However, after 2024, it is unlikely that there will be another doubling of the global population in the 21st century.[127] Historic chart showing the periods of time the world population has taken to double, from 1700 to 2000 Starting at 500 million Population\n\n(in billions) 0.5 1 2 4 8 Year 1500 1804 1927 1974 2024 Years elapsed 304 123 47 50 Starting at 375 million Population\n\n(in billions) 0.375 0.75 1.5 3 6 Year 1171 1715 1881 1960 1999 Years elapsed 544 166 79 39\n\nOverpopulation\n\nNumber of humans who have ever lived\n\nFurther information: Paleodemography Estimates of the total number of humans who have ever lived range in the order of 100 billion. It is difficult for estimates to be better than rough approximations, as even modern population estimates are fraught with uncertainties on the order of 3% to 5%.[17] Kapitza (1996) cites estimates ranging between 80 and 150 billion.[163] Haub (1995) prepared another figure, updated in 2002 and 2011; the 2011 figure was approximately 107 billion.[164][165][166] Haub characterized this figure as an estimate that required \"selecting population sizes for different points from antiquity to the present and applying assumed birth rates to each period\".[165] Robust population data only exists for the last two or three centuries. Until the late 18th century, few governments had ever performed an accurate census. In many early attempts, such as in Ancient Egypt and the Persian Empire, the focus was on counting merely a subset of the population for purposes of taxation or military service.[167] Thus, there is a significant margin of error when estimating ancient global populations. Another critical factor for such an estimate is the question of pre-modern infant mortality rates; these figures are very difficult to estimate for ancient times due to a lack of accurate records. Haub (1995) estimates that around 40% of those who have ever lived did not survive beyond their first birthday. Haub also stated that \"life expectancy at birth probably averaged only about ten years for most of human history\".[165]\n\nSee also\n\nNotes",

  "latent_32717": "Nier, to Me\n\nMark Thomas McLaughlin Blocked Unblock Follow Following Jul 18, 2017\n\nFirst and foremost, I must warn you that this article most certainly will contain spoilers and ending details for Nier Automata. Itâs nearly impossible to divorce any discussion of the maximum value of this game from the unprecedented ending and the decision it imposes upon you.\n\nWhat may seem like a gimmick if described out of context stands as a poignantly crafted climax to a strange rollercoaster of an adventure. In the concluding moments of the game, upon overcoming an unusual final challenge, the player is faced with a choice that means sacrificing all that has been gained over the course of the game. In return, the player will be comfortable in the knowledge that another player has been lent a helping hand.\n\nYoko Taro, creator of both Nier and previous Square Enix series Drakengard, is known for his criticisms of gaming as a culture and an industry via gameplay as an art. The man himself is a bit unusual, preferring to conduct interviews in a mask or represented by a hand puppet. Heâs not your typical poster boy for the Japanese video game industry.\n\nHis previous games include the original Nier, which came in two flavors, telling two very similar sides of a story set thousands of years prior to Automata. While Automata can be enjoyed without having played the previous installment, I found it beneficial to watch videos detailing the events of Nier and other media, of which there are many, that take place in the same universe.\n\nNier Automata takes place in a far future where Earth has been overrun by machine lifeforms (automata?) built by alien invaders. The invasion was successful to the point that humans have fled to the moon and left the defense of Earth in the hands of an android army known as YoRHa. The story centers around two YoRHa units, 2B and 9S, and their ongoing attempt to dismantle the machine network that currently holds dominion over the Earth.\n\nThe game is completed in three playthroughs. Once you believe yourself to have completed the game and experienced the credits, you are told to play it again. Each time you experience a new story or perspective, expanding your knowledge of the history of the world around you.\n\n2B, the android the player controls during the first run through the game, is designated as a battle type android (hence the B in her name). Her name (2B/âto beâ) also reflects the existentialist themes that can be found throughout the game. Weâll go over that later. Suffice it to say, there is more to this character than meets the eye.\n\nThe player controls 9S through the second run of the game, which mirrors the first run through his perspective. 9S is a scanner android with a natural curiosity to fuel his need to seek out information. He is also adept at hacking, which plays a major part in the gameplay of the second and third run.\n\nThe third run takes place after the concurrent events of the first two runs of the game. At this point a major victory has been achieved over the machine network and the war between YoRHa and the invaders has only escalated. Also at this point the player, via 9Sâs hacking abilities and inherent curiosity, has learned some devastating truths about the setting and events of the game world.\n\nThe Philosophy of Automata\n\nThe prevalence of philosophy in this game is just short of heavy-handed. Jean-Paul, a character literally named after a real philosopher, acts as one among the machine lifeforms and discusses the tenets of existentialism quite directly. The game can be played without exploring this character very deeply, but understanding Jean-Paul and his relationship with his many fans enriches the story of another character the player encounters in the main events of the game.\n\nMuch closer to the surface of the lore encountered during the main story is the series of uncomfortable truths the player encounters as the game progresses. Deep into the first run of the game it is discovered that the aliens who created the machine lifeforms have long since been destroyed, leaving the machine lifeforms alone to continue their invasion while their initial purpose no longer exists. In this way the game challenges the notion of essence and meaning by exploring the objectives of the machines once their original purpose is long destroyed.\n\nThe second challenging revelation occurs when 9S discovers that the androids share the same fate as the machine lifeforms. As he digs deeper into the YoRHa database, he is confronted with the reality that humans, as well, have been extinct for thousands of years, long before the aliens even came. It is then that the player becomes aware of the futility of the trail of violence that has decorated the adventure so far.\n\nOver the course of the game it also becomes apparent that the machine network is evolving to emulate human behavior. It begins in awkward uncanny valley phases, machines practicing human phrases and emotions without much context, until a group of them come together to literally birth two machines in human form. The human machines begin exploring human culture and refer to themselves as Adam and Eve, despite both appearing conventionally masculine.\n\nThese revelations all occur in the first two playthroughs, leaving the third playthrough open to bring the pieces together. After shedding light on the dark secrets that plague the history of this barren future, what remains is to complete the story of the characters, all of which have lost what they believed to be their purpose. Even then the game refuses to let go of the lesson it intends to teach. The best is yet to come.\n\nDifficulty and Subversion\n\nLetâs take a break from discussing the plot to discuss the gameplay and inevitably weave it into a theory about the overall themes of the game. The game plays mostly like a hack-and-slash action RPG. Melee attacks are a simple button press away, requiring no cool-downs or turn orders. Meanwhile, ranged attacks are available via a droid that essentially orbits you throughout the game.\n\nAs the game progresses, you are increasingly required to time ranged and melee attacks properly while artfully dodging a bullet hell style barrage of enemy projectiles. Some portions of the game are, in fact, played entirely with space shooter mechanics that transition from 2D to 3D movement.\n\nIâd never call myself a hardcore gamer so itâs no surprise that I struggled, but I still feel confident calling this a very difficult game. That is, unless you exploit a system built to allow the game to essentially play for you. You can install upgrades to your characters that completely automate all of your fights. Furthermore, you have access to those upgrades from practically the beginning of the game.\n\nThatâs right â you can automate almost every fight in the game so that youâll essentially never lose. Although this feature is only available in the easy difficulty setting, it lends itself to a profound statement for players who may otherwise struggle with the chaotic war zones encountered, especially in late game battles.\n\nIâll be the first to admit I made heavy use of the auto-chips. As I said before, Iâm not a hardcore gamer, but I really wanted to fully experience the story of the game. As the story proceeded, however, and I began to realize the futility of my mission, I was nonetheless blind to the fact that I only numbed myself to the entirely meaningless mass slaughter I had enacted.\n\nUltimately, when you are faced with the final battle to end all battles, your auto-chips are taken away from you, regardless of difficulty setting.\n\nThe argument regarding video games as art is that, in order for a video game to be considered art, it must make an artistic statement using a technique that cannot be done with other media. For example, Automata may provide a statement through its narrative, but practically all other forms of media can craft narrative. Where Automata succeeds in leveraging gaming for art is in the way these gameplay mechanics are inexorably linked to the themes of the narrative.\n\nThe Weight of Your Actions Incarnate\n\nThe third run of the game ends when the remaining two androids, having both lost sight of their purpose in some way, must face one another. The player must choose who to side with and kill the other. This is not the end, however, as the player must go back and choose the other side as well in order to unlock the true ending as the motives of either character are ultimately arbitrary. Herein does not lie the gameâs greatest lesson.\n\nWhen I first reached the ending of the third run, having chosen my side between the two androids, I told my friend who had played the game previously. Heâs the one who told me I had not yet completed the game. He said, in fact, that I was âcloseâ to beating it.\n\nUpon completing both scenarios, you are faced with your greatest and perhaps strangest foe â the credits!\n\nYes, in order to truly complete the game you must destroy the names of real people who really worked on creating the thing youâve spent hours enjoying. You fight the credits in classic space shooter style with no upgrades available. The game appears to give you no avenue to make this battle any easier. As you die repeatedly, you find yourself inching closer and closer to what seems at times like an impossible conclusion.\n\nThen the game throws you a bone. You are offered support from others who have played and beat the game. Upon accepting this assistance, you are notified each time you are destroyed that someoneâs data has been erased to protect you.\n\nYou are suddenly reintroduced to the weight of your violence. While destroying the names of real people who worked on the game, you are shielding yourself with the hard work of other real people whoâve played the game.\n\nSeveral Endings, One Victory\n\nIf you make it through the grueling battle, which you inevitably will if you accept the assistance offered to you, you are posed with the question of whether youâd like to offer similar assistance to others in need. All you are required to do is delete your save data and remove every trace of the hours you spent toiling away at the game, ridding yourself of all your progress.\n\nHaving caused so much senseless destruction, you are offered the chance to make it all worth something. You are offered a chance to create your own purpose in what may be an otherwise meaningless existence. This is not only redemption but so much more. This is proof that youâve learned the lesson of the game.\n\nSo when I confidently consented to the deletion of all my progress, I felt comfortable in the knowledge that I had made a purpose out of my actions. Despite the gameâs constant attempts at changing your mind, making it clear that you canât choose who youâre going to help and that you may help someone who doesnât appreciate it, I had no qualms with my decision.\n\nI now find myself telling my friend who had previously played the game, who chose not to sacrifice himself, that he is only âcloseâ to completing the game.\n\nTo truly beat Nier Automata is to vanquish the monster of nihilism that so often walks undeservedly hand-in-hand with existentialism. The final boss is not the credits you destroy. It is the save data, the fabrication of meaning built around the lie of predestination. Once you have let go of the illusion of outward meaning, you have truly experienced everything the game has to offer.\n\nIn an unexpectedly optimistic turn of events, Yoko Taro has taught us that meaning does not have to be handed to us by others. It can be found in the hefty decisions we make day by day."
