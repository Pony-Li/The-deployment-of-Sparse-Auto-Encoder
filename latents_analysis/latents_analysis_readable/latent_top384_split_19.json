  "latent_37": "ST. GEORGE — A St. George doctor was sentenced Monday to serve more than eight years in federal prison after writing bogus prescriptions for fictitious patients and illegally prescribing more than 81,000 oxycodone pain pills to people for nonmedical purposes.\n\nDuring a hearing in Salt Lake City’s federal court, Dr. Simmon Lee Wilcox, 60, was sentenced to 100 months in federal prison, plus three years of probation. U.S. District Judge Ted Stewart ordered Wilcox to surrender to U.S. marshals in August.\n\nWilcox and five others were federally indicted in 2013. Following an eight-day jury trial in January, Wilcox was convicted on one count of conspiracy to distribute oxycodone and one count of distribution of oxycodone. A jury acquitted Wilcox on three counts of distribution of hydrocodone. Five co-defendants in the case struck plea deals with prosecutors earlier this year.\n\nFederal prosecutors asked that Wilcox be handed a 15-year sentence, according to court documents, while Wilcox’s attorney, Brian Frees, requested that the court impose a sentence of home confinement or supervised release in lieu of incarceration.\n\nFrees argued that it was unfair to punish Wilcox more than the co-defendants in the case – who received sentences of no prison time and up to four years – simply because he was a doctor, according to court documents.\n\nHowever, prosecutors argued that a substantial sentence was warranted in this case given Wilcox’s position as a practicing physician and that the conspiracy could not have occurred without the integral participation of Wilcox.\n\n“Unlike every other defendant in this case, Dr. Wilcox did not accept responsibility for his actions, did not debrief with the United States, did not qualify for the safety valve provision, and did not substantially assist the government in any discernible way,” prosecutors stated in the United States Sentencing Memorandum. “Additionally, none of the other defendants had a medical degree, DEA prescription license, or practiced as a medical professional during the timeframe of the conspiracy.”\n\nEvidence at the trial showed Dr. Wilcox wrote approximately 618 prescriptions resulting in the diversion of more than 81,000 30-mg oxycodone pills for nonmedical purposes between July 2010 and March 2013.\n\nProsecutors told the court that Wilcox’s actions have been seriously destructive to the Utah community, and his sentence should reflect that seriousness.\n\n“Conspiracy to distribute oxycodone, and distribution of oxycodone, is a serious offense, especially given the toll of destruction that oxycodone has wrecked upon many communities, and upon Utah specifically,” prosecutors said in court documents. “… To be clear, Dr. Wilcox should not be held responsible for the opioid epidemic writ (at) large, but he should be sentenced in accordance with an understanding of the impact that his oxycodone trafficking has upon the community.”\n\nStewart agreed with prosecutors that Wilcox was the most indispensable part of the conspiracy due to his medical license. Stewart ordered Wilcox to report to begin his sentence on Aug. 12.\n\n“I’m respectful of the court process,” Wilcox told Fox 13 as he left the courthouse Monday. “I still hold on to my innocence.”\n\nWilcox said he intends to appeal his conviction to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver.\n\nOutside of the courthouse, Assistant U.S. Attorney Vernon Stejskal told Fox 13 in Salt Lake City that he was satisfied with the sentence Stewart handed down. Stejskal became chief of the Narcotics Section and Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force for the U.S. Attorney’s Office, District of Utah, in July 2015.\n\n“I believe the judge imposed a just and appropriate sentence given the conduct of Dr. Wilcox and the amount of opioids that he put in the St. George community and around there,” Stejskal said. “Hopefully, this sends a message to the other medical community that this kind of conduct will not be tolerated.”\n\nEmail: kscott@stgnews.com\n\nTwitter: @STGnews\n\nCopyright St. George News, SaintGeorgeUtah.com LLC, 2016, all rights reserved.",

We have a very small team here and covering such things are not usually feasible due to time constraints, especially given how much hardware we have to go through.\n\nToday we will be looking at Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, Kojima Production's final Metal Gear Solid title and the first full Metal Gear Solid title to be released on PC. Will this title be a a PC port which will be hailed above all others, or another Arkham Knight?\n\nIn recent years PC users have got the short end of the stick, with newer consoles becoming available the PC has been placed at the back of the priority list for many developers and publishers, which has allowed many sub-par PC games to be released in recent years, especially from Ubisoft.\n\nIn this Article we will not be reviewing Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain story or gameplay, but will be giving you a rundown of the game's performance at 1080p and 4K, an in depth analysis of the game's options menu and a screenshot comparison of the game's different graphical settings.\n\nTest Setup\n\nWe will be testing this game on our dedicated GPU test rig using a variety of different GPUs from AMD and Nvidia's Mid-range and High end offerings.\n\nBeing a Nvidia GameWorks title this game is expected to favor Nvidia GPUs, especially since Nvidia currently offer this game with the purchase of new GPUs. We will see if this prediction is correct as we play and benchmark this game.\n\nASUS GTX 960 & GTX 980\n\nASUS R9 380 & R9 Fury Strix\n\nIntel Core i7-4960X @ 4.4GHz\n\nASUS Rampage IV Extreme\n\nCorsair Dominator Platinum 2133\n\nCorsair AX1500i\n\nCorsair H100i\n\nWindows 7 x64\n\nMid Range GPU Testing\n\nTo represent AMD and Nvidia's Mid range GPU offerings we have decided to use the AMD R9 380 and the Nvidia GTX 960. Both of these GPUs will be the ASUS Strix models, which are currently available for £169.99 and £179.99 for the Nvidia GTX 960 Strix and the and AMD R9 380 Strix respectively at Overclockers UK.\n\nBoth of these GPUs offer very similar performance in most scenarios and come in at very similar pricepoints, so it will be very interesting to see which GPU will come out on top.\n\nRight now Nvidia's GTX 960 will come with a copy of this game for free with any purchase.\n\nHigh End GPU Testing\n\nAt the higher end of AMD's product stack are the AMD Fury and the Nvidia GTX 980, which while they are not the highest end GPUs available they are very big competitors when it comes to price and performance. Again we will be using ASUS' Strix models of these GPUs, the Nvidia GTX 980 Strix DCU II and the AMD R9 Fury Strix DC3 OC.\n\nRight now both of these GPUs are priced at £449.99 at Overclockers UK, making them ideal for a head to head comparison. Those who buy a GTX 980 right now will be given a copy of Metal Gear Solid V with their GPU, though right now we do not know how much longer this promotion will last.\n\n1 - Introduction 2 - MGSV's Graphical Options Menu 3 - Graphical Comparisons - AMD vs Nvidia & Low, Medium and High Detail settings 4 - Control Options 5 - 4K Gaming with ASUS GTX 980 and R9 Fury 6 - 1080p Gaming with ASUS GTX 960 and R9 380 7 - VRAM Usage and Conclusion 8 - Conclusion «Prev 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Next»\n\nMost Recent Comments",

  "latent_232": "Bob Lusk: And so, I asked him: what do you want me to talk about? He said, \"Well, why don't you try to talk about some of the different myths.\"\n\nNow, I want to tell you where I come from. Everybody in this room can out fish me, I promise you can, but you ain't going to beat me raising those fish that you catch. That's what I do. My world comes from what goes on underneath the water.\n\nI spent my entire life; I knew when I was 14 years old that I was going to make a living messing with fish. I knew it. I didn't know how. I didn't know where, but I knew that I was going to make a living jacking with fish.\n\nAfter I got my degree in fisheries management and hung out a shingle, about that time, I'm from Texas, I live north of Dallas near Lake Texoma. The year I went into business was the year that the state of Texas stopped giving away free fish for stocking the ponds. Well, people started having to buy their fish.\n\nWhen they started having to buy their fish, they wanted to take better care of them because it used to they could stock a pond or lake, and it was good for four or five years and then it would begin to decline. They could go in and Rotenone and kill all the fish, and the state would give them more free fish, so it was a pretty cool cycle from the late '50s through the '60s into the '70s, but in 1980 they stopped all that.\n\nWhat's really cool is now there's an industry that is developing and focuses on taking care of private lakes and ponds. I'm pretty fortunate because I get to go help take care of some really cool lakes. I take care of a 125 acre lake in North Carolina that was built in 1835. It was built in 1835 with slave labor, mules, Fresnos, slips, they call them, and shovels to harness water to turn a grist mill.\n\nTo bring that into perspective for you young guys, 1835 was one year before Davy Crocket was killed in the Alamo. It was ten years before Texas became a state. It was an old lake, and I get to help nurture that lake and grow some really good fish in it.\n\nThree weeks ago I was in wine country. Who would ever think someone in wine country in the Napa Valley in California would like to grow big fish, but they do. People that have ponds and lakes are just as passionate about growing their fish and taking care of their fish as we all are about trying to bring one in on the business end of the rod and reel with our cheeks puffed up out.\n\nI got a huge kick out of watching Glenn today. He foul hooked about a eight pound catfish, fought it like Moby Whale, and he was giggling like a little girl. I thought I was at a sleepover in the sixth grade, I did, and he was chuckling - hee, hee - and I thought, my gosh, I love it.\n\nThis is so much fun, and then he tied into the sultan. I don't know what this is, but it's this big. I thought it was going to break his rod. He caught a drum that almost weighed 11 pounds, huge fish. And what is that? I don't know. I take it for granted. I see this stuff all the time. It's just so much fun.\n\nHe asked me to talk a little bit about some of the myths out there. Keep in mind where I'm coming from. I'm coming from 30 years of lake design and studying fish and electro fishing boats and stocking ponds and draining ponds and seeing where those fish are. It comes from putting structures in lakes that fish never use to structuring lakes that I thought they'd never use but you can't keep them off of it.\n\nI couldn't tell you one thing about what should you tie on the end and throw into that structure, but I can pretty well tell you what's going to be there once I've studied that lake a little bit.\n\nOne of the myths I think out there is how does a fish get to be big? How does a fish get big? What does it take? I want to tell you the odds of that.\n\nThe odds of a large mouth bass to make double digits is probably one in 25 or 30 million fish that are hatched.\n\nOne of the take home points I want to make sure that you get tonight is . . . How many of you guys have caught the double digit large mouth bass? Okay, five of you. I think that's outstanding.\n\nWhen I go out and electro fish a lake, the instant, and I've been doing this . . . I'm 54, so I guess I've been jacking with fish 40 years. Every time I see a double digit bass, I get a chill down my back, my heart rate picks up, and I revel in that moment because I know the odds that fish had to overcome to get to that size.\n\nFirst of all, it's got a 50-50 chance the day it's hatched that it isn't going to make it because it won't be a boy, it'll be a girl. Males don't get that big. The second thing is it's got to have the right genetics. Just because a Florida bass spawns with another Florida bass doesn't automatically give those babies the gene pool or the genetics to be double digits.\n\nOnce the fish does have the genetics and it's a female, it's got to live long enough. 99.6% of every spawned fish gets eaten before their first year. Most of that happens in the first six to eight weeks; they get eaten. The odds are astronomical.\n\nLet's stay with this double digit bass. Who's caught the biggest double digit bass? Shout out a number. 13? Anybody got a 13? Show me a 13. What? Seven and a half. What's junior got?\n\nAudience Member: I got 14.7.\n\nBob: Dude, you might as well quit fishing. Let me tell you. A 14.7 and somebody's got 11-1/2. Let me tell you that 14.7 could have easily been that 11. Let me tell you why.\n\nYou get past the genetics, and the fish has the genetic propensity, we know that. Then, it's got to have something that it needs to eat every day.\n\nA fish has so many heart beats, and when those heart beats are done, that fish is done. I can't tell you how many that is, but I know it's finite. Fish live longer in the north because . . . bass, I'm talking about, live longer in the northern part of the country because their heart rate is slower because they're cold-blooded so their metabolism slows down in cooler water. There's been bass live to be 22 years old documented in Illinois, but a 13 year old bass in Alabama or Louisiana, that's old.\n\nIt's got to have the genetic propensity. It's got to be aggressive. In other words, it's got to be on the prowl, on the hunt almost all the time.\n\nThen, it's got to have the food chain available to it every day so that it can eat because a day missed of growth, you see it at the other end of that fish's life.\n\nIf it doesn't grow now - a bass is going to grow its entire life until it gets to that point that it gets to its age where its heart beats are starting to wane. It's going to start to deteriorate, and then it's going to die. If it doesn't get the food that it needs in year two, three or four, it'll show up in year eight, nine, ten, eleven. So, that 14.7 one I'm going to tell you is exceptional.\n\nThis is my 30th year, and I haven't kept track, but I started thinking about it today a little bit. I probably held 35 double digit bass in my career, but I'm messing with fish every day. I was in my electro fishing boat, I think, nine times in the last six days before I came up here. Saw, one double digit fish, a 10.2.\n\nThe point I want to drive home is when you do get your hands on a double digit bass or you see one, give it the reverence that it deserves. That fish has overcome astronomical odds to get to the very top of its food chain, and it rules the roost.\n\nNow, is it smart? Nope. If you ever dig into the head of a large mouth bass, even a ten pounder, its brain is not any bigger than that. It doesn't have the frontal lobe and some of the side lobes that give it the ability to reason. A fish doesn't think; it reacts. It's conditioned to its environment.\n\nThat ten pound bass, that 14 pound bass, grew up in that environment because it was able to condition to the environment, to the habitat, to what it has to eat every day and then survival. For whatever reasons, a snake didn't get it. A bigger bass didn't get it.\n\nI was talking with Bill Dance about a year and a half ago, and we were sitting in his office and just exchanging. I love talking to that guy because what you see on TV is exactly what he is in person. He's a practical joker. He'll fall out of his chair, and just visiting with him, he asked me the question, \"Bob, what do you think with the public, why aren't we seeing more double digit bass? It seems like in Florida you never hear about double digit bass\", he said. \"Is that environmental? Is it a genetics issue? What's your opinion about that?\"\n\nKeep in mind what I'm telling you is its opinions of what I have seen over 30 years of doing this. I said, \"Bill, let me tell you, the very first thing that strikes me when you ask me that question is there's really two factions of anglers. There's catch and release anglers, and I'm going to talk about that in a minute, and then there's those that aren't.\n\nSometimes, somebody might catch a bass that's a trophy for them and they don't understand they can weigh it, measure it, take photographs of it and get a replica. They're going to take it and get it mounted. That was the mentality quite a bit from the '70s, '80s, into the '90s. Even today I come across people that aren't willing to release a big fish because they want to get it mounted.\n\nSo, I said, \"Here's something, Bill. I studied this for a long time. When I went to Texas A&M, in Fisheries Management 101 they did not teach me this. I learned this on my own.\" I said, \"Bill, a four pound bass can't grow to six pounds in a skillet.\" You're supposed to laugh.\n\nAll right. When a bass reaches three pounds, three and a quarter pounds, that fish has got a shot at getting into double digits. Those 10 to 12 inch dinks, they don't stand much of a chance because there's too many of them fighting for the same food chain.\n\nHere's something that will help you. How big was that bass that had the thread fin shad in it today?\n\nGlenn: About a pound, pound and a half, maybe.\n\nBob: I think it was a little bit bigger, a little bit, maybe. Okay. We didn't weigh that one, did we?\n\nGlenn: Yeah. No, we didn't.\n\nBob: Glenn caught a bass today that was, maybe, 14 or 15 inches long. It had a six inch thread fin shad down its gullet. When a bass reaches the size just under 17 inches, its mouth is big enough that it can eat a ten inch bass. That's when its life changes. If a bass can quickly get to 17 inches, which is just a shade under three pounds, it stands a shot. If it has the genetics, if it's aggressive and if it has the food chain, it's got a shot at making 10 pounds or 11 pounds or 14.7.\n\nThe point that I want to make with you is that if you ever tie into a fish like that, treat it like you treated your date the first time you went out, the first time you dated your wife, the first time you dated your husband. Treat that fish the same way. It deserves that respect because of what it's gone through to get there.\n\nNow, I said: can it think? No, it can't. It can't think. We spend how many dollars, how much time trying to out think a fish that can't think. That's one of my favorite things about this whole fishing thing is we try to outsmart a fish that isn't smart, technically but it survives. It can make it.\n\nHow does it do it? Does it learn to avoid lures? I think fish can receive negative reinforcement, just like they can receive positive reinforcement. There's been studies done to try to figure out how long a bass can remember. Fifteen minutes, that's it. Fifteen minutes. You jerk its lips off, throw it in the boat. You let it flop around a minute, take the hook out, throw it back, and 15 minutes later you can probably catch it again if it's got that propensity to strike.\n\nHow do they avoid lures? Well, it's not the natural food. There are basically three kinds of strikes. You guys know that. There's the feeding strike, the reaction strike, and what's the third one?\n\nAudience Member: Territory.\n\nBob: Territory. That's it. They're defending a zone.\n\nNow, I'll tell you this. The bigger a bass gets, the more defensive it becomes, the more territorial it becomes.\n\nI was talking to Big O last night, and he's found a place at Lake Fork where he can go that he says nobody knows about. It's an underwater hump that people drive over every time they pass, they go from the marina. They go across his fishing hole to get where they're going. He found those fish, and he can go there every single time and catch fish at that same place, and they're all big fish.\n\nOnce a bass hits about four pounds, they become territorial. They get into zones, and that's where they stay because they rule the roost. They can eat when they want. They can chase away any smaller fish and they defend it. So, they're conditioned to the food. They're conditioned to the area. They don't like bare baby butt, smooth areas to hang out in. They orient to structure every time. They like to hang out and be in the same place, same time.\n\nI electro fished in east Texas on Friday night, and I shocked up a bass that was probably four and a half pounds. It had a crappie in it that was 11 inches long. I didn't take the crappie out. I left that one this time, Keri, but I weighed and measured the fish, shot a photograph of it. We carried around in the livewell for probably 45 minutes as we were collecting fish.\n\nIt was a 35-40 acre lake. We pulled up to the dock which was directly across the lake from where we picked that fish up. We weighed and measured all the fish. It was dark. It was getting close to midnight, and we just released them right by the boat. Well, the next morning we got back out there and started shocking again and went right back in that same area where we had shocked that fish and got it again.\n\nThis time, the crappie was all the way down. We saw the tail sticking out of its mouth the night before. The next morning the tail was all the way down its gullet, but you could still see the spots on the tail. So, that fish swam probably 400 yards to get right back where it was when we shocked it up.\n\nI want to talk about catch and release. I remember the first time I met Ray Scott. It was at a fishing show in Mesquite, Texas, outside of Dallas, and he was coming in with Earl Bentz to do a personal appearance and sell some books.\n\nIf any of you have been around Ray, you know that he's always selling something, and I love that guy. What you see is what you get. I could sit and listen to him talk about himself for hours and hours because he has done some amazing things and been to some amazing places.\n\nI walked up, and his books were 20 bucks, called \"Bass Boss\". I walked up to him. I got in line. I got my turn in line, and I had a $20 bill, and I stuck it out there. He said, \"You want to buy one of my books?\" I said, \"Yes, sir, I do. Would you sign it for me?\" He says, \"What's your name?\" I said, \"My name is Bob Lusk.\" He lays his pen down and he says, \"The pond boss?\" I thought, holy cow, how cool is this. This guy knows who I am. He says, \"I love your magazine.\" I said, \"Well, thanks a lot.\"\n\nHe says, \"Don't you have a book out?\" I said, \"Yes, sir.\" He says, \"How much is it?\" I said, \"Twenty bucks\". So, he gave me my $20 bill back. I went and got one of my books. He signed his; I signed mine. We traded books, and I sat by him while he was signing autographs.\n\nI decided the day I met you I wanted to ask you a question. \"Do you really believe - you're the guy that started catch and release\". He said, \"That's right.\" I said, \"Do you really believe that?\" He said, \"I believe it in public lakes.\" He said, \"I think public lakes are pressured heavily, so if you don't have catch and release, you're going to lose the resource.\n\nBut he said, \"In my lake, my 55 acre lake in Pintlala, Alabama, when somebody comes fishing over there, I tell them that I want the anglers to take out every bass under 15 inches.\" He said, \"Then, when I think they've taken out enough, I double it and take out that may more.\" So, I said, \"You and I are going to be friends.\"\n\nLet me tell you, catch and release is one of the tools that we use as fisheries managers. Now, I want to preserve the resource. If I catch a bass or shock up a bass or get my hands on a bass that's 18 inches or bigger, I'm going to put that back in the lake because that fish can impact the rest of the fishery because it can eat those young dinks, 10 and 12 inch fish, that disrupt the lifecycle of so many ponds and lakes.\n\nWhen you have a lake or a pond, it's almost like a garden. You're going to grow plants. You're going to grow animals, and at some point there's a bounty. If you don't harvest that bounty, that lake is going to lose its ability to produce the good quantities of quality fish.\n\nSo, catch and release is a great way to start. It's a great way to handle large fish, but you've got to have slot limits in there at some point in time.\n\nSlot limits are designed to allow us to harvest those overabundant fish of certain size ranges.\n\nThose of you that have raised animals, anywhere from dogs to pigs to cattle, not all animals are raised the same. You get a litter of puppies, you're going to have the runt, you're going to have the most aggressive one. They're going to have different personalities. They're going to grow at different rates. Fish do the same thing.\n\nEven when you have a brand-new lake that you just stock, by the third year you're going to see the growth rates are totally different.\n\nI electro fished a lake that I got to design for a family out of Dallas. Oh, this lake is in its fifth year, starting its fifth year. So, it's four years old.\n\nWe electro fished about 120 bass in that 50 acre lake. The largest group weighed six and a half to just under nine pounds at four years of age, but their siblings, some of them were still 13, 14 and 15 inches long. And the young fish that were hatched three years ago are about that same size or even bigger. That tells me now that there's a slot of fish right in the middle of that population that needs to be harvested.\n\nSlot limits are integral tools that lake managers use to be able to harvest the bounty of the fish. What we have to figure out is what's the bounty? Like when I'm talking to a landowner, I'm going to ask, \"What are your goals?\" Johnny Morse, \"Johnny, what are your goals?\" Well, I'm going to grow the biggest fish on the planet.\n\nAll right. Do you want any quantity fisheries? I'll fire you if you say yes. He wants to grow big fish, but on the other hand at my house I've got eight ponds on my little 12 acre parcel of land, and the main thing I want is I've got a nine year old grandson, a four year old grandson and a little granddaughter that will be a year old in July. I want those kids to come out and catch fish every single time they put a hook in the water, which means I'm homing in on bluegill and a wide range of sizes of largemouth bass. I've got a catfish pond.\n\nThe little nine year old spent the night with us two weeks ago, Glenn. I took him down and I said, \"Ethan, you want to go catch some fish?\" He says, \"You bet, poppa\". So, I put him in the Gator. We drove down and got a bucket and two fishing poles. The feeder was going to go off down there in about 15 minutes, and that little fart caught two channel catfish, two and a half pounds, three pounds, and he fed the family that night.\n\nI brought him back up. He fished for 30 minutes. You should have seen the look on his face. We skinned those catfish. He wanted to see the heart. We cut the heart out and he watched it beat as I was filleting the rest of the fish.\n\nThe goals that we set help determine what the limits are of the fish that we take out. Now, in public lakes you guys fish on mostly, I feel bad for some of the state agencies because they're limited to their biology management by politics and enforcement. They have to set laws that the game wardens can enforce.\n\nWhen they set some of these slots that don't apply, and you guys know that, when you go out there's lakes where you're catching fish that are just inside the slot or just outside the slot. You know in your heart that that lake is overcrowded with bass, and some of them need to come out. They're constrained by regulations and by enforcement issues, but in the private sector we're not.\n\nI'll never forget; this is probably 15 years ago. I took my electro fishing boat. I had an intern working for me. He was a young guy, a student at Stephen F. Austin State University in east Texas, and he was working for me for the summer. I took him out electro fishing to this really big lake that I'd been taking care of, about a 600 acre lake. We were just catching oodles and gobs of 10 to 12 inch bass.\n\nThe lake committee, as we got through weighing and measuring the fish for the first round, they said, \"Do you think this is going to be indicative of the rest of the lake?\" I said, \"You know what? I've been working this lake for three or four years. It's been this way for years.\"\n\nAnd so, they huddled and they said, \"Well, you've been telling us to take some fish out. I said, \"You need to\". He said, \"Well, why don't you keep all the bass that you catch that are under 15, 14 inches, whatever you think, and we'll fillet them at the end of the day.\" I said, \"You go get you some coolers.\" Well, they brought back five coolers, and we filled them up.\"\n\nI mean, we were busy, dipping these fish up, putting them in the livewell, taking them back, weighing them, measuring them, documenting the fish and then putting them in the coolers. These guys were going to have a big fish fry for the lake committee and see if they could make a few dollars to buy some forage fish for this lake.\n\nIt was hot; we were tired.\n\nOn the way back home, that intern was quiet. He was usually real talkative. In a minute, I said, \"Ryan, are you okay?\" He says, \"Yeah, I can't believe you told those people to eat those fish.\" He said, \"I've been raised on catch and release. You've got to throw the little ones back so that they can grow up.\" He says, \"I've always looked at the bass as like eating the family dog.\"\n\nThat's a myth. That lake, for their management goals, fish need to come out. I want to impart with you that every fishery has some bounty at some point, and our jobs, as the biologist, are to figure out what that bounty is and then encourage you guys to take it. Catch and release in the public lake, love it, except for it doesn't need to happen, especially in some of the smaller public lakes that you fish.\n\nGlenn asked me: why don't you talk a little bit about fish kills.\n\nWell, if you don't harvest the bounty of fish, especially in a smaller body of water, nature does it for you. At some point when the fishery becomes overcrowded, and I've seen it happen with wholesale die-offs of fish. I've seen it happen with partial die-offs of fish.\n\nI've seen it happen with species of fish, like gizzard shad are notorious. I've seen gizzard shad die off every year somewhere, and then in the summer time, especially when people have managed a lake and they have fed fish food to the catfish and to the blue gill, but they don't harvest any fish. At some point the carrying capacity of that lake is exceeded, and the water quality begins to deteriorate.\n\nWhen that happens, nature is going to spank us. There's going to be a fish kill.\n\nI don't investigate a lot of fish kills that are human caused. Most of them are caused be cause of a lack of understanding or a mismanagement of that fishery. Overfeeding or overstocking or pushing the envelope or a classic case is a turnover where the water quality starts to deteriorate just a little bit in the summer time. Especially where I live in tornado alley, we might get a vicious storm in late June that has golf ball size hail, and the water is already stratified by that time.\n\nYou've got a warm water layer sitting on top of a cold layer of water, and when the hail hits that water and the rain hits that upper layer and cools it to the same temperature as the bottom, they mix. Well, that bottom layer of water has been down there long enough. It has no oxygen. It's picking up everything that's coming out of those fish and decaying organic matter. There are water quality issues, and then when that lousy water mixes with that top layer, there's a fish kill.\n\nFish kills typically are nature's corrections.\n\nI'll never forget a guy back in, I guess, '85, '86, through there somewhere. He called me, and he was almost in tears. He said, \"I've had a fish kill.\" I said, \"Well, talk to me about it.\" So, he explained to me how he had stocked it right, and he fed his fish. This was the fifth year of his lake or his pond. It was about five acres, if I remember right.\n\nWhat I remember is that he was so upset that he was choking. He had to stop two or three times and regain his composure. I ran out there, and I looked at it. I said, \"You know what? These are all your big fish. Do you have any small fish?\" He said, \"Well, I did.\" I said, \"Well, you still do.\"\n\nWhat happened was those fish died. I had him go ahead and take them out and bury them which was a chore. At least, he had a front end loader on a tractor, but I'll tell you something. Eighteen months later that pond was in better shape than it was at the time that it died.\n\nHe had more fish growing faster in two years after that fish kill because nature made a correction. Nature got rid of a bunch of those bigger fish which were getting older, and now the younger fish that were there had more room and had more opportunities, and they grew really well.\n\nBy about the third or fourth year, he was pretty happy with it again, but he started to aerate his pond. He bought an aeration system to aerate it, which helped him take care of the water.\n\nLarry asked me to talk about . . . What don't you say something about multiple spawns? There's a myth out there about: will bass only spawn once? There's a myth that says they won't hybridize. Clear that up.\n\nLet me tell you what I know about multiple spawns. Female large mouth bass, as soon as they deposit their eggs and their ovaries are empty, they start to develop eggs for next year, immediately after that. When they go off after they've spawned, they go out and they start to feed and start to redevelop those eggs.\n\nNow, what's really cool, during my electro fishing studies over the years, I would see little bitty bass sometimes in Texas in April, and then by about May they were six or seven inches long but I didn't see any more little bitty bass. June would come around, and I'd see it again. Well, what I began to learn and figured out was - and there's been a couple of university studies that back up what I'm going to tell you - is that largemouth bass have one set of eggs, but they will spawn several times, especially the big fish.\n\nHere's why.\n\nSay, you have a double digit female at 14.7, she's not going to lay all her eggs at the same time because they're not mature at the same time. She wants to lay viable eggs that can be fertilized and carry on the species. All of her eggs don't mature at the same time, so the eggs that are viable doing the first phase of the spawn, she'll lay.\n\nNow, an old, old fish farmer that I met in 1980 told me this, and I've loved it. I've always remembered it, and by golly it's true. He says largemouth bass are going to spawn the first full moon after bull frogs start to croak. I love that.\n\nWell, it just so happens that bull frogs come out of their hibernation phase when the water temperature hits about 58, 59 degrees.\n\nLargemouth bass do spawn in cycles of the full moon, so as soon as that water temperature hits 58-60, you'll see those young buck bass beginning to build their nests, and then when the females are ripe, he'll bump one in there and she'll lay her eggs that are viable. He'll fertilize them sideways. She'll come in; he'll bump her. The eggs will start coming out.\n\nHe'll turn sideways and dispense his milt and fertilize those eggs, and he'll bundle them up in a nest, and then he'll go look for another female. He may get three or four females to spawn in that nest, and then he'll incubate those eggs, and when they hatch, it just so happens we're coming into the second phase or the next phase of the full moon.\n\nThe next line of spawning occurs when those bigger fish that didn't spend all their eggs will come in, and then they'll go again, and they'll spawn a second time. And then, sometimes they'll spawn a third time.\n\nNow, I'm talking about largemouth bass. Different species of fishes have different methods of spawning which leads me to the other question.\n\nLarry said: why don't you talk a little bit about hybridization. Does that occur? Well, one of the things I love. I love God. I love Jesus. I love the plan. I just can't tell you how much fun it is to go out there and observe it and study it. God has a very cool plan when it comes to fish.\n\nTo keep them from hybridizing, he has them spawn at different depths at different temperatures and different zones.\n\nA gizzard shad, for example, spits its eggs out of the vent, and they're fertilized and they wish them luck and they go on. A thread fin shad though spawns at daylight where a gizzard shad may do it in the middle of the afternoon. A thread fin shad will go along the shoreline and stick its eggs on grass so they don't hybridize.\n\nNow, on occasion I do find in managed lakes where there has been some hybridization going on. There's one guy that comes onto my website at pondboss.com who has studied our website, called guys probably for four or five years. Then, he built his own pond, about a quarter of an acre, in his back yard in the city limits of Phoenix, Arizona, the desert. He fills it up with a garden hose coming out of the irrigation ditch, going through the processing plant. He's buying his water to fill up this pond. They do that in the desert.\n\nHis pond is lined and what his thinking was part of what I preach, 90% of the fish live in 10% of the water, and you've got to figure out where they are. Once you find them, then you throw something out and you make them hit. Well, he took that philosophy and says, well, what I'm going to do is get rid of that 90% they don't use. I'm going to make this whole pond totally a habitat for these fish.\n\nWell, he stocked some largemouth bass, some blue gill. He stocked somesmall mouth bass as fingerlings, and one day he sent me an email, and he had a picture of a fish. He said, \"I don't have any idea what this is.\" I emailed him right back. I said, \"Dude, that's a meanmouth bass. That's a cross between a smallmouth and a largemouth.\n\nIn order for fish to hybridize, there's got to be something that happened at that instant in time that brought the habitat, the temperatures, the photo period for those to get together for those fish at the same time.\n\nWhere I see hybridizing occurring naturally on occasion is between sunfish.\n\nIf you're going to see a mean mouth bass, somebody did that in a lab. The hybrid striper, that don't happen out here. That happened in a lab under artificial situations. Nature, for e most part, doesn't allow hybridization because it won't allow that species to carry on as to what it is.\n\nI don't know how long I've talked, but you guys are a great audience. Those are the things that I wanted to cover, but I also wanted to leave some time for you guys to ask some questions.",
  "latent_425": "Ladies and gentlemen, the Roadhouse is proud to welcome a year’s worth of wonderful music cues from around the TV dial. Yes, the problem of so-so shows using classic songs remains endemic, but the sheer volume of TV being made today is its own form of quality control. Just as there are now more great shows to watch than even the paid pros know how to handle, so, too, are series employing songs from a range of eras and genres for a dazzling range of effects. The Leftovers and The Punisher picked songs that subverted audience expectations of what these shows could, or should, be about. Girls and The Young Pope used tracks to create complicated meta-commentary about the stories they’re telling. Insecure and Twin Peaks are so deeply shaped by their soundtracks that it’s hard to think they’d exist without them. Here are ten moments of Must-Hear TV from 2017.\n\nInsecure: “Love Galore” by SZA ft. Travis Scott\n\n“Love Galore” by SZA was playing on last night’s episode of #InsecureHBO pic.twitter.com/PKwqn9dzBm — DAILY SZA (@DailySZA) July 24, 2017\n\nThe music of Los Angeles’s SZA is woven so deeply into Issa Rae’s Insecure that she might as well be a member of the cast. Rae has talked at length about how much the romantic misadventures of her fictionalized self and those chronicled in SZA’s songs have in common, and coached composer and R&B superproducer Raphael Saadiq to use her work as his north star. SZA debuted her song “Quicksand” on the season-two soundtrack, while two more of her compositions, “Supermodel” and “Love Galore,” play during the show. A declined ticket to a SZA concert even features as a plot point. (Note: Do not decline SZA tickets.)\n\nThe post-party, pre-sex-with-her-ex moment in which “Love Galore” plays during the season-two premiere is a comparatively minor moment when stacked up against most of the other songs on this list, but that’s why it works so well. In a few regretful seconds, an entire range of bluster, regret, anger, lust, and love runs through Issa’s mind, as communicated by the song’s lyrics — all of which come bursting out when her ex-boyfriend Lawrence comes by to pick up his mail and winds up having apocalyptically urgent sex with her on the couch a couple of minutes later. There really aren’t “minor moments” as far as our hearts and minds are concerned, and the ongoing synergy between Rae, her music supervisor Kier Lehman, and SZA helps make that fact central to the show.\n\nInsecure is available to stream on HBO.\n\nSuburra: Blood on Rome: “Tarzan Boy” by Baltimora\n\nThe first order of business here is obvious enough: What the hell is Suburra: Blood on Rome? Glad you asked! A lushly filmed, unabashedly passionate Italian crime series from writers Daniele Cesarano and Barbara Petronio, it follows three extremely handsome young men at the margins of organized crime in Rome, thrown together by circumstance as they attempt to profit from a vast land deal in which the government, the Vatican, the local crime lord, various competing gangs, and the Sicilian Mafia all have a stake. (It’s also a prequel to a film called Suburra, but you don’t need to see it to enjoy this thing; I haven’t, and I love the show to pieces.)\n\nOne of its most intriguing subplots centers on Spadino Anacleti, the brash young heir apparent of the Sinti Roma crime family, who are hated and derided as “gypsies” by the city’s ethnic Italian overlords. He’s locked into an arranged marriage with another Sinti crime family, but Angelica, his wide-eyed bride to be, has no idea that he’s secretly gay, a fact his brother and boss will not allow to stand in the way of the impending nuptials.\n\nThe grim black comedy of the whole affair is driven home by this preposterous choice of music, unveiled as Spadino and Angelica road-test the facilities at the reception hall. While they stand silently in a gazebo that emerges from within a ring of fountains like Venus’s half-shell rising from the sea, the larger-than-life camp of Baltimora’s ’80s synth-pop novelty hit “Tarzan Boy” — you know, the one that goes “ohohOH-ahoh-ahohahoh-AH-ohoh-WAH” blares away. The complete and total disconnect between the song and the look of abject misery on Spadino’s face is the single funniest moment in a series that completely eschews the grimdark emotional, sonic, and cinematographic palette of prestige crime series. Don’t miss this one, for real.\n\nSuburra: Blood on Rome is available to stream on Netflix.\n\nMarvel’s The Punisher: “Wish It Was True” by White Buffalo\n\nCountry, I was a soldier for you\n\nI did what you asked me to\n\nIt was wrong, and you knew\n\nCountry, now I’m just a stranger to you\n\nA number, a name, it’s true\n\nThrow me away when you’re through\n\nThe home of the brave and the free, the red white and blue\n\nWell, I wish it was true\n\n“Courtesy of the Red White and Blue” it ain’t. These are the lyrics that play while Frank Castle, the man who will eventually become the killer vigilante called the Punisher, slaughters his way through an enemy stronghold in Afghanistan, grunting and screaming with rage and terror all the while. If you thought this was gonna be Make America Great Again: The Series, think again.\n\nWhether despite or because of the Punisher’s transformation into a symbol of unfettered state violence, showrunner Steve Lightfoot took the opposite tack with his surprisingly sad and thoughtful take on the Marvel antihero. Virtually all of Frank’s enemies are current or ex armed forces or intelligence operatives, who targeted him and his family over his knowledge of, and regret for participating in, an illegal torture and assassination squad funded by CIA-organized heroin smuggling. Even more provocatively, Frank’s emergence as an unstoppable killing machine takes place long before his wife and children’s murders gave him justification. Instead, the pretext is just business as usual for America’s endless war. Juxtaposing Castle’s traumatic berserker attack with outlaw-country artist White Buffalo’s plaintive and passionate antiwar anthem, which takes aim at America’s use of soldiers both on and off the battlefield, is a bold move that makes the show’s jaundiced view of violence unmistakably clear.\n\nFargo: “Prisencolinensinainciusol” by Adriano Celentano\n\nFargo’s critically divisive third season is all about creating a convincing fraud. Its main antagonist, gleefully repulsive British vulture capitalist V.M. Varga (David Thewlis), aims to turn the legitimate business run by Emmit Stussy — “The Parking Lot King of Minnesota” — into a shell corporation for untold billions in ill-gotten cash. Emmit’s sad-sack brother Ray (played, as is Emmit, by Ewan McGregor) simply wants the share of the good life he feels his sibling screwed him out of, and he’s not above a little criminal impersonation to get it. Ray is also in a relationship with ex-con Nikki Swango (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), but since he’s her parole officer, they have to pretend their relationship doesn’t exist. The major exception to that rule involves their side gig: the world of high-stakes competitive bridge, where of course you’ve got to bluff to win. What better musical companion to all this fugazi than a song sung in a totally fake language?\n\nRay and Nikki roll into the biggest match of their career to the scorchin’ ’70s tune “Prisencolinensinainciusol,” written by Italian performer Adriano Celentano to sound like it’s being sung in English despite being complete gibberish. Long beloved of music nerds, the song’s a far cry from the ginormous rock hits that festoon showrunner Noah Hawley and music supervisor Maggie Phillips’s other collaboration this year, Legion, which was to the lineage of British classic rock what Stranger Things is to songs you could find on a Totally ’80s compilation in a thrift-store dollar bin. The relative obscurity, undeniable groove, and underlying thematic resonance work like a charm. It fakes it so real, it is beyond fake.\n\nBillions: “Even the Losers” by Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers\n\nAfter the death of David Bowie, every showrunner and music supervisor worth their salt crammed the Thin White Duke’s music into their series. Death is the cheapest heat there is, dramatically speaking, and even a shoddy use of a late, beloved artist’s music can invest the scene it accompanies with emotional power for the audience. In the case of the climax of “Golden Frog Time,” the pivotal episode of Billions’ stellar second season, something like the reverse is true. Showrunners Brian Koppelman and David Levien and music supervisor Jim Black capped off the series-best hour with Tom Petty’s exuberant celebration of underdog victory months before the singer’s death, unwittingly providing him with a fitting tribute far in advance.\n\n“Even the Losers” is sprinkled throughout the episode’s introductory section, a complex web of flashbacks and time jumps in which billionaire investor Bobby Axelrod (Damian Lewis) plots to destroy the IPO of a juice company funded in part by his nemesis, crusading New York attorney general Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti). The cat-and-mouse game culminates with the successful tanking of the stock via mild poison planted in bottles that Bobby paid various patsies to drink. Defeated and deflated, Chuck shuffles into his bedroom and sits down, back to the camera, sobbing into his hands … until we realize he’s not crying but laughing. He’d seen Bobby’s play coming and lured him into it, collecting evidence against him all the while. “Even the Losers” is the sound of this legal-eagle Ahab catching his white whale and living to dine out on blubber steak for a year. For a show that struggled during its initial season only to find rollicking new life its second time around, it couldn’t be a more appropriate choice.\n\nThe Leftovers: “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Me Now” by David Pomeranz\n\nThe Leftovers’ final season features a plotline in which its protagonist, Nora Durst (Carrie Coon), travels to another dimension to find the family she lost during a semi-apocalyptic supernatural event with the help of rogue physicists she meets with the help of Perfect Strangers’ Cousin Larry. Honestly, nothing else I write in this piece is gonna sound stranger than that, and you’ve got Twin Peaks and The Young Pope coming at you a few paragraphs away. But the willingness of Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta’s science-fictional study of grief to do something as surface-level goofy as making real-life Perfect Strangers actor Mark-Linn Baker play a version of himself who faked his own disappearance because all the other members of the sitcom’s cast disappeared without him is what transformed The Leftovers from an also-ran to an all-timer in the space of three short seasons.\n\nLindelof and music supervisor Liza Richardson went right for the jugular when they used Perfect Strangers’ ebullient theme song “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Me Now” as the opening music for season three’s second episode. Since the premiere skipped the opening titles altogether, this was the first time we were seeing them, and the moment that harmonica hit was as disorienting as the Sudden Departure itself must have been. Each of the season’s remaining episodes used a different opening theme; by the time it actually got around to including Max Richter’s somber instrumental from season one and Iris DeMent’s twangy “Let the Mystery Be” from season two, the formerly familiar songs felt as bizarre as Balki’s theme felt just a few weeks earlier. It’s a funny, fearless, fiendishly clever way to set the tone for a series that never stopped taking bigger and bigger risks.\n\nGirls: “Desperado” by Rihanna\n\nThe more I think about it, the deeper Lena Dunham and music supervisor Manish Raval’s use of Rihanna’s “Desperado” in Girls’ instant-classic episode “American Bitch” gets under my skin. Dunham’s character Hannah Horvath has just endured a crushing encounter with Chuck Palmer (Matthew Rhys), a novelist she idolized until she learns he’d been crossing the lines of sexual consent with young women during a college tour for his latest book. As part of his ploy to put her doubts about him to rest, Chuck reads her a fictionalized version of one such encounter, painting him in an unsympathetic but also non-criminal light. He also gives her a signed copy of Philip Roth’s When She Was Good, the novel whose apocryphal original title the show borrowed for the episode, and which Hannah and Chuck discuss. Then Palmer takes out his penis and places it against Hannah, who suddenly finds herself in the real-life equivalent of one of those stories.\n\nTrue to form, “Desperado” doesn’t just play over the final scene (a surreal shot of a New York City street filled entirely with women, their faces unseen) or the closing credits, but also within the world of the show itself, via a live flute rendition by Palmer’s daughter, who has no idea what her father just did. Out of politeness to the kid, Hannah sits and watches the performance, then watches Palmer watching the performance, as we sit and watch them all. When the song slides from diegetic music to the soundtrack, it’s pure sonic claustrophobia, representative of a world where what’s real is determined by who gets to tell the story.\n\nHalt and Catch Fire: “Solsbury Hill” by Peter Gabriel\n\nSometimes you have to lean into the big of it all, and when that time comes it pays not to have blown your chance already. Soundtracked nostalgia for the ’80s and ’90s has been a growth market for years, and you could easily rattle off a whole list of shows that select the most recognizable pop-rock jams possible. To its eternal credit, Halt and Catch Fire was never that show. This enormously rewarding character study of five men and women alternately competing and working together during the early days of home computers and the internet had the most carefully curated selection of preexisting music from its era on the air, hands down; it never used a Flock of Seagulls “So Far Away” where a Dire Straits “So Far Away” would be subtler, smarter, more specific, and harder to shake.\n\nFor the final scene of their series finale, creators Christopher Cantwell and Christopher C. Rogers and music supervisor Thomas Golubić did something the show’s tech-maverick characters Cameron Howe or Joe MacMillan would love: the exact opposite of anything they’d done before. As Cameron (Mackenzie Davis) and her creative soul mate Donna Emerson (Kerry Bishé) take the first tentative step to working together again, and as the once hard-charging, totally miserable Joe (Lee Pace) settles into a more fulfilling life as a teacher, Halt hits you with freaking “Solsbury Hill” by Peter Gabriel. This song is such a staple of movies and TV shows in need of instant heartwarming that it’s actually a joke. Cantwell, Rogers, & Co. bet on the idea that the sensitivity with which the core characters had been developed over the course of the show’s four seasons would earn the uplift provided by Gabriel’s breakout solo hit, instead of leeching off it. They were right. For me at least, they took a song I’d never cared for and helped me hear it with fresh ears, with my love for Joe, Cameron, Donna, Gordon, and John Bosworth as headphones. It’s now a favorite, and so is Halt, a rare show capable of that kind of musical alchemy.\n\nThe Young Pope: “Sexy and I Know It” by LMFAO\n\n“Sexy and I Know It” is Paolo Sorrentino’s ambitious, emotional, confrontational series about an autocratic American-born pope in miniature. Granted, using LMFAO to represent your drama about faith, loneliness, power, corruption, and lies is a bit, well, counterintuitive, compared to summing up Twin Peaks with a song from the Twin Peaks score. That’s the joke, in part: It’s very stupid, and therefore very funny, to watch the Holy Father dress up for his first address to the College of the Cardinals while Redfoo drawls about wearing a Speedo at the beach so he can work on his ass tan. Girl, look at that body … of Christ?!\n\nBut like so much of The Young Pope, there’s a much deeper and more serious meaning beneath the craziness and camp. To wit, the brand of tyrannical, uncompromising religion the pontiff formerly known as Lenny Belardo (Jude Law) embraces depends on craziness and camp. Look at the obscene decadence of his subsequent entrance to the Sistine Chapel, borne on a litter like an emperor of old. Listen to his megalomaniacal speech, demanding that the Church remake itself in his bizarre and imperious image. Watch how he demands his followers demonstrate their obedience by literally kissing his feet. It’s a contrast to the self-aware silliness of “Sexy and I Know It,” yes, but it’s a contrast achieved by taking that song’s boasts as deadly serious claims to superiority. He’s got passion in his pants and he ain’t afraid to show it. Spiritually speaking, anyway.\n\nTwin Peaks: The Return: “Audrey’s Dance” by Angelo Badalamenti\n\nFrom the Chromatics’ tone-setting Roadhouse performance of “Shadow” to Amanda Seyfried’s top-down, coked-up, blissed-out ride to the Paris Sisters’ “I Love How You Love Me” to the stand-up-and-cheer romance of Otis Redding’s “I’ve Been Loving You Too Long,” David Lynch and Mark Frost’s masterpiece of a return to the strange, sad, surreal world they created way back in 1990 could field a competitive list of the year’s best musical TV moments all by itself. Hell, the all-time great episode “Part 8” alone featured three: Nine Inch Nails’ ferocious performance of “She’s Gone Away,” the atomic explosion of Krzysztof Penderecki’s “Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima,” and the Platters’ rhapsodic “My Prayer.” (Gotta light?) Picking a single winner from a show this thoroughly informed and highlighted by music is a tall order.\n\nBut like the woman for whom the song is named, “Audrey’s Dance” stands out in the crowd. Sonically and dramatically, it’s deployed as an all-in-one summary of everything that made Twin Peaks’ return so thrilling, so confounding, so brilliant.\n\nThe song itself is a return, and a welcome one. It’s an instantly recognizable track from longtime Lynch collaborator Angelo Badalamenti’s score for the original series that hadn’t been heard in the new iteration until its unexpected announcement by the Roadhouse emcee in “Part 16.” It bridges the Audrey we see in The Return — a confused, embittered woman trapped in a loveless marriage, furiously searching for the lover she openly keeps while her murderous son Richard runs amok elsewhere — with the glamorous, precocious bobby-soxer she was back when we first met her. Her dance feels as much like the reemergence of a buried hero and long-lost friend as Dale Cooper’s return to consciousness from within the addlebrained form of “Dougie Jones” earlier in the episode, itself accompanied by the triumphant strains of Badalamenti’s Twin Peaks theme.\n\nYet there’s still something off about it, something that subverts our joy even as it happens, something better suited to the sense of minor-key mystery within the song than even the iconic original dance scene back in the day. Why would the Roadhouse, which had just seen a performance by Eddie freakin’ Vedder, stop everything so this strange woman could have the dance floor to herself? Why does the bar fight over infidelity that breaks out in the middle of the dance seem to shatter the moment, and Audrey’s recovered sense of self, so completely? Why does she suddenly warp into a white room, staring into a mirror in horrified panic?\n\nAfter a seconds-long glimpse of our heroine in that bright limbo, we return to the song played backward by the band as the credits roll. We’re left to contemplate nostalgia, aging, the folly of youth, the regrets of adulthood, the nature of reality, music, magic, and whether the mistakes of the past can ever truly be put right — Twin Peaks: The Return in musical form. No other cue this year was more complex, more resonant, or more intriguing. To quote Audrey herself, God, I love this music. Isn’t it too dreamy?",
  "latent_471": "O Barretão, em Ceará-Mirim, interior do Rio Grande do Norte, foi palco de um dos gols mais bonitos da temporada 2017. O meia Gustavo Scarpa, do Fluminense, viu o goleiro Rafael, do Globo-RN, adiantado e, antes do meio do campo, fez um golaço por cobertura (assista no vídeo acima). Em duelo pela Copa do Brasil, fechou a goleada por 5 a 2 e saiu de campo aplaudido por todos os presentes. O lance vai ficar na memória dos tricolores e também na história do estádio. Literalmente. O clube potiguar vai homenagear o camisa 10 do Tricolor com uma placa, que deverá ser colocada no local nos próximos dias.\n\nA decisão de instalar a placa foi confirmada por Marconi Barretto, presidente de honra do Globo. Será uma ação em conjunto das direções dos clubes.\n\nScarpa ganhou o carinho dos torcedores de Ceará- Mirim (Foto: Edgard Maciel de Sá)\n\n- Foi, literalmente, um gol de placa. Tivemos a ideia em conjunto com a diretoria do Fluminense. Nada mais justo do que colocarmos uma placa no nosso estádio para reverenciar o autor deste belo gol e simbolizar este dia. Queremos instalar o quanto antes. O gol teve repercussão no mundo todo e a homenagem é merecida. Embora tenhamos saído derrotados, o Globo jogou bem e a nossa torcida também teve uma atitude muito bonita ao aplaudi-lo (Scarpa) de pé durante a partida - disse Marconi Barretto.\n\nLogo após o jogo, o Fluminense iniciou uma campanha para que Scarpa concorra ao Prêmio Puskás, da Fifa, que elege o gol mais bonito do ano. Para isso, o camisa 10 do Tricolor precisa ser indicado pela Fifa como um dos 10 finalistas, o que normalmente acontece em novembro. Depois, a escolha é aberta a votação popular.\n\nA partida da noite de quarta-feira foi válida pela primeira fase da Copa do Brasil. Ao deixar o campo, substituído por Pierre, Scarpa foi aplaudido pelos torcedores locais (veja no vídeo abaixo).

  "latent_610": "Rick Santorum may not be the president of the United States, but he’s about to become the king of Hollywood. Or a Dallas-based, Christian version of it, anyway.\n\nThe former Pennsylvania senator has been named CEO of EchoLight Studios, a production company that aims to make “honest, uplifting content” like 2011’s Soul Surfer, only without “water[ing] down the truth.” Hit the jump to learn about Santorum’s new gig, and to watch the trailer for EchoLight’s first theatrical release.\n\nEchoLight and its new CEO are far from the first to try to tap into the Christian movie market. Even the major studios have taken notice; it was Sony’s faith-based division Affirm Films that distributed Soul Surfer. But Santorum believes they still aren’t getting it quite right.\n\nEven in faith-based films, Hollywood tends to water down the truth. Soul Surfer was a good film, but it didn’t accurately portray faith in that young lady’s life and how she overcame what she had to overcome. I don’t want to preach to anybody, I just want to portray faith as it really is, and we’re going to be telling a lot of true-life stories, and we’re going to make them comfortable even for people who are not of faith, because they are honest. That’s the challenge for us, and it’s what Hollywood tends to shy away from.\n\nWhat Santorum hopes to deliver at EchoLight is a set of high-quality productions with “inspirational and uplifting” messages. “Dallas can become the Hollywood of the faith-and-family movie market,” he said. “And the keys are great content and economic success using money from all over to build out the industry and distribute an authentic product truthful to the faith in people’s lives.”\n\nSpecifically, that means movies like EchoLight’s first theatrical release The Redemption of Henry Myers, a Western about a bank robber who’s saved (physically and spiritually) by a kind widow who takes him in. The film is expected to hit sometime this year. Check out the trailer below:\n\nEchoLight’s other upcoming features include Hoovey, a fact-based drama directed by Sean McNamara (Soul Surfer) and starring Patrick Warburton and Lauren Holly; and Seasons of Gray, a dramatic, not-at-all-Andrew-Lloyd-Webber-esque retelling of the Biblical story of Joseph and his coat of many colors.\n\nDiscuss: What do you think of Santorum’s new job?",
  "latent_633": "Mads Nissen, the winner of the 2015 World Press Photo of the Year, is an inspiring individual. His award-winning shot came from a larger series about homophobia in Russia. Here, we present to you a selection from the series as well as an in-depth interview conducted by managing editor Alexander Strecker during the World Press Photo Award Days in Amsterdam.\n\nLC : Let’s begin with the biggest question: can you tell us more about the now famous image?\n\nMN: The image was made in the bedroom of Alex [one of the men in the photo]. It’s part of a larger body of work on homophobia in Russia that I started the work in 2013. At one point during my work, I felt that there was something missing. I realized my work is not about politics or religion, nor this new anti-gay law. It’s just about two humans who are in love with each other. Two humans who are attracted to each other regardless of gender. So, I decided to look for pictures of love.\n\nThis was important, so that the audience could connect with my body of work. In order for them to do that, I needed a picture that worked as a mirror to [the viewer]—the viewer needs a bridge into the work. Often, it’s those intimate moments that create that bridge for the audience to engage more, to see themselves as the persons in the story.\n\nLC: When you made the frame, or when you were looking at it after, did you have any feeling that this was an amazing image, or has that only come afterwards?\n\nMN: When I do stories, I obviously do a lot of research before—a lot of thinking—on the visual style, how to approach, how to convey the particular story. But when I am in the moment, I do not think too much, I just go with my instincts.\n\nIt’s like dancing. If you think too much, there’s no point. Just go with the flow; go with the feeling. That’s what empathy is about. You’re trying to put yourself in the mind of someone else. I’m not gay, but I can relate to being in love, and I can relate to being passionate, and if I’m photographing, say, a funeral, I do the same thing. It’s not my brother’s death, but the pain they’re having and feeling, I can relate to it.\n\nI’m always looking for images that stand out. Not just a documentation of what was happening, but also that have the potential to become a metaphor or a symbol of something bigger. That metaphor can be a universal human feeling—the kind of material from which great novels or poetry or storytelling is made. Things that are larger than the stuff you see in concrete reality…that’s what I’m looking for.\n\nLC: The aesthetic of your winning image is very distinctive, one could even say artful. Can you talk about injecting an artful aesthetic into a photo-documentary context—what does that add to the images’ strength or communicative power?\n\nMN: What I need in these exciting times—filled with so much information—is not more work, but better work—work that touches me more. Often, I see awful stories from around the world, but they don’t touch me. Aesthetics and intimacy are the keys to open those stories; to make people engage with those stories.\n\nI think the lovely thing about photography (when it’s at its best) is that it doesn’t just speak to your brain—it speaks to your heart. There needs to be something for the eye but then hopefully it goes to your guts, to your stomach, and that’s where you really feel it. You don’t even think about it, you just see the image and you respond, instinctively, to its message. And from there it goes up to your brain and you start to think, “How do I feel about this?”\n\nA lot of people want to take the image apart from the storytelling, but for me they’re very connected. As with a written article: if it’s written very, very well, it engages you more and opens you up to the story. I don’t want to take pictures just so people can see how it was. I want to take pictures so people can feel how it was—for me that’s very important.\n\nLC: Stepping away from the work a little bit: you have lived in China, you did this project in Russia, and you work as a newspaper staff photographer. What do you see as the role of the press, specifically the role of photography, within politically repressive societies?\n\nMN: Freedom of the press is a crucial pillar of democracy. If we don’t know what’s happening, how are we to decide on anything? But in all regimes, we see how the government tries to repress the free media. Luckily, there will always be individuals pushing the other way—pushing for more freedom. Once in a while, they break through and then once in a while they’re pushed back—it’s an ongoing struggle.\n\nLC: Russia is more open than China (I think) but I imagine you had to be careful with some of your (homosexual) subjects’ identities? Especially given the hostile environment that you show in your photographs…\n\nMN: In the case of the LGBT communities in Russia, there were always some people who would say, “I prefer not to have my image saved,” and that was something I completely respected. If I do take their image, and it does get published, maybe they will get fired from their job or maybe they will be arrested. It’s a huge responsibility.\n\nLC: So do John and Alex know that their portrait was named the photo of the year?\n\nMN: Oh yeah. One of the first things I did after getting the phone call was to reach out to John and Alex. They were super happy. The whole LGBT community was super happy. If you go onto the Facebook profile of Alex, you can see the image on his wall. It’s great how they are always saying, ” We won,” ” We are exhibiting there.” That’s how I want it to be. It’s not about me. It’s about them, their situation, their story. I’m so happy that they keep the ownership of the story.\n\nStill, I have to be careful: the law is tricky [in Russia]. It says you cannot make propaganda for “non-traditional sexual relationships” to minors. It’s a little bit weak in its description but also so broad. For example, my image will be shown in Russia [Moscow and St. Petersburg as part of the traveling World Press Photo exhibition] but if you’re under 18, you can’t go in. And if you’re a homosexual and have kids, you can’t tell them that it’s OK to be gay. So things are both permissive and restrictive.\n\nLC: You’ve been a staff photographer for a few years while also pursuing personal projects. What’s the relationship between the two like?\n\nMN: I’ve been working as a staff photographer for six years, and in Denmark we don’t have magazines really, so if you want to publish serious documentary photography, it’s in the newspapers. But I work for a great newspaper. It not only respects but even encourages documentary work and long-term projects.\n\nIn addition, my colleagues in the newspaper are some of the brightest minds in my country. Each day, they give me more ideas. When I was working on my project on homophobia in Russia, I could talk with them about it and learn so much. Being with great journalists inspires me so much.\n\nOf course, working at a newspaper, there are also daily assignments: portraits (lots of portraits), press conferences. But that’s fine. As a freelancer, I spent a lot of time worrying about assignments and what was going to happen tomorrow. At the newspaper, I have the chance to just focus on taking pictures.\n\nFundamentally, the daily routine gives me balance. Before, I had been traveling a lot, covering many difficult issues: conflicts and so on. When I was on the road, I had to be sensitive to keeping my internal balance. When I lose that, then maybe I can’t deal with my own emotions. And then I can’t deal with other people’s emotions—and if I can’t deal with their emotions, the pictures will reflect that.\n\nI need to be in balance in order to make pictures that really have the intimacy that I’m looking for. So in that sense, when I’m shooting one of those portraits for the newspapers, it’s totally OK with me. You cannot run a marathon every day. I’d rather do these daily assignments and be shooting every single day than lose my balance. Right now, it’s a great combination. But who knows—maybe in five years I’ll have to find something else.\n\n—Mads Nissen, interviewed by Alexander Strecker\n\nEditors’ Note: You can see more of our favorites from the 2015 World Press Photo Awards in our feature article.\n\nAlso, read Mads Nissen’s acceptance speech from Amsterdam—truly inspiring words from an inspiring young photographer!",
  "latent_752": "It's summer time at the NFL. During the next few weeks, we here at NFL.com will unveil our Most Underrated and Overrated Players of All Time for all 32 teams and allow users to determine their choices as well.\n\nUnderrated\n\nMatt Hasselbeck -- QB, 2001-2010\n\nOver the last decade, Hasselbeck has managed to claw his way onto almost every statistical list that matters for a quarterback. Hasselbeck is 16th in completions, 21st in passing yards and 32nd in passing touchdowns. In passing yards, Hasselbeck is ahead of Troy Aikman, Kurt Warner, Steve Young and Phil Simms. By no means am I saying that Hasselbeck is better than these elite quarterbacks, it's just worth noting that he is ranked ahead of some pretty respected gunslingers. Hasselbeck failed miserably the eye test due to his cautious, boring and even vanilla style of play. Yet despite his lack of ability as an entertainer, he did what was needed and led the Seahawks to their lone Super Bowl appearance. For his role as the quarterback of the greatest Seahawks team of all time, he deserves far more credit than he is given.\n\nSteve Hutchinson -- G, 2001-05\n\nHutchinson and Walter Jones were arguably the greatest blocking duo of all time, as they helped make Shaun Alexander look like a football god. I can see you recoiling in your chair, appalled by the notion that Alexander's infamous 2005 record-setting season was little more than unbelievable blocking. Again, Alexander's numbers dropped by 27.9 yards per game when \"Hutch\" departed. To put the impressive career of Hutchinson into perspective, the man blocked for a 1,000-yard rusher in 11 of his 12 seasons in the league, and the only running back that didn't hit the 1,000 yard mark was Adrian Peterson, who rushed for 970 yards in 2011 (when he suffered a high-ankle sprain for three weeks, and later tore his ACL). If the great people of Seattle chose to retire Walter Jones' jersey, they had better make sure to retire the Hutchinson jersey long before they choose to hang the No. 37 in the stands at CenturyLink Field.\n\nJoey Galloway -- WR, 1995-99\n\nDuring his brief Seahawks career, Galloway amassed the third most touchdown receptions in team history (trailing only Steve Largent and Darrell Jackson). Galloway's best year as a Seahawk occurred during a time in which the Seahawks boasted one of the most explosive passing offenses in the league. Yet due to a poor defense the Seahawks went 8-8 and Galloway's 1,049-yard, 12-touchdown 1998 season isn't as fondly remembered as it should be. While Galloway was with the Seahawks, he was the second-most consistent 1,000-yard reciever in team history, hitting the mark in three of his five seasons, again only trailing Hall of Famer Steve Largent. It should also be taken into consideration that Galloway is one of the few receivers in the last 20 years to succeed in the Pacific Northwest, which has all but become a graveyard where talented receivers go to watch their careers take a dive. T.J. Houshmanzadeh, Jerry Rice, Deion Branch and Braylon Edwards were all more or less put out to pasture when they came to play in Seattle.\n\nLeon Washington -- KR/RB, 2010-12\n\nWashington had the speed and agility of an elite athlete, yet he had an everyman feel to him because he had overcome so much adversity before getting to the Seahawks. While with the Jets, Washington suffered an awful leg injury in 2009 that many thought would end of Washington's days of returning kicks. After barely re-signing with the Jets in 2010, Washington was traded to the Seahawks for a fifth-round pick during the 2010 NFL Draft. In three seasons with the Seahawks, Washington set the record for both career and single-season kick return touchdowns. He was the spark that started many Seattle drives and he added an element of excitement on kick returns that people hadn't seen since the days of Charlie Rogers. Seahawks management should also get a nice pat on the back for this trade, they took two fifth-round picks and managed to swap one for Washington and turn the other into a safety out of Virginia Tech named ...\n\nKam Chancellor -- S, 2010-present\n\nChancellor is the only current Seahawk to be featured on this list. This offseason, the Seahawks chose to lock Chancellor (age 25) up until 2015, Chancellor is only heading into his fourth season in the league and is already one of the most devastating hitters in the game. Chancellor is the unspoken leader amongst the highly talented and ever-so-explosive secondary known as \"The Legion of Boom.\" Chancellor's hectic and powerful style of play bring back memories of what Ronnie Lott and Rodney Harrison used to do to opponents. His larger-than-normal stature and freakish strength should leave receivers feeling uneasy when facing the thought of going over the middle.\n\nOverrated\n\nUnderstand that despite being \"busts,\" Brian Bosworth and Aaron Curry will not be making an appearance on this list because they will forever be known for what they never became.\n\nShawn Springs -- DB, 1997-2003\n\nNever has a player been more revered and well-received for simply being athletic and not actually possessing any true skill for the position that he plays. After he was drafted in 1997, Springs was viewed as the keystone piece of a Seahawks defense that was supposed to be as potent and explosive as the team's offense. The only problem is that the Seahawks defense faltered, ranking 22nd in points allowed in the league. Springs, who had a 40-inch vertical and clocked a 4.35-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine, was an early example that there is more to being an elite player than raw speed and athleticism. The highly touted rookie managed one interception all season as the Seahawks fell to an 8-8 record and missed the playoffs.\n\nJerramy Stevens -- TE, 2002-06\n\nWhen the Seahawks selected Stevens with the 28th overall selection in the 2002 NFL Draft, Seattle fans salivated at his potential. Yet, many of the scouts who saw Stevens' potential also warned about the laundry list of off-the-field issues that seemed to paint a picture of recklessness and immaturity. In five seasons with the Seahawks, Stevens amassed what can only be described as underwhelming and highly mediocre numbers. Prior to Super Bowl XL, Stevens even got into a trash-talking battle with the Pittsburgh Steelers' Joey Porter. Stevens followed up his bold words by dropping four passes, and catching three for a meager 25 yards. Seattleites seem to remember Stevens fondly, when in reality Stevens should be recognized as the law-breaking, pass-dropping oaf that he was... or as Mr. Hope Solo.\n\nJim Zorn -- QB, 1976-1984\n\nZorn is arguably one of the most beloved Seahawks of all time, but for no real particular reason. Seahawks fans (my father included) choose to overlook just how atrocious Zorn was under the helm and revere him regardless. Zorn might have been forced to lead a Seahawks team from the get-go as an expansion team, but in his career as the Seahawks' starter he managed to go 40-60 and threw 30 more interceptions than touchdowns. The Seahawks' roster wasn't a wasteland those years either, as Zorn was either handing the ball off to Sherman Smith or passing it to Steve Largent. It baffles me why a franchise would choose to cherish a man who accomplished so little over the span of nine years. Perhaps it is simply because people don't tend to forget their first.\n\nShaun Alexander -- RB, 2000-07\n\nDespite breaking the NFL single-season record for touchdowns and holding the franchise record for most yards (by about 3,000), Alexander is severely overrated. He was lucky enough to have arguably the greatest blocking duo in NFL history on the left side of his offensive line in Steve Hutchinson and Walter Jones. The year that Hutchinson departed for Minnesota, Alexander's yards per game dropped by 27.9. Mind you that his average number of attempts per game went up by two, so it wasn't as though the Seahawks chose to run the ball less after Hutchinson's departure. Instead, it was the fact that Alexander was unable to run as well with only one Hall of Famer blocking for him. I implore you to go back and use the eye test on Alexander, the majority of his touchdowns came from him striding through gaping holes in the defensive line. Without gaping holes to run through, Alexander's subpar speed and average power weren't enough for him to produce at the same elite level he did with Hutchinson and Jones paving the way for him.\n\nLofa Tatupu -- LB, 2005-10\n\nAt the beginning of his career, Tatupu looked like an All-Pro linebacker that NFL team mistakenly passed over in the draft due to his small size for a middle linebacker. After three consecutive Pro Bowl selections and one All-Pro nod, the Seahawks elected to lock the linebacker down to a six-year $42 million deal in 2008. Tatupu followed up the big contract extension by leading a Seattle defense that ranked 30th in yards and 25th in points allowed in 2008. Tatupu would miss the Pro Bowl that season and was cut in 2011 following two injury-plagued campaigns. Though he had a solid few years with the franchise, too many Seahawks fans still own and wear No. 51 jerseys around town even though there are better past and present Seahawks linebacker jerseys worthy of being worn on Sundays.\n\nFollow Zach Schwartz on Twitter @zachiszach.",

  "latent_1276": "PARIS (AP) — The Yves Saint Laurent fashion house appointed Anthony Vaccarello as creative director of its clothing line on Monday, replacing the departing Hedi Slimane.\n\nThe 36-year-old Belgian, who has designed his own brand since 2009, previously worked at Fendi, and had a three-year stint at Versus Versace, where he was appointed creative director in 2015. Versace confirmed his departure with immediate effect.\n\nVaccarello will present his first collection for Saint Laurent Paris in October at the Paris fashion week.\n\n“Mr. Saint Laurent is a legendary figure for his creativity, style and audacity. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the history of this extraordinary house,” Vaccarello said.\n\nDonatella Versace said she was sorry to see Vaccarello “leave the Versace family. I wish him tremendous success.”\n\nIn a statement Monday, Yves Saint Laurent praised Vaccarello’s “mastering of razor-sharp tailoring techniques” as well as his influences and references which “strongly recall the soul of the maison.”\n\nFriendly and affable in person, Vaccarello has risen quickly up the ranks after putting Gwyneth Paltrow on the cover of Harper’s Bazaar in a leg-revealing photo shoot in 2012, and then being chosen by Donatella Versace to head her little-sister Versus line.\n\nKnown for his sexually bold designs that show off the female form, Vaccarello is a saleable and commercially-minded choice. He is expected to continue the youthful disco-glitter styles that Slimane’s tenure was associated with.\n\nSlimane provoked controversy at the house when he joined in 2012, rebranding YSL ready-to-wear with the new name “Saint Laurent Paris,” and overhauling the label’s image. Gone was the sophisticated look associated with the iconic house founder, and in its place were grunge styles modeled by adolescent-looking super-waif models.\n\nYves Saint Laurent president and CEO Francesca Bellettini is hopeful Vaccarello’s appointment will bring “further success” to the fashion house.\n\n“His modern, pure aesthetic is the perfect fit for the maison,” she said. “Anthony Vaccarello impeccably balances elements of provocative femininity and sharp masculinity in his silhouettes.

  "latent_1378": "ROME (Reuters) - EU patrol vessels in the Mediterranean are putting lives at risk by operating too far from the Libyan coast where migrants are embarking on the perilous voyage to Europe, the head of a rescue charity said on Tuesday.\n\nMigrants try to stay afloat after falling off their rubber dinghy during a rescue operation by the Malta-based NGO Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) ship in the central Mediterranean in international waters some 15 nautical miles off the coast of Zawiya in Libya, April 14, 2017. REUTERS/Darrin Zammit Lupi\n\nGrowing numbers of migrants are attempting the crossing in flimsy, overcrowded boats as the spring weather improves. Nearly 9,000, mostly Africans, were rescued over the long Easter weekend, U.N. aid agencies said.\n\n“Europe needs to rescue people because it cannot allow them to die at its own back door,” said Chris Catrambone, an American businessman who co-founded the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS), with his Italian wife Regina in 2014.\n\nHe was speaking by telephone from the MOAS rescue vessel Phoenix, which after a frantic weekend’s activity was heading slowly toward Sicily with 463 migrants on board, including 170 women and children, and seven dead bodies recovered from the sea.\n\nThe crossing from Libya to Italy is now the main migrant route into Europe. More than 181,000 came to shore in Italy last year, and arrivals this year are up about a third on the same period of 2016.\n\nSome 850 are estimated to have died so far in 2017. That is fuelling a dispute over whether laying on more rescue vessels, and patrolling closer to Libya, is encouraging the flow of migrants and boosting the profits of people-smugglers.\n\nSince Italy abandoned its search-and-rescue mission in 2014, the European Union’s border control agency Frontex has taken over patrolling the Mediterranean, but its ships remain well clear of the Libyan coast.\n\nBoth Frontex and a Sicilian prosecutor have said NGOs should not be working so close to Libya because they make it too easy for migrants to come to Europe, adding that some NGOs may be in contact with smugglers.]\n\nFrontex said on Monday it had rescued more than 1,400 people over the weekend.\n\n“Smugglers are taking advantage of the proximity” of the NGOs by using more unsafe boats and packing them even tighter, the agency said in an email to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nWhile the NGO boats tend to hover just outside of Libyan territorial waters that end 12 nautical miles from the coast, Frontex vessels patrol much further north and can take a half-day or more to reach the boats in distress.\n\nCatrambone said the only question at sea is life or death.\n\n“The priority needs to be saving lives, not patrolling a make-believe border. The further they (Frontex) stay away, the more people will die. Saying there is a pull factor is just ignorance.

Many of the guides I read focused very heavily on the actual code implementations of behaviour trees, or focused purely on the flow of generic contextless nodes without any real applicable examples, with diagrams like so:\n\nWhile they were invaluable in helping me understand the core principles of Behaviour Trees, I found myself in a situation where despite knowing how a behaviour tree operated, I didn't really have any real-world context as to what sort of nodes I should be creating for the game, or what an actual fully developed behaviour tree would look like.\n\nI've spent a ton of time experimenting (for the record since Project Zomboid is in Java I’m using the fantastic JBT - Java Behavior Trees (http://sourceforge.net/projects/jbt/) so didn't have to concern myself with the actual code implementation. However there are plenty of tutorials out there focusing on this, as well as implementations in many commonly used game engines.\n\nIt's possible some of the more specific decorator node types I detail here are actually native to JBT instead of general behaviour tree concepts, but I've found them to be integral to the way PZ behaviour trees work, so they are worth considering for implementation if your particular behaviour tree does not support them.\n\nI’m not professing to be an expert on the subject, however over the development of the Project Zomboid NPCs I’ve found the results I’ve had to be pretty solid, so thought I’d bash out a few things that if I’d known would have made my first attempts go a lot more smoothly, or at least opened my eyes to what I could accomplish with behaviour trees. I’m not going to dig into the implementation but just give a few abstracted examples that were used in Project Zomboid.\n\nBasics\n\nSo the clue is in the name. Unlike a Finite State Machine, or other systems used for AI programming, a behaviour tree is a tree of hierarchical nodes that control the flow of decision making of an AI entity. At the extents of the tree, the leaves, are the actual commands that control the AI entity, and forming the branches are various types of utility nodes that control the AI’s walk down the trees to reach the sequences of commands best suited to the situation.\n\nThe trees can be extremely deep, with nodes calling sub-trees which perform particular functions, allowing for the developer to create libraries of behaviours that can be chained together to provide very convincing AI behaviour. Development is highly iterable, where you can start by forming a basic behaviour, then create new branches to deal with alternate methods of achieving goals, with branches ordered by their desirability, allowing for the AI to have fallback tactics should a particular behaviour fail. This is where they really shine.\n\nData Driven vs Code Driven\n\nThis distinction has little relevance to this guide, however it should be noted that there are many different possible implementations of behaviour trees. A main distinction is whether the trees are defined externally to the codebase, perhaps in XML or a proprietary format and manipulated with an external editor, or whether the structure of the trees is defined directly in code via nested class instances.\n\nJBT uses a strange hybrid of these two, where an editor is provided to allow you to visually construct your behaviour tree, however an exporter command line tool actually generates java code to represent the behaviour trees in the code-base.\n\nWhatever the implementation, the leaf nodes, the nodes that actually do the game specific business and control your character or check the character’s situation or surroundings, are something you need to define yourself in code. Be that in the native language or using a scripting language such as Lua or Python. These can then be leveraged by your trees to provide complex behaviours. It is quite how expressive these nodes can be, sometimes operating more as a standard library to manipulate data within the tree itself, than just simply character commands, that really make behaviour trees exciting to me.\n\nTree Traversal\n\nA core aspect of Behavior Trees is that unlike a method within your codebase, a particular node or branch in the tree may take many ticks of the game to complete. In the basic implementation of behaviour trees, the system will traverse down from the root of the tree every single frame, testing each node down the tree to see which is active, rechecking any nodes along the way, until it reaches the currently active node to tick it again.\n\nThis isn’t a very efficient way to do things, especially when the behaviour tree gets deeper as its developed and expanded during development. I’d say its a must that any behaviour tree you implement should store any currently processing nodes so they can be ticked directly within the behaviour tree engine rather than per tick traversal of the entire tree. Thankfully JBT fits into this category.\n\nFlow\n\nA behaviour tree is made up of several types of nodes, however some core functionality is common to any type of node in a behaviour tree. This is that they can return one of three statuses. (Depending on the implementation of the behaviour tree, there may be more than three return statuses, however I've yet to use one of these in practice and they are not pertinent to any introduction to the subject) The three common statuses are as follows:\n\nSuccess\n\nFailure\n\nRunning\n\nThe first two, as their names suggest, inform their parent that their operation was a success or a failure. The third means that success or failure is not yet determined, and the node is still running. The node will be ticked again next time the tree is ticked, at which point it will again have the opportunity to succeed, fail or continue running.\n\nThis functionality is key to the power of behaviour trees, since it allows a node's processing to persist for many ticks of the game. For example a Walk node would offer up the Running status during the time it attempts to calculate a path, as well as the time it takes the character to walk to the specified location. If the pathfinding failed for whatever reason, or some other complication arisen during the walk to stop the character reaching the target location, then the node returns failure to the parent. If at any point the character's current location equals the target location, then it returns success indicating the Walk command executed successfully.\n\nThis means that this node in isolation has a cast iron contract defined for success and failure, and any tree utilizing this node can be assured of the result it received from this node. These statuses then propagate and define the flow of the tree, to provide a sequence of events and different execution paths down the tree to make sure the AI behaves as desired.\n\nWith this shared functionality in common, there are three main archetypes of behaviour tree node:\n\nComposite\n\nDecorator\n\nLeaf\n\nComposite\n\nA composite node is a node that can have one or more children. They will process one or more of these children in either a first to last sequence or random order depending on the particular composite node in question, and at some stage will consider their processing complete and pass either success or failure to their parent, often determined by the success or failure of the child nodes. During the time they are processing children, they will continue to return Running to the parent.\n\nThe most commonly used composite node is the Sequence, which simply runs each child in sequence, returning failure at the point any of the children fail, and returning success if every child returned a successful status.\n\nDecorator\n\nA decorator node, like a composite node, can have a child node. Unlike a composite node, they can specifically only have a single child. Their function is either to transform the result they receive from their child node's status, to terminate the child, or repeat processing of the child, depending on the type of decorator node.\n\nA commonly used example of a decorator is the Inverter, which will simply invert the result of the child. A child fails and it will return success to its parent, or a child succeeds and it will return failure to the parent.\n\nLeaf\n\nThese are the lowest level node type, and are incapable of having any children.\n\nLeafs are however the most powerful of node types, as these will be defined and implemented by your game to do the game specific or character specific tests or actions required to make your tree actually do useful stuff.\n\nAn example of this, as used above, would be Walk. A Walk leaf node would make a character walk to a specific point on the map, and return success or failure depending on the result.\n\nSince you can define what leaf nodes are yourself (often with very minimal code), they can be very expressive when layered on top of composite and decorators, and allow for you to make pretty powerful behavior trees capable of quite complicated layered and intelligently prioritized behaviour.\n\nIn an analogy of game code, think of composites and decorators as functions, if statements and while loops and other language constructs for defining flow of your code, and leaf nodes as game specific function calls that actually do the business for your AI characters or test their state or situation.\n\nThese nodes can be defined with parameters. For example the Walk leaf node may have a coordinate for the character to walk to.\n\nThese parameters can be taken from variables stored within the context of the AI character processing the tree. So for example a location to walk to could be determined by a 'GetSafeLocation' node, stored in a variable, and then a 'Walk' node could use that variable stored in the context to define the destination. It's through using a shared context between nodes for storing and altering of arbitrary persistent data during processing of a tree that makes behaviour trees immensely powerful.\n\nAnother integral type of Leaf node is one that calls another behaviour tree, passing the existing tree's data context through to the called tree.\n\nThese are key as they allow you to modularise the trees heavily to create behaviour trees that can be reused in countless places, perhaps using a specific variable name within the context to operate on. For example a 'Break into Building' behaviour may expect a 'targetBuilding' variable with which to operate on, so parent trees can set this variable in the context, then call the sub-tree via a sub-tree Leaf node.\n\nComposite Nodes\n\nHere we will talk about the most common composite nodes found within behaviour trees. There are others, but we will cover the basics that should see you on your way to writing some pretty complex behaviour trees in their own right.\n\nSequences\n\nThe simplest composite node found within behaviour trees, their name says it all. A sequence will visit each child in order, starting with the first, and when that succeeds will call the second, and so on down the list of children. If any child fails it will immediately return failure to the parent. If the last child in the sequence succeeds, then the sequence will return success to its parent.\n\nIt's important to make clear that the node types in behaviour trees have quite a wide range of applications. The most obvious usage of sequences is to define a sequence of tasks that must be completed in entirety, and where failure of one means further processing of that sequence of tasks becomes redundant. For example:\n\nThis sequence, as is probably clear, will make the given character walk through a door, closing it behind them. In truth, these nodes would likely be more abstracted and use parameters in a production environment. Walk (location), Open (openable), Walk (location), Close (openable)\n\nThe processing order is thus:\n\nSequence -> Walk to Door (success) -> Sequence (running) -> Open Door (success) -> Sequence (running) -> Walk through Door (success) -> Sequence (running) -> Close Door (success) -> Sequence (success) -> at which point the sequence returns success to its own parent.\n\nIf a character fails to walk to the door, perhaps because the way is blocked, then it is no longer relevant to try opening the door, or walking through it. The sequence returns failure at the moment the walk fails, and the parent of the sequence can then deal with the failure gracefully.\n\nThe fact that sequences naturally lend themselves to sequences of character actions, and since AI behaviour trees tend to suggest this is their only use, it may not be clear that there are several different ways to leverage sequences beyond making a character do a sequential list of 'things'. Consider this:\n\nIn the above example, we have not a list of actions but a list of tests. The child nodes check if the character is hungry, if they have food on their person, if they are in a safe location, and only if all of these return success to the sequence parent, will the character then eat food. Using sequences like this allow you to test one or more conditions before carrying out an action. Analogous to if statements in code, and to an AND gate in circuitry. Since all children need to succeed, and those children could be any combination of composite, decorator or leaf nodes, it allows for pretty powerful conditional checking within your AI brain.\n\nConsider for example the Inverter decorator mentioned in the above section:\n\nFunctionally identical to the previous example, here we show how you can use inverters to negate any test and therefore give you a NOT gate. This means you can drastically cut the amount of nodes you will need for testing the conditions of your character or game world.\n\nSelector\n\nSelectors are the yin to the sequence's yang. Where a sequence is an AND, requiring all children to succeed to return a success, a selector will return a success if any of its children succeed and not process any further children. It will process the first child, and if it fails will process the second, and if that fails will process the third, until a success is reached, at which point it will instantly return success. It will fail if all children fail. This means a selector is analagous with an OR gate, and as a conditional statement can be used to check multiple conditions to see if any one of them is true.\n\nTheir main power comes from their ability to represent multiple different courses of action, in order of priority from most favorable to least favorable, and to return success if it managed to succeed at any course of action. The implications of this are huge, and you can very quickly develop pretty sophisticated AI behaviours through the use of selectors.\n\nLet's revisit our door sequence example from earlier, adding a potential complication to it and a selector to solve it.\n\nYes, here we can deal with locked doors intelligently, with the use of only a handful of new nodes.\n\nSo what happens when this selector is processed?\n\nFirst, it will process the Open Door node. The most preferable cause of action is to simply open the door. No messing. If that succeeds then the selector succeeds, knowing it was a job well done. There's no further need to explore any other child nodes of that selector.\n\nIf, however, the door fails to open because some sod has locked it, then the open door node will fail, passing failure to the parent selector. At this point the selector will try the second node, or the second preferable cause of action, which is to attempt to unlock the door.\n\nHere we've created another sequence (that must be completed in entirety to pass success back to the selector) where we first unlock the door, then attempt to open it.\n\nIf either step of unlocking the door fails (perhaps the AI doesn't have the key, or the required lockpicking skill, or perhaps they managed to pick the lock, but found the door was nailed shut when attempting to open it?) then it will return failure to the selector, which will then try the third course of action, smashing the door off its hinges!\n\nIf the character is not strong enough, then perhaps this fails. In this case there are no more courses of action left, and the the selector will fail, and this will in turn cause the selector's parent sequence to fail, abandoning the attempt to walk through the door.\n\nTo take this a step further, perhaps there is a selector above that which will then choose another course of action based on this sequence's failure?\n\nHere we've expanded the tree with a topmost selector. On the left (most preferable side) we enter through the door, and if that fails we instead try to enter through the window. In truth the actual implementation would likely not look this way and its a bit of a simplification on what we did on Project Zomboid, but it illustrates the point. We’ll get to a more generic and usable implementation later.\n\nIn short, we have here an ‘Enter Building’ behaviour that you can rely on to either get inside the building in question, or to inform its parent that it failed to. Perhaps there are no windows? In this case the topmost selector will fail, and perhaps a parent selector will tell the AI to head to another building?\n\nA key factor in behaviour trees that has simplified AI development a huge deal for myself over previous attempts is that failure is no longer a critical full stop on whatever I’m trying to do (uhoh, the pathfind failed, WHAT NOW?), but just a natural and expected part of the decision making process that fits naturally in the paradigm of the AI system.\n\nYou can layer failsafes and alternate courses of action for every possible situation. An example with Project Zomboid would be the EnsureItemInInventory behaviour.\n\nThis behaviour takes in an inventory item type, and uses a selector to determine from several courses of action to ensure an item is in the NPC's inventory, including recursive calls to the same behaviour with different item parameters.\n\nFirst it'll check if the item is already in the character's main top level inventory. This is the ideal situation as nothing needs to be done. If it is, then the selector succeeds and thus the entire behaviour succeeds. EnsureItemInInventory has succeeded, and the item is there for use.\n\nIf the item is not in the character's inventory, then they will check the contents of any bags or backpacks the character is carrying. If the item is found, then they will transfer the item from the bag into his top level inventory. This will then succeed, as the success criteria is met.\n\nIf THIS fails, then a third branch of the selector will determine of the item is located in the building the character is currently residing in. If it is, then the character will travel to the location of the container holding the item and take it from the container. Again the criteria is met, so success!\n\nIf THIS fails, then there is one more trick up the NPCs sleeve. It will then iterate a list of crafting recipes that result in the item they desire, and for each of these recipes it will iterate through each ingredient item, and will recursively call the EnsureItemInInventory behaviour for each of those items in turn. If each of these succeeds, then we know for a fact that the NPC now carries every ingredient required to craft their desired item. The character will then craft the item from those ingredients, before returning success as the criteria of having the item is met.\n\nIf THIS fails, then the EnsureItemInInventory behaviour will fail, with no more fallbacks, and the NPC will just add that item to a list of desired items to look out for during looting missions and live without the item.\n\nThe result of this is that the NPC is suddenly capable of crafting any item in the game they desire if they have the ingredients required, or those ingredients can be obtained from the building.\n\nDue to the recursive nature of the behaviour, if they don't have the ingredients themselves, then they will even attempt to craft them from even baser level ingredients, hunting the building if necessary, crafting multiple stages of items to be able to craft the item they actually need.\n\nSuddenly we have a quite complicated and impressive looking AI behaviour that actually boils down to relatively simple nodes layered on top of each other. The EnsureItemInInventory behaviour can then be used liberally throughout many other trees, whenever we need an NPC to ensure they have an item in their inventory.\n\nI'm sure at some point during development we'll continue this further with another fallback, and allow the NPCs to actually go out specifically in search of items they critically desire, choosing a looting target that has the highest chance of containing that item.\n\nAnother failsafe that could be higher in the priority list may be to consider other items which may accomplish the same goal as the selected item. If one day we finally code in support for makeshift tools, then looking for less effective alternatives and hammering a nail in with a rock may trump sneaking across town into a zombie infested hardware store.\n\nDue to the ease of extending the trees during development, its easy to create a simple behaviour that 'does the job', and then iteratively improve that NPC behaviour with extra branches via a selector to cater for more solid failsafes and fallbacks to reduce the likelihood of the behaviour failing. The crafting fallback was added much later down the line, and just goes to further equip NPCs with behaviours to further aid them in achieving their goals.\n\nFurthermore if prioritized carefully, these fallbacks, despite being essentially scripted behaviours, bestow the appearance of intelligent problem solving and natural decision making to the AI character.\n\nRandom Selectors / Sequences\n\nI’m not going to dwell on these, as their behaviour will be obvious given the previous sections. Random sequences/selectors work identically to their namesakes, except the actual order the child nodes are processed is determined randomly. These can be used to add more unpredictability to an AI character in cases where there isn’t a clear preferable order of execution of possible courses of action.\n\nDecorator Nodes\n\nInverter\n\nWe’ve already covered this one. Simply put they will invert or negate the result of their child node. Success becomes failure, and failure becomes success. They are most often used in conditional tests.\n\nSucceeder\n\nA succeeder will always return success, irrespective of what the child node actually returned. These are useful in cases where you want to process a branch of a tree where a failure is expected or anticipated, but you don’t want to abandon processing of a sequence that branch sits on. The opposite of this type of node is not required, as an inverter will turn a succeeder into a ‘failer’ if a failure is required for the parent.\n\nRepeater\n\nA repeater will reprocess its child node each time its child returns a result. These are often used at the very base of the tree, to make the tree to run continuously. Repeaters may optionally run their children a set number of times before returning to their parent.\n\nRepeat Until Fail\n\nLike a repeater, these decorators will continue to reprocess their child. That is until the child finally returns a failure, at which point the repeater will return success to its parent.\n\nData Context\n\nThe specifics of this are down to the actual implementation of the behaviour tree, the programming language used, and all manner of other things, so we’ll keep this all rather abstract and conceptual.\n\nWhen a behaviour tree is called on an AI entity, a data context is also created which acts as a storage for arbitrary variables that are interpreted and altered by the nodes (using string/object pair in a C# Dictionary or java HashMap, probably a C++ string/void* STL map, though its a long time since I've used C++ so there are probably better ways to handle this)\n\nNodes will be able to read or write into variables to provide nodes processed later with contextual data and allow the behaviour tree to act as a cohesive unit. As soon as you start exploiting this heavily, the flexibility and scope of behaviour trees becomes very impressive, and the true power at your fingertips becomes apparent. We’ll get to this in a while when we revisit our doors and windows behaviour.\n\nDefining Leaf Nodes\n\nAgain, the specifics of this are down to the actual implementation of the behaviour tree. In order to provide functionality to leaf nodes, to allow for game specific functionality to be added into behaviour trees, most systems have two functions that will need to be implemented.\n\ninit - Called the first time a node is visited by its parent during its parents execution. For example a sequence will call this when its the node’s turn to be processed. It will not be called again until the next time the parent node is fired after the parent has finished processing and returned a result to its parent. This function is used to initialise the node and start the action the node represents. Using our walk example, it will retrieve the parameters and perhaps initiate the pathfinding job.\n\nprocess - This is called every tick of the behaviour tree while the node is processing. If this function returns Success or Failure, then its processing will end and the result passed to its parent. If it returns Running it will be reprocessed next tick, and again and again until it returns a Success or Failure. In the Walk example, it will return Running until the pathfinding either succeeds or fails.\n\nNodes can have properties associated with them, that may be explicitly passed literal parameters, or references to variables within the data context of the AI entity being controlled.\n\nI’m not going to go into the specifics of implementation, as this is not only language dependent but also behaviour tree implementation dependent, but the concept of parameters and storage of arbitrary data within the behaviour tree instance are fairly universal.\n\nSo for example, we may describe a Walk node as such:\n\nWalk (character, destination)\n\n- success: Reached destination\n\n- failure: Failed to reach destination\n\n- running: En route\n\nIn this case Walk has two parameters, the character and the destination. While it may seem natural to always assume that the character who is running the AI behaviour is the subject of a node and therefore would not need to be passed explicitly as a parameter, it’s best not to make this assumption, despite ‘Walk’ being a pretty safe bet. As too many times, particularly on conditional nodes, I’ve found myself having to recode nodes to cater for testing another characters state or interacting with them in some way. It’s always best to go the extra mile and pass the character the command applies to even if you’re fairly sure that only the AI running the behaviour would require it.\n\nThe passed location, as stated earlier, could be inputted manually with X, Y, Z coordinates. But more likely, the location would be stored in the context as a variable by another node, obtaining the location of some game object, or building, or perhaps calculating a safe place in cover in the NPCs vicinity.\n\nStacks\n\nWhen first looking into behaviour trees, its natural to constrain the scope of the nodes they use to character actions, or conditional tests about the character or their environment. With this limitation it’s sometimes difficult to see how powerful behaviour trees are.\n\nIt’s when it occurred to me to implement stack operations as nodes that their utility really became apparent to me. So I added the following node implementations to the game:\n\nPushToStack(item, stackVar)\n\nPopFromStack(stack, itemVar)\n\nIsEmpty(stack)\n\nThat’s it, just these three nodes. All they needed was init/process functions implemented to create and modify a standard library stack object with just a few lines of code, and they open up a whole host of possibilities.\n\nFor example PushToStack creates a new stack if one doesn’t exist, and stores it in the passed variable name, and then pushes ‘item’ object onto it.\n\nSimilarly pop pops an item off the stack, and stores it in the itemVar variable, failing if the stack is already empty, and IsEmpty checks if the stack passed is empty and returns success if it is, and failure if its not.\n\nWith these nodes, we now have the capacity to iterate through a stack of objects like this:\n\nUsing an Until Fail repeater, we can repeatedly pop an item from the stack and operate on it, until the point the stack is empty, at which point PopFromStack will return a fail and exit out of the Until Fail repeater.\n\nNext, a couple of other vital utility nodes that I use regularly:\n\nSetVariable(varName, object)\n\nIsNull(object)\n\nThese allow us to set arbitrary variables throughout the behaviour tree in circumstances where the composites and decorators don’t allow us enough granularity to get information up the tree we require. We’ll hit a situation like this in a moment, though I don’t doubt there’s a way to organize it so it’s not required.\n\nNow supposing we added a node called GetDoorStackFromBuilding, where you passed a building object and it retrieved a list of exterior door objects in that building, newing and filling a Stack with the objects and setting the target variable. What could we do then using the things we’ve detailed above?\n\nEek. This has gotten a little more complicated, and at first glance it may seem a bit difficult to ascertain what’s going on, but like any language eventually it becomes easier to read at a glance, and what you lose in readability you gain in flexibility.\n\nSo what does this do? Well it may be a little bit of a head mangler at first, but once you become familiar with the way the nodes operate and how the successes and failures transverse the tree, it becomes a lot easier to visualise. If necessary I may expand this section to show the walk through the tree, if my description proves insufficient.\n\nIn short, it is a behaviour that will retrieve and then try to enter every single door into a building, and return success if the character succeeded in getting in any of the doors, and it will return failure if they did not.\n\nFirst up it grabs a stack containing every doorway into the building. Then it calls the Until Fail repeater node which will continue to reprocess its child until its child returns a failure.\n\nThat child, a sequence, will first pop a door from the stack, storing it in the door variable.\n\nIf the stack is empty because there are no doors, then this node will fail and break out of the Until Fail repeater with a success (Until Fail always succeeds), to continue the parent sequence, where we have an inverted IsNull check on ‘usedDoor’. This will fail if the usedDoor is null (which it will be, since it never got chance to set that variable), and this will cause the entire behaviour to fail.\n\nIf the stack does manage to grab a door, it then calls another sequence (with an inverter) which will attempt to walk to the door, open it and walk through it.\n\nIf the NPC fails to get through the door by any means available to him (the door is locked, and the NPC is too weak to break it down), then the selector will fail, and will return fail to the parent, which is the Inverter, which inverts the failure into a success, which means it doesn't escape the Until Fail repeater, which in turn repeats and freshly re-calls its child sequence to pop the next door from the stack and the NPC will try the next door.\n\nIf the NPC succeeds in getting through a door, then it will set that door in the ‘usedDoor’ variable, at which point the sequence will return success. This success will be inverted into a failure so we can escape the Until Fail repeater.\n\nIn this circumstance, we then fail in the IsNull check on usedDoor, since it’s not null. This is inverted into a success, which causes the entire behaviour to succeed. The parent knows the NPC successfully found a door and got through it into the building.\n\nIf it failed, the same process could be repeated with a GetWindowStackFromBuilding node, to repeat the process with windows. Or with a little stack manipulation with a few more nodes, perhaps you could call GetDoorStackFromBuilding and GetWindowStackFromBuilding immediately after eachother, and append the windows to the end of the door stack, and process all of them in the same Until Fail, assuming that Open, Unlock, Smash, Close operated on a generic base of doors and windows, or run-time type checked the object they were operating on.\n\nFinally, you may notice I’ve added a Succeeder decorator parenting the close door node. This is because it occurred to me that if an NPC smashed the door, they would no doubt fail to close it.\n\nWithout the succeeder this would cause the sequence to fail before the usedDoor variable was set and move onto the next door. An alternate solution would be for Close Door to be designed to always succeed even if the door was smashed. However, we want to retain the ability to test success of closing a door (for example using the node within a ‘Secure Safehouse’ behaviour would deem a failure to close the door because it's no longer on its hinges as pretty pertinent to the situation!), so a Succeeder can ensure that the failure is ignored if that behaviour is required.",

Резиденты территории опережающего социально-экономического развития, осуществляющие функции работодателя, привлекают и используют иностранных граждан для осуществления трудовой деятельности на территории опережающего социально-экономического развития в порядке и на условиях, которые предусмотрены для соответствующих категорий иностранных граждан Федеральным законом от 25 июля 2002 года N 115-ФЗ \"О правовом положении иностранных граждан в Российской Федерации\", при этом:1) получение разрешений на привлечение и использование иностранных работников не требуется;\n\n2) приглашения на въезд в Российскую Федерацию в целях осуществления трудовой деятельности, а также разрешения на работу иностранным гражданам на территории опережающего социально-экономического развития выдаются без учета квот на их выдачу, установленных Правительством Российской Федерации в соответствии с Федеральным законом от 25 июля 2002 года N 115-ФЗ \"О правовом положении иностранных граждан в Российской Федерации\".\n\nСтатья 27.\n\nОсобенности изъятия земельных участков и (или) расположенных на них объектов недвижимого имущества, иного имущества для размещения объектов, необходимых для создания инфраструктуры территорий опережающего социально-экономического развития\n\n1.

  "latent_1952": "Russia is in dire economic straits.\n\nAmid a crashing ruble and shaken markets due to global sanctions over Russian president Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea, wages have stagnated and many normal Russians have sought new and often less-than-moral methods of earning a living.\n\nRansomware as a Service (RaaS) has increasingly become one of these dubious and criminal methods. Ransomware, or software which locks data and operating systems while demanding often exorbitant payouts, has targeted more and more corporations and individuals despite all attempts by cybersecurity firms to stop its advance.\n\nOver the past several months, new and unique variants of ransomware have made their debut. In March, the Russian ransomware software Petya was shown to encrypt entire hard drives rather than individual files. And days ago, Microsoft warned of self-reproducing ransomware which is able to move from one computer to another via flash drives and network drives.\n\nA new report by data intelligence firm Flashpoint details an organized Russian ransomware campaign which has targeted thousands of Westerners and Western companies. The campaign, which has netted ringleaders exorbitant salaries - 13x the salary of the average Russian - has targeted thousands of systems across the Western world, from hospital data sets to the computers of unsuspecting end users.\n\nAccording to Flashpoint, Russian ransomware bosses reached out to low level cyber-criminals on the deep web, offering lots of money for just a little work. The following message was distributed to forums and users across the deep web by members of the Russian digital underground:\n\nGood day, This offer is for those who want to earn a lot of money via, shall we say, not a very righteous path. No fees or advance payments from you are required, only a large and pure desire to make money in your free time. I propose mutually beneficial cooperation in the sphere of distribution of my software. It is desirable, of course, that you have already had some minimal experience in this business. But if you have no experience, it is not a problem. In addition to the file, you will receive detailed instructions on how and what to do - even a schoolboy could do it; you need only time and desire. The scheme is simple, and tested and working 100%, revenue yields are decent. Thus, you are not risking anything in particular (money being the most important), and are getting valuable experience, and if you succeed - a good cash reward. At the same time, you do not need to bother looking or work ideas, encryption software, nor for receipts and processing of payments. Details - for all correspondence, write in this topic or personal message or Jabber.\n\nAfter affiliates are targeted and agree to participate in the ransomware campaign, they can immediately begin distributing the software via several means, including botnet installs, email and social media spam, compromising dedicated servers, and distribution via torrent and file-sharing websites.\n\nAccording to Flashpoint, the Russian ransomware campaign they uncovered does not utilize a command-and-control infrastructure. Rather, it utilizes custom ransomware that encrypts the files on the infected machine and drops a text file containing an email address that the victim needs to reach out to obtain a decryption key to retrieve the encrypted data.\n\nRansomware bosses handle the legwork of collecting the payments and decrypting the files, and as a result, keep roughly 60% of the ransom paid. In several cases, bosses skimmed off the top, refusing to unlock software and data until the victim paid an additional ransom directly to the boss.\n\nRansomware bosses collected payments via Bitcoins, then laundered the money and distributed 40% of the ransom to affiliates from an unattributable clean Bitcoin wallet.\n\nAccording to Flashpoint, this ransomware campaign - and its Russian ringleader - has been active since at least 2012. Metrics collected on activity of the ransomware campaign showed motivation behind the campaign, as well as the most likely times individuals are targeted, which correlates to sleep/wake cycles and indicates the campaign's national origins.\n\n“Ransomware is clearly paying for Russian cybercriminals. As Ransomware as a Service campaigns become more wide-spread and accessible to even low-level cybercriminals, such attacks may result in difficult situations for individuals and corporations not yet ready to deal with these new waves of attacks,” said Vitali Kremez, Flashpoint's Cybercrime Intelligence Analyst. \"As a result of their participation in such campaigns, low level Russian cybercriminals gained a fruitful understanding of the inner workings of ransomware campaigns. It is not particularly hard for newcomers to start spreading ransomware quickly and attack corporations and individuals.\"\n\nBut despite the common perception that these ransomware campaigns fund a lavish life of mink coats and summers in Sochi, such campaigns are borne out of economic distress, and provide only a slight respite from the harsh financial prospects of Russian life.\n\nFlashpoint found that while the ransomware boss in this campaign earned 13x the salary of the average Russian, that figure only amounted to $90,000 a year, or around $7,500 a month.\n\nAnd yet even here, there is honor among thieves.\n\nFor example, Eastern European cybercriminals are generally prohibited by an unwritten moral code of conduct from targeting other citizens of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), an organization of former Soviet Socialist Republics which formed in the aftermath of the Soviet Union's collapse. This is due in part to lack of financial benefit from targeting members of developing nations, but also because it is more morally palatable to target a transcontinental audience.\n\nStill, many members of Eastern Europe's underground cybercrime community on the deep web expressed discontent at some of the larger and more high-profile ransomware actions which targeted civil institutions.\n\nWhen Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital in Los Angeles, California faced a ransomware attack in February, members of Russian cybercrime forums revealed their dismay at the target. According to Flashpoint's analysis of such forums, \"Eastern European cybercriminals reacted coldly to the news of the attack against Hollywood Presbyterian which was regarded as a reckless and unacceptable move.\"\n\n\"With the exception of a handful of supporters, the general consensus within this segment of the underground was highly negative, condemning the unknown assailants.\"\n\nOne reputable, high-profile member of a Russian cybercrime forum spoke out against the incident:\n\n\"From the bottom of my heart I sincerely wish that the mothers of all ransomware distributors end up in the hospital, and that the computer responsible for the resuscitation machine gets infected with it,\" the user said.\n\n\"From the bottom of my heart I sincerely wish that the mothers of all ransomware distributors end up in the hospital\" Other users showed immediate support, expressing similar dismay at the target of the attack.\n\n\"Dirt bags, the move is completely unethical. Do not touch hospitals!\"\n\nA 'notorious ransomware developer' also commented on the issue, saying he believes this attack means there will be more high-profile attacks in the future targeting similar institutions.\n\n\"I'm afraid it is [a pre-cursor to future operations]. They scored. It means everything was done properly.\"\n\nOn the deep web marketplace AlphaBay, users immediately flooded to talk pages to discuss the attack. One user took the news event as opportunity to sell his \"easy-to-use\" ransomware program.\n\n\"What if you was that hacker? I bet he was just a 16 years old kid in the right place at the right time. Just like you are now. The only things you need are a computer and the ability to follow clear instructions. If you can do that you will never have to worry about your finances again.\"\n\nFlashpoint says their findings dispute the common perceptions of cybercriminals as being larger-than-life, smart, well off, unreachable, undoxable, and unstoppable. The study also reveals that ransomware is still an ethical dilemma for top-tier cybercriminals, at least until the right opportunity knocks.",
  "latent_2058": "After decades of stymied progress and nine years of targeted diplomatic efforts, on December 12, 2015, 195 countries signed a landmark agreement to lower global greenhouse gas emissions in an attempt to protect the planet from the worst impacts of climate change. A little over a year later, a drooling conspiracy theorist and his white supremacist babysitter are on track to cripple this progress in the name of breathtaking greed and stupidity.\n\nThe New York Times reports that the White House is “fiercely divided” over whether to adhere to Trump’s campaign promise to “cancel” the Paris Climate Agreement, with officials telling the Times that senior advisor Steve Bannon is pitted against Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Ivanka Trump, who are arguing against pulling the U.S. out of the accord. Tillerson, however, runs an agency that the Trump administration seems to view as unnecessary, and Ivanka Trump has no official role in the administration, while Bannon is arguably Trump’s most influential advisor. In January, EPA transition team head Myron Ebell told reporters that “Trump has made it clear he will withdraw from the Paris Agreement.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEbell, Trump’s EPA pick Scott Pruitt, and a number of other staffers and advisors on the Trump EPA transition team—Thomas J. Pyle, David Schnare, and David Kreutzer, to name a few—are all affiliated with groups supported by Koch Industries, which has worked for decades to generate political opposition against environmental regulations that threaten their bottom line.\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nWhile the president cannot, as Mr. Trump suggested, unilaterally undo a 194-nation accord that has already been legally ratified, he could initiate the four-year process to withdraw the world’s largest economy and second-largest climate polluter from the first worldwide deal to tackle global warming. Such a move would rend a global deal that has been hailed as historic, throwing into question the fate of global climate policy and, diplomats say, the credibility of the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Obama pledged to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025, a mark that, according to researchers, we were already potentially going to miss by nearly a billion metric tons of greenhouse gases. The Trump administration, I probably don’t need to remind you, is considering cutting the EPA staff by one-fifth, eliminating thousands of jobs and dozens of programs, particularly those related to climate change—but also cleanup projects and air and water pollution programs. Trump also recently signed an executive order aimed at rolling back Obama’s Clean Water Rule, which he described as “horrible, horrible.”\n\nThe Times reports that one option on the table is to make Congress do the Trump administration’s dirty work by declaring the Paris Agreement a treaty that requires ratification. Obama didn’t do this because our Republican-controlled Congress would absolutely not vote to ratify—and considering Mitch McConnell wouldn’t recognize a responsible decision if it stabbed him repeatedly in the gullet, it seems likely that no matter what happens, the only people who will benefit from the Trump administration’s environmental policies are the energy industry billionaires with enough cash to shoot themselves out into space once the planet they’ve ruined is no longer inhabitable.",
  "latent_2082": "Seven years ago, I flew business class on Qantas from Australia to California, a thirteen-hour trip. I hadn’t had much experience outside economy, but I didn’t want to look like a front-of-the-plane rookie, so I stowed my “amenity kit” without ripping it open, declined the first cocktail a flight attendant offered me, and tried to appear engrossed in a book while the passenger nearest me bounced around like a four-year-old at a birthday party. I didn’t begin to play with my own seat until after dinner, when I lowered it into its fully extended position, and stretched out—not to sleep, which is something I hardly ever manage on airplanes, but to see how the thing worked. The concave back of the seat shell formed a domed enclosure over my head, like a demi-cocoon. Suddenly, I heard people speaking in loud voices and banging things around. I sat up, indignant—and realized that the noise was the sound of breakfast being served. I’d slept for eight hours straight, something I never do even at home. In a little while, we began our descent into Los Angeles. In the early nineties, the best seats on airplanes were still just seats, even if they reclined almost all the way back. Then, in 1995, in first class on some long flights, British Airways introduced seats that turned into fully flat beds, and within a relatively short period airborne sleeping became a potent competitive weapon. The carriers that fly the wealthiest passengers on the longest routes have been especially aggressive about adding comforts, in both first and business (while also often shrinking the seats in economy and squeezing them closer together). A first-class passenger on the upper deck of some Lufthansa 747s gets to hop back and forth between a reclining seat and an adjacent full-length bed. On some of Singapore Airlines’ A380s, a couple travelling in first can combine two “suites” to create an enclosed private room with a double bed and sliding doors. On some flights on Emirates, first-class passengers who make a mess of the treats in their personal minibar can tidy up with a shower before they land. The modern aircraft-seating industry is highly specialized. The number of manufacturers is small, in part because creating new seats is so complex that moving from conception to installation takes years and entails large financial risks. It also poses unique design challenges, since a premium-class seat has to create an impression of opulence in what is actually a noisy and potentially nausea-inducing metal tube filled with strangers. If you checked into a luxury hotel and were taken to a room the size of a first-class airplane cabin, and told that you’d be sharing it with eleven people you didn’t know, all of whom would be sleeping within a few feet of your own skinny bed, you wouldn’t be thrilled, especially if you were paying twenty thousand dollars for the experience. Yet it’s not unheard of for people who travel long distances in really good seats to remember the flight as one of the best parts of their trip. Making them feel that way requires a particular kind of design and engineering skill, along with what amounts, almost, to psychological sleight of hand.\n\nIn March, TheDesignAir, an air-travel Web site, published its second annual ranking of the best international business classes. The winning airline was Singapore, and the runner-up was Cathay Pacific, which is based in Hong Kong. One interesting fact about Singapore and Cathay is that they held the same positions on last year’s list, though in the other order. Another is that the business-class seats on both were created by the same design firm: James Park Associates, whose main office occupies three rooms in a building on Worship Street, in Shoreditch, in East London. Just inside the largest room is a worktable surrounded on three sides by IKEA bookcases filled with fabric swatches, carpet samples, and plastic bags containing pajamas, robes, and other “soft goods” that J.P.A. created for first-class cabins on Air China. In the main part of the room, two dozen designers work shoulder-to-shoulder at computers on two long tables. James Park, the firm’s founder and principal, is sixty-seven years old, and when he’s wearing his glasses he looks a little like the poet Philip Larkin. He earned a degree in architecture in 1974 at London’s Architectural Association, whose other alumni include Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas, and Richard Rogers. His first job after graduation was with the Louis de Soissons Partnership, a distinguished architectural practice. When that firm moved out of London, he left and took what he assumed would be a stopgap job: helping to restore and design vintage railway carriages for the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, a luxury private-train service. “The train project became much more involving and much more enjoyable than I’d thought it would,” Park told me recently, as we sat at a big table in the firm’s conference room. “There was a lot of marquetry and very high-quality finishes in the interiors.” There was also the challenge of fitting things together in a way that would allow the wooden panels to move without splitting or cracking. “That’s a tricky problem, because a train car is moving all the time, and it isn’t a completely rigid object,” he said. “It also contracts and expands—say, as it goes up into the mountains and then comes down to Venice in the summer.” One of the old train cars was so badly corroded that it couldn’t be salvaged. Park cut it in half, and studied, in cross-section, the way the interior had been assembled—a technique that he and his colleagues adopted, and called “loose-fit technology.” To explain, he took my pen and a piece of scrap paper, and sketched the profile of a train car sliced vertically, across its width: ceiling, frieze, raised panel, heater grille, skirting, floor—all made of wood. The parts fit together in a way that allowed them to move on their anchors, he said, and each panel was secured by a horizontal piece, which was screwed in place. “If you simply removed that one piece, you could dismantle the whole thing, because it was all interlocking,” he said. “All you needed was a screwdriver.” That train restoration led to others. Then, in the early nineteen-nineties, Singapore Airlines invited J.P.A. to compete for the job of reconceiving the first-class cabins on its Boeing 747s. “They were interested in us because of the trains, because we’d shown we were good at dealing with small spaces,” Park said. He quickly decided that aviation seating had changed little in decades, and that even in first class the ambience was coldly utilitarian. The seats were large, and they reclined, but they looked more like dentist’s chairs than like luxury furniture. “We decided to try to do something about the way the elements were put together and presented, to make them more comfortable, and to provide more of a club atmosphere,” he said. The interiors that Park created for the Orient-Express trains resemble rolling versions of Downton Abbey, but achieving that effect while satisfying late-twentieth-century safety regulations required lots of modern technology. All of Park’s “loose-fit” woodwork had to be anchored securely enough to remain intact after a train wreck, and it had to be impregnated with a flame-retardant chemical and finished not with ordinary varnishes or paints but with what are known as “intumescent” coatings, which foam up when they’re exposed to high heat, forming an insulating layer that prevents the underlying wood from igniting. Airplane interiors are even more tightly regulated. Nearly every element undergoes a safety-enhancing process called “delethalization”: seats have to withstand an impact equal to sixteen times the force of gravity, and to remain in place when they do, so that they don’t block exit routes or crush anyone, and they can’t burst into flames or release toxic gases when they get hot. Doing something as simple as slightly increasing the thickness of the padding in a seat cushion can necessitate a new round of testing and certification, because a more resilient seat could make a passenger bounce farther after an impact, increasing the risk of injury caused by turbulence or a hard landing. Delethalizing some premium-class seats—in which a passenger’s head and torso have a lot of room to accelerate before being stopped by something solid—requires the addition of a feature that many passengers don’t even realize is there: an air bag concealed in the seat belt. In economy, the tight spacing of the seats makes air bags mostly unnecessary. But seat-back video screens and the hard frames that surround them pose a safety challenge, partly because of the potential for injuries caused by head strikes, and partly because the computers and the electrical systems that serve them have to be both fireproof and fully isolated from the plane’s—so that crossed wires in somebody’s seat don’t allow a ten-year-old playing a video game to suddenly take control of the cockpit. Largely as a result, in-flight entertainment systems are almost unbelievably expensive. The rule of thumb, I was told, is “a thousand dollars an inch”—meaning that the small screen in the back of each economy seat can cost an airline ten thousand dollars, plus a few thousand for its handheld controller. At the same time, nearly every surface on an airline seat has to be easily replaceable during the brief interval between landing and takeoff, so that if a passenger spills a glass of red wine the seat won’t have to be kept vacant for the following flight: a lost fare. No design change is made casually, because even small ones can affect operating costs. Gulf Air, which is based in Bahrain, reduced its annual fuel bill by a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a few years ago by using slightly thinner leather in the upholstery of its first-class seats—a change that involved just sixteen seats on fifteen planes. Despite such challenges, J.P.A. created a first-class cabin for Singapore that was seductively different from anyone else’s. The seats, which could be transformed into fully flat beds, looked less like conventional airplane seats than like oversized wing chairs, each with its own ottoman, dining table, and wood-framed video monitor. (The “wood” was actually a delethalized photographic imitation.) The new seats first flew in 1998. They won many awards and remained in service in their original form for almost a decade. Their successors fly today. The Singapore job enhanced J.P.A.’s reputation, and not just in aviation. The firm created a first-class lounge for Singapore Airlines at Changi Airport, and soon afterward it won contracts for several hotel renovations, including, in 2009, a hundred-million-dollar redesign of the guest rooms in the Pierre, in New York. (Most of J.P.A.’s hotel work is handled by a second office, in Singapore.) As a result, the firm’s portfolio grew to include luxury environments on a variety of scales, and Park’s conception of what J.P.A. does inside aircraft extended from the plane to the airport and beyond. “There are certain little events you experience as you progress through this promenade up to the plane,” he told me. “They should climax in your vision of the seat.”\n\nOne afternoon, I drove to Heathrow with John Tighe, a design director at J.P.A., to see a new long-haul business-class seat, called Next Generation, which the firm created for Singapore, and which first flew last year. Tighe is thirty-two years old, and before coming to J.P.A. he worked for both a seat manufacturer and an airline; he said that he has become “bilingual in measurement.” He slips effortlessly between metric and English units, both of which are used in the industry, and isn’t thrown by the occasional oddball unit, such as a mysterious Taiwanese measure that, he said, turned out to be slightly more than an inch. Boarding an airplane with no boarding pass takes some doing. We presented our passports at an airport office, and were escorted through security and onto the plane by an airline employee. Departure was an hour and a half away, and flight attendants were bustling like stagehands on opening night. Singapore’s attendants were made famous by the airline’s early-seventies motto, “Singapore Girl, you’re a great way to fly,” and they still wear batik sarong kebayas designed in 1968 by Pierre Balmain. To stay out of their way, I sat in one of the new seats, a capacious but invitingly snug enclosure. Nearly every hard surface was a curve, and the colors were soothing: tan, mauve, plum, taupe, coppery-pinkish, brown. The plane had two business-class sections: a small one, with just eight seats, directly behind first class, and a larger one behind that, with thirty-four seats. To keep the larger section from seeming enormous (and therefore less exclusive), J.P.A. had used different upholstery tones in alternate seats, checkerboard style—a pattern that causes the brain to register less than the entire expanse. “In a way, it’s a trick of the eye,” Tighe said. “It cuts down on the perception of the repetition of objects.” Tighe pushed a button on a control panel near my arm, and hidden downlights subtly accentuated the detailing in the console on my right. A button on the inner surface of the aisle-side armrest, he showed me, was positioned so that a Singapore Girl could switch off my video screen once I’d fallen asleep. He extended the tabletop, and said that a Singapore Girl could do that from the aisle, too, without reaching across my lap, and then he raised it into the proper position for breakfast in bed. He clicked open a door to the right of the video console, revealing a lighted makeup mirror—useful upon arrival. “A good seat doesn’t show you everything it’s got in the first ten minutes,” he said. “It surprises you during the flight, and lets you discover things you weren’t expecting.” Such features can pay off in unexpected ways: passengers who like their seats tend to give higher ratings to everything on their flight, including movie selections that haven’t changed. To the left of the video screen was a retractable coat hook—a surprisingly humble accessory, given that long-haul first-class seats nowadays often have a shallow personal “closet,” in which passengers can hang things like jackets and sweaters. But Tighe explained that the simplicity was intentional. Singapore had stipulated that nothing J.P.A. did should undermine the airline’s emphasis on personal service, and the hook, he said, creates an opportunity for passenger interaction. “You might hang your jacket on it when you arrive at your seat, but by the time you’ve sat down a flight attendant will have taken it away.” Similarly, J.P.A. designed the seat so that its transformation into a bed is mainly a manual operation, rather than, as is common, something a passenger can do by pushing buttons. “Usually, a flight attendant will make your bed up for you, maybe while you’re getting ready to go to sleep,” he said. The upper part of the bed is created by pulling down the seat back, revealing a flat, fabric-covered mattress section attached to the other side. (Leather is nice for sitting and is easy to clean quickly, but it can be hot and slippery for sleeping.) A cantilevered panel fills the gap between that surface and the stationary footrest, and then a Singapore Girl adds bedding and a pillow. Manual operation has the additional benefit of reducing the seat’s weight, by shrinking the machinery inside it. Next Generation, as the name suggests, evolved from an earlier seat that J.P.A. designed for Singapore. In both, the passenger sits facing forward but sleeps on the diagonal, an innovation that makes it possible to create what looks like a first-class experience in a significantly smaller space. In bed mode, each seating unit borrows some empty volume from the underside of the shell of the seat in front of it. Designing seats is like solving a three-dimensional puzzle, in which all the pieces have to fit together and even tiny spaces can be significant. During one project, on which J.P.A. worked essentially around the clock, by using employees in both of its offices, the designers in Singapore sent the designers in London an exultant overnight message saying that they thought they’d found another half inch.\n\nBeds on aircraft aren’t a recent invention. Some of Pan Am’s early planes had Pullman-style berths, and on one of those planes, in 1937, a crew member woke a man and asked to look out his window, so that he could complete his celestial navigation chart, because he hadn’t been able to see the North Star clearly from the cockpit. The awakened passenger recalled later that the actress Anna May Wong, who had starred in the film “Shanghai Express” five years earlier, was in the berth across the aisle, and that he knew she was asleep, on the other side of her curtain, because he could hear “a kind of soft snore.” As air travel extended down the income scale, though, and as airplanes got faster, bedlike sleeping surfaces became less common, then disappeared, until British Airways reintroduced them, in the nineties. Early flights were classless in the sense that only the wealthy could afford them. (In 1938, a ticket on Imperial’s flight from London to Durban, which took six days, cost a hundred and twenty-five pounds, hotels and meals included—a little less than a quarter of the cost of an average house.) On early mixed-class planes, the first-class seats were sometimes back near the tail, farther from the noise of the engines and, perhaps, from the chauffeur-like men handling the controls. In 1977, British Airways introduced a third division, a mid-plane Executive Cabin, which it described as having “a quiet, exclusive atmosphere free from the distraction of movies and young babies.” The seats and their spacing were the same as those in economy, but the section was intended for passengers paying nondiscounted fares—typically, business travellers. The first true business class arose soon afterward, and versions of it have evolved, since then, in response to the fluctuations of national economies, the increased competition that followed airline deregulation, and other factors. One key to its success is that many of the tickets are purchased with the world’s oldest virtual currency: Other People’s Money. For self-paying passengers who upgrade with frequent-flier miles, the cost is supported by things like the fees that retailers pay to credit-card companies, which buy miles in bulk from airlines and distribute them to cardholders as rewards; for corporate executives and their lawyers, bankers, and consultants, the expense is partly borne by shareholders, as is also the case with corporate jets. (Private jets divide the wealthy into two classes: there are the rich, who fly first class without thinking about it, and then there are the jet-rich, who have never seen the inside of Concourse B.) Not long after beds returned to first class, they began to appear in business class, too. Today, the variation in detail, size, spacing, comfort, and ticket price in all classes is so great that traditional cabin designations aren’t very meaningful. Ben Orson, the managing director of J.P.A.’s London office, told me that it’s probably more accurate to think of seating types as tightly spaced points on a continuum—from the thrombosis-inducing perches on regional jets to the bedroom-like micro-palaces on Emirates and Etihad. Between those extremes is a Cambrian explosion of features and variants, including an emerging intermediate class with names like Economy Comfort, Economy Plus, and Main Cabin Extra. Air New Zealand has been especially innovative, and in recent years has introduced two distinctive seat types: the Skycouch, which is formed by turning three adjacent economy seats into a broad mini-bed, and the Spaceseat, which the company classifies as “premium economy” but on some airlines might pass for business class. Competing for travellers in this way is economically risky. Some first-class cabins on Kingfisher Airlines, based in India, had a bar, a bartender, and a spacious lounging area, as well as a chef who prepared delicacies to order. But Kingfisher stopped flying in 2012, after just seven years in operation, in part because it had allocated too much cabin space to functions that delighted passengers but produced no revenue. “Is there anything else I can do wrong for you?” Yet moderation is risky, too. Premium cabins contribute disproportionately to an airline’s economic performance—both directly, through higher ticket prices, and indirectly, by solidifying relationships with big-budget customers who fly all the time. Business class is especially valuable; first class can be problematic, because first-class ticket holders require extra pampering and won’t tolerate overbooking. Web sites like SeatGuru enable picky fliers to compare seats on many routes, and keeping such fliers loyal is expensive: new first-class seating units can cost more than half a million dollars each. Jami Counter, a senior director at TripAdvisor, which owns SeatGuru, told me, “The true international first-class cabin actually keeps shrinking, because the international business-class cabin has become such a great product, to the point where you’re differentiating more on things like food and service.” Because costs are high, passenger density is extremely important, especially outside first class. The critical industry measure is “pitch,” which is the distance between a point on one seat and the same point on the seat just ahead of it or just behind it. Short pitches mean more rows; more rows mean more revenue (and, usually, cheaper tickets—the main criterion by which most economy passengers compare flights). Seat pitch on commercial jets ranges from about thirty inches, in many short-haul economy cabins, to slightly more than ninety inches, in a few long-haul first-class cabins. In any cabin with more than a few rows, even centimetres become important, because they add up. If you have a seating pattern that repeats every seventy inches, sixty inches of leftover space is an expensive extravagance, because the difference between profit and loss on a given flight can be less than the fare from a single seat. Accurately pricing tickets for all cabins has become so important that airlines work hard to predict demand, which is influenced, on an hourly basis, by weather, military coups, school vacations, disease outbreaks, sporting events, and innumerable other factors. Prices move constantly, as conditions change. “If you sell out a flight too quick,” Tighe told me, “you weren’t charging enough.”\n\nDuring my visit to J.P.A., nearly everyone in the office was preparing for the Aircraft Interiors Expo, which is held each spring in Hamburg and is the world’s largest trade show for people who design, manufacture, sell, or buy almost anything that goes into the inside of almost anything that flies. The J.P.A. designers were working on a new long-haul business-class seat, which they were developing in partnership with an aircraft-interiors manufacturer called Jamco. The seat—its prototype was first shown at Hamburg in 2013—is in some ways a descendant of a fully-flat-bed seat that J.P.A. and another manufacturer introduced in 2007. Versions of that earlier seat, called Cirrus, are used by a number of airlines, mostly in business but sometimes in first. Cirrus seats are enclosed within curving, podlike shells—a look familiar to many international travellers, who, by now, have either flown in Cirrus seats or grumpily walked past them on the way to the back of the plane. The seats nest together in a herringbone pattern, so that each unit is oriented diagonally to the longitudinal axis of the plane, like cars parked at an angle to a curb. That arrangement makes it possible to provide more than six feet of sleeping surface within a pitch of less than four feet, while also preserving what may be the single most coveted modern premium-class feature: direct aisle access from every seat, so that passengers never have to say “Excuse me” when they get up to go to the bathroom. The Cirrus arrangement is called “reverse” herringbone, because it flips the orientation used by Virgin Atlantic, which was the first airline to angle business-class passengers for both sleeping and sitting. In Virgin’s arrangement, passengers at the sides of the cabin sit with their back to the window and their feet toward the aisle; in Cirrus’s, they face the other way. “The Virgin seat was very innovative, but we felt it was a shame to make people look away from the window,” Tighe told me. “And that seat has a global limitation, because there are cultures in which the soles of the feet are considered unsavory, or rude, and people are uncomfortable sleeping with their feet exposed where other people are walking—mainly in Asia and the Middle East.” Cultural differences in air travel can be significant. Americans are less bothered than Arab sheikhs when slobs wearing flip-flops end up in first class. J.P.A.’s new seat, like Cirrus, will be sold, in various versions, to more than one airline, and the purpose of demonstrating it in Hamburg and elsewhere is to line up customers in advance of production. The prototype is a full-size mockup of a five-unit cluster, in which one seat is fully functional, another is set up as a bed, and a third is partially reclined. “The C.E.O. of the airline usually sits in the seat that works, and everyone else gathers around,” Orson told me. During demonstrations, J.P.A.’s designers act as salespeople, but they also watch closely for hints about likely passenger behavior. One thing they learned from watching airline executives at last year’s show was that a curved element on the aisle side of the seat shell, near a seated passenger’s shoulder, occasionally bumped a passenger who was getting up, so they eliminated it. After the 2013 expo, the model was shipped to Seattle, Singapore, Tokyo, and other cities, for additional demonstrations, and by the end of last year representatives from several dozen airlines had studied it. Even so, the seat is at least two years from launch, and almost everything about it, including its name, is still a trade secret. Before this year’s expo, the model was disassembled, repaired, modified, rebuilt, and refinished in a different color scheme, and while that work was under way J.P.A.’s designers built a crude mockup out of white foam-core panels. The seats themselves were ordinary office chairs, but the mockup allowed the designers to double-check things like sight lines and clearances. Full-size models have been important tools for aircraft designers for a long time. Computer software can create extraordinarily realistic three-dimensional representations of entire airplane cabins, Park told me, but there are still features and qualities you can’t perceive accurately without studying a full-size physical object. The demonstration model of J.P.A. and Jamco’s new business-class seat was built in Pitstone, about forty miles north of London, by Curvature Group, a private company, which makes exquisitely detailed 1:1 scale models of everything from cell phones to rockets. Tighe lives nearby, and sometimes looks in on his way to or from work. One day, I joined him there, and James Lilley, who is Curvature’s project manager, gave us a tour. In one room, we watched a man gluing together several huge polyurethane planks that he would later turn into part of a boat model, using the largest of Curvature’s thirteen computer-controlled milling machines. “We can quite comfortably build a full-size train in-house,” Lilley said. Curvature built a (non-functioning) prototype railway car for Hitachi not long ago, Tighe said, and the model had such a perfectly detailed interior that even when you walked inside it you couldn’t tell it wasn’t the real thing. In another room, a craftsman who had been hand-shaping the curved edge of part of a seat shell explained to Tighe why reproducing a particular color sample would be difficult. The sample, a translucent blue, had been sent over by a J.P.A. materials designer, who thought that it might be perfect for a particular trim piece on the new seat. “We think we know how to achieve this,” the craftsman said, “but what you’d have to do is a real pain in the ass.” Creating the sample’s effect in a coating, he said, would require a primer, a black coat, a gloss coat, a paint coat, a lacquer coat, and at least a couple of other things, plus long drying times between steps. But he thought he’d found a simpler way to achieve almost the same thing, and he gave Tighe two samples. “The first person who figures out how to make a convincing chrome paint will make a fortune,” Lilley said. Building a model of an airplane seat can take Curvature as long as ten weeks, because virtually every part has to be custom-made. Once a prototype is finished, building an actual airplane seat is faster, but the process is similar. “The aviation-seating industry isn’t like the automotive industry,” Park told me later. “The multiples are much, much smaller, and it’s still almost an artisan process. With motorcars, robots do most of the welding and, nowadays, even a lot of the electrical work. With aviation seats, even parts of the frames are milled by hand.” Tighe added, “Once you know what goes into an airplane, it seems insane that you can buy an airplane ticket for as little as you can.”",

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nJERUSALEM - Israel believes Syria has retained caches of combat-ready chemical weapons after giving up raw materials used to produce such munitions under pressure from foreign powers, a senior Israeli official said on Thursday.\n\nSummarizing Israeli intelligence estimates that were previously not disclosed to avoid undermining the Syrians' surrender of their declared chemical arsenal, the official said they had kept some missile warheads, air-dropped bombs and rocket-propelled grenades primed with toxins like sarin.\n\n\"There is, to my mind, still in the hands of Syria a significant residual capability ... that could be used in certain circumstances and could be potentially very serious,\" the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.While saying Israel had a \"high degree of confidence\" in its information, he declined to give figures for chemical weapons allegedly kept by Syria, citing secrecy concerns as well as the possibility some had been destroyed or used by President Bashar Assad's forces.\"What we are saying is that there are a number of questions here that still have to be clarified, still have to be looked at very closely\" by international inspectors, the official said.Israel is an old foe of its northern Arab neighbor and in April 2013 its intelligence service was the first to accuse Assad's regime of using chemical weapons against areas held by Syrian rebels in the on-going civil war.Western powers soon echoed the charge and Washington threatened Damascus with air strikes.Assad agreed to give up the chemical arsenal, which Damascus had previously not acknowledged having. However, he denied his forces had used them and accused rebels of such attacks.International diplomats told Reuters this week that Syria had revealed a previously undeclared research and development facility and a laboratory to produce the ricin poison.Those disclosures appeared to support Western assertions in recent months that the Assad regime had not been fully transparent in detailing its chemical weapons program.GAME-CHANGERThe Israeli official said the 1,300 tonnes of mustard gas and precursors for sarin and VX surrendered by Syria largely matched Israeli assessments of its total stockpile of such materials. The shelf-life of any deployable munitions held back was limited given the chemicals' deterioration, he added.Those assessments appear to contribute to overall Israeli relief at the Syrian chemical disarmament, even if Assad has reneged in part. The Israeli official voiced confidence that \"our deterrence\" - usually a coded reference to Israel's superior military and assumed nuclear arsenal - would continue to keep Damascus in check.Using chemical weapons against Israeli targets, even on a small scale, \"wouldn't be a game-changer, it would be a game-ender\" for Syria, the official said.He was less sanguine, however, when asked about the possibility that Islamic State insurgents in Syria and Iraq might get hold of Assad's remaining chemical weapons.Israel had no indication that this had happened, he said, indicating Israeli intelligence knew where Assad's remaining chemical arms were kept and that these sites were still safe - something he declined to confirm or deny directly.\"I haven't seen any information that they (Islamic State) have received them. I would not be surprised if they are interested, though, in receiving them,\" he said.While using higher-yield munitions like air-dropped bombs might be beyond the insurgents, they could easily launch attacks with \"a bunch of grenades with sarin\" if this became available, the official added. He noted Israel's concern at the entrenchment of Islamist rebels along its ceasefire line with Syria in the occupied Golan Heights.According to regional sources, Israel has on several occasions bombed sites in Syria to thwart the suspected handover of conventional weapons from Assad to allied Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas. Israeli officials have not formally confirmed carrying out the strikes but say they are poised to take similar action to prevent insurgents getting chemical weapons.\"When we have seen things that we are concerned about, whatever has been done has been done, and that's it. We have been very careful not to be sucked in. So that policy will continue,\" the Israeli official said.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

The deputy consul general, Lin Jing, spoke at an event organised with Victoria police at the university last month, telling Chinese students about personal safety, Victorian laws around theft and robbery and the protection the consulate could offer.\n\nPolice reportedly used the event to reassure students that being the victim of a crime would not affect their visa status.\n\nThe spike in thefts has prompted the university to send safety alerts to students via social media and its student intranet.\n\n“A number of actions have been taken by the university, including increasing security patrols and providing a dedicated security escort service for students,” a university spokesman, David Scott, said. “The university will continue to work closely with Victoria police to ensure the safety of its students and staff.”\n\nChinese investment in Australia jumps 60% to $15bn Read more\n\nThe University of Melbourne Chinese Students and Scholars Association, which helped organise the event with Lin, has warned its 3,500 members to remain vigilant, and the story has been picked up by Chinese state media.\n\nIt’s not the first time Melbourne has received negative press for the treatment of international students. In 2009 and 2010, a series of brutal attacks on Indian students culminated in the fatal stabbing of 21-year-old accounting graduate Nitin Garg, which soured the relationship between India and Australia and saw India issue a warning to parents not to send their children to study in Australia.\n\nThe international education sector is worth $16.3bn annually to the Australian economy and, according to a 2011 report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the largest group of international students, accounting for 20% of the 250,000 student visas approved that year, are from China.",
  "latent_2537": "The first man ever to command a tank in battle only volunteered for the secret mission because learning to fly aeroplanes was so dangerous, his daughter has revealed.\n\nCaptain Harold ‘Morty’ Mortimore was in command of tank ‘D1’ (“Daredevil”) on September 15, 1916. His was the first tank to go into action in history.\n\nHis place in history occurred because he had crashed an aeroplane while training with the Royal Naval Air Service and was looking to find a way of keeping his feet on the ground. So when volunteers were asked to join a top secret and dangerous mission he put his hand up immediately with the quip: “Nothing can be as terrifying as this.”\n\nA few months later the moustachioed pioneer was rolling over No Man’s Land towards the German trenches in the first tank to ever engage an enemy. His daughter, Dr Tilly Mortimore, spoke about her father when she visited The Tank Museum 100 years after that first action, where she saw the only surviving item from the tank D1 – its compass – in a new display case about ‘Morty’. See the full interview ‘My Tank Ancestor’ here.\n\nThe compass, displayed below, has been stickered and placed in a lead-lined box as the radium paint that made it luminescent emits substantial amounts of radiation.\n\nIt was designed by Captain Creagh-Osborne R.N. in 1911 as a universal type for service aircraft, Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service and was issued from 1913 onwards.\n\nA Tank Corps button has been welded to the side which is not part of the original design, and is a bit of a red herring as, at that time, the crew would have worn the MGC badge.\n\nTilly described how her father saw German soldiers drop their guns and run away when they first clapped their eyes on the new British invention. However, after Morty had cleared the trenches his tank was hit by artillery from his own side and was disabled.\n\nHe later told his daughter that he thought the tanks should have been deployed differently – as one huge unit rather than the piecemeal approach that was taken. Tilly – who was born on September 15 1950, when her father was 59 – was christened Matilda after the nickname given to the `female` Mark 1 tanks.\n\nShe said: “My father told me that being in the Royal Naval Air Service was the most terrifying thing you could possibly do. He said the planes were made out of string and balsa wood and he even crashed one onto a shed on the training field.\n\n“So when volunteers were requested for a top secret dangerous mission his hand shot up – and that’s how he ended up in the tanks. Dad was selected as a tank commander and he started training in April 1916. By August the tanks were being shipped to France.\n\n“His tank was supposed to go into battle with two others, but they had broken down so my dad went in on his own. He became the very first man to command a tank in battle and although he cleared the trenches, the steering mechanism was hit by a flying barrage from his own artillery. The crew got out and some were injured, but not seriously. D1 was abandoned on the battlefield.\n\n“Dad didn’t speak much about his experiences, but he did tell me that his job on the first day was to clear a trench of German machine-gunners near to a strategically important wood. He said that as he approached the enemy he peered through his view finder and saw the Germans take one look at the tank and run.\n\n“Just imagine what that huge tank must have looked like rearing up at the German soldiers in the early morning. The development of the tank had been kept secret and the effect must have been incredibly powerful. Dad also said that the effect would have been much greater had all the Mark 1 tanks gone at the Germans together.\n\n“I am very proud of my father and of all those men who volunteered. They did so because they thought it was the right thing to do.”\n\nMorty was gassed twice and eventually sent home. He became a businessman and politician in local government in Hertfordshire, met and married Tilly’s mother Mary in the late 1930s, and served in the Home Guard during World War II. He died in 1967 aged 76.\n\nFor more on the first tank crews, have a look at our products below.",

Also participating were Avalon Ventures, SoftBank Capital and Seattle's Madrona Venture Group. It's too soon to discuss any plans for an IPO, Huh said.\n\n\"The financing aside, the size of what they've built with such limited capital, so few people, is really impressive,\" said Greg Gottesman, Madrona managing director and longtime fan of Cheezburger's Fail Blog. \"This is a great sort of entrepreneurial story about a good local team that's done some incredible things on the media side.\"\n\nOther sites in the network include Memebase and The Daily What.\n\nIt's too soon to discuss any plans for an IPO, Huh said.\n\n\"We got here because we concentrated on the next few months of what we wanted to do,\" he said. \"We don't have strategic plans; we just have a mission we really love, which is to make everyone happy.\" For five minutes a day.\n\nThe company is also now officially called Cheezburger — a reference to its flagship cute-kitten site, Icanhascheezburger.com. Huh said the previous name, Pet Holdings, was just a placeholder.\n\nThings will stay on course in part because Cheezburger has been working to decentralize its management, he said. New employees are trained to make decisions on their own, for instance, to minimize bottlenecks.\n\nThere will be plenty of new employees to train. Huh said the cash infusion will be used partly for hiring, with Cheezburger planning to more than double staffing at its Lower Queen Anne office this year. By year's end the company should have more than 100 employees, up from 50 today and 20 at the end of 2009.\n\nHuh had considered opening editorial offices in New York and Los Angeles, but has decided to keep primary business operations concentrated in Seattle. The company is planning to hire sales reps in those cities, though.\n\nCheezburger has had success publishing books based on its sites. Huh said he's interested in pursuing video and TV projects as well.\n\nHuh also plans to use the capital to buy more companies. He's looking for Web ventures with strong brands and user communities that would complement Cheezburger's network of 50 sites.\n\nDon't expect Huh to add a flurry of new websites to the Cheezburger network, though. After a \"huge binge\" developing a network of sites, including the Fail Blog and The Daily What, the additions tapered off last April. Huh said scaling problems arise when you reach 100 sites, and Cheezburger is now going for quality more than quantity.\n\n\"What we're actually interested in is creating more engaging sites,\" he said.\n\nBut can Cheezburger stay funny as it gets bigger and richer?\n\nHuh said yes, and he's drawing inspiration from Groupon founder Andrew Mason, who kept things irreverent as his company evolved into a major online advertising company.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned Groupon's really a content company — they sell deals as content that's meant to be read and consumed,\" Huh said.\n\nHere are edited excerpts from more of the conversation:\n\nQ: What sort of acquisitions will you make?\n\nA: We're going to make small bets, many of them. We're looking for things that work well within our model. It has to work within user-generated content.\n\nQ: Will your role change?\n\nA: No. This is what I love doing.\n\nQ: So are you going after The Onion now?\n\nA: The Onion and we fill very different roles.

  "latent_2847": "The tweet in question. Twitter\n\nWikiLeaks has had a big few days. On Friday, Julian Assange’s organization released about 20,000 emails from the Democratic National Committee, embarrassing the group to the point that chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign.\n\nHillary Clinton’s campaign has blamed Russia for the leak, which they said was done for the benefit of Donald Trump.\n\nPerhaps lost in the brouhaha, though, was the fact that over the weekend WikiLeaks—an organization that claims to be devoted to radical transparency—sent out an anti-Semitic tweet and then deleted it.\n\nHere is the tweet in question:\n\nHoly shit. Holy shit. Holy shit. pic.twitter.com/b6QrDVDsu0 — Kelsey D. Atherton (@AthertonKD) July 23, 2016\n\nUnless you’re a close follower of white nationalist and neo-Nazi Twitter memes, this might be a little hard to follow. Here’s an attempted parsing:\n\nTribalism is a noun meaning “an advocate or practitioner of strong loyalty to one’s own tribe or social group.” Jewish “tribalism” is a theory of Jews working in concert to control world events for the benefit of Jews, espoused by such notable white supremacists as David Duke.\n\nEstablishment is another word used sometimes by white supremacists to describe Jews in a pejorative way, such as “the Jewish media establishment, the Jewish money establishment, the Jewish political establishment.” It is also a noun that’s definition includes “a group in a society exercising power and influence over matters of policy or taste, and seen as resisting change.”\n\nPerhaps the most difficult bit to understand, and the most important part, is the “[most] of our critics have 3 (((brackets around their names))) & have black-rim glasses” part. The brackets is a reference to an alt-right meme that was a way of signaling that a person was Jewish, often for anti-Semitic commentary (some Jews later co-opted the meme and used it as a self-identifier). Black-rimmed glasses are a style of eyewear sometimes associated with the notable Jewish comedian and director Woody Allen. They are also worn by many different people.\n\nBizarre is an adjective meaning “very strange or unusual, especially so as to cause interest or amusement.”\n\nSo, one possible meaning: Jews are climbers among an elite and powerful group who use a symbol that indicates strong loyalty to other Jews. These types of people (Jews) also often wear black-rim glasses and are WikiLeaks’ biggest critics. This is an odd (perhaps nefarious?) thing.\n\nThe WikiLeaks account then tweeted this even more confusing thing, which we won’t even attempt to explain:\n\nThe account then deleted both of these tweets, claiming it did so because the original tweet had “been intentionally miscomprehended by pro-Clinton hacks and by Neo-Nazis.”\n\nNo. We deleted it because it was been intentionally miscomprehended by pro-Clinton hacks and by Neo-Nazis. — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 24, 2016\n\nWikiLeaks also implied that the tweet wasn’t anti-Semitic but rather, actually, never mind, I have no idea what they were trying to say here:\n\nWhat nonsense:\n\nAnti-semites bracket names\n\nAnti-racists ironically appropriate\n\nNeo-liberal castle creepers co-opt virtue signal — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 24, 2016\n\nIt’s unclear who writes the WikiLeaks Twitter feed. Assange in the past has reportedly said that there is a “Jewish” media conspiracy against him at the Guardian newspaper.",

  "latent_2908": "Previously on this blog I have sought to explore the Iranian-backed Local Defence Forces (LDF) networks beyond Aleppo province (where it is most prominent), such as the Damascus LDF affiliate Saraya al-Wa'ad. There are also LDF affiliates with visible profiles in Hama province, such as Quwat al-Ghadab based in the Christian town of Suqaylabiyah. When I first wrote about Quwat al-Ghadab, I had not quite appreciated the LDF connection, though the description of it as part of 'Quwat al-Asdiqa\" ('Forces of the Friends') became clearer to me over time in alluding to the Iranian role (more specifically, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps- IRGC) in backing this group and other LDF units.\n\nSaraya al-Ra'ad is another LDF affiliate currently based in Hama but in fact is affiliated with the LDF Idlib sector. Although this point may seem confusing at first sight considering that Idlib is almost entirely in the hands of insurgents, an Idlib sector for the LDF was specified in legislation earlier this year regarding the LDF and military services. That is, that the government presence in a particular province may be/may have been limited does not mean no LDF sector was specified for it. A similar point has applied to Deir az-Zor province, where no LDF branch had been operating on the ground when I last inquired but an LDF sector was specified for it in the legislation.\n\nCurrently, the LDF Idlib sector is led by an Iranian known by the name of al-Hajj Asghar. This should come as no surprise, considering that the head of the LDF Aleppo sector is Sayyid Jawad, a known figure in the IRGC. In fact, every sector of the LDF is led by an Iranian, though the exact names of these individuals are largely unknown at the present time.\n\nAs is the case with Saraya al-Wa'ad, the group's name can be seen as a double entendre. For Saraya al-Ra'ad can be rendered as 'Brigades of Thunder', but the Ra'ad part can also refer to the group's leader, who goes by the name of Ra'ad Abu Ja'afar, originally from Hama but among the inhabitants of Latakia.\n\nBefore the formation of Saraya al-Ra'ad, Ra'ad Abu Ja'afar was serving in the Syrian army, leading a contingent that was stationed in the northwest Idlib town of Jisr al-Shughur prior to its fall to the rebels in April 2015. This contingent had also fought in Aleppo, Zabadani, the al-Sha'er field in the Homs desert, and the Hama, Latakia and Idlib countrysides. During the battle of Jisr al-Shughur, Ra'ad Abu Ja'afar was wounded and lost his own car.\n\nAs is often the case with formations in the Syrian civil war on all sides, personal connections play a role in determining the composition of Saraya al-Ra'ad. Many if not most of those in Saraya al-Ra'ad had previously served with Ra'ad Abu Ja'afar in the contingent that was stationed in Jisr al-Shughur.\n\nThe groups that would come to form Saraya al-Ra'ad were first brought together on 12 December 2016 in the Slenfeh area of the Latakia countryside, after Ra'ad Abu Ja'afar had recovered from his injuries. Originally these groups under his military command came under Fawj Qamr Bani Hashim (aka Liwa al-Mukhtar al-Thiqfi) as part of the Idlib LDF. Ra'ad Abu Ja'afar and his groups then split off from Fawj Qamr Bani Hashim to operate under the name of Saraya al-Ra'ad while still being a part of the Idlib LDF. Besides Ra'ad Abu Ja'afar, another figure of note in the group is Mazen Tahan who directs administrative affairs.\n\nMazen Tehan\n\nAs always when it comes to LDF groups, I inquired about the distinction between the LDF and the more familiar National Defence Forces (NDF). In this case, one answer was given as follows: \"The difference is that the NDF are fighters on civilian contracts: that is, voluntary. As for LDF fighters, they are military personnel in the Syrian Arab Army undertaking military service and the national obligation.\" Thus, while the LDF has an affiliation with the IRGC, the NDF does not have this affiliation: \"It [the NDF] has not been with the Revolutionary Guard [IRGC]. The Revolutionary Guard gave support only.\"\n\nSaraya al-Ra'ad fighters with their leader Ra'ad Abu Ja'afar.\n\nA similar explanation offered here described the NDF as a \"civilian\" and \"auxiliary\" formation but not on the registers of the Syrian armed forces. It was explained that while the Iranians offered some financial support and training in Iran for some NDF units, the NDF is not affiliated with the IRGC. The LDF however has an affiliation with the IRGC while also being on the registers of the Syrian armed forces.\n\nAs far as the areas of operations go, Saraya al-Ra'ad has fought in a number of places, including the Hama countryside, Palmyra, the desert border areas with Jordan and Iraq, and the key Deir az-Zor towns of Albukamal and al-Mayadeen. The next target is supposed to be Idlib. For members of Saraya al-Ra'ad, monthly salaries start at 50,000 Syrian pounds but may rise up to 100,000 Syrian pounds depending on type of assignment.\n\nRa'ad Abu Ja'afar (right) with IRGC Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani (left).\n\nIn sum, the case of Saraya al-Ra'ad is important in illustrating how many of these 'Syrian Hezbollah/IRGC' groups have developed over time and originated. Instead of thinking of these groups as atomised entities, it is important to consider how they are being fitted or intended to be fitted into wider networks, above all the LDF. In the case of Idlib, what we see at least in part (as illustrated in the case of Saraya al-Ra'ad) is an Iranian reorganization of pro-government forces that had been based in the province and collapsed in the rebel offensive in spring 2015.\n\nFor the longer term, the rise of the LDF shows the futility of calls to remove 'Iranian-backed militias' from Syria. Even if the Iranian-backed foreign formations like Lebanon's Hezbollah leave entirely, the LDF will remain in place, with many of its units aligned with Iran ideologically. The only real way to counter this development would be to remove the government in Damascus, which no one is seriously countenancing at this point.\n\nNB: Exact identities of sources have been omitted by request.",
  "latent_3003": "Debates about immigration often lead to the topic of language. Donald Trump believes that only English should be spoken in the United States. In August he backed a bill that would evaluate prospective immigrants on a points system, with more points given for demonstrating English language ability. “Whether people like it or not, that’s how we assimilate,” Trump said in 2015.\n\nThe reality of language assimilation is more subtle. When people move to a country where a language other than their own is spoken, they have many incentives—cultural, economic, and social—to learn to talk like a local. That is probably why English is one of the most popular languages in the US on Duolingo, the world’s most popular language-learning app.\n\nFor these English learners in the US, Spanish is by far the most common native language. There are 9.1 million users studying English in America, and 7.8 million of those are learning it via Spanish, according to data provided to Quartz by Duolingo. In fact, in Miami more people are studying English than any other language on Duolingo. It’s the only major city where that’s the case, but the proportion is high elsewhere, too.\n\nThe 7.8 million users in the US learning English via Spanish make up 13.5% of Duolingo’s overall American user base, a company representative said in an email. That’s a big number, and proportionally it’s pretty close to the percentage of Americans that are Spanish speakers, probably about 40 million by now, or around 12% of the population. We don’t know how many of these users are recent immigrants, or whether they have been in the country for decades, but they are all trying to improve their inglés.\n\nBut there’s another point to be made on the topic of assimilation: many Americans are assimilating to the newcomers by learning Spanish. It is far and away the most popular language on Duolingo, the top choice for users in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and many others. In these cities, Spanish is more than twice as popular as the next competitor, French. Even English speakers, it seems, don’t agree with Trump that English should be the only language spoken in America.\n\nThe best way to learn a language is to move to a country where it is spoken. For an English learner, Duolingo can help, but it is no replacement for moving to America. Not letting in people who don’t already speak English is, therefore, a bit of a catch-22. Its overall effect will likely be to reduce the total number of people who are fluent in American English.\n\nFinally, immigrants usually want to assimilate. The alternative is to feel like an outsider and miss out on job opportunities. Latinos in the US are increasingly using English and not Spanish, even at home. And, in Sweden, the most popular language on Duolingo is…Swedish.",
  "latent_3087": "The chief inspector of schools has delivered a sharp warning to the government that the opening of more grammar schools would be “a profoundly retrograde step” that would damage the prospects of disadvantaged children.\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to influence government policy, Sir MichaelWilshaw, who steps down from his role as head of the schools watchdog, Ofsted, in December, said grammar schools’ record on admitting children from poorer backgrounds was “pretty woeful”.\n\nHe said that rather than boosting social mobility, selective education worked against the poorest children who were just starting to benefit from education reforms introduced first by Labour’s Tony Blair and later by the former education secretary Michael Gove.\n\nSocial mobility doesn’t exist – and grammar schools are part of the problem | Lola Okolosie Read more\n\nWilshaw has been a longtime critic of grammar schools, but his strongly worded speech at a London Councils education conference on Monday will be seen as a direct rebuke to prime minister Theresa May’s reported support for selection in schools.\n\nThe education secretary, Justine Greening, has said she is keeping an open mind on grammars. Reports have indicated however that the government may sanction the opening of selective schools in poorer areas in an effort to improve social mobility.\n\nWilshaw told the conference the success of schoolchildren in London, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds who outperform their counterparts elsewhere, challenged the narrative surrounding grammar schools.\n\n“If grammar schools are the great answer, why aren’t there more of them in London?” he said. “If they are such a good thing for poor children, then why are poor children here in the capital doing so much better than their counterparts in those parts of the country that operate selection?\n\n“I appreciate that many grammar schools do a fine job in equipping their students with an excellent education. But we all know that their record of admitting children from non-middle-class backgrounds is pretty woeful. The notion that the poor stand to benefit from the return of grammar schools strikes me as quite palpable tosh and nonsense – and is very clearly refuted by the London experience.”\n\nEngland has 164 state-funded fully selective schools, while Northern Ireland has 69. A ban on new grammars has been in place since the Blair administration, but there is widespread support for greater selection from backbench Tories.\n\nThe ban was undermined by the former education secretary Nicky Morgan who gave the go-ahead last October for the opening of a new grammar school in Kent, which won approval because it claimed to be a satellite of an existing school rather than a new selective institution.\n\nAt the time May made clear her support for moves in her own Maidenhead constituency to open a similar satellite grammar school. Since she became prime minister, Downing Street has done nothing to dampen speculation that an extension of selection in schools is on the agenda. An announcement could be made as early as the Tory autumn party conference.\n\nWilshaw, who is due to leave his post after five years, told Monday’s conference the gap in attainment at GCSE level in Hackney between children on free school meals and those on non-free school meals was 14.6%. In Kent, which operates selection, the gap is nearly 34%.\n\n“A grammar school in every town, as some are calling for, would also mean three secondary moderns in every town – a consequence rarely mentioned,” Wilshaw said. “That is why I am in no doubt that a return to selection would be a profoundly retrograde step that would actually lead to overall standards sliding back, not improving.”",
  "latent_3286": "The immediate focus for Shawn Watson is getting Tyrone Swoopes and Jerrod Heard ready to play against Notre Dame, but Texas' quarterbacks coach is also keeping an eye on the future.\n\nEven before Arlington Lamar's Shane Buechele or Austin Westlake's Sam Ehlinger – two quarterback takes in consecutive classes the Longhorn coaches are excited about – get to campus, Watson is focusing his attention on his 2015 take, Baltimore (Md.) Gilman Top247 athlete Kai Locksley.\n\nThe 6-foot-4, 188-pound newcomer is currently working as the No. 3 quarterback behind Swoopes and Heard. Despite a lot being thrown at him, Watson has spoken positively of the way Locksley responded during fall camp.\n\n“He's a coaches kid, and he came here with that going for him and he's understands football,” Watson said recently of the son of current Maryland offensive coordinator Mike Locksley. “He understands defensive football. He's done a really nice job.”\n\nIn the first week of fall camp Watson installed the entire base offense Texas will use in 2015, meaning Locksley had a ton of information thrown his way. What's helped Locksley make the transition to the college game, Watson said, is his experience being around meeting rooms, locker rooms and having the kind of understanding of football few incoming freshmen quarterbacks possess.\n\n“The analogy I used for the players, and I did with him, was you're going to be drinking out of a fire hose,” Watson said. “I've really been impressed with how he's handled the volume of information and the plays that we've given him offensively, and then you couple that with the multiplicity and all that our defense does.”\n\nWhether or not Locksley redshirts this season is a question that coaches have publicly yet to answer. Watson has talked about wanting Locksley to continue working behind Swoopes and Heard this fall to keep him up to speed with everything the Longhorns are doing, but it could also be to keep him warm should an emergency situation arise.\n\nLocksley's skill set has been everything Watson thought it would be, and his natural talent combined with his background at the position suggest he could be an answer down the road. Until that time comes, Watson wants Locksley to just keep plugging away.\n\n“He'll matter at some point and at some time,” Watson said. “When is how fast he can pick it up.”",

I'm very excited to be going to the Pro Bowl.\n\n\"The goal [entering the season] is to be either in the Pro Bowl or the Super Bowl. That is every year. That is something you want to be able to build on and put that on your résumé.

After missing all of training camp and the first four games of the season with a hamstring injury, Beckham finished with 91 catches for 1,305 yards and 12 touchdowns in only 12 games.

He also missed last season's Pro Bowl after needing surgery for knee and finger injuries.\n\nESPN.com Lions reporter Michael Rothstein contributed to this report.",
  "latent_3329": "“Thanks to climate change scams, swine flu and a whole host of own-goals, the status of the white-coated prima donnas and narcissists has never been lower in the public esteem…After a period of priest-like authority, the pointy-heads in lab coats have reassumed the role of mad cranks they enjoyed from the days of Frankenstein to boys’ comics in the 1950s.” So wrote The Daily Telegraph’s Gerald Warner four years ago in the wake of the sacking of David Nutt as head of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. Is that really how the public see scientists? Or, as Harry Collins puts it, are we all scientific experts now?\n\nCollins is a sociologist of science, or rather, as he likes to put it, he works in the field of the sociology of scientific knowledge. Indeed, he is one of its early proponents. The idea of “priest-like authority” he would equate with what he calls “Wave One” in his field, when scientists were believed to be infallible authorities working on ideas that could be directly tested in the laboratory. However, unlike Warner, Collins saw the “priests” being defrocked back in the 1960s and 1970s, as studies started to show that scientists were actually rather human. They swore, they made mistakes, they didn’t always agree with each other, and a lot of their lives were spent in mundane tasks such as making coffee and filling in requisition forms for test tubes and gasket seals. These apparently unexpected truths were revealed in Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar’s classic book Laboratory Life: The Construction of Scientific Facts (1979) and elsewhere.\n\nCollins has come full circle in his arguments and, after many years, he has accepted that we are not all equal when it comes to science\n\nThis seeming humanisation of scientists meant that, to many researchers, they were no longer seen as special, and over the next 25 years of “Wave Two” they (including Collins himself) downplayed the expertise of scientists in one way or another. This was one part of the “science wars” story that claimed that scientists had no firmer a grip on facts and truth than anyone else: since science was a social activity, results could be coloured by who presented them and so could not represent ultimate truth. One outcome was the recognition that many different groups of people, scientists and non-scientists alike, should contribute to decisions. This has become widely accepted in the years since, although these decisions may often be skewed by political demands to as great a degree as the science itself, a point Collins completely overlooks here.\n\nCollins sought to explore the idea of expertise further and, based on the time he spent embedded in a gravitational waves research group, he introduced what he termed “interactional expertise”, believing he could effectively masquerade as a gravitational wave researcher without ever having studied the underlying science. As he puts it here: “Interactional expertise is acquired by engaging in the spoken discourse of an expert community to the point of fluency but without participating in the practical activities or deliberately contributing to those activities.” Developing the question of what expertise is, and the different flavours it comes in, occupies a substantial part of Are We All Scientific Experts Now?: a close-focus discussion of different sorts of expertise, ranging from that of the “beer mat” expert to those who genuinely can contribute to new knowledge, in other words, practising scientists.\n\nScientists are treated, throughout this book, as a monolithic grouping, which is obviously a vast oversimplification. The idea that there is only one way of doing science, which we can call “the” scientific method, is a view to which historians of science no longer subscribe. Furthermore, scientists are much less a race apart than Collins would imply; I believe it is dangerous to treat us as such and is likely only to reinforce the oft-discussed but somewhat imaginary and unnecessary fault line between science and the arts. Nevertheless, the virtues ascribed to scientists in Wave One of the sociology of scientific knowledge by researchers such as Robert Merton, of being “universalistic”, working by “organised scepticism” and driven by “disinterestedness”, probably do apply across the spectrum of science.\n\nWhere I think this book is strongest and the message most important is where Collins takes his ideas about different levels of expertise and translates them into the context of recent controversies. Was former South African president Thabo Mbeki creating a “fake scientific controversy” (to use Collins’ useful terminology) with his selective use of discredited science to drive his country’s attitude towards HIV/Aids treatments? Did journalists let parents and children down in driving the scare over the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella)vaccination based on one man’s flawed research? What about the apparent “tricks” alluded to in the “Climategate” emails leaked or stolen from the University of East Anglia – were the scientists behaving honestly?\n\nThe answer in all these cases, Collins says, is clearly yes and his analysis is useful. It would be good to believe that the media will learn that what they claim is evidence of “balance” in reporting some stories serves simply to perpetuate untruths that the collective scientific community – those who can claim the highest level of expertise and who are speaking with more or less a single voice – have examined and rejected.\n\nThis viewpoint may also explain why, in general, scientists are reluctant to appear on programmes such as BBC One’s Question Time: since they do tend to like to be precise, the requirement to give soundbites and less-than-nuanced responses to questions that are often beyond their area of expertise is unlikely to be appealing. And even when a microphone is thrust under their nose to respond to a question that is in their field, they are still likely to want to hedge their response to reflect genuine uncertainties. This isn’t a case of being slippery; it is a case of being frank within their confidence levels. Unfortunately, that isn’t always how the media report such uncertainty.\n\nThis is certainly a book for those who are interested in science and its role in society, rather than for practitioners themselves. For the former group I believe it ought to convey important messages. It is intended to be provocative and its introductory chapter infuriated me until I realised that Collins was putting forward straw men that the rest of the book was going to shoot down. He has come full circle in his arguments and, after many years (and several books), he has accepted that we are not all equal when it comes to science. Scientists do have, by virtue of their experience and training, a special place when it comes to knowledge, and Collins is now prepared to admit it. This could be seen as a recantation of his earlier, and much more negative, position. Indeed, he is quite disingenuous in the way he presents his position here, burying his own earlier scepticism about what expertise scientists possess.\n\nThis book doesn’t address the issue of how science should interface with policy and politics, although that is the context of many of Collins’ examples (turn to Roger Pielke’s The Honest Broker: Making Sense of Science in Policy and Politics if you want to grasp that particular nettle). It will doubtless fail to disabuse doubters such as Warner, and indeed many in the media, of the notion that scientists are knowingly engaged in a giant climate-change scam. But for others who are curious about how scientists tackle problems and why they do often have the answers, it should prove illuminating.\n\nThe author Harry Collins, distinguished research professor of sociology and director of the Centre for the Study of Knowledge, Expertise and Science at Cardiff University, was born in Hitchin, Hertfordshire “into a middling-orthodox Jewish family who evacuated London’s East End during the war. “I learned a huge amount from my parents – respect for education, knowledge and creativity; integrity; and the obsessiveness, enthusiasm and hard work that dragged them from the deep poverty of my early life to financial comfort by the time I was a teenager. Living life on the margins of society was also a good background for a sociologist.” He is married to Susan, a nurse practitioner, and they live with her two children in Penarth, “which is really part of Cardiff. My children from my previous partnership live and work in London and my ex-partner lives in Bath. We are all on good terms and all spend time together two or three days a year.” “We live five minutes’ walk from Cardiff Bay Barrage, which is a wonderful amenity, and our house has a garage/workshop attached, which I have fitted out to do lots of rough woodworking and other DIY.” As a child, recalls Collins, “I was a bit of a nerd. My parents taught me to be enthusiastic about great thinkers.” However, he adds, “I was a rotten undergraduate and have always been bad at exams. I was lucky to have become a university lecturer, but thereafter I flourished as I could use my non-scholarly talents such as obsessiveness and creativity. I also taught myself to write well – something I enjoy – and this, I think, has helped.” Collins has said that early in his academic career, he “chanced upon” something on gravitational wave science in New Scientist; from this chance encounter, he would later go on to make its scientists and research practices an object of study for many years. Asked whether he thinks scientists in that field are proud, irritated, bemused or resigned to have served for so long as his case study, he responds: “The gravitational wave scientists have nearly always been very generous about my project, even those who distrusted its academic integrity, accepting that I ought to be allowed to do my project just as they are allowed to do theirs. “In the main I have been surprised at how well my work has been received by those scientists and that, I think, is because they recognise how much effort I have put in to understanding their world – unique for an outsider. Nowadays we mostly like each other very much, although I try to keep irritating them.” Collins says his view of the sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) “has not changed since 1981, although I have added a new element to my work – ‘studies of expertise and experience’ – which looks in a different direction without contradicting what went before. However, the overarching field, science and technology studies (STS), has changed. It has become very politicised. This breaks my heart, as politics is so easy compared to discovery. To be good at politics all you have to do is say the same as everyone wants to hear; to be good at creativity you have to say something that no one wants to hear and convince them that it is true.” Does he see the late physicist Joseph Weber, whose work on gravitational wave detection would be discredited, as a tragic figure, a deluded one, or a dishonest man? And was he unusual among scientists? Collins responds: “Lots of people think Weber was dishonest – I don’t. I think he was a bit prone to kidding himself, but I think of him as a hero: without him we would not have the billion-dollar field of gravitational wave physics. Science is not always about being right; it is also about being determined.” It is often argued that the practice of both the sciences and the humanities (and society itself) would be greatly improved if schoolchildren and undergraduates were obliged to study both. Collins agrees wholeheartedly. “I think the American school and university system has a lot to teach us. It is very important to teach everyone some science, not only because it makes a good education but also because it instils integrity; in my most recent work I am arguing that it is science’s values that are the most important thing for our society. Having spent lots of time with both communities, I have come to respect and admire the scientists even as I try to re-describe what they do in social terms. Ironically, my SSK analyses is in tension with the mythology of science that gives rise to the values I admire; life is strange.” Early in his career, Collins took some memorable North American road trips. “I’ve done huge amounts of travelling and really enjoyed it,” he says. “But old age is catching up with me, and I keep having to cancel trips because of one ailment or another. We will have to see if there are any more problems in the queue after I get over the current labyrinthitis. My colleagues will be horrified to learn that I do not plan to retire if I can help it.” Had he the chance to magically acquire a skill or talent he does not now possess, Collins says he would ask “to be able to play a musical instrument with flair and, if I can be greedy, to be able to draw and paint”.

  "latent_3550": "Back in August, Nationalist opposition leader Devlet Bahceli took to Twitter to call Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan a “locally produced Hitler, Stalin or Qaddafi”:\n\nYönetim sistemi bir ki?inin eline kald?ysa vay halimize! Bizim yerli üretim Hitler’e, Stalin’e, Kaddafi’ye tahammülümüz olmaz, bu iyi biline — Devlet Bahçeli (@dbdevletbahceli) August 15, 2015\n\nThat comment came as Erdogan was busy undermining the coalition building process on the way to calling for new elections. \"Accept it or not, Turkey’s governmental system has become one of an executive presidency,\" Erdogan said, the day before the tweet shown above was published. \"What should be done now is to finalize the legal framework of this de facto situation with a new constitution,” Erdogan continued.\n\nFor anyone in need of a refresher, Erdogan’s plans to make Turkey an executive presidency were derailed in June when the pro-Kurdish HDP put on a better show at the ballot box than expected, robbing AKP of its absolute majority in parliament.\n\nThe President effectively nullified the election results by calling for a November redo ballot.\n\n\"He’s now saying 'I won’t listen to the laws or constitution.' This is a very dangerous period,\" warned Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the Main Republican People’s Party. \"He wants to give a legal foundation to this coup he’s carried out. Those who carry out coups always do this: First they carry out the coup, then they give it a legal foundation.’\"\n\nFast forward four months and we’ve seen Erdogan shoot down a Russian warplane and intensify a crackdown on the Kurds which many thought would dissipate once AKP reinstated its iron grip on politics in November.\n\nNow, as Erdogan pushes to officially transform the Turkish presidency from a figurehead role (obviously Erdogan is anything but a figurehead, but this is about enshrining powers he shouldn’t have into law) into a chief executive position, the President is appealing to history. As it turns out, the opposition aren’t the only ones who compare the strongman to Hitler.\n\n\"There are already examples in the world. You can see it when you look at Hitler's Germany,” Erdogan said on Thursday, when asked whether it was possible to maintain the unitary structure of the state under an executive presidential system. \"There are later examples in various other countries,\" he added, in an apparent effort to soften the blow.\n\nAKP agreed this week to work with CHP on a new constitution. As Reuters notes, “Opposition parties agree on the need to change the constitution, drawn up after a 1980 coup and still bearing the stamp of its military authors, but do not back the presidential system envisaged by Erdogan, fearing it will consolidate too much power in the hands of an authoritarian leader.”\n\nOf course PM and yes man par excellence Ahmet Davutoglu is on board. \"What is right for Turkey is to adopt the presidential system in line with the [democratic] spirit,\" he says. \"This system will not evolve into dictatorship but if we do not have this spirit, even the parliamentary system can turn into this [dictatorship].\" Who knows what that means other than that Erdogan won't get any argument out of Davutoglu.\n\n\"[Erdogan] wants a presidential system in Turkey. He did not change his mind after the last election. I think he will force that, somehow. And I think this is the last exit before the full dictatorship for Turkey,\" Ceyda Karan, an opposition journalist at Cumhuriyet newspaper, told RT. \"We’re dealing with the situation here that is close to a kind of civil war, and that is really dangerous – it is dangerous for Turkey domestically, and it is also dangerous for the international scene where Turkey, the US, Russia, Syria – all these countries, the Kurds are all involved in the struggle against ISIS in Syria and in Iraq.”\n\nYes, yes they are - and maybe that’s part of the reason why Erdogan despises them more now than ever.\n\nIf it's Hitler's Germany that Erdogan plans to model Turkey after once he manages to rewrite the constitution, we shudder to think what that will mean for the Kurds who are already being persecuted in places like Diyarbakir, Cizre, Silopi and Nusaybin.",

Mr. Rubio dropped out, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio is too far behind, and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas would need to win the vast majority of the remaining delegates — a near impossibility.\n\nBut Mr. Trump still needs to win most of the remaining delegates to avoid a contested convention.\n\nIf he continues his current performance and wins a series of key states — like California and New York — he would get the needed delegates.\n\nMr. Trump will probably need to win California, which has 172 delegates.

  "latent_3746": "A fire destroyed a 66-year-old man’s house in St. Paul and everything in it, including the TVs, but his cable service? He couldn’t get it canceled, at first.\n\nJimmy Ware lost all his possessions in the wind-whipped fire in St. Paul’s North End on April 1. Since then, his daughter said, she had been calling Comcast but was unable to cut off his service until Tuesday, when the company did so and issued an apology.\n\nAnother family that lost its house in the fire said they canceled their service easily.\n\nBut when Jessica Schmidt had called Comcast for her father, customer service representatives asked for Ware’s account number, saying they needed that to cancel his cable.\n\n“Gone in the fire,” Schmidt told them. Ware got on the line and provided the last four digits of his Social Security number, which Comcast told him was still not enough.\n\nSchmidt grew increasingly frustrated because she wanted to focus on helping her father with more serious matters, such as where as he’s going to live or how he’s going to rebuild his life. The retired trucker had no homeowners’ insurance.\n\n“I’ve said to Comcast, ‘Here’s your choice, disconnect the service or send someone out to fix the cable, because it’s not working,’ ” Schmidt said. “The (Comcast) guy said, ‘That doesn’t make sense, because the house burned down.’ I said, ‘Exactly, shut the service off.’ ”\n\nAfter Schmidt said she called Comcast four or five times, she heard from the company’s corporate office Tuesday. A representative said the matter hadn’t been handled properly, that Ware’s cable service had been canceled — backdated to the fire — and he wouldn’t be charged for the cable equipment, Schmidt said.\n\nComcast spokeswoman Mary Beth Schubert said in a statement Tuesday: “We understand that this is a difficult time for Mr. Ware and apologize for the inconvenience. Comcast has safeguards in place to protect the privacy of our customers, including not allowing unauthorized users to make changes to a customer’s account.\n\n“We do provide the option for customers to designate others, such as family members, to make authorized account changes and verifying an account can normally be done either over the phone or in person with a driver’s license,” the statement continued. “We will continue to stay in contact with Mr. Ware to make certain the issue has been resolved to his satisfaction.”\n\nA family affected by last week’s fire in St. Paul reported a better experience with Comcast. The home next to Ware’s, where Ngae Lay and Ta Pay Pay lived with their eight children, was also destroyed by the blaze on Front Avenue, near Western Avenue.\n\nA downed power line ignited dried vegetation, and the flames, fanned by high winds, spread to the houses.\n\nBarb Lawrence-Windholz, a friend of Ngae Lay and Ta Pay Pay, said she brought a family member of the family to Comcast’s Highland Park office in the days after the fire. She believes a representative accessed the family’s cable account through their home phone number and name.\n\n“They were wonderful,” Lawrence-Windholz said. “They helped me right away to cancel it.”\n\nWare, who grew up in the house that burned down, is now staying with a friend, his daughter said. He’ll likely have to move in with Schmidt until he can find a permanent residence.\n\nTad Vezner contributed to this report.\n\nHOW TO HELP\n\nFundraising websites have been set up for people who lost their homes and possessions in the fire.

  "latent_3796": "The patterns of human migrations around the world are fascinating to think about. Global movements reflect current events–whether war and strife, or economic opportunity and technological improvement–and these patterns also slowly reshape nations themselves.\n\nThat’s why it’s worth taking a few minutes to play around with this new interactive graphic of global migration patterns. In an unprecedented amount of detail, the graphic captures the movements in and out of 196 countries over the last 20 years (see here for the interactive version).\n\nBuilt with software normally used in the field of genetics, the visualization accompanies a new analysis published in the journal Science today that provides the most detailed look at migration patterns yet.\n\nCircular plot of migration flows of at least 170,000 people between and within world regions during 2005 to 2010. Tick marks show the number of migrants (inflows and outflows) in millions. Click to enlarge. Image courtesy of Abel et al., Science/AAAS.\n\nThe authors, from the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Human Capital in Vienna, combined country-level data and new census data from the United Nations to tease out how people moved between countries at five-year intervals. Previously these kinds of statistics were hard to capture.\n\nThe data disprove some misconceptions about global migrations. For example, many people–including scholars–believe that the number of people who leave their country of birth has been on the rise. But this proves untrue, according to the data. In fact, the percentage of the world’s population picking up their roots to cross borders has actually held quite steady at around 0.6% of the world’s population.\n\nA circular migration plot showing flows of at least 60,000 immigrants between 60 countries from 2005 to 2010. Tick marks indicate the number of migrants in 100,000s. Click to enlarge. Image courtesy of Abel et al., Science/AAAS.\n\nPlaying around with the graphic, I put on my amateur demographer hat and investigated some trends. For example, I know both after the two elections of President George W. Bush and President Obama’s first election many opponents threatened to move to Canada. It appears few followed up: Between 2000 and 2010, only about 180,000 people made that move, the graphic shows. I’ve always been interested in Rwanda’s history so I checked out the flows from there. As expected, zero people immigrated to Rwanda between 1990 and 1995, while 1.5 million people left the tiny country. Those were the years of and leading up to the 1994 genocide. But since, the country has stabilized and put the past largely behind it. Between 2005 and 2010, 56,000 people moved to Rwanda, while only 36,000 left–reflecting that recovery.\n\nIn their own far more professional analysis, the authors go over some new trends uncovered in their data. They show that the largest flows of people are happening between South and West Asia, from Latin America to North America, and within Africa.",
  "latent_3832": "by issuing currency—a liability that pays no interest—the Fed has reduced the interest expense of the government.\n\nby issuing interest-bearing reserves and using them to buy longer-term government debt (as in most of the Fed’s large-scale asset purchase [LSAP] operations), the Fed changes the maturity composition of the consolidated government debt. (In contrast, when the Fed buys agency mortgage-backed securities or debt issued by either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, it expands the consolidated government balance sheet since such debt is not a liability of the federal government.)\n\nMonetary policy affects economic activity, with implications for both revenues (for example, via tax collection) and expenditures (for example, because of automatic stabilizers).\n\nMonetary policy affects Treasury borrowing costs. This is true not only when the Fed changes interest rates with “conventional” monetary policy, but also when it changes rates with “unconventional” monetary policy (for example, LSAPs) via an effect on risk premia (see Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack).\n\nMonetary policy affects inflation. U.S. government debt is mostly nominal, which implies that changes in inflation affect the real cost of financing the debt.\n\nMarco Del Negro, Jamie McAndrews, and Julie RemacheIn 2012, the Fed’s remittances to the U.S. Treasury amounted to $88.4 billion. The vast majority of these remittances originated as income from the SOMA portfolio (see the second post in this series for an account of the history of SOMA income). While net income has been high in recent years because of the Fed’s large balance sheet, it is likely to drop in the future as the Fed normalizes interest rates. This is because the Fed will likely face increased interest expense on its reserve balances and possibly realize losses in the case of asset sales. A recent paper by economists at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( Carpenter et al. ) shows that under some scenarios the Fed may be forced to decrease its remittances to zero for a few years (see also the related work by Hall and Reis and by Greenlaw, Hamilton, Hooper, and Mishkin ). The fact that remittances may vary more over the next few years than they have in the past has highlighted the fact that monetary policy has fiscal implications. This post tries to cast the fiscal implications of monetary policy for public finances in a broad context. Like every household or firm, the federal government has a budget constraint: if it spends more than its revenues, it needs to accumulate debt (see the federal government’s flow of funds, Table F.105 of the Financial Accounts of the United States, Federal Reserve Z.1 statistical release ). Broadly speaking, government expenditures consist of purchases of goods and services, transfers (for example, to state and local governments), and the cost of servicing any interest-bearing debt. Government revenues come from taxes, tariffs, and remittances from the central bank. The Fed too has a budget constraint (see the Federal Reserve H.4.1 statistical release ): it derives income from its assets, has to pay operating expenses and interest on reserves, and, after adding to its capital stock and paying dividends, remits what is left to the Treasury (see Carpenter et al. for a more detailed description). Note that, unlike the federal government, the Fed does not pay interest on all of its liabilities: currency—a unique liability of the Fed—pays no interest.Since the central bank’s remittances to the Treasury enter the federal government budget constraint, it is useful to analyze the consolidated government budget (at the federal level) by summing together the Fed's and the federal government's budget constraints. To do this, you add the Fed's assets (SOMA portfolio, including Treasury debt held by the Fed) and liabilities (currency and reserves) to the federal government’s assets and liabilities (Treasury debt outstanding), and net out those Treasury liabilities that are owned by the central bank. As soon as you've done that you realize thatThis portion of Fed income is called seigniorage, the income derived from issuing paper currency. It also follows thatWhy has the maturity composition of the consolidated government debt changed because of the Fed’s actions? From the consolidated government view, reserves are simply very short-term government liabilities. So from the perspective of public finances, an LSAP swaps long-term for short-term government debt. Is this a good idea in terms of public finances? An LSAP that swaps long-term for short-term debt leaves the government, and therefore ultimately the taxpayer, exposed to a different interest rate risk profile, so that when rates go down, it may lower government financing costs—as measured by coupon and interest payments on debt—and vice versa when rates go up. The changes in consolidated government financing costs resulting from LSAPs partly show up in the federal government budget constraint as changes in remittances from the Fed. Therefore, in recent years, as LSAPs have been large and interest rates low, remittances have been high, but if rates were to increase, remittances would decrease, as pointed out by Carpenter et al., Hall and Reis, and the New York Fed’s report Domestic Open Market Operations during 2012 It is important to bear in mind, however, that the implications of Fed policy for government finances are much broader than the direct influence that remittances from the Fed’s earnings have on government finances. In fact, monetary policy influences the government’s finances in three additional ways:The combined effects of these last three channels are likely quite large. As we’ll explain below, through an illustrative scenario, the direct effects of monetary policy on economic activity can have an extremely large impact on government revenues and expenditures. To gauge the effects of monetary policy on borrowing costs directly and through inflation, we can gain some insight from a calculation by Christopher Sims in his AEA presidential address . Sims provides a rough calculation of the historical impact of surprise changes in interest rates and inflation on the real value of U.S. debt as a percentage of GDP, thereby giving us some sense of the magnitude of the effects from the last two channels. He finds that since the 1960s these effects have been large—“about the same magnitude of fluctuations as year-to-year fluctuations in the fiscal deficit”—again suggesting that these indirect effects of monetary policy on the government’s finances are substantial.Understandably, the attention given to the fiscal implications of LSAPs has focused on what’s most visible—namely remittances—because they appear as a line item in the federal budget. But the broader implications are also important, even if more difficult to measure. In principle, it is possible that returns to asset purchases, if measured narrowly by net income, could be negative, but the overall fiscal effect is still positive.Imagine a hypothetical scenario where, without LSAPs, the U.S. economy would have spun into a deflationary spiral. In that case, the real value of nominal government debt would have gone up, while revenues would have slumped in real terms. Remittances, measured in real terms, would likely have been quite high. Nonetheless, even from a pure public-finance perspective—leaving aside, for instance, any consideration of the (large) cost of unemployment—avoiding such a scenario would save the government a great deal in financing costs, and is therefore a good result from that narrow perspective.The LSAPs were part of the policies carried out by the Fed that may have helped steer the economy away from a deflationary spiral. As such, these policies were a good idea from a taxpayer’s point of view, even if they implied that remittances might be zero for a few years. In any case, our hypothetical scenario illustrates the need, when assessing the effects of monetary policy on the consolidated government balance sheet, to consider all the ways that monetary policy influences the economy, and thereby the government’s taxes and expenditures, and not just the more easily observable remittances made by the Fed each year to the U.S. Treasury.The views expressed in this post are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.

  "latent_3994": "In Northern English folklore, the Barghest or Barguest is a mythical monstrous black dog with large teeth and claws,[1] though in other cases the name can refer to a ghost or household elf, especially in Northumberland and Durham, such as the Cauld Lad of Hylton.\n\nOrigin of the name [ edit ]\n\n\"Ghost\" in Northern England was pronounced \"guest,\" and the origin is thought to be of the combination burh-ghest, \"town-ghost.\" Others explain it as cognate to German Berg-geist, \"mountain ghost\" or Bär-geist, \"bear-ghost\".[1] Another mooted derivation is Bier-Geist, the \"spirit of the funeral bier\".[2]\n\nDomain and description [ edit ]\n\nOne notable case is said to frequent a remote gorge named Troller's Gill in the Yorkshire Dales, Yorkshire, England. A ballad entitled \"The Legend of the Troller's Gill\" can be found in William Hone's Everyday Book (1830). It recounts the tale of a man who ventures forth \"to the horrid gill of the limestone hill\" in order to summon and confront the Barghest in an act of ritual magic. The man's lifeless body is discovered soon after with inhuman marks upon his breast.[3] There is also a story of a Barghest entering the city of York occasionally where, according to legend, it preys on lone travellers in the city's narrow Snickelways. Whitby is also associated with the spectre.[4]\n\nIn the 1870s a shapeshifting Barghest was said to live near Darlington and was said to take the form of a headless man (who would vanish in flames), a headless lady, a white cat, a rabbit, a dog, or a black dog. Another was said to live in an \"uncannie-looking\" dale between Darlington and Houghton near Throstlenest,[2] and yet another haunted an area of wasteland between Wreghorn and Headingley Hill near Leeds.[2][5]\n\nThe Barghest often serves as an omen of death. At the passing of a notable person the Barghest may appear, followed by all the other dogs of the local area in a kind of funeral procession, heralding the person's death with howling and barking. If anyone were to get in the Barghest's way it would strike out with its paw and leave a wound that never heals.[2]\n\nBesides taking the form of a large black dog with fiery eyes, it may also become invisible and walk about with the sound of rattling chains. It may also foretell the death of an individual by laying across the threshold of his or her house, and like the vampire the Barghest is unable to cross rivers.[3][5]\n\nIn popular culture [ edit ]\n\nMany stories feature ghostly black dogs. Dogs specifically named as barghests appear in the following:\n\nSee also [ edit ]",
  "latent_4163": "Note: For instructions on how to enter the giveaway, see the bottom of this post.\n\nIf you’ve been following my blog at all, you probably know that I’m a huge fan of pretty much everything Brandon Sanderson writes. I think it’s especially cool that many of his books are set on different planets in the same universe (the “Cosmere”), and that he plans to connect them all into an overarching story in the future. So when I found out that there was a Cosmere short fiction collection coming out, I was really excited to get it (even though I’ve already read many of the stories in it.)\n\nFirst, I’ll talk about the book’s structure. I thought it would just be organized like a regular short story collection, but it actually has more. There are in-universe write ups (written by Khriss, the same woman who writes the Ars Arcanum at the end of all Brandon’s other books) about each planetary system featured in the book and how the magic there works. I’ve read a lot of Cosmere theories and interviews by Brandon about the Cosmere, and there’s quite a bit of information in these that has not been covered anywhere yet. Also, there are gorgeous illustrations for each story, and postscripts by Brandon about how the story came to be.\n\nThere’s one new novella in this book that has never been published before – Edgedancer, which is set in the world of the Stormlight Archive and features Lift, who we’ve met in an interlude in Words of Radiance. The Stormlight Archive is probably my favorite series by Brandon, so I was particularly excited to read this story, and of course it did not disappoint. It offers great moments of character growth, and it seems like it will be important to understand how a particular character’s attitude changes between Words of Radiance and the upcoming third book. Plus, Lift is a great character and I’d love to keep reading about her. Also, we see a few new things about Roshar, I wasn’t expecting more worldbuilding and answers from such a short story. My only complaint is that now I really, really cannot wait a year for the next book.\n\nThere were two other stories that were new to me, although they have been published previously in the Mistborn RPG books – The Eleventh Metal and Allomancer Jak and the Pits of Eltania. They were fun stories, I enjoyed The Eleventh Metal a bit more because it featured Kelsier, and who doesn’t love Kelsier? Allomancer Jak and the Pits of Eltania was a nice homage to pulp adventure, though.\n\nI did reread all the stories I’d read previously as well. I absolutely love The Emperor’s Soul, I think it’s a really great standalone novella, and the fact that it’s set in the same world as Elantris and that it ties into the Cosmere just makes it better. The Hope of Elantris is a very simple story, but it’s cute, and it’s nice to see some of the backstory of what secondary characters were up to during the climax of Elantris. Mistborn: Secret History is pretty cool, I think it’s one of the first ones to actually delve directly into what’s going on with the Cosmere a little bit. I don’t want to say too much about it because even the protagonist’s name is a spoiler.\n\nI guess White Sand will be new to a lot of readers, but it’s one of Brandon’s unpublished books that you can email him to get a copy of, and I’ve done that. It’s being published as a graphic novel series now, and the book excerpts both the graphic novel and the beginning of the unpublished book. I was afraid that the excerpt wouldn’t be satisfying enough by itself, but I think it manages to tell a good and complete story.\n\nI first read Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell in George R.R. Martin and Gardner Dozois’ anthology Dangerous Women, and I love it. Threnody is a fascinating world, and the characters are different from the ones Brandon usually writes – darker and more serious. Sixth of the Dusk also has a very un-Brandon-like protagonist (someone who has trouble articulating himself), and the world is in a very interesting period as it evolves into the industrial age, prodded along by spacefaring humans. I think both of these stories are the most atmospheric in the book and I’d love to hear more from their world and characters in the future.\n\nOverall, I’d highly recommend this collection. I think most of the stories would work for someone unfamiliar with Brandon Sanderson’s other work and the Cosmere just as well – the only ones I’d be iffy about are Mistborn: Secret History, which is set during the original Mistborn trilogy and probably doesn’t have much impact without reading it, and The Hope of Elantris, which is likewise set during Elantris.\n\nTor Books is letting me give away two copies of Arcanum Unbounded!

  "latent_4196": "Manning, a 24-year-old native of Crescent, Okla., could face life in prison if convicted. | AP Photos Testimony on Manning's computer\n\nFORT MEADE, Md. - A computer-crimes investigator testified Sunday he found more than 10,000 diplomatic cables and other sensitive information on the work computer of the Army private charged with spilling a mountain of secrets to WikiLeaks.\n\nMoreover, Special Agent David Shaver told a military hearing he discovered evidence that someone had used the computer to streamline the downloading of the cables with the apparent aim of “moving them out.”\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt was the government’s first hard evidence linking Pfc. Bradley Manning with the wealth of confidential government information that showed up on WikiLeaks: battlefield reports from Iraq and Afghanistan, diplomatic communications, a military video showing a U.S. helicopter attack that killed 11 men, and more.\n\nShaver’s appearance capped the third day of a hearing that will determine whether Manning will be court-martialed on 22 charges, including aiding the enemy. The testimony was potentially the most damaging so far.\n\nShaver said the material he found at the intelligence analyst’s workstation in Iraq was all linked to the username bradley.manning or Manning’s user profile.\n\nHe said he examined two computers that were assigned to Manning while he was working in Baghdad in 2009 and 2010.\n\nThe other machine, he said, contained evidence that someone had conducted more than 100 searches using the keywords “WikiLeaks” and “Julian Assange,” the organization’s leader.\n\nThose terms seemed “out of place” on a computer that was used for analyzing intelligence about Iraq, said Shaver, who is to be cross-examined by Manning’s defense Monday.\n\nShaver told the hearing that in addition to the cables, he found assessments of Guantanamo Bay terrorist detainees and several versions of the 2007 helicopter attack video on Manning’s computer.\n\nManning’s lawyers have neither acknowledged nor denied that the intelligence analyst was behind the leaks.\n\nInstead, they have pressed the government to explain why Manning remained entrusted with access to highly sensitive information after showing hostile behavior to those around him. A supervisor who might have shed light on that question Sunday refused to testify.\n\nManning, a 24-year-old native of Crescent, Okla., could face life in prison if convicted.\n\nIn camouflaged fatigues and dark rimmed-glasses, he sat mostly forward for the third straight day, appearing calm, listening intently to the witnesses and occasionally writing on paper in front of him. He didn’t speak Sunday except for the few occasions he leaned over to consult with his civilian defense attorney, David Coombs, each time first switching off the defense table microphone for privacy.",

(Photo: Dave Wasinger/Lansing State Journal)Buy Photo\n\nSome precincts in Ingham County continue to struggle with technology issues amid high turnout, and county Clerk Barb Byrum is encouraging voters to do as much preparation as they can before heading to the polls.\n\nByrum said this afternoon that some tabulator machines had to be repaired and others had to be replaced, which she blamed on old, outdated machines.\n\n\"These machines are over 12 years old,\" she said. \"They run on Windows XP (software released in 2001 and no longer supported by Microsoft). The fact that we're having tabulator issues is not a surprise. I have been begging for new election equipment for over three years.\"\n\nByrum said voters with identification should have that at the ready as they head into their polling place. She also encourages voters to visit michigan.gov/vote to see their sample ballot and study their choices ahead of time.\n\nAmong the technology-related issues:\n\nEarly this morning at East Lansing's Precinct 16, at the Wesley Foundation on Harrison Road, some ballots were jammed in a tabulator machine, Byrum said this morning. She said any ballots that were not counted by the machine were placed in an auxiliary bin and will be counted.\n\nAlso this morning, a computer glitch at the polling place at Lewton Elementary in south Lansing caused voters in line to have to wait to cast their ballots, according to poll watcher Emily Dievendorf. The issue was fixed within 10 minutes, she said, and voters have been casting ballots without incident since then.\n\nByrum said she also regularly encourages anyone who can to vote absentee.\n\nOutside of the technology issues, clerks are reporting relatively smooth voting. There was a rush of voters before business hours, and clerks are expecting a rush as afternoon turns to evening. Polls close at 8 p.m. As long as people are in line by then, they will be able to vote.\n\n“We’re having a good turnout,” said Chris Swope, Lansing city clerk. “Most are being processed pretty quickly.”\n\nRoughly 50,000 voters were expected to head to the polls in the city of Lansing today. Swope said this will be one of the higher election turnouts, with an estimated 55% to 60% showing up. More than 11,000 absentee ballots have been cast, which is the highest the city has seen, he said.\n\nSo far, one voting machine has malfunctioned, Swope said, but it was replaced. The city has four back-ups and is working to get the malfunctioning one back online.\n\n“The election equipment is getting old and needs to be replaced,” he said, adding that they have been in use since 2005. “I hope this is the last election we use them.”\n\nAbout 100 people were lined up outside the gym at Parker at Memorial Baptist Church in south Lansing.before polls opened at 7 a.m., said Robin Smith, chair for precinct 16 in Lansing's Ward 2.\n\n\"As it gets toward the dinner hour, we expect a huge increase,\" she said.\n\nJamie Rice said she didn't mind the line zigzagging through the gym.\n\n\"I was happy about it,\" she said. \"I saw a lot of people in there, a lot of diversity.\"\n\nTony Stegall agreed.\n\n\"We need to utilize our American right,\" he said after voting. \"A lot of people don't take advantage of it and then want to complain later.\"\n\nThere have been no reported issues at the polls in Clinton County, despite a higher-than-expected turnout, said Diane Zuker, county clerk. She expects a voter turnout of more than 80%, or roughly 45,000 people in the county, compared to 71% in 2012.\n\nThe Michigan Secretary of State's Office confirmed Monday that Ingham County received 29,525 completed absentee ballots that morning. Eaton County received 14,238 and Clinton County received 9,375.\n\nPoll watchers out\n\nAt some of the highest-turnout precincts in Lansing, voters may encounter poll-watchers who are keeping an eye out for voting irregularities.\n\nDievendorf stood outside Lewton Elementary as part of what she described as a statewide \"election protection\" effort organized by a group of nonpartisan civic engagement groups. The effort happens every election but she said additional volunteers were trained this year because \"we are anticipating we might have some issues this election just because of the tensions we have been experiencing as a nation.\"\n\nVolunteers from the group are outside the 24 busiest polling places, she said.\n\nThe volunteers carry a list of voters' rights and will help voters who experience problems — everything from voter intimidation to being denied a ballot — by calling the appropriate clerk or even reaching out to a committee of attorneys the group has pulled together.\n\nCLOSE Emily Dievendorf is part of a statewide \"election protection\" effort run by a group of nonpartisan civic engagement groups. Justin A. Hinkley/The Lansing State Journal\n\nMeanwhile, inside the school, Lansing's Shari Ewing was watching the polls, unaffiliated with any group. She said she'd come out for the first time just \"to help out\" and \"make sure that everything goes smoothly and there are no problems.\" She said she'd seen none as of 10 a.m.\n\nThe student vote\n\nInside the Brody Cafeteria at Michigan State University, dozens of students lined up to vote as the odors of lunchtime meals wafted out from kitchens above.\n\nSeveral Clinton and Trump surrogates visited Michigan State University in the months before the election. This was the partial result. Approximately one-third of the 1,200 people registered to vote at Brody had done so before noon, said Kathleen Kiester, chairperson of Precinct 1.\n\nAt the MSU Student Union, voters were lining up by 6:30 a.m., said precinct chair Cathy Scott.\n\n“We’ve had amazing turnout so far,” she said, particularly compared to the August election, when only half a dozen voters turned out to cast their ballots in local elections.\n\nAlexander Alusheff and Justin Hinkley are reporters for the Lansing State Journal.

  "latent_4417": "The roster-building portion of the NFL offseason is all but over. Your favorite team's lineup is pretty much set, with the big names in free agency all snatched up and the 2016 NFL Draft in the books.\n\nHow did your favorite team do addressing its biggest needs heading into May and June OTAs? We're taking a team-by-team look with offseason exit interviews for each division. Next up: The NFC West.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers\n\nThree positives\n\n1. They hired Chip Kelly\n\nWhen Chip Kelly was hired by the 49ers back in January, he took over a team that was in complete disarray. Fortunately for San Francisco, Kelly's basically a janitor when it comes to cleaning up messes left by prior coaching staffs. Remember, during his first year in Philadelphia, Kelly took over a 4-12 team left by Andy Reid and turned it into a 10-6 playoff team. Not only that, but the Eagles actually won the division during Kelly's first year in Philly.\n\nThat being said, the NFC East isn't the NFC West and it's unlikely that Kelly's going to be able to pull off that type of turnaround in San Francisco. Although Kelly might not be able to completely clean up the mess left by Jim Tomsula in 2016, he's definitely a big upgrade over Tomsula, so it wouldn't be a surprise to see the 49ers easily surpass the 5-11 record Tomsula put together in 2015.\n\n2. They picked up two sure-fire starters in the draft\n\nThe 49ers didn't make a huge splash in free agency, but they definitely made up for that during the first round of the NFL Draft. Although the Niners only had one first-round pick going into the draft, they left Chicago with two first-round picks who should both turn into sure-fire starters in San Francisco.\n\nWith the seventh overall pick, the 49ers selected someone Chip Kelly's highly familiar with: DeForest Buckner. The former Oregon defensive end played one season under Kelly in Eugene before Kelly bolted to Philadelphia in 2013.\n\nThe 49ers also beefed up their offensive line by trading up to land Stanford's Joshua Garnett. After making a trade with Kansas City, the Niners were able to move up from the 37th spot in the draft to the 28th. Trading up for a guard can be kind of risky in most situations, but it feels like the 49ers made the right move here. Garnett will likely be the team's starting right guard when the 2016 seasons starts.\n\n3. They put the Colin Kaepernick drama behind them\n\nChip Kelly probably slightly regretted taking the 49ers coaching job after the Colin Kaepernick trade bomb dropped in February. At the NFL Combine, Kaepernick's agents demanded a trade, which turned into a nightmare for Kelly, because everywhere he went after that, he was pretty much only asked one question: Are you going to trade Kaepernick?\n\nBetween the combine and the NFL Draft, Kelly had to answer dozens of questions about Kaepernick, but now that the draft's over, those questions have died down, which has allowed Kelly to start coaching the team without the tension of Kaepernick's trade demands hanging over his every move.\n\nKaepernick reported to OTAs and he seems to be happy, which means Kelly's already doing a good job of cleaning up the mess left by Tomsula (and the 49ers front office).\n\nThree negatives\n\n1. They still don't have a starting quarterback\n\nIt's a good thing the Kaepernick trade drama is over because the 49ers are soon going to have deal with another type of drama: Quarterback controversy.\n\nIf Kaepernick had been traded, there would've been no quarterback drama in San Francisco because the job would've been handed to Blaine Gabbert. Instead, Kaepernick and Gabbert and going to duke it out to see who's the starter. Although it's easy to write off Gabbert because he's been pretty horrible during his five NFL seasons, it's hard to blame him for his struggles. The former first-round pick of the Jaguars has had to deal with five offensive coordinators during his five seasons in the league. That number jumped to six this year when Kelly and the 49ers hired Curtis Modkins.\n\nSpeaking of Kelly, he knows exactly what he wants in a quarterback, so this competition shouldn't last too long because he's going to play the guy who understands his system the best (Get the ball off quickly, don't take sacks, don't turn the ball over). Kaepernick's health will also play a key part in this competition. If he can't get healthy, it will be kind of tough to win the job. Kap had offseason surgery on his left shoulder and has also been dealing with knee and thumb injuries.\n\nWho wins the starting job in San Francisco? USATSI\n\n2. They're arguably worse at every offensive skill position\n\nThe Niners leading receiver from 2015 (Anquan Boldin) is no longer on the team and their leading rusher (Carlos Hyde) isn't exactly healthy. Hyde missed the final nine games of the season in 2015 after suffering a fracture in his foot during a Week 7 loss to the Seahawks.\n\nHyde could thrive in Kelly's system if he's healthy, but as of right now, it's hard to say how good he'll be. Hyde only rushed for 470 yards in 2015 and 35.7 of those yards (168) came in one game: The 49ers season opener. After that, Hyde only crossed the 60-yard mark one time over the final six games he played in.\n\nThe good news for the 49ers is that Hyde's foot was looking kind of healthy during some offseason training back in March.\n\n49ers Carlos Hyde and Bruce Ellington @el_guapo1 @_elling10 =============================== Everything I do with my athletes has an exact purpose for what they will need from their bodies when they are playing. There is No cookie cutter workouts at @dbcfit It's all about our approach and the details. #WhereDoYouTrain A video posted by David Alexander (@dzandertraining) on Mar 21, 2016 at 4:14pm PDT\n\nThe above video doesn't mean Hyde's foot will hold up in an NFL game, but it's obviously a good sign.\n\nAs for the receiving game, there were seven players who went over 300-yards in Philly last season under Kelly. On the other hand the 49ers had just four. The 49ers are going to have to figure out who they can get the ball to through the air (besides Torrey Smith).\n\nIf the 49ers are looking for someone to sign, they can always add James Jones. The Packers leading receiver from 2015 recently said that he'd like to play in San Francisco.\n\n3. The Anthony Davis situation keeps getting weirder\n\nIf you don't know who Anthony Davis is, or just forgot him, he's the 49ers offensive tackle who surprisingly decided to retire back in June 2015. The reason this situation is odd is because it seems like Davis wants to play football, he just doesn't want to play for the Niners, which is a problem because the Niners own his playing rights.\n\nAt least two times over the past two months, Davis has taken to Twitter to rip 49ers general manager Trent Baalke. In one tweet, Davis said that Baalke gives him a \"headache\" and in another tweet, Davis wrote that the 49ers front office isn't trying to win games.\n\nThe 49ers actually have a hole at right tackle and if a healthy Davis decided to return to football, that'd be a huge pickup for the 49ers offensive line. Unfortunately for San Francisco, it seems that Davis would rather send cryptic messages on Twitter than play football. As of June 1, the lineman hasn't applied for reinstatement.\n\nIf Davis does get back on the field, the 49ers will get a guy who started in every regular season game the team played in between 2010-2013.\n\nLos Angeles Rams\n\nThree positives\n\n1. They might actually have a quarterback\n\nGenerally, trading up to land a quarterback in the first round of the NFL Draft is a horrible idea. If you need proof, just consider that Johnny Manziel, Tim Tebow, Mark Sanchez and Ryan Leaf were all picked after a team traded up to get them in the first round of their respective drafts.\n\nThat being said, you can't fault the Rams for going after Jared Goff, especially since they haven't had anything that even slightly resembles a capable quarterback since Kurt Warner left town 13 years ago.\n\nIf the Goff pick pays off, it will almost make up for all the games that Rams fans had to sit through over the past 12 seasons where Sam Bradford, A.J. Feeley, Kellen Clemens, Shaun Hill, Nick Foles, Case Keenum, Marc Bulger, Jamie Martin, Ryan Fitzpatrick, Gus Frerotte or Brock Berlin, Kyle Boller or Keith Null was the starting quarterback. Almost makes up for it.\n\nIs Jared Goff finally the answer at quarterback for the Rams? USATSI\n\n2. They're finally in Los Angeles\n\nIf you've ever made a big move in your life, then you know that it's not easy. Whatever you experienced, multiply that by 100 and that's what the Rams had to go through. Not only did the team have to move computers, whirlpools and 1 million pounds of equipment, but the Rams also had to worry about getting each and every player situated in Southern California. The move didn't happen overnight either. As a matter of fact, the Rams didn't move out of St. Louis until March, which was a full two months after the NFL approved the team's move to L.A.\n\nNow that the Rams are officially in Los Angeles, several headaches should go away. The coaching staff won't be getting blitzed with relocation questions and players won't have to worry anymore about where they're going to live next year.\n\n3. They dumped some people they needed to dump\n\nEnding a long-term relationship is never easy. Just ask the Rams, who were forced to make some tough decisions this offseason. Three of those tough decisions were made on the same day (Feb. 19) when the team decided to cut ties with Chris Long, James Laurinaitis and Jared Cook.\n\nThe cuts probably weren't easy to make, but the Rams were almost certainly in a much better mood after they saw how much money they saved. The three cuts shaved roughly $23 million off the 2016 salary cap. If the Rams knew what to do what the kind of salary cap savings, this story would have a happy ending, but the team didn't really fill any holes during free agency.\n\nThree negatives\n\n1. They might have given up too much to land their quarterback\n\nThe downside of giving up everything to land the No. 1 pick in the draft is that if it doesn't work, then you just mortgaged your future. If Jared Goff somehow turns into a flop, then the Rams might end up being worse than they've been over the past 10 years, which is saying a lot because the Rams have been pretty bad.\n\nThe Rams had a front row seat to a similar trade in 2012 when the Redskins traded with them so they could land Robert Griffin III. Four years later, Griffin is no longer in Washington and neither is the coach who drafted him. As a matter of fact, the last six times a team has traded up in the first round to land a quarterback, the pick hasn't panned out (Mark Sanchez, Josh Freeman, Tim Tebow, Blaine Gabbert, RG3, Manziel).\n\nOn the other hand, the Rams could join the 1984 Patriots and the 1978 Oilers and make some NFL history. Before 2016, those were the only two teams ever to have traded up from a spot 15th or lower to land the No. 1 pick. The trade worked out in both cases: Both the Oilers and Patriots were in the AFC title game within two years.\n\nUnfortunately for the Rams though, neither team drafted a quarterback. The Patriots selected a receiver (Irving Fryar), while the Oilers selected a running back (Earl Campbell).\n\n2. Nick Foles decides he doesn't want to attend OTAs\n\nIf Nick Foles' goal this offseason is to make things as awkward as possible for the Rams, then he's probably going to succeed. In an ideal world, Foles would show up at OTAs with a smile on his face and help out Jard Goff. Instead, Foles has turned himself into a headline because he's decided to skip OTAs out of protest.\n\nTo be fair, Foles has no obligation to show up to OTAs -- they're voluntary -- but it's still a bad look. The Rams just gave him a two-year, $24.5 million contract that included $13.8 million in guaranteed money. If someone gives you that kind of dough, the least you can do is not cause them a headache, and make no mistake, Foles being a no-show is headache for the Rams whether they'll admit it or not.\n\n3. They lost half of their secondary and there's some legal issues for half of the half that stayed\n\nAfter three years together, the Rams secondary has officially been broken up. The unit of Rodney McLeod, Janoris Jenkins, T.J. McDonald and Trumaine Johnson had basically started every game together in the Rams secondary since 2013, but that won't happen anymore now that Jenkins (Giants) and McLeod (Eagles) both dipped out of town and headed for the NFC East.\n\nBoth players received huge contracts with their new teams and letting them walk might have made financial sense, but that doesn't hide the fact that there's now a gaping hole in the Rams secondary. That gaping hole could bust open even more if McDonald gets suspended by the NFL. The Rams safety was charged with a non-alcoholic DUI after an arrest on May 10.\n\nSeattle Seahawks\n\nThree positives\n\n1. They were ready for Marshawn's retirement\n\nIf Marshawn decides to come back, there might not be any room for him in the Seahawks backfield. Coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider obviously had a game plan ready in case Lynch retired and they put that plan into action during the NFL Draft. During the three-day event, the Seahawks selected a total of three running backs in C.J. Prosise (third round), Alex Collins (fifth round) and Zac Brooks (seventh round).\n\nThose three will join Thomas Rawls and Christine Michael in a Seahawks' backfield that's suddenly crowded. The added depth is good news for Rawls, who shouldn't feel any pressure to return early. Rawls is still recovering from a broken ankle he suffered in December.\n\n2. They brought back some familiar faces\n\nIf you own a Chris Clemons or Brandon Browner Seahawks jersey, hopefully you didn't throw those away when the two left Seattle during free agency, because both players have returned. (On the other hand, if you own a Brandon Browner Saints jersey, you can probably get rid of that one.)\n\nAlthough Clemons and Browner were both relatively successful during their time with the Seahawks -- which helped them score huge contracts in free agency -- both players struggled once they left and are now back in Seattle on relatively small deals.\n\nClemons, a former Jaguar, signed a one-year, $1.5 million deal to return. As for Browner, he signed an even smaller deal to return to Seattle (one-year, $760,000), although he probably doesn't care because he just fleeced the Saints for $7.75 million in guaranteed money -- or as he put it, \"Saints weak a-- f--- I took that few millions ran with it sucka.\"\n\nThat's way more eloquent than anything I could have written.\n\n3. Ricardo Lockette's retirement\n\nA retirement doesn't usually qualify as a \"positive\" thing during the offseason, but it does in Lockette's case. The wide receiver announced on May 12 that he's done playing football. One of the main reasons that Lockette had to call it quits is because he's having trouble moving his head. Remember, this is a guy who almost died on the field after taking a crushing blow during a November game against the Cowboys.\n\n\"Tough day for me, but I don't want anyone to be sad,\" Lockette said.\n\nThe wide receiver also said he had no regrets about retiring: \"I love my family, and I'd rather walk.\"\n\nThree negatives\n\n1. Russell Wilson running for his life is something that's likely to continue\n\nPete Carroll and John Schneider do a great job of identifying talent, but it's almost as if they've given up on trying to make the Seahawks offensive line better. If Russell Wilson was hoping that his team would beef up the line this offseason, he's going to be depressed when he shows up for minicamp because that definitely didn't happen.\n\nOver the past three months, the Seahawks lost two starters on the offensive line (Russell Okung, J.R. Sweezy) and didn't exactly bring in adequate replacements (Bradley Sowell, J'Marcus Webb). Of course, the fact that the Seahawks' offensive line struggles almost every year isn't completely related to the amount of talent on the line, it also has to do with amount of money the Seahawks spend on that talent. According to OverTheCap.com, the Seahawks have only spent $11.69 million on their offensive line in 2016. That's an extremely low number when you consider that the Vikings have spent $43 million and no other team has spent less than $15 million.\n\nFor the third year in a row, Russell Wilson running for his life and then making a spectacular throw while being hit will probably be the most successful play in the Seahawks' playbook.\n\nRussell Wilson will be on the run again in 2016. USATSI\n\n2. They let two defensive starters walk\n\nIn what has basically become an annual tradition, a starter from the Seahawks defense jumped ship to sign with another team. This year, it was actually two starters who jumped ship when Brandon Mebane signed with the Chargers and Bruce Irvin signed with the Raiders. Of course, those two weren't jumping off a sinking ship, they were going to a ship that had way more money on it: Mebane signed a three-year, $13.5 million deal, while Irvin signed a four-year, $37 million deal.\n\nAlthough both losses could sting, they likely won't and that's because the Seahawks have managed to overcome major defensive losses in the past. After the 2013 season, they lost Clemons and Browner, and managed to get along just fine. The Seahawks also lost Byron Maxwell after the 2014 season and managed to survive, so although the losses of Mebane and Irvin could hurt early, they probably won't hurt for long.\n\n3. Marshawn Lynch's non-retirement retirement\n\nIt's been almost four months since Marshawn Lynch unofficially retired during the Super Bowl, yet, we're still talking about him today because no one seems to know if he's actually retired. Richard Sherman and Seahawks general manager John Schneider both seemed unsure about Lynch's future plans when they were recently asked whether or not they thought he would stay retired.\n\nThe negative here is that if Lynch does come back, the Seahawks will have to decide pretty quickly what they're going to do with him. Although the Seahawks placed Lynch on the reserve-retired list on May 5, that doesn't make him retired. Lynch still hasn't filed his retirement papers, which means all he has to do to play in 2016 is let the NFL know that he wants to play. At that point, Lynch would be taken off the reserve-retired list and the Seahawks would have an $11.5 million decision to make.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, it seems like the Seahawks have already moved on from Lynch, so if he does decide to unretire, it's very likely that Seattle wouldn't hang on to him.\n\nArizona Cardinals\n\nThree positives\n\n1. They pulled off the best trade of the offseason\n\nIt's not often that you can add an elite pass-rusher to your roster for under $8 million, but that's exactly what the Cardinals did in March when they pulled off a trade for Chandler Jones. All the Cards had to give up to land Jones was trade a player they didn't want anymore (Jonathan Cooper) and a second-round pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. It was probably the easiest trade that Cardinals general manager Steve Keim will ever make in his life.\n\nThe Cardinals defense was already good and the addition of Jones has the potential to make them great this season. It's almost unfair that the Cards will have Jones and Calais Cambell on the same defensive line (Plus first-round draft pick Robert Nkemdiche). Arizona had the fifth-best defense in the NFL in 2015, so don't be surprised if they crack the top 3 in 2016.\n\nThe Cards are ecstatic about landing Chandler Jones in a trade with the Patriots. USATSI\n\n2. They added by subtraction on the offensive line\n\nUnlike the Seahawks, the Cardinals aren't afraid to spend money on their offensive line, something they proved once again this offseason when they brought in veteran guard Evan Mathis on a one-year, $6 million deal. The move comes two years after the Cards brought in Jared Veldheer and one year after they brought in Mike Iupati. The Cardinals are slowly constructing a Frankenstein offensive line that will likely dominate the division in 2016.\n\nIn Mathis, the Cardinals get a player who's an instant upgrade over Jonathan Cooper.\n\nBy the way, Cooper wasn't the only offensive lineman to leave Arizona this offseason, the Cardinals also lost Bobby Massie to the Bears. However, \"lost\" might not be the right word to use there because the Cardinals were completely OK with his exit. When you lose two linemen and only sign one, but still improve your team, that's some old-fashioned addition by subtraction.\n\n3. Tom Brady's suspension\n\nIf Tom Brady's four-game suspension sticks, the biggest winner would probably be the Cardinals. The Patriots only play one road game during Brady's suspension and it happens to be at Arizona in the regular-season opener.\n\nAlthough there are no easy games in the NFL, there are definitely winnable games and the Patriots game becomes a lot more winnable if Brady's out. The Cardinals' 2016 schedule is actually front-loaded with winnable games, and if Arizona can get past New England in the opener, they'll have a good shot of starting 6-0.\n\nAnd by the way, don't think this Brady suspension isn't being talked about in the Cardinals locker room. As a matter of fact, Larry Fitzgerald didn't even try to hide his feelings when he was asked recently if he wanted Brady to play in the opener.\n\n\"C'mon, man, I think that's a pretty easy question to answer,\" Fitzgerald said. \"I love Tom, that's my man. But if he doesn't play, I wouldn't shed any tears. I'd love to see him back the next week, though.\"\n\nThree negatives\n\n1. Everyone's going to be a free agent after 2016\n\nIf the Cardinals are going to win a Super Bowl, they might want to do it this season, because there's quite a few guys who likely won't be around after 2016. There could be a mass exodus from Arizona after this season because several important contracts are set to expire.\n\nTyrann Mathieu, Calais Campbell, Larry Fitzgerald, Michael Floyd, Chandler Jones, Evan Mathis and Jeramine Gresham are all starters going into the final year of their current deal. The Cardinals will likely get something done with the Honey Badger before the 2016 season starts, but unless the NFL abolishes the salary cap, don't look for all of the other guys to return to Arizona in 2017.\n\n2. Negotiations with the Honey Badger could get interesting\n\nIt's pretty much a certainty that the Cardinals are going to give a contract extension to the Honey Badger, but it's not clear when that's actually going to happen. Negotiations with Mathieu could get tricky for two reasons: For one, he's coming off an ACL injury for the second time in three years.\n\nMathieu tore his right ACL in December, an injury that came two years after he tore his left ACL in a December 2013 game.\n\nThe other tricky part of negotiations is that it's not clear what position Mathieu plays. The Cards basically put Honey Badger on the field wherever they see fit, which sometimes means he's playing safety and sometimes means he's playing corner. That's fine and dandy when he's on the field, but it's not an easy thing to hash out in terms of a contract because the NFL's best corners make a lot more money than the NFL's best safeties.\n\nThe good news for the Cardinals is that Mathieu doesn't want to be paid like a corner, it sounds like he's willing to split the difference between the two positions.\n\n\"I just want to get paid as a top defender,\" Mathieu told ESPN.com recently. \"I don't want to be slotted as a corner or a safety, because I'm not Patrick Peterson and I'm not Earl Thomas. I'm kind of different than both of those guys, but I still have the same type of impact on the game as those guys do.\n\n3. They still need to fill some minor holes\n\nWhen it comes to their offensive and defensive starters, the Cardinals don't have any glaring holes on their roster, but they could definitely stand to beef up their depth at a few key positions. Both the offensive line and secondary could use another player or two. Right tackle D.J. Humphries, who was the 24th overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft, has never played in a regular season game, so it'd probably be smart for the Cardinals to make sure they have some extra depth behind him.",
  "latent_4453": "In about eight months, the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party will war at the ballot box for the state of NSW. Corflutes will be mounted, flyers distributed, telephone numbers dialed, and meals interrupted. The foot soldiers of the operation will be the parliamentary parties’ respective youth wings: Young Labor and the Young Liberal Movement.\n\nRecently, the NSW State Conference showcased the best of the worst of the Labor Party: inter-factional squabbling, ideological gulfs, and abrasive and very public sledging. The factions, Centre Unity (Labor Right) and the Socialist Left (Labor Left), were noisy and visible.\n\n“The Young Liberals are the epicenter of factional intrigue for the entire party.”\n\nOn the other side of the fence, however, one hears little and sees less. The Liberal Party has an adroit capacity for suppressing public dissent about internal issues, particularly among its younger members. Former President of the Sydney University Conservative Club Brigid Meney cited this “very strict media policy” when she declined to be interviewed for this feature investigation.\n\nTo the public, the pews of John Howard’s broad church seem deathly quiet.\n\nIn early 2014, John Ruddick broke the silence. A Liberal party member of 20 years and prominent reform advocate, he decried the state of the Young Liberals in an email to 10,000 Liberal party members. “The YLs [Young Liberals] are often dismissed as an innocuous youth group… that is false. Under the current anti-democratic structure of the NSW Liberal Party the YLs [Young Liberals] are the epicenter [sic] of factional intrigue for the entire party.”\n\nA variety of sources close to the Young Liberal movement spoke to us about the clandestine operations of the factions, the Sydney University Club (SULC), and the Young Liberal movement – albeit on the condition of partial anonymity. Corroborating evidence in leaked emails and excerpts from the club’s constitution and meeting minutes flesh out the rest of the saga.\n\nFactional Fisticuffs?\n\nOn a campus level factional brawling has historically taken place behind closed doors in tensely stacked-out annual general meetings. Following the Centre Right’s victory for the control of SULC in 2011, the battleground has moved to O-Week stalls and social events, where factions vie to recruit new members.\n\nA scuffle at this year’s O-Week between members of the Centre Right-aligned SULC and the Hard Right Conservative Club underlines the hostility between two battling factions. The clubs’ stalls were initially placed side by side, but by Thursday were inexplicably separated. Despite mounting evidence that an altercation took place, the President of the Conservative Club and the President of SULC issued a joint statement denying any hostility between the parties.\n\n“On Thursday, the USU decided that given the similar appearance of the stalls, they should be separated. This was welcomed by both clubs.”\n\nThe true story was borne out in the minutes of a University of Sydney Union Clubs and Societies (C&S) Committee meeting held in May.\n\n“[Conservative Club President Chaneg] Torres says the Liberal Club were acting aggressively towards them during O-Week. He says they have photographic evidence and O-Week Directors had to tell them several times to stop,” the minutes of the meeting read.\n\nThen-SULC President Alex Dore lodged a complaint against the Conservative Club. According to the minutes of the meeting, he requested the club “be deregistered or that the C&S committee require the Conservative Club to place a clause in their constitution saying they cannot use Liberal Club paraphernalia in their promotional materials.”\n\n“Many people do not feel they have a home in the Liberal Club … because they are simply barred from membership.”\n\nEmails sent by Dore, obtained by Honi Soit, also indicate the Centre Right’s general wariness of rival Liberal factions on campus. “We need to keep monitoring the Group [Moderates] and Tali [sic] on campus. I’ll chat with [REDACTED] about [REDACTED] – the more we can ostracise him in college, the better,” Dore wrote in May 2012. The “Tali” referred to in the email is short-hand for the Taliban Right, a nickname for the Hard Right.\n\nAnother missive sent later that year in September reveals an attempt by Dore to frustrate the Inaugural General Meeting (IGM) of the Small Government Society, an initiative spearheaded by the Moderates on campus. Allegedly in order to draw bodies to the room, Dore set up a bar tab at Manning an hour before the meeting. “We will primarily be trying to get it [Small Government Society] knocked out through C&S Committee, but we can’t take the risk that it will go through so we need the numbers,” Dore wrote. “The Left are very confident that they have the numbers, and so every person that we can possibly bring will be useful.”\n\nThe operation was absolutely covert. The email contains the caveat: “Importantly; we need them to think we’re not bringing people along.” Earlier that year in May, Dore wrote a letter to Honi outlining his position on stacking. “We [SULC] know from first-hand experience how damaging stacking is,” he wrote. “We have zero tolerance of such activities, and I will revoke the membership of any person found to be complicit in such an act.”\n\nOur Factions, Ourselves\n\nA lot of people would quote this classic Liberal axiom: ‘There are no factions in the Liberal Party,’” said Margaret*, a current member of the Young Liberal movement. “They’re more so political alliances.”\n\nThough Margaret may distinguish the alliances of the Liberal Party from the “institutions” of Labor Right and Labor Left, the divisions in the Liberal Party and its youth wing, the Young Liberal movement, are certainly real and allegedly vicious.\n\nFor the past 50 years the frontbench of the Federal Liberal Party has contained at least one former SULC member.\n\nThe consensus among the those interviewed is that three “factions” exist within the Liberal Party: the Hard Right, the Centre Right and the Moderates. Every person interviewed confirmed the existence of these factions. Some however, like Margaret, denied their rigidity. Characterisations of the Hard Right and Moderates’ ideologies were largely consistent and undisputed by everyone we interviewed. The Centre Right, on the other hand – the dominant force within SULC – is the youngest of the bunch and emerged the least well-defined.\n\nSince its inception, SULC has remained one of the most powerful student Liberal Clubs in Australia. For the past 50 years the frontbench of the Federal Liberal Party has contained at least one former SULC member. Though the Centre Right lacks force at the State level, their ability to wedge the Hard Right and the Moderates in the Young Liberal Movement has rewarded its fledgling lieutenants.\n\nFormer NSW Young Liberal President Simon Fontana, former SULC President Alex Dore, and former NSW Young Liberals Metropolitan Vice President Tobias Lehmann (who shared his position with Dore) are all members of the Centre Right. Dore is tipped to be the next State President of NSW.\n\nThe Centre Right’s use of wedge tactics has drawn fire from the established factions of the Liberal Party. “SULC is in the middle, it doesn’t have a really clearly defined ideology,” said Adam*, a current member of SULC. “The focus is on power and ambition rather than developing political ideas.”\n\nClaire*, a former member of SULC and the Young Liberal Movement, described the Centre Right as “the Ambition Faction, because they’ll work with either to get what they want.” This epithet was repeated, without prompt, by separate parties – albeit from rival factions.\n\n“Importantly; we need them to think we’re not bringing people along.”\n\nDefenders of the Centre Right assert the faction fills a niche between the Hard Right and Moderates. A former member of SULC, aligned with the Centre Right, said “the Soft Right has the broadest ideological base for people who find either of the two other factions uncomfortable”.\n\n“100 Forms a Year”\n\n“SULC is very much the base of the Soft Right at the moment,” said Arthur*, a former executive member of SULC. “It brings in around 100 forms per year.” SULC holds significant power in the Young Liberal movement; its status as the premier Liberal Club of Sydney University makes it a powerful base for recruitment into the movement and the Centre Right. Estimates by a variety of sources suggest that student organisations represent 30 per cent of total party sign-ups.\n\nO-Week in particular is a significant recruitment period for the club. “There’s several hundred members they [SULC] get during O-Week,” Adam says. “The Liberal Party is a very recognisable brand, so a lot of first-years will join up, especially [from] Eastern Suburbs feeder schools.”\n\nIt’s worth noting that recruiting students to youth branches is not unique to SULC. Claire alleged the practice is “commonplace from what I’ve seen for the political clubs to sign people up to their respective youth branches”. Several sources contended recruitment is an inevitable consequence of hosting political clubs on campus.\n\nOne respondent analogised the situation to a cupcake business. “It’s like if you had a cupcake society and you had a senior cupcake organisation,” they said. “Why don’t you join this? You obviously have mutual interests.”\n\n“[University Liberal] clubs have a strategic importance to the Party,” Margaret said. “Senior party figures have to come from somewhere … and one of the areas that they often come from – as the majority come from – is University bases.”\n\n“We need to keep monitoring the Group [Moderates] and Tali [sic] on campus.”\n\nUniversity clubs like SULC are particularly significant for the party’s upstart Centre Right faction. Arthur explains the Moderates’ sizeable amount of MPs in parliament gives them access to high schools, a significant source of recruitment, while the Hard Right naturally draw members from churches and religious institutions. The Centre Right, however, lacks these particular historical and institutional advantages, and instead relies on politically active campuses like USyd and UNSW.\n\nHoni understands that members of the club’s executive obsess over securing factional support from ‘high potential’ new members or, as they’re referred to internally, HIPOs. A number of former SULC members have attested to the high ‘churn rate’ of SULC membership, resulting in many members falling out of the faction. Securing the support of new, charismatic members is therefore crucial to furthering factional interests.\n\nAn internal document sent out to senior members of the Club prior to a new members’ night in 2012 suggests the priority when talking to new members should be to “make them solid supports [sic] of the Centre-Right”, and to “make them want to get more involved in the party”.\n\n“Senior SULC members should be ‘on … guard in case someone is a mole’.”\n\nSenior members in attendance at the drinks were then expected to provide written reports on the people they had met. The internal document also appears to reveal the Club’s intense suspicion of opposing factions. It recommends that, although “the Tali or the Left” are not expected to “send operatives” to the event, the senior SULC members should be “on … guard in case someone is a mole”.\n\nSimilar policies, which paired senior SULC members with HIPOs in mentoring roles, were used in 2013. Arthur emphasises that the Club aims to create a social connection, rather than a political one: “It makes it a lot harder for those people to break away… because essentially it means going against their friends.”\n\nTwo Rights Make A Fight?\n\nThe contest over recruitment and branch stacking may drive hostility between SULC and the Conservative Club. “If there’s no other club on campus signing people up on O-Week or Re-O Day, then you’re getting every single Liberal that walks through the gate,” Claire said. Charlie went further, alleging it was “an attempt to gain a monopoly over right-leaning Liberal students on campus.”\n\n“It [SULC’s complaint made to C&S] really reflected that they [SULC] have concerns about the Conservative Club gaining influence over the right-wing student circle at Sydney University and tapping into that base,” he said.\n\nRegardless, SULC emerged the victors in the C&S spat. Following the May meeting, the C&S Committee issued the following resolution: “The Conservative Club shall be prevented from representing itself in such a manner as to lead a reasonable prospective member to believe the club was affiliated with any one political party.”\n\nOf particular significance was the order that: “The club shall not display Australian political party official election branding.”\n\n“They have concerns about the Conservative Club gaining influence over the right-wing student circle at Sydney University and tapping into that base.”\n\nDespite reports of the heated nature of the committee meeting, a spokesperson for the Conservative Club denied allegations of disunity between the two clubs. “The Sydney University Conservative Club looks forward to continuing their amicable relationship with the Sydney University Liberal Club to oppose the radical left on campus, and in Australian culture generally.” When asked about the clubs’ relationship, SULC President Will Dawes referred us to the statement provided by the Conservative Club.\n\nSnakes and Branches\n\nTo be elected national President of the Young Liberals is to join the ranks of Liberal Party elite. With the position comes authority and access; the President holds a vote in Federal and State pre-selection and routinely rubs shoulders with senior party players and operators.\n\nDespite these perks, Margaret said the presidency is “not a hardly coded position of power, it’s more a representation of power”.\n\nAlong with the prestige, the presidency brings with it functional, factional value. “The President of the Young Liberals has access to the referral system,” Arthur said. Allegedly, this allows the sitting king to direct new members to specific, faction-aligned branches. “You could game that system a lot more effectively, if you were in control of it,” he said.\n\nThere are over 50 branches in which Young Liberal factions do battle. These branches play a pivotal role in the election of the State and National Young Liberal Executive, including the Presidents. A branch is given a delegate for every ten members it has. A typical branch hosts 30 to 40 members. The number of delegates is capped at six per branch.\n\n“You could game that system a lot more effectively, if you were in control of it.”\n\nGiven the electoral power of individual members through this branch structure, every sign-up matters. Branches vote for branch delegates, who, in turn, directly elect the State Executive.\n\nSeveral respondents alleged SULC actively recruited members to the Young Liberal movement and referred them to Centre Right-aligned branches to boost the number of allied delegates they held. New recruits to the Young Liberal movement can be directed to branches by request, or through an online referral system. A majority of prospective members do not typically know the names of branches, let alone the factions that operate them, Margaret claims.\n\n“There is no doubt the factional intrigue and knife-fight politics of SULC extends beyond campus.”\n\nShe alleges that sign-ups from SULC “probably get some advice” on Young Liberal Party branches. “And of course… you’re going to want them to join your own branch.”\n\nAdam explained that the conversation usually goes like this: “If you’re interested in becoming an active part of the party, it’s just $35, give us your credit card numbers. Don’t worry about the Branch or anything like that we’ll select the right Branch.”\n\n“It’s really quite beautifully subtle,” he added.\n\nWhen asked if this process occurred, Arthur replied in the affirmative: “100 per cent and I was actively involved in that.”\n\nThis claim has been challenged, however, by an anonymous former member of SULC. “When someone leaves their choice of branch blank, the form goes to the Young Liberal executive (different from the SULC executive) and can be influenced from there,” the member said. “Are branches recommended? Sure, because some branches are more active and have more people from the club in them, so they’ll know more people. But if someone wants to join a branch, SULC has no influence whatsoever.”\n\nAnti-Stacking Measures: It’s the Vibe\n\nA set of peculiar ‘anti-stacking’ measures introduced into the SULC Constitution in 2009 have enabled the Centre Right to retain power over the club’s Executive and successfully bat away a number of factional challenges.\n\n“The Constitution is nearly impossible to obtain through official channels.”\n\nAccording to Dawes, these constitutional mechanisms were “recommended by the C&S Office” to “deter stacking”. Their aggregate effect, however, has been to not only to deter cynical factional rivals, but to preclude legitimate challenges to Centre Right control.\n\nThe Constitution is nearly impossible to obtain through official channels. Repeated requests from Honi to Dawes, SULC Secretary Joshua Crawford, Immediate Past President Alex Dore, and the C&S office were ignored.\n\nOne of the more controversial ‘anti-stacking’ measures in the Constitution is the ‘two signature’ rule. Section 4.2 of the SULC Constitution states that every new member of SULC must have their official membership form counter-signed by both the SULC President and Secretary. To Honi’s knowledge this measure does not exist in the constitution of any other society.\n\nClaire alleges that in 2012 she witnessed members of the SULC executive cross-checking member signup forms with the Facebook profiles of new members. If such prospective members were friends with well-known Moderate-aligned students, she explains, their applications for ordinary membership of SULC would not be countersigned.\n\nSimilar suggestions about the Club’s selective membership were made by a member of the Conservative Club at the C&S meeting in May. Despite having a receipt for paying his ordinary membership fee in O-Week, Conservative Club Vice-President Alessandro Cowley alleged his membership still hadn’t been accepted by SULC, according to the meeting’s minutes. Conservative Club President Chaneg Torres made similar comments to the C&S Committee. He alleged that “many people do not feel they have a home in the Liberal Club … because they are simply barred from membership.”\n\nDawes denied the allegations in a statement to Honi. He said the assertion that “particular students have been refused membership based on affiliations or exclusivity” was “totally incorrect”. Additionally, a former member of SULC said the allegations were “simply not true”. The provisions were “designed to prevent individual members of the SULC executive from arbitrarily adding people to the membership register”, they said.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is no doubt the factional intrigue and knife-fight politics of SULC extends beyond campus. An email sent by Dore in September 2012 implicates his involvement in the affiliation of a “Centre-Right UNSW Liberal Club”. Earlier this year Dore, Dawes, Crawford and Dean Shachar (current SULC Vice-President) attended the IGM of the UNSW Conservative Club. Tharunka reported their presence was part of a larger movement to “prevent the Conservative Club from forming on campus due to [its] perceived connection with the hard right, religious faction of the Liberal Party”.\n\n“One respondent informed us ‘the party’ was cracking down and would be unable to answer simple follow-up questions.”\n\nYoung Liberal lieutenants are frequently employed as staffers for MPs. Members from all factions accused each other group of allocating staffing jobs based on factional nepotism. Honi has been unable to verify these accusations.\n\nThe Liberal Party’s broad church knows to keep a tight lock on the feuding within its house. Young Liberal Elliot Donazzan was threatened with a five-year expulsion from the party for advocating internal reform and starting a website, entitled “Young Liberals for Democracy”. One respondent informed us “the party” was cracking down and would be unable to answer simple follow-up questions. Another requested we destroy our recordings and transcripts upon the article’s completion.\n\nIt is often assumed that students progress from university politics to party politics. In reality, they’re one and the same.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect anonymity.\n\nSULC President Will Dawes declined to be interviewed for this piece. He declined to comment on the allegations raised, beyond a general statement.\n\nFormer SULC President Alex Dore also declined to comment.",
  "latent_4490": "This article is about the musician. For other people with this name, see Paul Stanley (disambiguation)\n\nStanley Bert Eisen (born January 20, 1952), known professionally by his stage name Paul Stanley, is an American musician, singer, songwriter and painter best known for being the rhythm guitarist and singer of the rock band Kiss. He is the writer or co-writer of many of the band's highest-charting hits. Stanley established The Starchild character for his Kiss persona.\n\nHit Parader ranked him 18th on their list of Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time. Gibson.com Readers Poll also named him 13th on their list of Top 25 Frontmen.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nStanley Bert Eisen was born January 20, 1952, in upper Manhattan, near 211th Street and Broadway; the Inwood neighborhood near Inwood Hill Park. Both of his parents are Jewish. He was the second of two children, born two years after his sister Julia. His mother came from a family that fled Nazi Germany to Amsterdam, Netherlands, and then to New York City. His father's parents were from Poland. Stanley was raised Jewish, although he did not consider his family very observant and did not celebrate his bar mitzvah.[1] His parents listened to classical music and light opera; Stanley was greatly moved by Beethoven's works. His right ear was misshaped from a birth defect called microtia; he was unable to hear on that side, thus he found it difficult to determine the direction of a sound, and he could not understand speech in a noisy environment.[2] Attending PS 98, he was taunted by other children for his deformed ear.[citation needed]\n\nDespite his hearing problem, Stanley enjoyed listening to music, and he watched American Bandstand on television. His favorite musical artists included Eddie Cochran, Dion and the Belmonts, Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard. Stanley learned to sing harmony with his family, and he was given a child's guitar at age seven.[3][4]\n\nStanley's family relocated to the Kew Gardens neighborhood in Queens in 1960.[5] He listened to a lot of doo-wop music, but when the Beatles and the Rolling Stones played on U.S. television he was inspired by the performance aspect, which he thought was not out of his reach. Stanley received his first real guitar at age 13, an acoustic one that he would have preferred to be electric. He played tunes by Bob Dylan, the Byrds, the Lovin' Spoonful and more.[3]\n\nAll through his childhood Stanley had been recognized for his talent at graphic arts, so he attended the High School of Music & Art in New York City, graduating in 1970.[6] Despite his skill as a graphic artist, he abandoned that as a career, and instead played in bands.[citation needed]\n\nKiss [ edit ]\n\nBefore Kiss, Stanley was in a local band, Rainbow (not to be confused with Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow) and was a member of Uncle Joe and Post War Baby Boom. Through a mutual friend of Gene Simmons, Stanley joined Simmons' band Wicked Lester in the early 1970s. The band recorded an album in 1972, but it has not been officially released (although songs from the album appeared on Kiss's 2001 box set). Wicked Lester fell apart and Stanley and Simmons answered Peter Criss's advertisement in Rolling Stone (August 31, 1972): \"Expd. Rock & Roll drummer looking for orig. grp. doing soft & hard music.\" Soon after recruiting Criss, they held auditions for a lead guitarist, with Stanley placing an ad in the Village Voice (December 14, 1972). Despite what Stanley, Criss, and Simmons admit was a shaky first impression, Ace Frehley won the group over with his playing, which all admit was nearly a perfect fit to the group's sound, and with his style, showing up to the audition wearing Converse shoes in two different colors (one red, one orange). Kiss released their self-titled debut album in February 1974.[citation needed]\n\nAt this point, Stanley had the idea of changing his name not only for marketing purposes but also the fact he had always hated his birth name. Inspired by Paul McCartney and Paul Rodgers, he legally changed his name to Paul Stanley.[7]\n\nStanley's persona in Kiss is \"The Starchild\" displaying one star over his right eye. For a brief time, Stanley changed his character to \"The Bandit\", with a \"Lone Ranger\" style mask design make-up pattern. This make-up design was only used during a few mid-1973 shows. \"I even tried painting my face all red,\" he admitted. \"I looked like a longhaired tomato! Before settling on the star, I'd just paint a black ring around my eye… Each of us wears something that reflects who we are. I always loved stars and always identified with them – so, when it came time to put something on my face, I knew it would be a star.\"[8]\n\nIn his book Sex Money Kiss, Gene Simmons says Stanley was the driving force for KISS during the period in the 1980s when the band performed without makeup. Those years, Stanley noted, \"were fine for me. I found them very satisfying because I got a chance to be out there without makeup, which I craved at that point. I think it was easier for me [than Simmons] because my persona was one that wasn't really defined by the makeup… The makeup was just reinforcing what you were seeing and who I was.\"[9]\n\nIn 2006, Stanley resumed[further explanation needed] his association with Washburn Guitars, using the Washburn PS2000. Previously, he has had four signature guitars made by Silvertone, and tweaked the Ibanez Iceman to his specifications, calling it the PS10.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007 (prior to the final show of the Hit 'N Run Tour on July 27), Stanley was hospitalized with tachycardia. In his absence, Kiss performed live as a trio for the first time in decades. The concert was the first Kiss performance Stanley missed.[10]\n\nIn September 2007, Stanley took part as a guest star (for the second time) in Rock 'n Roll Fantasy Camp in New York City.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2009 he recorded three voice ads for the charity Kars4Kids. Stanley continues to tour with Kiss; the KISS 2010 The Hottest Show on Earth Tour (a continuation of the Sonic Boom Over Europe Tour, itself a continuation of the Kiss Alive/35 World Tour) which started March 2010 and ended at Guadalajara, Mexico in October.[citation needed]\n\nSolo career [ edit ]\n\nOther than Paul Stanley (album), Stanley has rarely recorded or performed outside of Kiss. He wrote and recorded material for a solo album in 1987–88, which was shelved in favor of the Kiss compilation, Smashes, Thrashes & Hits. While never officially released, songs such as \"Don't Let Go\" and \"When Two Hearts Collide\" have circulated as bootleg recordings. One song from the project, \"Time Traveler\", was released as part of Kiss' 2001 box set.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1989, Stanley embarked on a brief club tour. His touring band included guitarist Bob Kulick and future Kiss drummer Eric Singer. The same year, Stanley sang lead on the title track for the soundtrack of the Wes Craven horror flick Shocker.\n\nTwenty-eight years after releasing his first solo album (as part of the four simultaneously released Kiss solo albums), Stanley released a second album, Live to Win, on October 24, 2006. The title song of his solo album, \"Live to Win\", appeared on the South Park episode \"Make Love, Not Warcraft\". In October and November 2006, Stanley embarked on a theater tour in support of Live to Win. His touring band was the house band from the CBS TV show Rock Star, composed of Paul Mirkovich (keyboards), Jim McGorman (guitar), Rafael Moreira (lead guitar), Nate Morton (drums), and Sasha Krivtsov (bass). In April 2007, Stanley extended the tour to include Australia, playing in Coolangatta, Wollongong, Newcastle, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide. Portions of the tour were filmed for a documentary titled Paul Stanley: Live to Dream by the Chicago-based Film Foetus.[11] The band's performance at the House of Blues in Chicago was captured on film and released in 2008 on DVD and digital audio download formats as One Live Kiss.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2008, Stanley sang a duet with Sarah Brightman, \"I Will Be with You\", on her Symphony album. In 2016, he guested in Ace Frehley's covers album Origins, Vol. 1, singing \"Fire and Water\" by Free.[citation needed]\n\nVocals [ edit ]\n\nStanley tends to sing in the high register of his vocal range. On Music From \"The Elder\" he experimented with falsetto (\"Just a Boy\", \"The Oath\").[citation needed]\n\nOther projects [ edit ]\n\nStanley in concert with Kiss at the Chumash Casino Resort in Santa Ynez, California\n\nIn 1999, Stanley starred in a Toronto production of The Phantom of the Opera, in which he played the role of the Phantom. He appeared in the musical from May 25 to August 1, and again that year from September 30 to October 31, 1999. Stanley made his debut as a painter in 2006, exhibiting and selling original works of art.

He has announced[when?] that he will require a third hip surgery in the future. He regards the degeneration of his left hip as partly the product of thousands of shows performed in platform boots since the early 1970s.[citation needed]\n\nIn October 2011, Stanley had surgery on his vocal cords. He said, \"I hold myself to a higher standard than others do. With that in mind, I wanted to remedy a few minor issues that come with 40 years of preaching rock 'n' roll.\"[22]\n\nBecause of his birth defect microtia, Stanley is an ambassador for the charitable organization AboutFace, an organization that provides support and information to people with facial differences.

He will also stop in Djibouti, where demonstrators inspired by revolts that toppled leaders in Egypt and Tunisia have clashed with riot police.\n\n“Though this trip was planned well before the recent unrest in the region, the chairman will be interested to gain the perspectives of leaders here about these protest movements,” said spokesman Capt. John Kirby.\n\nMullen, he added, will also “make clear his desire to see that peaceful protest be allowed to continue without threats or violence from any quarter and that restraint is shown by all sides in these disputes.”\n\nNo further details on the trip were provided.\n\nMullen’s itinerary did not include Bahrain, a cornerstone of U.S. military power in the Gulf and the site of deadly clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces last week.

  "latent_4558": "Chess\n\nChess is a two-player board game believed to have been played in India as early as the sixth century AD. In different parts of this world, different chess games are played. The most played variants are western chess, Shogi (in Japan), and Xiangqi (in China).\n\nThe western version of chess is a game played on an board, called a chessboard, of alternating black and white squares. Pieces with different types of allowed moves are placed on the board, a set of black pieces in the first two rows and a set of white pieces in the last two rows. The pieces are called the bishop (2), king (1), knight (2), pawn (8), queen (1), and rook (2). The object of the game is to capture the opponent's king.\n\nIn Ingmar Bergman's 1958 film classic The Seventh Seal, a Knight and his squire arrive home from the crusades to find Black Death sweeping their country. As they approach home, Death appears to the knight and tells him it is his time. The knight then challenges Death to a chess game for his life. Chess also appears as one of the games known to the WOPR computer in the 1983 film WarGames.\n\nHardy (1999, p. 17) estimated the number of possible games of chess as . The number of possible games of 40 moves or less is approximately (Beeler et al. 1972), a number arrived at by estimating the number of pawn positions (in the no-captures situation, this is ), multiplying by the possible positions for all pieces, then dividing by two for each of the (rook, knight) pairs that are interchangeable, and dividing by two for each pair of bishops (since half the positions will have the bishops on the same color squares). (However, note that there are more positions with one or two captures, since the pawns can then switch columns; Schroeppel 1996.) Shannon (1950) gave the estimate\n\nRex Stout's fictional detective Nero Wolfe quotes the number of possible games after ten moves as follows: \"Wolfe grunted. One hundred and sixty-nine million, five hundred and eighteen thousand, eight hundred and twenty-nine followed by twenty-one ciphers. The number of ways the first ten moves, both sides, may be played\" (Stout 1983). To be precise, the number of distinct chess positions after moves for , 2, ... are 20, 400, 5362, 71852, 809896?, 9132484?, ... (Schwarzkopf 1994, OEIS A019319). The number of chess games that end in exactly moves (including games that mate in fewer than plies) for , 2, 3, ... are 20, 400, 8902, 197742, 4897256, 120921506, 3284294545, ... (OEIS A006494).\n\nCunningham (1889) incorrectly found games and positions after the fourth move. C. Flye St. Marie was the first to find the correct number of positions after four moves: . Dawson (1946) gives the source as Intermediare des Mathematiques (1895), but K. Fabel writes that Flye St. Marie corrected the number (that he found in 1895) to in 1903. The history of the determination of the chess sequences is discussed in Schwarzkopf (1994).\n\nThe analysis of chess is extremely complicated due to the many possible options at each move. Steinhaus (1999, pp. 11-14), as well as many entire books, consider clever end-game positions which may be analyzed completely.\n\nTwo problems in recreational mathematics ask the questions\n\n1. How many pieces of a given type can be placed on a chessboard without any two attacking?\n\n2. What is the smallest number of pieces needed to occupy or attack every square?\n\nThe answers are given for the usual chessboard in the following table (Madachy 1979).",

He has previously played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Detroit Red Wings, Los Angeles Kings, Colorado Avalanche, Tampa Bay Lightning, New Jersey Devils Columbus Blue Jackets and the Minnesota Wild.\n\nPlaying career [ edit ]\n\nJunior [ edit ]\n\nQuincey grew up in the Caledon, Ontario, area playing most of his minor hockey for the Halton Hurricanes AAA program of the OMHA. He was drafted in the third round, 47th overall, of the 2001 OHL Priority Selection by the London Knights.\n\nQuincey was drafted 132nd overall by the Detroit Red Wings in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft after finishing his first Major junior hockey season with the Knights in 2002–03. At the beginning of the 2003–04 season in early October, Quincey was traded from London to the Mississauga IceDogs in a blockbuster deal for star forward Rob Schremp. Quincey helped the IceDogs to the OHL Final in 2004 before the IceDogs were swept in four games by the Guelph Storm.\n\nDeveloping as an offensively-able defensive-defenceman, Quincey was named in the OHL Second All-Star Team in the 2004–05 season after finishing with 46 points in 59 games. Selected as the Eastern Conference's Best Defensive Defenceman, he also placed third in voting for the OHL's top defenceman award, the Max Kaminsky Trophy.\n\nProfessional [ edit ]\n\nDetroit Red Wings [ edit ]\n\nOn July 28, 2005, Quincey was signed by the Detroit Red Wings to a three-year, entry level contract.[1] He was assigned to the Wings' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Grand Rapids Griffins, to begin his first professional season in 2005–06. He finished the season fifth among rookie defencemen in the AHL with seven goals and 33 points in 70 games, while also making his NHL debut with Detroit against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim on November 25, 2005.[2]\n\nQunicey was again assigned to the Griffins the following season. As a late call-up, he scored his first NHL goal in the last game of the Red Wings' 2006–07 regular season in a 7–2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks on April 7, 2007. He scored in the second period against Patrick Lalime, which turned out to be the final Red Wing goal of the regular season.[3] After injuries to defencemen Niklas Kronwall and Mathieu Schneider, Quincey was thrust into play just as the playoffs had begun.[4] He first played in Game 6, an overtime victory for Detroit against the Calgary Flames that enabled the Wings to move on to the second round to play the San Jose Sharks. After dispatching San Jose, the Red Wings eventually lost to the Anaheim Ducks in six games in the Western Conference Final.\n\nSlated to make the Detroit roster after an impressive 13-game playoff performance, Kyle suffered a setback after suffering a broken hand in training camp, forcing him to miss the entire 2007–08 pre-season.[5] Quincey returned and played the majority of the year with Grand Rapids, scoring 20 points in 66 games. He was used as an call-up from the Griffins in February to play six games for Detroit in the regular season.[6] During the 2008 playoffs, he was on the practice roster for the team as the Red Wings eventually captured the Stanley Cup over the Pittsburgh Penguins. Although the Red Wings included him on the Stanley Cup-winning picture, and was awarded a Stanley Cup ring. He however, did not qualify to be inscribed on the Stanley Cup.[7]\n\nQuincey during his tenure with the Kings\n\nEntering the 2008–09 season, Quincey was re-signed to a two-year contract on September 9, 2008.[8]\n\nLos Angeles Kings [ edit ]\n\nUnable to crack the talent-laden Red Wings and due to salary cap compliance issues, he was placed and eventually claimed off waivers on October 13, 2008, by the Los Angeles Kings.[9] Posting an assist in his Kings' debut against the Carolina Hurricanes on October 17, 2008,[10] he quickly became an important part of a young Kings defensive corps, especially early in the season due to the injury of Jack Johnson, playing on the power play and penalty-killing units.[11] He finished his breakthrough season leading the Kings' defence in scoring, with 34 assists and 38 points in 72 games, before finally succumbing to a herniated disc on April 1, 2009.[12]\n\nColorado Avalanche [ edit ]\n\nOn July 3, 2009, Quincey was traded, along with defenceman Tom Preissing and a fifth-round pick in 2010, to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for left winger Ryan Smyth.[13] In the 2009–10 season, he made his Avalanche debut on opening night in a 5–2 victory over the San Jose Sharks on October 1, 2009.[14] Quincey joined Todd Gill to become just the second player to play on the Avalanche after previously appearing for the rival Detroit Red Wings.[15] Quincey again quickly established himself within the re-building Avalanche defence to lead the team in average ice time and to record a career-high of six goals for 29 points in 79 games. On July 2, 2010, he was signed by the Avalanche to a two-year contract extension.[16]\n\nIn July and August 2011, Quincey captained Canada in a three-game exhibition series against the United States in New Zealand.[17]\n\nReturn to Detroit [ edit ]\n\nOn February 21, 2012, in the last year of his contract with the Avalanche, Quincey was traded by Colorado to the Tampa Bay Lightning for Steve Downie. Just moments later, Tampa Bay traded him to the Detroit Red Wings for a first-round draft pick in 2012 and prospect Sébastien Piché.[18] Marking his progression in returning to his original draft team in which his initially left on a waiver transaction, Quincey appeared in all 18 games and the Red Wings' first round defeat to the Nashville Predators to end the 2011–12 season.\n\nAs a restricted free agent on July 18, 2012, Quincey re-signed with the Red Wings on a two-year contract.[19] With the NHL lock-out cancelling the start of the 2012–13 season, Quincey, who still resided in Denver, Colorado, from his tenure with the Avalanche, signed with the inaugural Denver Cutthroats of the Central Hockey League under the influence of former Kings teammate and current Cutthroats head coach, Derek Armstrong on October 12, 2012.[20] With the intention to give back to the community, Quincey posted 11 points in 12 games with the Cutthroats before ending his tenure with the team on November 19, 2012.[21] Quincey returned to Detroit when the NHL lock-out ended in January 2013.\n\nDuring the 2013–14 season, Quincey was one of two Red Wings to play in all 82 games, recording four goals and nine assists along the way. On July 2, 2014, the Detroit Red Wings signed Quincey to a two-year, $8.5 million contract extension.[22]\n\nDuring the 2014–15 season, Quincey recorded three goals and 15 assists in 73 games, and finished with a career-best plus 10 rating. It was announced that Quincey would undergo offseason surgery to remove bone chips from his ankle.[23] In the final year of his contract with Red Wings in the 2015–16 season, Quincey recorded four goals and seven assists in 47 games.[24]\n\nNew Jersey Devils and Columbus Blue Jackets [ edit ]\n\nOn September 28, 2016, Quincey signed a one-year contract with the New Jersey Devils,[25] In the 2016–17 season, Quincey secured a regular blueline role within the Devils top four defenceman. With the Devils falling in standings and having contributed 12 points in 53 games, Quincey was traded at the deadline to the playoff-bound Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Dalton Prout on March 1, 2017.[26] He appeared in 20 games for the club, recording 3 points.\n\nMinnesota Wild [ edit ]\n\nOn July 1, 2017, having left the Blue Jackets as a free agent, Quincey was signed to a one-year, $1.25 million contract to provide a veteran presence on the blueline with the Minnesota Wild.[27] Quincey began the 2017–18 season, as a third-pairing defenseman for the Wild. After struggling in 18 games, Quincey was placed on waivers by Minnesota on November 29, 2017.[28] Upon clearing waivers, Quincey was originally assigned to the AHL with the Iowa Wild, however refused to report, he subsequently sat out for the remainder of the season.\n\nHIFK [ edit ]\n\nOn August 28, 2018, Quincey as a free agent signed his first contract abroad in agreeing to a one-year deal with Finnish club, HIFK of the Liiga.[29]\n\nPersonal [ edit ]\n\nQuincey hails from Orangeville, Ontario, and cites former Toronto Maple Leafs forward Bill Berg as one of his childhood idols. \"When I was young, my dad took me to see a Kings game in Toronto. I was watching Wayne Gretzky, but my dad said to me, ‘watch the way Bill Berg plays. Look at him working in the corners, not being afraid to get his nose dirty, and doing all of the little things.’ Berg became one of my favorite players to watch after that because of the effort he put, and how he never took a night off. I feel like I have taken a similar approach to working hard and being confident to do whatever is asked of me.\" Kyle celebrated his day with the Stanley Cup from the Detroit Red Wings in Caledon, Ontario, with family and friends. He also took the Cup to Alder Street Recreation Centre for autographs and pictures with local fans. Kyle is married to longtime girlfriend Rachel Quincey (Hall).

  "latent_4652": "Last week, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee announced it would leave the target Federal Funds Rate unchanged.\n\nDuring 2014 and 2015, the Fed repeatedly hinted that it would raise rates \"soon\" and that it would return the target rate to more normal levels.\n\nThroughout most of 2015, the Fed repeatedly put off increasing the target rate, and then, feeling pressured to actually take action after many months of claiming it would take action, the Fed raised the target rate from 0.25% to 0.5% in December of 2015.\n\nSince then, though, after months of claiming that the economy was improving, the Fed has refused to raise the target rate any further. The Fed was obviously spooked by what anyone can see is a very fragile economy, although FOMC statements continue to contain phrases like \"growing,\" \"moderate,\" \"gains\" and other language that would lead one to believe that the economy is stable and strong.\n\nThe reality, of course, is something different which is why the Fed kept the target rate at 0.25% for seven years, and why is refuses to move above 0.5% percent now.\n\nAnd lest we forget just how low 0.5% is, we should remember that as recently as 2007, the target rate was above 5%.\n\nThe obvious posturing of the Fed in the past, however, has not been enough to shame the Fed's spokespeople who are now proceeding with exactly the same rhetoric we saw back in 2014 with the Fed repeatedly claiming the economy is strong and solid, while apparently being too fearful to take any action of allowing interest rates to rise closer to what is surely a higher natural rate.\n\nThis week, New York Fed President William Dudley trotted out the usual rhetoric, saying that well, maybe, we'll start raising rates more aggressively in the future. Says Dudley:\n\n\"If the upcoming information validates my view of the outlook, then U.S. monetary policy will need to move at a faster pace than implied by futures prices to a more neutral posture as the labor market tightens further and U.S. inflation rises,\" Dudley said.\n\nNote the hedge words: \"If the upcoming information validates my view of the outlook...\" This statement from Dudley thus means exactly nothing since all he's saying is what everyone knows: \"If the economy looks great, then we'll raise the target rate.\"\n\nThese pronouncements are especially meaningless because the Fed never defines what exactly a good economy looks like. At what point will things be good enough to warrant an increase in the target rate? The Fed won't tell us.\n\nAll we do know is that the Fed likes to constantly tell us how well the economy is improving while refusing to increase the target rate. That latter part tells us all we need to know.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg asks the obvious question: Has the Fed become even more dovish?\"\n\nThe answer is yes, for two reasons. First, there is fear that there is a slowdown coming. But secondly, and more importantly, the Fed is extremely unlikely to raise the target rate right before a presidential election. In spite of all the persistent and naive claims that the Fed is \"independent\" of politics, the Fed consistently tends to favor the incumbent administration. Moreover, given the current electoral environment, it's also fairly clear that the Fed will also tend to favor the candidate who is more friendly with Wall Street, and that candidate this time around is Hillary Clinton. Given that Clinton's party is the incumbent Party, the Fed will not be doing anything to raise rates, and possibly upset the economy's apple cart until the election is over.\n\nSo, regardless of whatever Dudley or the Fed says, the likelihood of a rate hike before December is extremely small, and if the economy worsens by then, the odds of a rate hike at any point for the next several years will be even smaller.",
  "latent_4679": "HI!!\n\nI’m obsessed with mayo right now. Ever since I found out that you can make mayo with an immersion blender, I want to make it every day. In every kind of flavor. So, that’s exactly what I did. And since it’s still 1,000 degrees in our house, I just bought a rotisserie chicken at the store and mixed it with my 30 second mayo and had a meal in less than 10 minutes. The faster I get to eat, the happier I am.\n\nSo I just got back from camping. I haven’t camped in probably 7 or 8 years, so I wasn’t sure if I was going to like it or not. I was mostly worried about doing my business in the woods. Toilets are way more comfortable. And relaxing. But that’s besides the point. A big group of us headed up to Glendo Lake in Wyoming to spend our July 4th with friends, tents, and boats. 2 boats to be exact. We brought a pretty Malibu wakeboard boat and a pontoon boat. That’s the first time i’ve ever spelled pontoon. It looks like raccoon. Not really, but kind of. Anywho, as we hauled the boats up north, we got half way there and were welcomed with a sign that said “There is no gas station available for the next 65 miles” AFTER we passed the last exit. How does that make any sense whatsoever? It doesn’t. Especially when you’re getting 4 miles to the gallon. Sooooo we coasted as much as possible. And chewed our fingernails. Just kidding, I don’t do that. I just bite my lips. What a gross habit. I need to break that.\n\nWell, since we made it to the gas station, we ended up making it to our huge camp site with a nice little area to back our boats into. We spent our days on the water; surfing, wakeboarding, paddleboarding, and floating. I did most of the floating. Two of my girlfriends went on the paddleboard and drug me behind them on a pink tube. I really got my exercise in on this trip, obviously. And then we spent our nights around the campfire, eating grilled items, and drinking different beverages. Like apple pie moonshine. Not for me. But I did have a few sips to be a true ‘Merican on the 4th. Ugh, I’m annoyed with myself for saying that.\n\nI loved being around the campfire. As soon as the sun went down, I became instantly freezing cold, unlike anyone else. I’d be in full sweats while some guys still hadn’t even put their shirts back on from being on the lake. I’m a child. But we saw some cool things while we sat around the fire. Like fireworks, that the guys set off on the beach. Slightly frightening. Cool, but still frightening when you know the people who are setting them off. No one’s hands got blown off, so we’re good!! We also saw one of the three dogs find a great stick that he brought over to the campfire and began to chew on for a while. Well, we finally noticed that it wasn’t a stick. It was a deer leg. Still with his little hoof. Poor guy. We threw it away, but it still came back later on. Along with other pieces of his legs. That poor deer. I’m sure it tasted delicious, though.\n\nNext time, I’ll only camp for 2 nights. But for not really liking camping, or even the outdoors, I really loved being on the lake. It’s just the best feeling. I can’t wait for Lake Powell in August. That’s just the best.\n\nOn the way back home, I had to eat at Taco John’s. Ew.\n\nChipotle Chicken Salad Print shopping list Prep Time 10 mins Total Time 0:10 Yields 2-3 Ingredients 1 pound chicken, cooked and diced\n\n4 stalks of celery, finely chopped\n\n1/4 white onion, finely chopped For the mayo 2/3 cup avocado oil\n\n1 egg\n\n1 teaspoon lemon juice\n\n1 teaspoon chipotle adobo sauce\n\n1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n\n1/4 teaspoon garlic powder\n\nsalt and pepper, to taste Directions Mix together chopped chicken, celery, and white onion.

  "latent_4801": "Date: December 18, 2017\n\nContact: Interior_Press@ios.doi.gov\n\nWASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey released a report that detailed the extent to which the United States is fully, majorly, or partially dependent upon foreign competitors and even adversaries for our supply of \"critical minerals.\" The report identified 23 of the minerals that are most-needed to sustain our national defense and economy and are used in manufacturing everything from batteries and computer chips to equipment used by our military. The report shows a troubling trend of foreign dependency.\n\n\"I commend the team of scientists at USGS for the extensive work put into the report, but the findings are shocking,\" said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke. \"The fact that previous administrations allowed the United States to become reliant on foreign nations, including our competitors and adversaries, for minerals that are so strategically important to our security and economy is deeply troubling. As both a former military commander and geologist, I know the very real national security risk of relying on foreign nations for what the military needs to keep our soldiers and our homeland safe.\"\n\nThe report found the United States is most reliant on China for critical minerals with at least 20 critical minerals being sourced exclusively in China. Russia, South Africa, Brazil and Canada also supply many of our minerals.\n\nThe mineral commodities highlighted in this book have been called critical or strategic owing to concerns about risk of supply interruption and the cost of such a disruption. Such critical mineral commodities include rare-earth elements, used in high-end electronics, and platinum-group elements, used in catalytic converters and petroleum refining.\n\n“The best part of this report is that we can provide complete minerals information for the Nation for the first time in generations,” said Klaus Schulz, an editor and author of the volume. “The USGS combines short- and medium-term data on the current global supply of minerals with research on the long-term potential of these minerals through our mineral-resource assessments. Despite current supply concerns, one thing we shouldn’t lose sight of is that we will also need mineral commodities far into the future. We wanted to identify future needs too, so we included information to help plan for the sustainable development of each of these minerals.”\n\nThis report updates another USGS report from 1973, which was published when many of the commodities that are covered in this new volume were only of minor importance. Today, advanced technologies have increased the demand for and production of mineral commodities for nearly all elements in the periodic table.\n\nFor instance, in the 1970s, rare-earth elements had few uses outside of some specialty fields, and were produced mostly in the United States. Today, rare-earth elements are integral to nearly all high-end electronics and are produced almost entirely in China.\n\nAccording to the recently released USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries 2017, the United States was 100 percent net import reliant on 20 mineral commodities in 2016, including manganese, niobium, tantalum and several of the other mineral commodities covered in the new volume.\n\nThis number has risen dramatically over the past 60 years. For example, in 1954 the United States was 100 percent import reliant for the supply of only eight nonfuel mineral commodities and by 1984 for 11 commodities.\n\nSince 1973, there has also been a significant increase in knowledge about geologic and environmental issues related to production and use. This report addresses the sustainable development of each mineral commodity in order that the current needs of the Nation can be met without limiting the ability of future generations to meet their needs.\n\nFor each mineral commodity, the authors address how the commodity is used, the location of identified resources and their distribution nationally and globally, the state of current geologic knowledge, potential for finding additional deposits, and geoenvironmental issues that may be related to the production and uses of these mineral commodities.\n\nThe volume, USGS Professional Paper 1802, is entitled “Critical Mineral Resources in the United States–Economic and Environmental Geology and Prospects for Future Supply.\" The USGS also regularly produces mineral information products, such as the yearly Mineral Commodity Summaries, the Minerals Yearbook, and mineral-resource assessments.\n\nFor more information on this book and mineral-resource science, please visit the USGS Mineral Resources Program.",
  "latent_4931": "The study comes at a critical time for the future of U.S. Nuclear Weapons. On December 22, Donald Trump confused and alarmed the world when he tweeted that he would both strengthen and expand America’s nuclear weapons capability. But there was less new in the announcement than might actually appear. In fact, the Obama Administration was already working to fullfill the “strengthening” part of that same promise, having already put the United States on track to spend more than $1 trillion on modernization of U.S. nuclear weapons.\n\nFor the United States Air Force, the modernization list includes replacing LGM-30 Minuteman with a new intercontinental ballistic missile (also called a ground-based strategic deterrent), developing a controversial nuclear-armed cruise missile called the long-range standoff weapon, or LRSO, to building and deploying an entirely new B-21 stealth bomber.\n\nWhat are “surety concerns?” Read that to mean how do you make sure that your fancy networked nuclear warfare control system can’t be hijacked or go off accidentally.\n\nBefore the United States can modernize its nuclear weapons it must first make certain it understands everything that can possibly go wrong. Think back to the classic film (and book) Dr. Strangelove, a story very much about surety failure. A crazed Air Force general sends his B-52 wing to destroy their targets in the Soviet Union. Of course, only the President is supposed to be able to call for a nuclear strike, but an obscure contingency plan (Wing Attack Plan R) allows a lower level commander to issue the order in the event that the normal command and control has been disrupted.\n\nThe Pentagon can’t call back the wing because the B-52s can no longer receive transmissions unless preceded by specific three-letter code that only the general knows, part of a poorly thought-out safety scheme to protect the airmen from false orders. Even after the recall code is issued and most of the plans abort their missions, one continues on to a new tertiary target, as the plane’s radio has been damaged in combat. (Somehow, the drafters of Wing Attack Plan R forgot to insert a rule ordering pilots back to base when their radios are damaged, rather than continue to target.) The lone B-52 hits its target and sets in motion the end of the world.\n\nSurety failure squared.\n\nAccording to Defense Department Directive 3150.02, which outlines the Air Force’s Nuclear Surety Program. The directive assigns “responsibilities for DoD Nuclear Weapons Surety for the oversight of safety, security, and control of U.S. nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon systems in DoD custody.”\n\n“We have formal Air Force documents that detail the formal certification process for nuclear weapons. To what extent do the current models for certifying nuclear systems carry over into these modern, network enabled systems and how would you re-conceptualize certification for systems that are likely to come out of these recap programs?” asked Dahm. The 2017 Air Force Scientific Advisory Board study will attempt to answer those questions. The board consists of 50 members that are appointed by the Secretary of Defense and are drawn from academia, industry, and elsewhere. Members serve for four years.",
  "latent_4940": "“20 of the most important SEO blogs online” “20 of the most important SEO blogs online”\n\n“complete with handy guides explaining how you, too, can get in on the gold”\n\nIn the Academy Award-nominated film Food Inc, filmmaker Robert Kenner reveals how the varied choice of items we see on the shelves of supermarkets is actually a false presumption.\n\nInstead, that seemingly endless variety is actually controlled by just a handful of companies.\n\nToday I’m going to reveal how the huge diversity we perceive in Google search results is once again a few large corporations controlling what we assume to be choice. More specifically I’ll reveal how just 16 core companies are dominating the most popular industries online and how that situation is going to get a whole lot worse.\n\nTo begin our journey down the rabbit hole together, I want to take you through a series of events which uncovered something I had never considered before about the industry in which I operate: Are the Google rankings I aim to get for myself and my clients actually controlled by just three hands full of companies?\n\nAround two weeks ago I came across a post on Reddit about Hearst Media. I was unfamiliar with Hearst Media but very familiar with the brands they own such as Esquire, Elle and Cosmopolitan.\n\nThe Reddit outing, which was shared on a new account, claimed that Hearst were using their powerful brands to “game Google” and rank a new website of theirs very quickly, using slightly shady practices.\n\nBeing an inquisitive marketer I had to check it out for myself. The quick summary is that Hearst clearly were (and still are) using their authoritative brands to point links to their latest venture, BestProducts.com.\n\nWhile I expected BestProducts.com to be receiving a lot of traffic from the brands linking to them – which also include Marie Claire and Woman’s Day – I didn’t expect Google to have taken such a huge liking to them. Especially when the site in question had zero reason prior to be ranking so well (it was owned previously then the domain dropped a few years ago).\n\nTo give an overview of what was happening for those who are skimming this article, the situation looks like this.\n\nThe arrows in this picture represent links.\n\nThere are far more brands involved in this network, but we’ll get to those in a second.\n\nAs I stated earlier, I was far more surprised by how Google reacted to this.\n\nLaunched in October, They Now Receive More than 600,000 Visitors from Google Per Month\n\nHere’s the graph that kick started the countless days of research I did for this blog post.\n\nAs we can see, the estimated traffic to BestProducts has shot up dramatically in the last few months. SEMRush is showing similar numbers, as we’ll get to in a second. With 62% of their traffic estimated to be coming from Google, that’s at least 600,000 organic (free) website visitors for the month of April.\n\nI expect the data for May will be significantly higher, but I have to wait until June 10th to see (that’s when SimilarWeb confirm they’ll update their reporting).\n\nSo Why Am I Surprised?\n\nTons of authoritative sites linking to you is obviously great for SEO.\n\nBut as anyone who has been involved in search engine optimisation for a period of time might wonder, surely getting so many sitewide links in a short timeframe should raise a bit of a red flag?\n\nEven if the links in question are from some of the biggest media brands in the world.\n\nHere’s a few examples.\n\nEsquire.com (Product Reviews)\n\nElle.com (Beauty Reviews)\n\nCosmopolitan.com (Beauty Reviews)\n\nMarieClaire.com (Reviews)\n\nPopularMechanics.com (Product Reviews)\n\nNow, I will say that 90% of me thinks there is absolutely nothing wrong with this. In fact, you’ll see the majority of this post is focused on why I’m surprised Google give the resulting website so much traffic.\n\nQuite simply if I owned a lot of websites, I would be fine linking them together. If for nothing more than from a usability standpoint.\n\nThat being said, 10% of me is a little surprised that these link texts and locations are constantly changing. I think it’s a bit risky on their part.\n\nAs of publishing this post, Cosmopolitan use ‘Beauty Reviews’ as the anchor text of their footer to the site. Previously it was in a different placement and used the anchor text ‘Style Reviews’.\n\nThese are not static footer links that have been left alone (and not just on one site). They’re changing to different pages – and using different words – on a fairly frequent basis.\n\nTo me this takes the situation away from “they’re just linking to their own site” to “they’re doing a lot of tweaking to see which results in higher rankings.” You could argue they’re testing it for usability reasons, but you’ll see in a moment why I think they know a thing or two about SEO.\n\nBefore I get into that, I wanted to see if I could figure out when these links were added to their network.\n\nWere they all thrown up at once and it took a while for them to have an impact, or was there some clear plan behind the links from Hearst Media’s various brands?\n\nHere’s some of the data I managed to uncover on when each site first linked to BestProducts (I bolded those that linked on the same day).\n\nPopularMechanics.com – November 5th\n\nEsquire.com – November 5th\n\nCosmopolitan.com – January 1st\n\nSeventeen.com – January 12th\n\nRedbookMag.com – February 23rd\n\nElle.com – March 15th\n\nCountryLiving.com – March 18th\n\nWomansDay.com – April 5th\n\nMarieClaire.com – April 5th\n\nRoadandTrack.com – April 13th\n\nFor my own curiosity, I was glad I took the time to trawl through every screenshot on Archive.org to find these answers. It’s now obvious that the people working for Woman’s Day, Marie Claire, Popular Mechanics and Esquire had some conversion that went along the lines of, “Don’t forget, today’s the day we have to put those links to Best Products in the footer.”\n\nAs I said earlier, I don’t really care too much about what Hearst media are doing with their “link network” of magazine brands. I don’t see anything wrong with it and don’t think Google should either.\n\nThat being said, because I’ve done more research for this blog post than any other, I do want to add that they purchased the most successful SEO agency on the planet just a few years ago.\n\nIf you can’t read that because of my small post width (I’m working on a redesign), they paid $325 million for an agency that generated more than 60% of their revenues from SEO clients.\n\nAt the time of acquisition iCrossing were also the biggest search agency in the world based on revenue numbers. In other words, the staff at Hearst Media comprises of a large number of people who know a lot about SEO.\n\nTo me this explains the slow buildup of network links and the semi-frequent changing of URL’s and link text in their website footer.\n\nI Have No Problem With What Hearst Are Doing. Google’s Reaction Is What Really Interests Me…\n\nI’ve said it a few times but I’ll say it once more for anyone skimming the post: This is by no means an attack on Hearst Media. They own the websites so they’re welcome to do with them as they please. They also made BestProducts a rather attractive looking website.\n\nThen again, I’m surprised at how well their strategy is working. I’m not naive – I know that authoritative links equal a good chance of increased search rankings – but I didn’t expect they would be outranking some of the biggest brands on the internet for search terms that can make them a lot of money.\n\nFrom Zero to $583,000 in Free Search Traffic\n\nWe’ve already looked at the data from SimilarWeb, but the stats from SEMRush are interesting as well.\n\nSEMRush pips BestProducts at ranking for over half a million dollar’s worth of search queries (if you were to buy them via Google Adwords) in a very short space of time.\n\nTheir Top Keywords According to SEMRush\n\nSome of those incredible rankings they’ve achieved include:\n\nhairstyles: 11th (450,0000 searches per month)\n\n(450,0000 searches per month) short hairstyles: 7th (301,000 searches per month)\n\n(301,000 searches per month) best wireless earbuds: 1st (22,200 searches per month)\n\n(22,200 searches per month) short haircuts: 9th (301,000 searches per month)\n\n(301,000 searches per month) best running shoes for women: 1st (18,100 searches per month)\n\n(18,100 searches per month) bluetooth speakers: 11th (165,000 searches per month)\n\n(165,000 searches per month) lighted makeup mirror: 1st (14,800 searches per month)\n\n(14,800 searches per month) best makeup brushes: 1st (14,800 searches per month)\n\n(14,800 searches per month) haircuts: 7th (165,000 searches per month)\n\n(165,000 searches per month) short haircuts for women: 6th (110,000 searches per month)\n\nThey’re still ranking for these terms, which is why I predict the SimilarWeb traffic graph will increase a lot when they update their data for May.\n\nTheir Top Keywords According to SimilarWeb\n\nIt’s interesting to see how different the data from SimilarWeb and SEMRush seems to be, but they’re at least right that BestProducts are ranking for what they state they’re ranking for.\n\nbest dishwasher 2016\n\nbest smartwatch 2016\n\nbest gaming headset 2016\n\nbest action camera 2016\n\nbest bluetooth speaker 2016\n\nHey, I did tell you all just before new year that you should be writing 2016 everywhere on your site.\n\nI could make this page infinitely scrollable if I show all of their rankings, so I’ll just share a couple to show they really do rank.\n\nWhile they aren’t a top result for this one it does show that they’re likely still getting hundreds of clicks per day for just one search term.\n\nIt’s certainly not just with BestProducts that Hearst are having a lot of SEO success though. Just look at how their brand is doing as a whole…\n\nHearst Alone Absolutely Dominate Certain Sectors of Google Search Results\n\nWorried about ranking top three? Why not just take all of the spots.\n\nSadly, Google Search Results Will Never Look Diverse Again\n\nAt least not to me.\n\nYou may think Hearst are some kind of exception and partly, you would be right. However, they’re certainly not alone.\n\nPurch also own some of the biggest sites online.\n\nThey all already link to each other in the footer of every site, but it’s my understanding that they were all fairly big ‘brands’ on their own before being purchased. Just look at the traffic numbers for some of those sites:\n\nToms Hardware – 51 million visitors per month\n\nTop Ten Reviews – 17.5 million visitors per month\n\nLive Science – 20.6 million visitors per month\n\nI don’t have to go into their domain stats; you already know they have authority.\n\nPurch and Hearst compete in many of the same industries and one of Purch’s sites – TopTenReviews – also ranks in my screenshot above for the dishwashers search query.\n\nThere’s no doubt they are watching the success of one of their bigger rivals and if they see that they can spin off new web properties into valuable entities, it must be very tempting to follow the same path.\n\nSadly, the more research I did for this post, the less and less varied Google search results appeared to be. Time after time I was able to trace back the top ranking websites to some of the biggest media companies in the world.\n\nThere are of course some I’m missing (especially outside of the English language) but these are the companies I found most often in search results across the board.\n\nClick here to view a slightly larger image.\n\nTo show you I’m not being dramatic, let’s take a look at some actual search results I believe that these networks are dominating. They’re not just limited to one sector.\n\nThey’ve Taken Over Software\n\nThat’s a little bit of a long-tail example, so let’s look at something far more popular.\n\nThey’ve Taken Over Food\n\nImage results were manually removed from this screenshot for clarity\n\nAnd another…\n\nFor this screenshot I removed some Google images so I could fit in the search results\n\nThey’ve Taken Over Technology\n\nI’m starting to feel like I was one of the only people who didn’t know about these brands.\n\nThey’ve definitely got a big hold on the technology industry.\n\nThey’ve Taken Over Gaming\n\nNote: One Youtube result was removed from this graphic so I could fit in the screenshot\n\nThey’ve Taken Over Health\n\nThey’ve Taken Over Automotive\n\nThey’ve Taken Over Beauty\n\nThey Buy Out the Competition\n\nThey (More than Likely) Share Keyword Data Across Their Network\n\nI can’t blame them for doing this, but it’s certainly interesting to see.\n\nIt’s not only the big broad keywords that send a lot of traffic they can share either. If you have similar brands, you should definitely be taking advantage of the long tail.\n\nWhy have one top search result when you can have two (or many more)?\n\nThese Companies Get $20,000 in Links Just for Buying a Domain Name\n\nWhen Google search results are so reliant on one thing then we’re all a little bit at the mercy of whoever has the most money to throw at the problem.\n\nWhenever these big brands start a new website the tech and news blogs share it with the world, and that means link acquisition.\n\nHearst’s Best Product Got Incredible Links On the Day of Launch\n\nHere is Racked.com, ironically owned by another of the sixteen, talking about their new brand.\n\nAs Did Time’s New Breakfast Site\n\nEven if you’re just writing about the first meal of the day, it’s notable to those in the tech space.\n\nAs Did IAC’s New Health Site\n\nThere are few better links to get about a new brand than a mention from TechCrunch.\n\nIt’s Clear That Domain Authority is More Important Than Ever\n\nIf you didn’t “catch” on to this after seeing how well BestProducts are ranking then let me make it clear: There are almost no backlinks from other sites pointing to the top ranking pages of BestProducts.com.\n\nThey do have some internal links – mostly from the footer of PopularMechanics articles – but very few. However, they have a ton of strong links pointing to their homepage and category pages, which is spreading the ‘link juice’ around their entire website.\n\nThis is inline with what Brian Dean reported when he analysed 1,000,000 Google search results:\n\nAs he says, “In other words, the domain that your page lives on is more important than the page itself.”\n\nOverall, it makes sense that domain authority plays a big role in overall site rankings (it’s not easy to get internal links) but I’m surprised to see it being so important.\n\nHow IAC’s About.com Used Their Authority to Catapult a New Site to the Top of Google\n\nWhen TechCrunch covered the launch of About.com’s new standalone health website, Very Well, they had this to say regarding their SEO,\n\nOne of the greater challenges for About.com will be SEO. The company current has pretty good juice when it comes to Google searches, and launching on a new domain with a new brand could prove difficult to migrate.\n\nThe other interesting thing they quoted, which a lot of other news sites picked up on, was that,\n\nVerywell will launch with more than 50,000 pieces of content ranging from common medical conditions like diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis to simple health tips like how to get more sleep or advice on fitness.\n\nThat’s a lot of content for a brand new site.\n\n50,000 Pages of Content Did Nothing for Their SEO.\n\nFrom what I can tell, Very Well seemed to come online around February of this year. The first mentions or evidence of the site didn’t appear until April, but some of their older content has February 2016 as the publish date.\n\nNow the day they launched the site – whatever that really means – was April 26th, 2016. That means they added 50,000 pieces of content to a dropped domain in the space of two months.\n\nDuring these two months not a single website analytics tool (such as SimilarWeb, Alexa or Compete) detected any traffic going to VeryWell.com\n\nLuckily, About.com Has Some SEO Authority to Throw Around\n\nAs TechCrunch noted, About.com are one of the most SEO-authoritative brands in the world. It seems like no matter what you search for, they’ll be there ranking on the first page of Google.\n\nIt’s interesting then that About.com decided to risk that authority by pointing their health-related sub-domains straight to Verywell.com, as shown below.\n\nThis is just a sample of those I found. There are many more.\n\nTo be clear, these sub-domains used to have sites on them. They’re not just randomly redirecting. They were previously used by About.com.\n\nWIth a wave of links from About.com and the media web talking about IAC’s new web brand, VeryWell started to get noticed on website analysis tools. Most notably by Ahrefs.\n\nThat’s a lot of links in a short period of time. Surely it must be setting off a few red flags like they did for Best Products.com? Heh.\n\n“How’s That New Site Ranking, IAC?” Very Well!\n\nIf you want to know how this new brand is doing in Google, take a look for yourself.\n\nThat’s a recording of 3.6 million visitors to the site with 56% of that reportedly from free search engine traffic.\n\nIAC must be pleased with that. So much so in fact that I think this situation is only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThis Domination of Google Results Is Going to Get Much Worse\n\nOver the last two weeks of dedicating day and night to this topic I found a lot of similarities in these mega brands.\n\nMany started offline in publishing and brought those titles online while many purchased their own competitors and ran different brands like they were separate entities. For instance, IAC purchased About.com while AOL (now owned by Verizon) purchased Patch, TechCrunch and The Huffington Post.\n\nHowever, the most common thing I’ve found in my research is that they all plan to spread the authority of their online presence.\n\nIAC’s About.com Will Disperse into Many More Verticals\n\nSpeaking with TechCrunch, their CEO Neil Vogel states, “What we learned in rebuilding what we were is that we don’t want to be that anymore. About was built during a different time in the internet, where scale translated to trust. But the internet has changed. No one wants advice on their 401k from the same people that give advice on how to bake a pie.”\n\nAs TechCrunch also note;\n\nLearning that, About has shifted its focus to building out verticals around its troves of topic-specific content, with Verywell being the first.\n\nAfter seeing the quick SEO success of Very Well, I’m sure they’ll be bringing that plan forward.\n\nTime Have Already Spun-Off into Two Verticals\n\nBack in September of 2015, Time Inc’s ‘The Foundry’ (sort of like their internal incubator) launched a car news website called The Drive. Time recently revealed the site is now receiving more than 2 million unique visitors per month.\n\nMore recently, Time launched a website called Extra Crispy. Oddly enough it’s a website dedicated to breakfast, but if you saw the screenshots above then you’ll know they’ve received a TON of links back to this site, simply because it was created by Time.\n\nTwo of the 16 Are Teaming Up\n\nJust last month, two of the sixteen brands I’ve highlighted today actually acquired a new company together named Complex Media.\n\nThe video-focused company claim to reach more than 50 million unique visitors per month.\n\nWith Verizon purchasing AOL last year for $4.4B, I wouldn’t be overly surprised to see them make a few more content-focused acquisitions. *Cough* Verizon will buy Hearst *cough*\n\nHearst Built BestProducts.com in Just Six Weeks\n\nI’m not even talking about how long it took to get the content on the website. I’m talking about sitting in a meeting one day and having the idea for the site to actually having it online and getting links from some of the most powerful domains in the world.\n\nDigiday reports that Hearst can move fast. “We’re now at place where we can spin up properties incredibly quickly,” Young said. “This went from idea to launch in six weeks.”\n\nYoung also commented that, “We have a strong new platform. Now we can start applying that to new opportunities.”\n\nWhich to me can only mean that more BestProducts-like websites are on their way.\n\nA Depressing Summary, but Not a Negative One\n\nThough this post may seem like a bit of a “it’s us against them” fight, that really wasn’t my aim.\n\nThe more research I did for this article and the more I realised certain brands were owned by the same company, the more I felt like I was watching Food Inc, the documentary that revealed the thousands of brands you see on supermarket shelves are really owned by just a handful of companies.\n\nSide note: If anyone has the skills to make a similar graphic with the brands I covered here I would include it\n\nIt’s not too dissimilar from what I’ve shared today. Thanks to Jason and Mary for putting this graphic together.\n\nClick here to view larger\n\nAs I’ve always said, I write articles that I personally think would be interesting to read. In 11 years of immersing myself in the online marketing industry I’ve never seen anyone talk about the huge dominance that certain players have on search results. So, as the research was interesting to me, I decided to share it.\n\nLet’s take an ideal worldview for a second. If Google’s ideals are to be believed, results from queries in their search engine should produce results that searchers want to find.\n\nFor that reason, I’m sure teenage American girls searching for advice on colours of eye-liner aren’t thinking “Ugh, really Google? Beauty tips from Vogue again?”\n\nSimilarly, when I’m searching for tech product reviews, I’m actually happy results from The Verge appear over some site I don’t have much faith in. I trust The Verge, and I’m more likely to click on their results than from anyone else.\n\nFrom an objective standpoint, the Google results are good, if not great. They provide what the searcher, and I, are looking for.\n\nBut I’m a marketer. If you’re still reading this article, I can assume with 99% certainty that you’re one too.\n\nAs a marketer I learned how little Google care if a new site gets hundreds of thousands of links very quickly.\n\nI came away with even more belief in the importance of having a strong domain (read: a domain that has a lot of backlinks) if you want internal pages to rank.\n\nI also became a little fearful that these brands are going to spread into even more verticals, taking their already huge financial war chests and filling in all of the blank Google results they don’t yet own.\n\nIf we want to debate whether it’s fair or not or whether Google should make changes, a court of law in the US has twice protected their search results under the First Amendment.

The risk is very slight for those who have received the recommended two doses of the vaccine,” read the statement.\n\n“The person was infectious but did not know it because the person had not yet developed the tell-tale rash — a circumstance that contributes to the rapid spread of the highly infectious, airborne virus. Symptoms can develop between 7 and 21 days after exposure to the virus,” the city said.\n\n“If those exposed develop fever and a facial rash, they should contact their health care provider for advice and assistance. Those at highest risk are those who are unvaccinated, infants, pregnant women, and those with impaired immunity.”\n\n“I encourage Berkeley community members to make sure they and their children have received the required two doses,” said Dr. Janet Berreman, Berkeley’s Health Officer. “Obtaining records of your vaccination could prove critical in the event of a local outbreak.”\n\nThe city’s statement also included the following guidance:\n\nMeasles is highly preventable. The recommended two doses of MMR vaccine protects 99% of people even if they are exposed to the virus. Even a single dose protects 95% of those vaccinated.\n\nBerkeley Public Health is working with the restaurant to notify and assess exposed individuals who work at the restaurant. Berkeley Public Health is also working closely with the San Mateo County Health System, which is working to trace all contacts involving the infected individual.\n\nCalifornia is experiencing a large measles outbreak that has now spread to other states. There have been at least 126 cases statewide that have reached six Bay Area counties, including Alameda County. New cases continue to emerge. The origin of the local restaurant patron’s infection are unknown at this time. Public health officials around the state have been working to track cases and limit exposure to others through quarantines and tracing the populations of those possibly infected.\n\nMeasles can have significant health impacts, especially among infants and pregnant women. Patients develop high fevers, red and watery eyes, high fevers, and a rash that starts on the head and face and spreads to cover most of the body. In some cases, measles can lead to pneumonia, encephalitis, hospitalization or even death.\n\nTwo doses of MMR vaccine are recommended, starting at 12 months of age. The second dose can be given as soon as 28 days after the first dose. In high risk situations, infants as young as 6 months of age can receive the vaccine.\n\nAdults born before 1957 are considered immune because of the prevalence of measles prior to the emergence of the vaccine. Other adults who were not vaccinated as children, or are not sure of their immune status, can also receive the MMR vaccine.\n\nMembers of the community who have questions can contact Berkeley Public Health at 981-5300 or email: publichealth@cityofberkeley.

Yet here we are, watching him get off to a start in 2016 that would put him on track for the best season of a historic career.\n\nThat's how it looks from this view after Thursday's three-hit shutout in a 5-0 dismantling of the Mets, anyway.

Consider this: Every single year, Kershaw strikes out more hitters. Every single year, he combines that with fewer walks:\n\n\"OK,\" you're maybe saying. \"He's great, but it's just eight starts. Lots of things can happen over eight starts.\" Fair enough, although it's more than obvious that Kershaw is hardly a small-sample fluke at this point. Let's instead look at Kershaw's past 32 starts, a number that may seem somewhat arbitrary but is generally accepted as \"a full season of starts\" for pitchers in the era of the five-man rotation. In 236 1/3 innings, Kershaw has struck out 305 against 30 walks, and has posted a 1.49 ERA and a 1.63 Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP) mark.\n\nNow let's take that hidden \"season\" and compare it to the best pitching seasons of all time. Since the live-ball era began in 1920, there have been 4,019 seasons of at least 200 innings.\n\nBest seasons, 1920-2016, Fielding Independent Pitching\n\n1. Pedro Martinez, 1999 -- 1.39\n\n2. Kershaw, 2015-16 (last 32 starts) -- 1.63\n\n3. Dwight Gooden, 1984 -- 1.69\n\n4. Bob Gibson, 1968 -- 1.85\n\n5. Sandy Koufax, 1963 -- 1.88\n\nEven when using a league-adjusted version that accounts for the changing run environments in baseball throughout the years, Kershaw's \"season\" still ranks second behind Martinez, just ahead of a pair of elite Randy Johnson years (1995 and 2001). As you can see, Kershaw's FIP just keeps on improving, as this look at his 32-game rolling FIP shows:\n\nTweet from @mike_petriello: Kershaw, who shouldn't possibly still have room to get better, is still getting better: pic.twitter.com/iv98PLViJE\n\nWhy FIP and not ERA? Because ERA can be affected by quality of defense and bullpen along with batted ball luck, which the pitcher cannot fully control, and FIP is entirely based on strikeouts, walks and home runs, the \"three true outcomes\" that should be entirely within a pitcher's control. It's not a flawless measure, because it doesn't account for quality of contact against, but that's not exactly been a Kershaw issue either; he hasn't allowed opposing hitters to manage a batting average over .200 since 2012's .204, and after three straight years in the .192-.194 range, this year it's down to .186. In the two years of the Statcast™ era, his 85.6 mph exit velocity is tied for the lowest of any starting pitcher.\n\nSo what exactly is Kershaw doing differently in 2016 to actually up his production? He's not really throwing harder. Kershaw's spin rate isn't markedly different. He's throwing his slider slightly more at the expense of his curve, but not to an extent that stands out. It's hard to show huge differences when you're looking at a pitcher who was already great, though there are at least two things we can point to:\n\nHe's throwing more fastballs for strikes ...\n\n\"Walking guys is how you get in trouble,\" Kershaw told MLB.com after beating the Mets. \"I'd rather them string hits and make them swing bats to beat me, that's always my mentality.\"\n\nKershaw is right. Between 2010-15, between 55 percent and 58 percent of his fastballs were thrown in the strike zone. So far in 2016, that number is up to 65 percent. Considering that Kershaw threw more than 1,800 fastballs last year, a jump of 10 percentage points is nearly 200 more fastballs for strikes. Even Bartolo Colon, notorious for pumping fastballs into the zone, has never made it to 65 percent.\n\nAmong lefties who have thrown 200 fastballs, only Drew Smyly has more vertical movement than Kershaw's, which makes it very difficult to hit -- and is how he can get away with all those strikes. It's also how Kershaw has walked just four hitters all year (and one of them, to Hunter Pence, featured what was probably the most questionable ball call you'll see all season.) Kershaw doesn't have baseball's hardest fastball, or the highest-spin fastball. But he does have pinpoint control and the confidence in it to challenge hitters.\n\nGif: Clayton Kershaw fastball\n\n… and he's using his curve more effectively.\n\nFamously styled \"Public Enemy No. 1\" by Vin Scully back in 2008, Kershaw's curve has long been his most famous weapon. It's not necessarily moving more this year, showing 9.8 inches of vertical drop, since his career average is 9.3 inches of drop.\n\nBut Kershaw is using it differently. While we just hailed him for throwing more fastball strikes, he's throwing fewer with the curve -- his zone percentage has dropped from 47 percent to 38 percent to 28 percent. But the contact rate against it hasn't changed, staying steady in the 61 percent range, and that's not a bad thing.\n\nMaking hard contact on curveballs outside the zone is incredibly difficult, and of the 56 pitchers who have had at least 10 curves put into play, Kershaw's 79.6 mph exit velocity is the third lowest. Only twice of the 143 times he's thrown it has a hitter barrelled it up at more than 100 mph, and both of those times were groundouts to shortstop.\n\nGif: Kershaw Curve K Looking\n\nKershaw didn't need to get better, and in many ways it didn't seem posisble for him to get better -- yet, so far, he's been better. The results have been nearly unthinkable.\n\nSo with all due respect to Chris Sale, Max Scherzer, Noah Syndergaard and (especially) the phenomenal and historic in his own right Jake Arrieta, there's no need to be submitting resumes for the title of Best Pitcher in Baseball right now, because the position simply isn't open. The King isn't dead. Long live the King.",
  "latent_5250": "An Emmy-award winning director who discovered that one of his movies had been downloaded from torrent sites and handed out among store employees has gotten his revenge. Casey Tebo went to the store in question and started stealing ingredients to make a clam chowder. Unlike most pirates, however, he got caught.\n\nAmong most copyright holders and some artists there is an insistence that illegal downloading is tantamount to stealing. A download can result in a lost sale, they argue, thereby depriving creators (or distributors) of revenue.\n\nFile-sharers, on the other hand, have their own theories as to what their hobby amounts to. Conclusions vary, from “try before you buy” to satisfying demand unmet by authorized sources. Some merely want content for free but still argue that a copy does not amount to theft.\n\nDirector Casey Tebo, on the other hand, strongly disagrees.\n\nTebo, who has directed live performances for Aerosmith, Mötley Crüe, Judas Priest and Run DMC, believes that piracy is just like stealing. And, after becoming a victim himself, decided to do something about it.\n\nAccording to the 42-year-old, who won an Emmy for his work on ESPN E:60’s Dream On: The Stories of Boston’s Strongest, the final straw was when he discovered people had been pirating one of his movies.\n\nTebo wrote and directed 2016 horror movie Happy Birthday (Buy!) and recently discovered that an old friend from school had watched it.\n\n“He said ‘Bro, I saw your movie, it was amazing!’,” Tebo recalled.\n\nWhen the director asked where he’d seen it – iTunes, Walmart etc – the guy dropped the bombshell. Someone at work supplied it.\n\n“What do you mean, he brings the DVDs into work?” the director asked. “I don’t know what that means?”\n\nIn a mocking tone impersonating his former friend’s recollection, Tebo continued.\n\n“He gets ’em off, you know, King Torrent, uTorrent, your fucking mother’s torrent, whatever the fuck it is.”\n\nNoting that his movie only had a small budget with just three investors putting in $500K between them, Tebo said that one of his buddies came up with a plot to get revenge.\n\n“You should go to the fuckin grocery store this cat works at and just fuckin steal some shit,” his buddy said. “And, if you get caught by the cops, just say ‘Hey, he steals my shit, why can’t I steal his shit?'”\n\nIn a video posted on YouTube, which he describes as a PSA (Pirates Suck Ass), Tebo reveals what happened next. A sped-up clip shows the director ‘shopping’ for $30 worth of ‘free’ ingredients to make a clam chowder. He then leaves the store without paying. Needless to say, Tebo (who apparently was born with six fingers on his right hand) didn’t get away with it.\n\nSomeone from the store came out to Tebo’s car after spotting him on the security camera and threatened to call the cops unless he came back and paid.\n\n“Yeah I know, but this is like a really huge chain supermarket,” Tebo protested. Although subtle, this was almost certainly a dig at people who believe that downloading movies from big companies doesn’t hurt them.\n\n“This is a store, you just robbed it,” the worker replied. Then, Tebo revealed his scheme.\n\n“See, the guy who works at your store likes to download the movies and burn ’em and give them to everybody who works there. You have people in your store who are stealing from my industry, so why can’t I just steal from you guys?” he asked.\n\nThe store worker was having none of it. “Give me the bags or i’m calling the cops,” he said.\n\nAgain, Tebo underlined his point.\n\n“I just want to know. If you’re the manager of this place and you got guys downloading illegal movies, why can’t I take groceries for free?” he questioned.\n\n“Because it’s fucking stealing, asshole,” came the reply…..\n\nTebo says that he eventually gave the stuff back. He didn’t, however, explain why he thought it was fair to steal from the grocery store when his aim was to get revenge on one of its employees. Maybe this is the real-life equivalent of holding ISPs responsible for Internet pirates, who knows.\n\nThe whole bizarre affair is documented below.",

In contrast to the main Occupy events across the country, this group was mostly Latino and Native American.\n\nAccording to spokesperson Jerry Lopez, they demonstrated because, “A lot of communities of color have the desire to express their concerns around what has happened with the bank industry and our communities.” West St. Paul was chosen because, “We want to do something where we live, where we work, where we do most of our shopping.”\n\nDemonstrators’ signs and the speeches reflected the themes of the Occupy movement, with references to the 99 percent and to bank bailouts and mortgage foreclosures.\n\nClyde Bellecourt of the American Indian Movement (AIM) told the group, “We know Wells Fargo, and we know him well.” He said that back in the day, “they asked our grandfathers” for permission to ride the Pony Express across Dakota land, and then to send the telephone wire and the Wells Fargo stagecoach, and that, “We said yes, because we are a generous people.” But, said Bellecourt, promises and treaties were made and broken. Now, he warned, another threat to the land is coming in the form of the Alberta pipeline, which will run from Canada down through the land over the Oglala aquifer.\n\nLouis Alemayehu, a Minnesota poet and environmentalist of African, Native American and European ancestry, sounded a call for solidarity. “I stand for what I stand on — Mother Earth,” he said. “Because she is our mother, we are all family. … We need to ask what are we for? What are we going to build? What are we going to create?”\n\nAlemayehu said that re-localization is part of the task ahead. “We need to have minds that are ready to create what we need,” he continued, “[We need] to get rid of divide and conquer. Let us build bridges to where we want to go.”\n\nWhen Lopez tried to enter the bank to withdraw his money, the door was locked so he could not go in. After a few minutes, another demonstrator went around to the other side of the building, entered and walked through the lobby to the locked door, and opened it for Lopez. Once inside, he was allowed to withdraw his money. A bank customer objected to Lopez using the commercial teller to withdraw money from his commercial account and demanded to see proof that he had a commercial account. The same man argued with AIM members accompanying Lopez, and the bank called in police, but no arrests were made.\n\nAsked whether he thinks about the main Occupy movement, Lopez said, “I think it’s important that we allow a space for dialogue around the history of race and class with respect to communities of color and indigenous peoples, with respect to the role played in the protest movement. but it’s important that the movement itself not lose momentum. We want to unite, not divide.”",

  "latent_6078": "This November, Oregon voters will get to decide whether they want to legalize and regulate recreational marijuana.\n\n\"Initiative Petition 53 has qualified for the November ballot,\" Tony Green, communications director for Oregon Secretary of State Kate Brown, confirmed to The Huffington Post Tuesday.\n\nThe petition was submitted by New Approach Oregon, a Portland-based marijuana policy reform group, earlier this month. More than 87,000 signatures have been verified by Brown's office.\n\nAccording to the proposed initiative text, adults 21 and over in Oregon would be able to possess up to eight ounces of marijuana at home and one ounce in public. The Oregon Liquor Control Commission would be the agency charged with regulating and monitoring the industry, similar to the regulatory model used in Washington state. Taxes collected on sales of marijuana would be distributed to schools, law enforcement and drug prevention and education programs in the state.\n\nIt appears likely that the Oregon measure will pass. A recent poll showed that 57 percent of the state's likely 2014 voters support recreational marijuana legalization. Oregon has already decriminalized cannabis and legalized it for medical use, and Gov. John Kitzhaber (D) has signaled his support for recreational marijuana legalization, should a bill make it to his desk.\n\n\"I hear the drumbeats from Washington and Colorado,\" Kitzhaber said in January, referring to the two U.S. states where legal, regulated marijuana markets already exist. \"I want to make sure we have a thoughtful regulatory system. The legislature would be the right place to craft that.\"\n\nOregon is not the only state that will consider legalizing recreational marijuana in November. Alaska voters will also decide this fall on regulating marijuana for adults.\n\n\"With legalization initiatives qualified in two states -- with another in D.C. likely to be certified soon -- plus several recent wins on the floor of the Republican-controlled U.S. House, 2014 is shaping up to be the biggest year for marijuana reform yet,\" Tom Angell, chairman of the advocacy group Marijuana Majority, told HuffPost. \"If we win these legalization initiatives, it's not only likely that more states will follow suit in 2016, but that presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle are going to see the value in being perceived as pro-reform.\"",

  "latent_6140": "Declaring that the city is ready for what may be a historic blizzard, Mayor Thomas M. Menino today canceled school in Boston for Friday and urged people to stay off roads and out of downtown.\n\n“We haven’t had a snowstorm of this size in many years,’’ Menino said at a press conference at City Hall. “We are hearty New Englanders used to these storms, but we want people to use common sense and stay off the streets.’’\n\nThe city, the largest in New England, will increase the number of public safety officials on the streets, Menino said, and take other steps to prepare for the snow. Before dawn Friday, 200 plows and salt spreaders will be crisscrossing roads in Boston. By 9 a.m., officials plan to increase the number of plows and salt spreaders to 600.\n\nFriday trash pickup will be moved up to 6 a.m. in an effort to get garbage trucks off streets. A snow emergency will go into effect at noon Friday, which bans parking on major thoroughfares. Roughly 15,000 parking spaces will be available at discounted rates at roughly 50 private and municipal garages. Extra staff will be deployed to homeless shelters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMenino met Thursday in his City Hall office with 50 top municipal officials to discuss preparations for the storm. The team included Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis, Fire Commissioner Roderick Fraser, and a man introduced as Boston’s snow general, Elmo Baldassari, who as the city’s deputy commissioner of public works oversees snowplows.\n\nMenino seemed confident that his administration was up to the task presented by the storm.\n\n“We’re ready for it,’’ Menino said before repeating, “The message here is to stay off the public roadways.’’",

We’ve recorded it four times — once for every season, giving truly unique footage of this ten hour ride.\n\nYou can watch it on the web, but we have also made everything available for you to download in full HD — and licensed it with Creative Commons so that you can edit, remix and share!\n\nThis is an example of what you can make with these files:\n\nThe Nordland Railway (‘Nordlandsbanen’ in Norwegian) celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. The railway is 729 kilometers long, and passes thorugh spectacular scenery, varying from the fjord area around Trondheim in the south, through beautiful valleys, over mountains and along fjords before crossing the Arctic Circle at Saltfjellet and descending down to the coastal city of Bodø.\n\nFollowing the success of the world’s longest live documentary, Hurtigruten minute by minute, the Telemak Canal and Bergensbanen minute by minute, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation set out to film the Nordland Railway as well. This time, though, we had to think up a way to show the contrasts one can encounter along the route; the weather, colours and climatic conditions.\n\nThe solution was to film the journey once every season, to show the different weather conditions and the great changes in nature’s expression from summer to authumn, and winter to spring.\n\nWe have thus recorded the journey four times, with the idea of combining the four seasons in both a regular, 10 hour long, TV documentary, and a version for web where the audience can mix their own version. Let us show you an example of the result:\n\nRecording\n\nThe recording was done using a SonyXDcam, placed in the front of the Di. 4 locomotives used on Nordlandsbanen. In addition we used Canon XF 302 for some side view-shots and interviews, in addition to GoPro Hero 2 and a Sony Handycam for some effect shots.\n\nSince NSB Di. 4 is a rather unstable camera platform with a lot of vibrations, we used a special image stabilizing lens from Canon, with the very cryptial name of HJ15ex8.5B KRSE-V. For aerial shots, during the summer, we used NRK’s own Cineflex V14.\n\nSyncing the files\n\nEven though the Norwegian State Railway managed to keep the schedule on each of our recorded trips, the four journeys differed in position at any given time. The train will, for example, not enter a station at the exact same second in both June and March, and cannot keep the exact same speed at all times. In other words, we had to synchronize the video files in order to make the train appear to be at the same place at the same time in every video stream.\n\nThe GPS position of the train was logged continuously on each trip, with an interval of 1 Hz. Deciding to use the summer clip as the master, we used Microsoft Excel to interpolate the GPS data to 25 Hz, to match the video frame rate of 25 frames per second. This 25 Hz GPS data was then written to a PostgreSQL database.\n\nWe then wrote a script which asked the database to give us the time for when each of the other seasons were at the same position as the Summer recording. This gave us a long list of time codes, near 36 000. Using Adobe After Effects, we were then able to manipulate the speed of the winter, autumn and spring-recordings with the effect «time remap», to match the speed and position of the summer recording.\n\nThis is a screenshot of the autumn recording before we adjust it to match the speed of the summer recording. We see that the time is linear, meaning one frame in = one frame out. There is also only two keyframes: at the start and the end of the video. Adobe After Effects enables us to copy the keyframe data as plain text, and if we do that, this is what we end up with:\n\nAdobe After Effects 8.0 Keyframe Data\n\nUnits Per Second 90\n\nSource Width 1920\n\nSource Height 1080\n\nSource Pixel Aspect Ratio 1\n\nComp Pixel Aspect Ratio 1\n\nTime Remap\n\nFrame seconds\n\n0 0\n\n892026 9911.4\n\nEnd of Keyframe Data\n\nThe data of interest here is the values under «frame» and «seconds». Frame denotes which frame number is the keyframe, and seconds denotes what time in the recorded video that is to be shown at that specific frame.\n\nYou might have noticed we use 90 frames per second, as opposed to the original 25 that we recorded. Adobe After Effects does not support time lines over three hours, but does, however, support up to 99,99 frames per second. By speeding up the video, we are able to keep our time line under three hours, and avoid splitting our recording over several time lines.\n\nWhat we need to do is tell After Effects when to slow down and when to speed up the recording. Using the position data we created earlier, we can generate new keyframes:\n\nAdobe After Effects 8.0 Keyframe Data\n\nUnits Per Second 90\n\nSource Width 1920\n\nSource Height 1080\n\nSource Pixel Aspect Ratio 1\n\nComp Pixel Aspect Ratio 1\n\nTime Remap\n\nFrame seconds\n\n990 0.0\n\n990 1.0\n\n—– —–\n\n3600 82.0\n\n3675 83.0\n\n3761 84.0\n\n3841 85.0\n\n3927 86.0\n\n4010 87.0\n\n4089 88.0\n\n4176 89.0\n\n4251 90.0\n\n4341 91.0\n\n4420 92.0\n\n—– —–\n\n3201886 35380.0\n\n3201886 35381.0\n\nEnd of Keyframe Data\n\n(Originally this creates over 32000 lines, so we have shortened the list substantially.)\n\nHaving pasted the new keyframes, our timeline will look like this:\n\nTime still goes on, but in this case it has over over 32 000 keyframes telling After Effects when to stop (horizontal lines) or jump (vertical lines) in time.\n\nRendering the three, time remapped seasons took over 20 hours each. They were still 90 frames per second, however, but using Apple Cinema Tools we were able to stretch this back to the original 25 frames per second — without another round of rendering.\n\nThe result can be seen below: we are able to run the four seasons at the same speed, giving the impression that the train is at the same place at the same time.\n\nSharing\n\nThe TV programme can be seen at our website http://nrk.no/nordlandsbanen, where we’ve also coded a beta version of a video mixer, which enables you to view whatever season you want, or watch two seasons at the same time.\n\nJust like we shared Bergensbanen, Flåmsbanen, Holmenkollbanen, Telemarkskanalen, and the 134 hour long Hurtigruten minute by minute-programmes, we do of course share the Nordlandsbanen as well. We give you all four seasons, already synchronised, in addition to the GPS data for each trip. The files can be downloaded via BitTorrent:",
  "latent_6338": "India and Russia +\n\nVladmir Putin +\n\nBRICS Summit +\n\nNEW DELHI: In a game-changing arms acquisition, India is going to ink a Rs 39,000 crore deal for five new-generation Russian S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems, which can destroy incoming hostile aircraft, stealth fighters, missiles and drones at ranges of up to 400-km.will also finalise the long-awaited agreement for the joint production of around 200 Kamov 226T light utility helicopters at a cost of about $1 billion under the \"Make in India\" programme.With Russian Presidentheaded for India to attend thein Goa, the S-400 deal as well as the joint venture for helicopters to be established between defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics and Russian Rostec State Corporation will be inked over the weekend.TOI was the first to report in October 2015 that India had decided to purchase the S-400 systems, which basically have three kinds of missiles, with different capabilities, that can fly at supersonic and hypersonic speeds to intercept all kinds of targets at ranges from 120 to 400-km. Russian experts even proclaim the S-400 surface-to-air missile (SAM) system can \"radar lock and shoot down\" stealth fifth-generation fighters like the American F-35 jets.This procurement comes over a year after China sealed a $3 billion deal with Russia for acquisition of six S-400 batteries. China is slated to get the S-400 batteries, which is designated `SA-21 Growler' by NATO and rivals the anti-ballistic missile capabilities of the US Patriot PAC-3 system, from 2017 onwards.As for the Kamov helicopters, which will replace the aging and obsolete Cheetah and Chetak fleets of the armed forces, the deal will be signed between defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics and Russian Rostec State Corporation. HAL and Rostec will form a joint venture to set up the production facilities to execute the deal.As was reported by TOI last month, the decks had been cleared for the helicopter deal after a flurry of high-level meetings between the two countries. After a pronounced tilt towards the US in terms of defence deals and military-to-military ties over the last decade, India has reassured Russia that their traditional strategic partnership and defence projects will continue as before.Negotiations for other mega defence projects with Russia like the joint development of the futuristic fifth generation fighter aircraft (FGFA) and the $1.5 billion lease of a second nuclear-powered submarine are also on track now.Soon after it had come to office in 2014, the NDA government had scrapped the long-pending acquisition of 197 light-utility helicopters from abroad, the selection process for which has been dogged by corruption allegations and technical deviations.The armed forces have waited a long time for new helicopters to replace their Cheetah/Chetak helicopters, which are even used even in high-altitude areas like Siachen. In all, the Army and IAF need 384 light-utility helicopters. HAL, which was tasked to manufacture 187 similar helicopters in 2009, too, is yet to deliver.",

If you would like to be privy to his daily market comments and model ratings via daily email, free of charge, email him at wayne[AT]witterlester.com with the subject title “ADD ME TO DAILY EMAIL”.\n\nThe Hindenburg Omen Signal flashed a sell signal this week and will draw a lot of attention this weekend. If you google the signal, you will see that several of the criteria are predicated on a large number of issues making both New Highs and New Lows on the NYSE composite, a phenomena that I have researched and written about in the past (for more, see: Confusion Index). A reader ask for my take of the signals implications today so I thought I would pass along my response to him.\n\nThe NYSE composite index is comprised of approximately 3200 issues of which about 50% are non-operating companies, many of which are interest rate sensitive bond funds. Throughout the last decade this has been overlooked by many analyst for two primary reasons.\n\nIt is generally not an issue, because most of the time, bonds and stocks move in the same direction, often with bonds leading stocks which was very convenient. NYSE Composite data is very available, listed in the financial sections of most newspapers and on most financial web sites, while tape data on an index such as the S&P 500 or NYSE common stocks are not because they do not have a parent exchange conveniently computing their statisitics each day.\n\nAt this point in stock market history, specifically the last week, you have a Draconian disconnect between bonds and stocks an event that normally happens when you get historically low interest rates resulting from recessionary and deflation concerns. This has resulted in a large numbers of issues making new highs on the NYSE, 95% of which are interest sensitive funds. At the same time a large number of actual stocks are making new lows, incorrectly suggesting confusion in the equities. See below for a list of the Wall Street Journal’s list of 52 week New Highs and New Lows on August 13 to get an appreciation for the issues being listed as New Highs each day:\n\nIf you examine the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq index you will see this is not the case for predominantly equity only indexes. Below is a table showing New Highs and New Lows on each of the three Indexes for the previous week.\n\nNotice that on Wednesday and Thursday (August 11th-12th), the NYSE showed more issues making New Highs than New Lows. This is an incredibly misleading equity statistic because there were more than ten times as many issues making New Lows than New Highs on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes.\n\nI am always leery of stating that this time is different, but I don’t see the Hindenburg Omen Signal in play using any index of equity only issues, which is not to say that the market can’t go lower for other reasons.",

Spain has been especially vocal, fearing it would further inspire separatists in Catalonia and the Basque Country,\n\nGordon Brown, former British prime minister, who is himself a Scot, told a No campaign rally that the quiet majority of pro-Union Scots \"will be silent no more\", while Alex Salmond, pro-independence leader and Scottish first minister, urged voters to seize a democratic opportunity 307 years in the making.\n\nA Yes vote would have led to months of negotiations between Scotland and the British government over the messy details of independence, which would have taken effect on March 24, 2016, the anniversary of the date in 1707 that Scotland decided to unite with Britain, according to Scottish authorities.",

  "latent_6552": "Headlines about the first televised debate between U.S. presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were predominate in much of the world’s media outlets Tuesday, with many largely opining that Clinton came up trumps.\n\nEuropean press, in particular, lauded Clinton for her “poise” and being “calm” and “well-prepared” for the debate. Left-leaning UK newspaper The Guardian led with the headline, “Clinton calm as Trump struggles on issues of racism, sexism and foreign policy.” It said the “candidates had several heated exchanges and Clinton landed several big blows including on Trump’s taxes and ‘racist behavior’ regarding birtherism.” Right-leaning Brit paper The Telegraph said the debate, which was likely watched by more than 100 million people on U.S. TVs, “revealed Donald Trump’s limitations.”\n\n“This was a lesson in the limits of Trump the entertainer,” wrote Ruth Sherlock. “Under the glare of the lights on the debate stage at Hofstra University, Donald Trump faltered. The debate format, in which each candidate was given two whole minutes to answer a question, did not lend itself to fast quips.” She added that Trump “rambled and struggled” to make clear points.\n\nGerman paper Der Spiegel dubbed the Republican nominee “erratic and uncertain” while France’s center-left paper Le Monde said Trump “drowned in his own speeches.” France’s Le Figaro, which leans center-right, claimed Clinton had managed to “destabilize her opponent” in the first debate.\n\nA number of Brit headlines including The Telegraph, Daily Mail, the Independent and The Times all pointed to Clinton branding Trump a “racist,” and the concern amongst much of the continent’s business world and left-leaning media was that a Trump presidency would have detrimental ramifications across the world.\n\nHowever, Guardian political commentator Jill Abramson said that while Trump was “rude,” “Clinton came off as too pleased with herself and failed, once again, to deliver a digestible vision of how she would change the country.” But she added that if Clinton’s “intention was to let Trump asphyxiate himself, mission accomplished.”\n\nPiers Morgan, who counts himself as a “friend” of Trump, couldn’t help but get his two cents in on his UK morning talk show Good Morning Britain, which he co-hosts with Susanna Reid. Morgan credited himself with Clinton’s performance on the debate. “She obviously read my column yesterday urging her not to trade punches and not to back down,” he said, referring to his regular column in the Daily Mail.\n\nItalian press such as Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica newspapers pointed to the issues that riled the candidates the most during the debate such as “employment, the economy, racial tensions and terrorism” with the latter indicating that neither candidate fought hard enough to earn “the knockout blow.”\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, the country’s TV channel Rossiya 1 claimed “Russia was one of the key topics” of the debate and independent newspaper Nesavisimaya Gazeta claimed Trump appeals to Russian sympathizers in the U.S., who “like his proposal to restrict the access of illegal migrants to the country.”\n\nIranian state TV highlighted the candidates’ take on Iran’s nuclear issue while Qatar’s Al-Jazeera focused on comments made on the Middle East region, saying that Trump attempted to blame Clinton for the “failure” of U.S.-Middle Eastern policies and had therefore caused “chaos in the region.”",
  "latent_6619": "LANDOVER, MD - SEPTEMBER 01: Lorenzo Alexander #97 of the Washington Redskins warms up before the start of a preseason game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at FedExField on September 1, 2011 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Rob Carr/Getty Images) credit: Rob Carr/Getty Images\n\n— The Washington Redskins could have Lorenzo Alexander making yet another position switch. Or at least they’re preparing him in case of emergency.\n\nAlexander has been working a little bit with the tight ends recently.\n\n“I may be taking a couple here and there,” Alexander told 106.7 The Fan’s LaVar and Dukes Wednesday afternoon when asked whether he was taking snaps on offense. “They’ve got me over there learning some of the tight end position. But it’s more so being ready like I was last year, instead of just throwing me in there when somebody got hurt. It’s more about just having me mentally ready, mentally sharp, so I can go in there and still do the same type of job that Darrel Young or Chris Cooley would do at fullback or that tiger tight end position.”\n\nAnother position switch would be fitting for a man who has seemly made a career of filling every hole imaginable on the team. During his NFL career, Alexander has shined on special teams, played on both the offensive and defensive lines and even had a previous stint at tight end.\n\nAlexander has served as a backup outside linebacker in recent years, but has been earmarked to move to inside this season.\n\nOne player on the team joked that Alexander changes positions more often than a politician.\n\n“I fill that niche as being that ‘One Man Gang’ and doing a lot of different things for the team,” he said. “That’s why I’ve been in the league for eight years and hopefully I can play four or five more years doing the same thing, if not eventually become the starter.”\n\nHe called his versatility a “blessing” and attributed it to his time at Cal.\n\nAs for his progress at tight end, Alexander has only taken “mental reps” thus far.\n\n“I mean, you want to go back to the film in ’07 when I was beasting guys off the line of scrimmage,” he joked. “But I haven’t done it in a while. Obviously I’m a smaller guy now so it’s going to be a little bit more of just getting back in there and getting that technique back.”\n\nSince his last stint on offense, defensive ends and outside linebackers have grown more athletic.\n\n“Over-extending yourself and letting these guys throw you can happen easily if you haven’t done it enough,” he said, acknowledging he has a lot of work to do. “Watching Fred [Davis] and watching [Chris] Cooley and seeing how they approach it is really going to help me out in the meeting room and out at practice with them.”\n\nFollow @FNNChuck, @granthpaulsen and @1067TheFanDC on Twitter for breaking Redskins news.\n\n‪‬",
  "latent_6698": "TMZ is reporting that boxing star Adrien Broner has rejected a healthy 5-year, $40 million offer from Roc Nation Sports. Broner felt that the offer was insulting to him because it was for only $8 million per year. Broner figures that he’ll be fighting four times in 2015 alone. Unfortunately, Broner didn’t say what kind of money he’s looking for to sign with them, but you’d have to assume that it’s a lot more than the $40 million that Roc Nation was supposedly offering him to sign.\n\nIf Broner isn’t happy with a big offer of $40 million, it would be interesting to see what kind of money that he’s looking for in order to sign a contract of 5 years with various promoters.\n\nSome boxing fans feel that Broner has already shown his best while fighting in the super featherweight and lightweight divisions. He’s not looked good since moving up to 140 and 147, and there’s major questions whether he’ll ever be more than just a contender in those two weight classes.\n\nBroner wants to be a pay-per-view fighter like his mentor Floyd Mayweather Jr and Filipino star Manny Pacquiao, but it could be difficult for Broner to make the leap up to that class without him becoming a champion and proving that he can beat most if not all the top guys in his own weight class. As of now, you can’t put Broner as the No.1 fighter at 140 and definitely not even close to being the No.1 fighter at 147.\n\nYes, Broner is young at 25 and can wait out the aging fighters Mayweather and Pacquiao, but there’s still going to be guys like Danny Garcia, Lamont Peterson, Lucas Matthysse, Ruslan Provodnikov, Terence Crawford, Kell Brook, Amir Khan and Keith Thurman who will likely all be better than Broner.\n\nIt’s hard to estimate a worth on a 5-year contract for Broner right now because there are so many questions that need to be answered about him at 140. We saw that he failed at 147 in getting beaten by Marcos Maidana and arguably beaten by Paulie Malignaggi as well. But at 140, the weight class where Broner has seemingly retreated to, he’s not looked good in his fights against Carlos Molina and Emmanuel Taylor.\n\nThose fights showed that Broner will most likely struggle if he’s asked to face the best light welterweights in Danny Garcia, Viktor Postol, Lamont Peterson and Terence Crawford. I’m not sure that Roc Nation would be getting such a bargain if they were to have signed Broner for a 5-year, $40 million contract.",
  "latent_6717": "Jan 10, 2015; New York, NY, USA; New York Knicks president Phil Jackson addresses the media before the start of game against the Charlotte Hornets at Madison Square Garden. Mandatory Credit: Noah K. Murray-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt’s been a big summer for the Knickerbockers, so it’s time to examine Phil Jackson’s job as team president of the New York Knicks thus far.\n\nIt’s been a busy Summer in New York. As the temperature continues to rise, so does the level of talent on the New York Knicks’ roster. For the first time in a while, the Knicks have a balanced lineup, adding Derrick Rose, Courtney Lee and Joakim Noah to the starting five.\n\nPhil Jackson, who was hired as the teams President of Basketball Operations in March of 2014, endured harsh criticisms about his health and availability, his dedication, and his skills as an executive during his introductory season. Those criticisms were warranted; the Knicks went 17-65 and suffered the worst season in franchise history en route to earning the No. 4 pick in the 2015 NBA Draft.\n\nSince then, he’s made great strides toward turning the Knicks into a legitimate contender in the East. Entering the 2016-17 season, here are some reasons why it’s time to trust in Phil.\n\nA Consistent Approach to Free Agency\n\nGone are the days of Amar’e, Starbury, Steve Francis, and Eddy Curry. Jackson has shown discipline during his two trips into free agency. He’s signed guys like Arron Afflalo, Robin Lopez, and Courtney Lee to low-cost contracts that make sense for the organization. He’s done a great job of plugging holes in the roster with guys who fit what the team needs, and that’s refreshing.\n\nSuccess in the NBA Draft\n\nJackson and the Knicks’ front office hit the jackpot with Latvian big man Kristaps Porzingis, who was met with boos and skepticism by fans in the Summer leading up to his NBA debut. With his gamble on Porzingis striking gold, he’s proven that the Knicks have a process for evaluating talent, and that the process is working very well. Jackson was able to find success in recruiting talent from the D-League, and later in the draft as well. He put young combo guard Langston Galloway on the map as an athletic rotational guard, as well as molding point guard Jerian Grant into a tradable asset.\n\nGood Trades\n\nJackson’s run as Knicks President began with a few lackluster moves—mainly the Tyson Chandler and Raymond Felton, and J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert trades. Those mistakes were redeemed, however, when Jackson was able to trade away Tim Hardaway Jr. to the Hawks for the rights to draft Jerian Grant, a key cog in the deal that brought Derrick Rose to New York this summer. Jackson has shown an increasing aptitude for valuing his assets and making decisions with that value in mind.\n\nHolding on to Draft Picks\n\nFrom 2010 to the 2015 NBA Draft, where they selected Kristaps Porzingis #4, the Knicks made only 2 first-round picks in the NBA Draft. They hadn’t made a pick in the Top 16 since Jordan Hill in 2009, trading away virtually all of their future first-round picks in blockbuster trades.\n\nAfter missing out on the first round of the draft in 2016 because of the trade that brought Andrea Bargnani to New York in 2013, the Knicks draft picks are fully intact moving forward. The flexibility that comes with a future first, to provide some affordable depth, is something the Knicks haven’t been able to rely on for a pretty long time.\n\nLike many other decisions Jackson has made, that’s a huge step in the right direction.",
  "latent_6736": "The race for the 2012 GOP nomination is looking a little less like a Mitt Romney cakewalk this week: Not only will Jon Huntsman officially throw his hat in the ring this week for what some observers think could be a very serious run at the nomination, but Texas governor Rick Perry gave a speech at the Republican Leadership Conference this weekend that looked a whole lot like a stump speech — and one that would appeal to social conservatives, a group that doesn’t have a clear, strong candidate to back among Republicans currently running. After lines like “We need to stop apologizing for celebrating life,” Perry walked offstage to cries of “Run, Rick, run,” and was reportedly even more of a conference darling than Michele Bachmann.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the governor will only declare a candidacy if he thinks the investment of time and energy would actually pay off in a nomination: He’s tasked aides with figuring out whether there’s enough time left to raise the amount of cash a serious run would require and has tested the waters a bit in Iowa. Unlike Sarah Palin’s prolonged fan dance, Perry’s careful consideration mirrors the fiscal prudence which, along with his successful record of job creation as governor (which John Heilemann examines in the magazine this week), would be one of his chief selling points as a candidate.\n\nHis speech also didn’t just nod to social conservatives, it also showed him to be fluent in tea party-ese. According to Politico, Perry offered “a robust defense of the 10th Amendment, repeatedly invoking of the founding fathers and launching an assault on what he portrayed as an ever more menacing federal government.” That all makes him an attractive alternative to Bachmann for voters who want a Republican who not only shares their values, but might actually be electable.\n\nAs an aide told Politico, “He’s not going to pussy-foot around.” And there’s his first bumper sticker.\n\nThe “You’re Hired” Gun [New York]\n\nWould a Rick Perry Campaign Ruin Romney’s Chances?

  "latent_6973": "The clouds of misconception and skepticism around bitcoin were so dark in the initial years that it hid the genius behind it. In trying to understand bitcoin, it brought into the spotlight the technology that underpins it - the blockchain.\n\nDuring the World Economic Forum at Davos, Christine Lagarde, Managing Director, International Monetary Fund spoke about virtual currencies and released a paper titled “Virtual Currencies and Beyond: Initial Considerations.” The paper examines virtual currencies as well as blockchain. It reads, “VC schemes and distributed ledger technologies can strengthen financial efficiency by facilitating peer-to-peer exchange while reducing transaction times and costs, especially across borders...Beyond payments systems, distributed ledger technologies have implications for a wide range of markets and financial market infrastructures as a fast, accurate and secure record keeping system, including for stock exchanges, central securities depositories, securities settlement systems or trade repositories.”\n\nWhile blockchain has applications beyond bitcoin, the two are intertwined. In fact, bitcoin can be called a beautiful, first application of this amazing technology.\n\nImproving the Ledger\n\nThroughout history, records of transactions have always been an essential part of tracking information, be it in commerce or government activities. Such recordings created ledgers, which house these records. Blockchain supports digital distributed ledgers that record and store data. The data is ‘distributed’ across a whole network, which can be open to everyone (“unpermissioned”) or restricted in terms of participants (“permissioned”).\n\nBlockchain’s distributed ledger has great potential of cost-saving especially for international remittances for the banking system. According to the IMF report on virtual currencies, “The costs of sending international remittances, however, are notoriously high: as of 2015, the global average cost of sending small remittances (for example US $200) is 7.7%, though this has declined from just below 10% in 2008. In contrast, the cost with Bitcoin is estimated to be about 1% (Goldman Sachs, 2014).” Banks are looking to act fast as blockchain-based remittance systems have already made a debut; in the Philippines and Kenya, such platforms offer transfers via bitcoin and back into fiat currency.\n\nBesides cost advantages, the other area where banks are looking to benefit from blockchain is efficiency in operations. The use of this technology will help them get rid of ‘headache work’ like manual processes, middlemen, huge data entry and verifications; blockchain making all possible at a faster speed and greater accuracy.\n\nThe blockchain technology is being looked at as a great invention, which has many potential uses in many other industries such as music, healthcare, diamond, real estate and more. Even governments are showing interest in the breakthrough technology.\n\nBlockhain Moves Beyond Finance\n\nA recent report by the UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser says, “distributed ledger technology provides the framework for government to reduce fraud, corruption, error and the cost of paper-intensive processes. It has the potential to redefine the relationship between government and the citizen in terms of data sharing, transparency and trust. It has similar possibilities for the private sector.”\n\nThe diamond industry, which is highly prone to fraud, has already embraced the blockchain technology. Everledger is a permanent ledger for diamond certification and related transaction history. It provides verification for insurance companies, claimants and law enforcement. According to Everledger, “£200 million is spent by insurers each year for tackling fraud.”\n\nLikewise, the real estate industry can benefit greatly from the blockchain technology. According to Ragnar Lifthrasir, “Putting property titles on the Bitcoin blockchain will bring the real estate industry out of its existing 18th century technology. Title insurance is a $20 billion industry. It’s estimated that the total annual cost of fighting and resolving title fraud is $1 billion.”\n\nThe healthcare industry has shown interest in the blockchain technology and companies such as Facto, Tierion, DNA.Bits, BitHealth, and Gem are working on such projects. A tweet in October 2015, revealed a project for Philip Healthcare Group in collaboration with Tierion. The health care sector holds a lot of confidential information, like records of medical history, diseases, payments and treatment. The blockchain not only provides a solution to the concern over the security and privacy of such sensitive data, it would help eliminate the huge costs incurred by hospitals and healthcare service providers in managing the patient and other such information.\n\nNot far behind is the music industry, which has its own tailor-made blockchain. PeerTracks, a music streaming and retail company, is the first outfit to use the brand-new MUSE platform, in partnership with Danish exchange CCEDK and OpenLedger. OpenLedger, through its Danish registrar CCEDK, is now offering a fiat gateway – enabling anyone to buy MUSE for USD via the OPENMUSE/OPEN.USD market. On platforms using the MUSE network, such as PeerTracks, all the payments made by consumers, and income generated by artists, are in crypto-USD, so there is no confusion about how much a track costs – and no issues with crypto’s trademark volatility.\n\nThe technology is also being put to use for creation of decentralised credit rating and KYC. “Algorythmix has been named the most transformative use of blockchain in Citi Mobile Challenge APAC 2015, for “Cetas – The decentralised KYC and Credit rating framework. Cetas is a decentralised platform which enables sharing of the KYC data using blockchain.”\n\nThere are many other projects working around the blockchain technology like Microsoft Corporation’s (MSFT) Azure Blockchain as a Service program, and the Open Ledger Project spearheaded by IBM overseen by the not-for-profit Linux Foundation. The project involves other big names like Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), London Stock Exchange Group Plc., Accenture Plc. (ACN), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), Digital Asset, Intel Corporation (INTC) and many more.\n\nThe Final Word\n\nThis is just an overview of the multiple projects being worked around this innovative technology. The blockchain technology, still in its early years, has thrown down the gauntlet in front of the current systems, challenging them to overhaul.",
  "latent_7014": "They say to never return to the scene of the crime. Well, the Rangers don’t have much of a choice this time, for this evening the Rangers will return to the Staples Center for the first time since falling to the Los Angeles Kings in last year’s Stanley Cup Final.\n\nFollowing last night’s dynamite 4-1 win over the league leading Anaheim Ducks, the Rangers, who are the hottest team in the NHL with wins in 11 of their last 12, will have no time to bask in their latest victory. It’s time for them take the 53 minute trek North to Los Angeles.\n\nFrom NYR stat folks: First time Rangers have won 11 games in a 12-game span since they did so from Oct. 30, 1993 to Nov. 24, 1993 — Steve Zipay (@stevezipay) January 8, 2015\n\nA Trip Back in Time\n\nFlashback to June 13, 2014. That was the last time these two squads faced off against one another. For the Kings, it resulted in eternal glory; hoisting Lord Stanley’s Cup in front of their home crowd following a double overtime winning goal from Alec Martinez. For the Rangers, it was an agonizing, and I mean agonizing defeat.\n\nThe sight of Henrik Lundqvist lying on the ice as the Kings celebrated their Cup win is not something Ranger fans will soon forget…\n\nAfter a playoff run that seemed destined for greatness, the Rangers fell into a deep 3-0 hole to start the best-of-seven Stanley Cup Final. But in typical post-2005 lockout fashion, the gritty Rangers clawed their way back, and slowly but surely raised the hopes of Ranger fans near and far.\n\nIn game four, the Rangers outlasted the Kings with a 2-1 win, fending off defeat on home ice, and forcing the series back to LA for game five.\n\nIn that fifth game, the Kings jumped out to an early 1-0 lead just 6:04 into the opening period thanks to a goal from Justin Williams. And as the game went on, moving from the first period to the second, it started to feel like “one of those games,” where the Rangers would do absolutely everything except score.\n\nBut that was not at all the case. Game five turned out not to be “one of those games.” In fact, quite the opposite. Finally, at 15:37 of the second period while on the power play, Chris Kreider tipped in a perfect pass from Ryan McDonagh to tie the game at one. You could sense the collective sigh of relief in all of Manhattan when the red light when on after Kreider’s goal.\n\nAnd before anyone had a chance to digest the Kreider goal, Brian Boyle stunned every Rangers fan and their mother in the waning seconds of the middle stanza, when he placed a perfect shorthanded shot over the glove of Jonathan Quick to put the Blueshirts ahead 2-1.\n\nThe game had taken a shocking turn, and the Rangers, who just minutes earlier appeared to be having an evening where they would never break through, were suddenly, in the blink of an eye, in the driver’s seat and 20 minutes away from forcing the series back to New York for a game six.\n\nThe team that appeared to be dead in the water just a few days prior, was now just minutes from making the final series, a serious series.\n\nBut as we all know, it was not meant to be for the Rangers, and a sixth game back in New York never did happen.\n\nApproximately 37 minutes of gameplay later, following a questionable penalty call on Mats Zuccarello, a tying goal from Marian Gaborik, and one-plus periods of sudden-death overtime, the Kings’ Alec Martinez finally scored the goal, and the Kings were crowned the champions.\n\nRetribution? Or Just a Chance for a Sweet Win?\n\nWhile not a whole lot can get a team entirely past a loss such as that, aside from finally winning the Stanley Cup, the Rangers do have a chance this evening to achieve some sort small, minuscule retribution.\n\nTonight, following his stellar performance in Anaheim, Henrik Lundqvist will not have to stand in the spot where he once lay, defeated and deflated. Instead, Cam Talbot will get the nod for the Rangers. During last year’s Stanley Cup Final, the Rangers’ number two was sidelined for the entire series. Tonight, he’ll get his opportunity to crack the Kings.\n\nThis year’s Rangers team looks different in many ways than the one which fell to the Kings in five games almost seven months ago. It’s a new season, a new year, and a new team hitting the ice. For those who were there, though, the memories are sure to come flooding back.\n\nThe hunger for a win in this one might be just a tad higher than many other ordinary regular season contests for the Rangers. If you ask me, that certainly isn’t a bad thing. There’s never anything wrong with a little bad blood and anger heading into a game such as this one.\n\nIt’s time the Rangers get their glitzy Los Angeles due.",
  "latent_7084": "Image copyright SPL\n\nGolden eagles in North America may have the timing of their migration shifted out of step with a seasonal boom in food they need to raise their young, according to scientists.\n\nA project to track the impact of climate change on migrating animals has revealed that adult golden eagles are unable to shift the timing of their migration.\n\nLead researcher Scott LaPoint from Columbia University presented the findings at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union.\n\nHe explained that day length, or photoperiod, appeared to give the great birds the cue to go \"as far and as fast as possible\".\n\nWhen analysing tracking data, composed of 20 years' worth of tagging birds with satellite tags and following their seasonal migrations, Dr LaPoint noticed an unusual pattern. Younger raptors would shift the timing of their journey, seemingly adapting to weather conditions and climate.\n\n\"But the adults get this photoperiod trigger and it's 'Time to go!',\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"I would have expected an older, wiser bird to better time their migration,\" he added.\n\n\"But, with this [daylight] trigger, they don't have the luxury of deciding. They need to get [to their nesting site] as soon as possible to initiate a clutch.\n\n\"They want to get their chicks as independent as possible by October, November.\"\n\nBirds younger than five years are sub-adult. They do not reproduce, so they are able to wait for good thermals to take them on a less energy-intensive journey north.\n\nNorthern-breeding golden eagles can travel thousands of miles to their wintering grounds.\n\nAnd they have adapted to have their departure coincide with the first lasting snowfall or freeze and decreasing prey abundance.\n\nIf they're coming up at the same time every year, and if there's a change in that ecosystem due to climate change - whether that's a shifting of when spring arrives, or more extreme weather events - that time of arrival could be less optimal, said Dr LaPoint.\n\n\"We're potentially disrupting this synchrony. And if the birds aren't able to adapt, I'm not sure what to expect.\"\n\nFollow Vic on Twitter",
  "latent_7104": "A field supervisor in the Census Bureau’s Denver region has informed her organization’s higher-ups, the head of the Commerce Department and congressional investigators that she believes economic data collected by her office is being falsified.\n\nAnd this whistleblower — who asked that I not identify her — said her bosses in Denver ignored her warnings even after she provided details of wrongdoing by three different survey takers.\n\nThe three continued to collect data even after she reported them.\n\nWhen I spoke with this whistleblower earlier this year as part of my investigation of Census, she told me that hundreds of interviews that go into the Labor Department’s unemployment rate and inflation surveys would miraculously be completed just hours before deadline.\n\nThe implication was that someone with the ability to fill in the blanks on incomplete surveys was doing just that.\n\nThe Denver whistleblower also provided to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform the names of other Census workers who can spill the beans about data fraud in other regions.\n\nCensus is broken up into six regions. Cheating has already been proven in the Philadelphia region. And with this whistleblower’s letter, Census authorities now have allegations that the same kind of nonsense was going on in Denver — that office covers Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Wyoming\n\nThe Oversight Committee recently completed a report along with the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that verified one case of falsification in the Philly office. But the committee said it couldn’t prove or disprove that there was a nationwide pattern of data fraud because Commerce — which oversees Census — had “obstructed” its investigation.\n\n“There are serious issues within the Census Bureau Denver regional office management and I feel it’s time that you are made aware of them,” the whistleblower wrote on Sept. 30 to Penny Pritzker, the head of Commerce, and Wayne Hatcher, associate director of Census Field operations.\n\nThat same information, along with about a thousand e-mails and other documents, was also sent to the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe case of falsified data in Philly — by a surveyor named Julius Buckmon — resulted in a lengthy investigation by Commerce’s Inspector General as well as the probe by the Oversight Committee and the Joint Economic Committee.\n\nWhen the question is asked about data quality, my answer would be simple, there is none. I wouldn’t trust any data from the Census Bureau. - Denver whistleblower\n\nThe IG’s investigation resulted in widespread changes in the way data is collected and checked. One of the key changes is that supervisors can no longer conduct what are called “re-interviews” of their own workers’ surveys.\n\nBy conducting a re-interview, Census can often spot a fraudulent survey. The problem is that the supervisors conducting the re-interview weren’t motivated to report fraud because it reduced the number of completed responses they could report toward their quota.\n\nI asked recently the Denver whistleblower her opinion on the surveys Census is providing. “When the question is asked about data quality, my answer would be simple, there is none,” she said.\n\n“I wouldn’t trust any data from the Census Bureau,” she added.\n\nLast Friday, for instance, Labor announced that a healthy 248,000 new jobs were created in September, when the unemployment rate dipped to 5.9 percent from 6.1 percent.\n\nThose 248,000 new jobs are determined by a survey of companies — the Establishment Survey, it’s called — that is conducted by Labor itself. So while some people rightly take issue with the quality and temporary nature of many of those new jobs — and the fact that not enough have been created in the current economic cycle — the tabulation itself isn’t really in doubt.\n\nThe 5.9 percent unemployment rate comes from the Household Survey that Labor hires Census to conduct. There are big concerns about the truthfulness of the jobless rate, especially since this is the last report before the November congressional elections.\n\nFor instance, in September the rate fell to 5.9 percent mainly because 315,000 more people told Census they stopped looking for a job.\n\nIn fact, about a third of the recent decline in the unemployment rate can be attributed to a decline in the so-called Labor Participation Rate, which is now at a 36-year low. Ninety-six million Americans no longer consider themselves in the labor force.\n\nSome think there is a logical explanation for this: baby boomers who are leaving the workforce because they simply don’t want to work anymore. But the data doesn’t bear that out.\n\nThere were 230,000 more workers aged 50 or older in the Household Survey released Friday. So how did the workforce decline by 315,000 people, if aging baby boomers were increasingly looking for jobs?\n\nIt’s either a miracle or someone’s pulling our leg.",

  "latent_7185": "Humans are not very efficient. When we walk, we waste close to 20 watts of energy per second. Instead of turning all calories into lift or forward motion, we turn most of them into heat that's quickly dissipated. So my colleagues and I came up with a way to harvest the wasted energy from human motion and convert it into about 10 watts of electricity.\n\nOur device is based on a physical phenomenon called electrowetting: If you apply electrical voltage to certain liquids, the liquid moves. This means you have converted electrical energy (the current) to mechanical energy (the liquid in motion). We reversed the process, forcing liquid to move over electrodes. In the shoe, you have two flexible plastic bladders, one under the heel and the other under the toe. The bladders are filled with a mixture of oil and water and connected by a thin, snaking tube. When you step down on your heel, you compress the rear bladder, and several milliliters of liquid travel through the tube to the front bladder. Step on the toe, and the process is reversed.\n\nThe tube is lined with a thin film of electrodes, and as the liquid slides back and forth, the electrodes charge—electrowetting in reverse. A small battery stores the energy, and you can access that energy by way of a micro-USB port on the heel of the shoe. We also invented a way, like Wi-Fi, to transfer power from shoe to cellphone battery. Military or police might like having a regular supply of power, but I suspect most people wouldn't be happy dealing with wires connected to their footwear.",
  "latent_7296": "The Ottawa RedBlacks won the Grey Cup, but the big winner last season was offence across the Canadian Football League.\n\nDuring CFL Week in March, league vice-president of officiating Glen Johnson was trumpeting the results of recent rule changes that led to the, “highest scoring ever last year, highest quarterback efficiency ratings ever last year, the highest average return on kick ratio.”\n\nIt was all geared toward making things more difficult on defences — a feat that was accomplished to record effect last season.\n\n“They wanted that in Year 1,” Edmonton Eskimos defensive co-ordinator Mike Benevides said of significant rule changes made ahead of the 2015 season.\n\n“But I think in Year 1, the offences hadn’t gotten to the point where they could totally capitalize on it like they did last year.\n\n“And I think what happened across the board is there were a lot of different colleagues I talked to that were trying to use younger guys (on defence). And when the rules changed ahead of that year, all the quarterbacks were hurt, so the efficiency and the scoring goes down. So (the league) reacted and changed things when there wasn’t necessarily anything that needed to change.\n\n“But anyway, they did, and last year, we had the rule changes and a bunch of healthy quarterbacks that really played it all the way through.”\n\nDefensive co-ordinators across the league had their work cut out for them in 2016, let alone Benevides in Edmonton, where he had joined a newly formed staff under rookie head coach Jason Maas. Expectations for the season were through the roof for an Eskimos club that just won the Grey Cup in 2015, despite losing key pieces on the defence to the NFL over the off-season — defensive halfback Aaron Grymes and linebacker Dexter McCoil — before rookie CFL all-star John Ojo suffered a season-ending Achilles injury in training camp.\n\n“Points were up, and that’s exactly what they wanted,” said Benevides, whose unit wound up in the middle of the pack, sitting fifth overall with 27.6 points allowed per game.\n\nIt was across the board, but fans of a particular team tend to notice it at home first.\n\n“It’s what we do and how we go,” said Benevides, whose defence rebounded after a disappointing start to last year. “The first half wasn’t what we wanted. If you look at the second half statistically, there was no one better in the league, and we won a playoff game.\n\n“Still, when you look at the totality, we weren’t where I wanted to be. But they got better, I learned who they were, I did a better job of putting them in better positions.”\n\nThe mid-season additions of defensive back Brendyn Thompson and defensive end Phillip Hunt played roles in the turnaround, Benevides added, and this season brings the benefit of continuity.\n\n“I told the guys upstairs when we got to work on Saturday night, ‘We know each other, we know what we want to do, we should be able to play tomorrow and win,” Benevides said. “The great part right now in training camp is there are opportunities. There are guys pushing at the heels of the free safety, we need to find two new corners because Patrick (Watkins) retired and Cord (Parks) is no longer here. And we’re looking at the weak-side halfback, depending where Cell (Marcell Young) goes.\n\n“So there are three legitimate chances and jobs in the secondary.”\n\nAnd with the WIL linebacker changing to a Canadian spot with the acquisition of former NFLer Cory Greenwood, the depth at Canadian linebacker is not simply focused on special-teams duty.\n\n“You look at guys like Adam Konar, draft choice Christophe (Mulumba-Tshimanga), Blair Smith, there’s a legitimate opportunity in Year 2 or 3 to get real snaps and be a starter. And that’s what every player wants but doesn’t always have the opportunity. Now they’ve got to perform to take that job.”\n\nAt the same time, it simply became too expensive to keep veteran defensive tackle Eddie Steele on the roster, especially with losing the Canadian depth behind him. So the flip side of the decision go with a Canadian at outside linebacker will see another American defensive tackle next to perennial all-star Almondo Sewell.\n\n“I don’t think Almondo gets enough credit, we’re talking about a defensive end in pro football with 11 sacks,” Benevides said. “Now, the system’s conducive to him. The guys around him do a good job, Casey (Creehan) coaches his butt off. But now you’ve got Euclid Cummings fighting for a job and Da’Quan Bowers.\n\n“Camp is about competition, there are some spots that have multiple candidates and you can’t keep everybody.”\n\nNEXT UP: The Eskimos continue with two-a-day sessions Wednesday at Commonwealth Stadium between 8:30-noon.\n\ngmoddejonge@postmedia.com\n\nOn Twitter: @GerryModdejonge",
  "latent_7310": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nThis story was originally published by Grist.\n\nShould we eat meat? That’s the big question, which—for this series—I’m asking three different ways: in terms of environmental sustainability, morality, and practicality.\n\nToday, to begin: Can meat be sustainable?\n\nIn any comparison of the environmental impact of meat eaters and plant eaters, we have to start by noting that plant eaters have a powerful ally on their side: physics. Every time energy moves from one state to another, a little is lost along the way. Flip on an incandescent bulb and only 8 percent of the electric energy turns into visible light—the majority of energy is lost as infrared light and heat. Convert the calories in corn into meat by feeding a chicken, and you’ve got the same problem.\n\nIn even the most efficient, high-tech farms, it takes a pound and a half of grain to grow a pound of chicken—because that chicken is constantly radiating heat and burning energy to move around. The picture gets worse if you just look at the parts of the chicken that people like to eat. The scientist Vaclav Smil, who has a reputation for objective number-crunching, considered this basic issue of thermodynamics in his book, Should We Eat Meat? Evolution and Consequences of Modern Carnivory, and came up with this table:\n\nAccording to Smil’s calculations, you need 3.3 pounds of feed to get a pound of chicken meat, 9.4 pounds of feed for a pound of pork, and 25 pounds of feed for a pound of beef. It’s simply more efficient to eat plants than to feed those plants to animals and eat meat.\n\nThis efficiency problem puts meat eaters way behind from the beginning, and it extends from energy to every other resource. Look at water use, greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, land-use footprints, and just about anything else, and it’s always going to make more sense to grow grains for people to eat rather than for animals to eat. To take just one example, scientists looked at the amount of nitrogen fertilizer that flows into rivers and creates dead zones in oceans: They calculated that a kilogram of red meat put an average of 150 grams of nitrogen equivalent (in various fertilizers) into waterways, versus 50 grams per kilogram of chicken and less than 3 grams per kilogram of grain.\n\nYou need 3.3 pounds of feed to get a pound of chicken meat, 9.4 pounds of feed for a pound of pork, and 25 pounds of feed for a pound of beef.\n\nThis idea, that meat is environmentally unfriendly, has been the conventional wisdom since 2006, when the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization published a report called Livestock’s Long Shadow. Which is why I was surprised when Frank Mitloehner, a UC-Davis animal science professor who is leading an update of the FAO’s livestock assessment, told me that the idea of eliminating animals from our food system was ridiculous and, actually, unsustainable.\n\n“Agriculture cannot be sustainable without animal agriculture,” he said. “That is something I’m sure of.”\n\nThere are two key points to consider, Mitloehner said. First, most of the feed that livestock eat is not edible by humans. Globally, just 18 percent of animal feed is made up of grains or other crops that people might otherwise eat. The rest is crop residues, grass, and waste from milling grain and other food processing. And so, despite the inefficiency of converting calories to meat, animals are able to give humans access to energy that they wouldn’t have been able to access otherwise.\n\nThe second, issue, Mitloehner said, is that what I’d been thinking of as the “waste products” of animal agriculture are actually valuable resources. The manure animals produce is vital for agriculture (especially organic agriculture). “If we were to reduce the fertilizer animals produce by 100 percent, we would have to double or triple the amount of chemical fertilizer we apply, and we just don’t have that,” Mitloehner said.\n\nIn addition, every part of the animal that we don’t eat as meat—the skin, bones, sinew, organs, and fat—is used in some way. The artist Christien Meindertsma demonstrated this beautifully with her book Pig 05049, in which she followed every part of a slaughtered pig to its final use. Extract from pig hairs are used in baking bread, bone ash is a key part in train brakes, gelatin is used to filter your beer, elements from blood are used as edible food glue—Meindertsma found 185 products in total. If we were to eliminate animal agriculture, we’d have to find new supply chains for these things, and each would come with its own environmental footprint.\n\nLivestock is especially important to poor farmers. Animals are often a key part of the agro-ecological system and provide high-quality nutrients to the people most likely to go hungry—more frequently in the form of dairy than meat. In some of the poorest areas of the world, people need cattle because manure is their only source of fuel. In his book One Billion Hungry: Can We Feed the World?, Gordon Conway lays out the benefits of livestock animals, which can be easy to forget when you’re rich and comfortable:\n\nContribute 40 percent of global value of agricultural output\n\nSupport livelihoods and food security of almost 1 billion people\n\nProvide food and incomes and consume non-human-edible food\n\nContribute 15 percent of total food energy and 25 percent of dietary protein\n\nProvide essential micronutrients (e.g. iron, calcium) that are more readily available in meat, milk, and eggs than in plant-based foods\n\nAre a valuable asset, serving as a store of wealth, collateral for credit, and an essential safety net during times of crisis\n\nAre central to mixed farming systems, consume agricultural waste products, help control insects and weeds, produce manure and waste for cooking, and provide draft power for transport\n\nProvide employment, in some cases especially for women\n\nHave a cultural significance, as the basis for religious ceremonies\n\nBut anyone reading this probably is relatively rich and comfortable—at least rich enough that it may be a bit mindboggling to think you might need a cow so you could burn its dung for energy. For those of us living with easy access to energy and cheap calories, would it make ecological sense to reduce our meat consumption? Probably.\n\nI called up Rattan Lal, one of the world’s leading soil scientists, to ask him what he thought about meat eating. I wanted to talk to him because there’s been a lot of excitement about the idea that cattle grazing on grassland could actually be carbon negative—that is, we might need more animals, not less, to combat climate change.\n\nLal, director of the Carbon Management and Sequestration Center at Ohio State University, had told Washington Post journalist Tamar Haspel that we shouldn’t expect cows to save the world. Haspel wrote:\n\nHe says one metric ton per hectare is a reasonable estimate of the maximum [carbon] that grazing can sequester in a place like Ohio, where growing conditions generally are favorable, and a half-ton would be more realistic in drier areas. He supports grass-fed beef but says carbon sequestration “can’t completely compensate for the greenhouse gases in beef production.”\n\nI wanted to double check—was there anything else? Some way that animals are crucial for soil health? When I spoke to Lal, he said it just came down to basic logistics. “In the next 40 years, there are 2.3 billion people coming to dinner. We have invited them—they haven’t made the choice to come. It is our moral duty to insure that they are well fed. The luxury of having so much meat as we do in the U.S. will become less and less feasible as population grows.”\n\nThe French eat 35 pounds a year, while Americans eat 270 pounds of meat.\n\nAnimals are a key part of the agricultural system, but the people who eat the most meat—the rich of the world—almost certainly need to eat less to make the global food system sustainable, especially as billions rise out of poverty and begin demanding their share.\n\nSmil came to the same conclusion. He says that we should aim for an average of 33-66 pounds of meat per year. The French eat 35 pounds a year, while Americans eat 270 pounds of meat. If we got down to the French level, Smil’s calculations suggest that everyone around the world could have their share of meat, and we could still reduce the farmland used to grow feed from 33 percent of all cropland to 10 percent—with huge environmental benefits.\n\nSo can meat be sustainable? The answer, based on the evidence I was able to assemble, seems to be: Yes, but only in moderation. And because we are currently eating so much meat, those who give it up altogether are probably making the most environmentally friendly choice of all.\n\nNext, I’ll tackle the morality of meat eating. And then I’ll turn to what’s probably the most important question of all: It’s fun to debate what we should do, but it’s more important to figure out what we can do, realistically. So after looking at morality, I’ll look at the most pragmatic ways to improve meat production.",

  "latent_7507": "Get the Recipe The Best Chili Ever\n\nI gotta admit up front: The title of this article is somewhat misleading. Yes, we will discuss chili, and yes, it's the best chili I personally have ever made.\n\nBut! To call something \"the best chili ever\" implies that the recipe is perfect, and perfection implies that there is no room for improvement. I can only hope that others will continue perfecting the chili work that began on the Tex-Mex border, and that I continue testing, well after the last rich and spicy remnant is licked clean off the bottom of the bowl. With that disclaimer out of the way, let's move on to the testing.\n\nMy first step was to set up some parameters that would define the ultimate chili. Certainly, there are disputes in the chili world as to what makes the best. Ground beef or chunks? Are tomatoes allowed? Should we even mention beans? But discounting a few people (who are most likely from strange places, like Cincinnati or Japan), I think we can all agree on a few things.\n\nThe ultimate chili should:\n\nHave a rich, complex chili flavor that combines sweet, bitter, hot, fresh, and fruity elements in balance.\n\nHave a robust, meaty, beefy flavor.\n\nAssuming that it contains beans, have beans that are tender, creamy, and intact.\n\nBe bound together by a thick, deep-red sauce.\n\nTo achieve these goals, I decided to break down the chili into its distinct elements—the chilies, the beef, the beans, and the flavorings—perfecting each one before putting them all together in one big happy pot.\n\nThe Chilies\n\nI have bad memories of my chili-eating college days—when chili was made by adding a can of beans and a can of tomatoes to ground beef, then adding one of every spice on the rack (and two of cumin), then simmering. The finished product inevitably had a totally unbalanced flavor, with a powdery, gritty mouthfeel from the dried spices.\n\nMy first goal was to ditch the powdered spices and premixed chili powders (which are at worst inedible, and at best inconsistent) and go straight for the source: real dried chilies.\n\nThey come in a baffling array. To make my selection easier, I decided to taste every variety of whole chili I could find—both powdered in a spice grinder, and puréed in a blender with water—taking note of both their spice level and their flavor profile. I noticed that most of them fell into one of four distinct categories:\n\nSweet and fresh : These peppers have distinct aromas reminiscent of red bell peppers and fresh tomatoes. They include costeño, New Mexico (a.k.a. dried Anaheim, California, or Colorado), and choricero.\n\n: These peppers have distinct aromas reminiscent of red bell peppers and fresh tomatoes. They include costeño, New Mexico (a.k.a. dried Anaheim, California, or Colorado), and choricero. Hot : An overwhelming heat. The best, like cascabels, also have some complexity, while others like, the pequin or árbol, are all heat and not much else.\n\n: An overwhelming heat. The best, like cascabels, also have some complexity, while others like, the pequin or árbol, are all heat and not much else. Smoky : Some peppers, like chipotles (dried, smoked jalapeños), are smoky because of the way they are dried. Others, like ñoras or guajillos, have a natural musty, charred-wood smokiness.\n\n: Some peppers, like chipotles (dried, smoked jalapeños), are smoky because of the way they are dried. Others, like ñoras or guajillos, have a natural musty, charred-wood smokiness. Rich and fruity: Distinct aromas of sun-dried tomatoes, raisins, chocolate, and coffee. Some of the best-known Mexican chilies, like ancho, mulato, and pasilla, are in this category.\n\nJust as I occasionally like to mix up my Beatles Rock Band with a bit of Super Mario or old-school Street Fighter II, variety is what keeps you coming back to the chili pot.\n\nThe best spice strategy: Cover the low notes with a chili from the rich-and-fruity category, the high notes with a chili from the sweet-and-fresh category, and add a hit of heat with one from the hot, giving the smokier chilies a miss for reasons purely of personal taste. Unless you're camping or cooking it in a Dutch oven, there's no room in chili for smokiness.\n\nEliminating the gritty texture of powdered chilies: Ditch the powder, toast the chilies whole to enhance their aroma, cook them down in stock, and purée them until they're completely smooth, creating a rich, concentrated flavor base for my chili.\n\nThe Meat\n\nBeyond beans, the meat is the biggest source of contention amongst chili lovers. Some (like my lovely wife) insist on ground beef, while others (like myself) prefer larger, stew-like chunks. Regular Food Lab readers may have noticed that more often than not, I begrudgingly let my wife have her way.\n\nThis time, I was determined to fight for my own rights, or, at the very least, make her compromise her chili convictions.\n\nAfter trying store-ground beef, home-ground beef, beef cut into one-inch chunks, and beef roughly chopped by hand into a textured mix of one-eighth-inch to half-inch pieces, the last method won out. It provided little bits of nearly ground beef that added body and helped keep the stew (and my marriage) well bound, while still providing enough large, chunkier pieces to provide textural interest and something for a real man (like myself) to bite on.\n\nI decided to go with bone-in short ribs—my favorite cut of beef for braising—hoping that I'd be able to use the bones to add extra flavor and body to my chili later on.\n\nBrowning Issues\n\nAs anyone who's ever made a Bolognese knows, it's nearly impossible to properly brown a pot of ground beef. It's a simple matter of the ratio of surface area to volume. Ground beef has tons of surface area for liquid and fat to escape.\n\nAs soon as you start cooking it, liquid starts pooling in the bottom of the pot, completely submerging the meat and leaving it to gurgle and stew in its own gray-brown juices. Only after these juices have evaporated can any browning take place. The sad truth? With ground (or, in our case, finely chopped) beef, you have to settle for either dry, gritty meat, or no browned flavor.\n\nThen I had a thought: Why was I bothering trying to brown the beef after I'd chopped it? If browned flavor in the stew was what I was after, does it even matter when I brown the beef, as long as it ends up getting browned?\n\nI grabbed another batch of short ribs, this time searing them in a hot pan before removing the meat from the bone and chopping it down to its final size.\n\nThe result? Chili with chopped-beef texture, but deeply browned flavor.\n\nThe Beans\n\nIf you are from Texas, you may as well skip to the next section. But if you're like me and believe beans are as integral to a great bowl of chili as beef, if not more so, read on.\n\nTo be honest, there's nothing wrong with canned kidney beans in a chili. They are uniformly cooked and hold their shape well, and—at least in chili—the relative lack of flavor in canned versus dried beans is not an issue. There are enough other flavors going on to compensate.\n\nBut sometimes the urge to crack some culinary skulls and the desire for some food-science myth-busting are so strong that I can't resist. So we're going to have a quick diversion into the land of dried beans.\n\nIf you have a chef (as in \"the boss,\" that is, not a personal one); a grandmother from Tuscany; or an aunt from Toulouse, you may have at one point been told never to add salt to your beans until they are completely cooked, lest you prevent their tough skins from softening fully. In fact, in some restaurants I worked in, it was thought that overcooked beans could actually be saved by salting the water. (I assure you, whatever firmness was reattained was purely psychosomatic in nature.*)\n\n* I know, I know—that's what she said.\n\nBut how often have you actually cooked two batches of beans side by side, one soaked and cooked in salted water, and the other soaked and cooked in plain water? Chances are, never. And now, you never will. I present to you the results of just such a test:\n\nBoth batches of beans were cooked just until they were fully softened, with none of the papery toughness of an undercooked skin (about two hours for both batches, after an overnight soak). As you can clearly see, the unsalted beans end up absorbing too much water and blowing out long before their skins properly soften, while the salted beans remain fully intact.\n\nThe problem? Magnesium and calcium, two ions found in bean skins that act kind of like buttresses, supporting the skins' cell structure and keeping them firm. When you soak beans in salted water overnight, some of the sodium ions end up playing musical chairs with the calcium and magnesium, leaving you with skins that soften at the same rate as the beans' interiors.\n\nSo where does the old myth come from? Probably the same place most culinary myths come from: grandmothers, aunts, and chefs. Never trusted 'em, never will.\n\nSpices\n\nThe chili-standard duo of cumin and coriander were a given, as were a couple of cloves, their medicinal, mouth-numbing quality a perfect balance for the spicy heat of the chilies, much like numbing Sichuan peppers can play off chilies in the Chinese flavor combination known as ma-la (numb-hot).\n\nI also decided to give star anise a try, in a nod to Heston Blumenthal and his treatment of Bolognese sauce. (He's found that, in moderation, it can boost the flavor of browned meats without making its anise-like presence known. He's right, as I quickly discovered.)\n\nAs for toasting, I made sure to toast the spices before grinding them. Why? Toasting heats the volatile flavor compounds in the spices' cells, causing them to change shape, recombine, and form new, more complex aromas.\n\nIf you toast post-grinding, these volatile aromas are too exposed to the air. They can easily leap right out of the spices and dissipate, leaving you with more aroma around your kitchen while you cook, but less aroma around your food when you serve it.\n\nWith the spices accounted for, the last thing was working on a cooking method. Aside from puréeing the chilies and browning the short ribs, I saw no reason to stray far from tradition.\n\nI sautéed onions, garlic, and oregano in rendered beef fat (along with some fresh Thai chilies for added heat and freshness); cooked down the chili purée; deglazed with some chicken stock (I tried a bit of beer, but found the flavor too distracting); added the beef, its bones, and the soaked beans, along with some tomatoes; and simmered it all until it was done.\n\nSo how'd it taste? Great. But not that great.\n\nDessert Chili?\n\nSo how could I add complexity? If my chilies already had distinct aromas of coffee and chocolate, could there be any harm in adding real coffee and chocolate to play up those flavors? After all, chocolate is a common ingredient in many true south-of-the-border chili blends (like mole negro), and coffee is commonly used as a bitter flavor enhancer in sweet and savory dishes alike.\n\nI made a new batch incorporating one ounce of unsweetened chocolate and a tablespoon of finely ground dark-roast espresso beans into my chili purée, which instantly bumped up its complexity and bitterness. Although chocolate aromas were readily detectable during the first few minutes of cooking, the scent quickly dissipated, providing subtlety as the chili cooked.\n\nAlmost there. The only thing remaining was to address meatiness.\n\nRounding Up the Usual Suspects: Umami Bombs\n\nIn the last few months, ever since I started my experimentation with turkey burgers, the only things I've kept closer by my side than my meat grinder and my wife are my jars of Marmite, soy sauce, and anchovies—three umami bombs that can increase the meatiness of nearly any dish involving ground meat and/or stews.\n\nAdding a dab of each to my chili purée boosted my already-beefy short ribs to the farthest reaches of meatiness, a realm where seared skinless cows traipse across hills of ground beef, darting in and out of fields of skirt steak, stopping only to take sips of rivers overflowing with thick glace de viande...\n\nConvinced that I had finally reached the pinnacle of my chili-centric existence, I ladled up a bowl for myself, noting the perfectly intact, creamy beans; the good mix of finely chopped beef and robust beef chunks; and the deep-red sauce.\n\nInhaling deeply, I stopped and suddenly thought of penne alla vodka, the once-ubiquitous dish that enjoyed a brief moment of stardom in the 1980s—when all the red-sauce joints decided they wanted to be pink-sauce joints—before realizing that the 1990s don't like pink.\n\nWhy did this mysteriously enter my head at such a critical moment of introspection? It all has to do with something called an azeotrope.\n\nIt's a curious fact that although water boils at 100°C (212°F), and alcohol boils at 78.5°C (173°F), a mixture of alcohol and water will boil at a lower temperature than either pure alcohol or water on its own.\n\nYou see, alcohol and water are a bit moleculist (the molecular equivalent of a racist), but only a bit, meaning they stick with their own kind just a bit tighter than with each other. So, when the water and alcohol are mixed, an individual water molecule is further away from other water molecules, making it much easier for it to escape and vaporize. Likewise for the alcohol.\n\nSo what's this got to do with chili?\n\nAll of this aroma-building serves no purpose whatsoever unless those aromas reach your nose, right? So after cooking the chili, my goal should be to get as much of the aroma out of the bowl and into the air as possible.\n\nI reasoned that by adding a couple shots of hard liquor—say, some vodka, bourbon, or tequila—I'd not only help the alcohol-soluble flavor compounds in the chili reach my nose and mouth more efficiently, but, because of the mixture's azeotropic nature, I'd actually help the water-soluble compounds vaporize more efficiently as well.\n\nIt worked like a charm, and, after a thorough tasting of vodka, Scotch, bourbon, and tequila, in the name of good science, I came to the conclusion that they're all good.\n\nLong Island iced chili, anyone?\n\nThis may all seem long and tedious to do in one shot, and, I admit, even I sometimes prefer doing things the short, easy, and less flavorful way. But the beauty of multi-step recipes is that even if you change only one thing in your routine—adding chocolate and coffee to your mix, grinding spices after toasting instead of before—the results should be better, and isn't better food what it's all about?\n\nGet the Recipe The Best Chili Ever View Recipe »\n\nThis post may contain links to Amazon or other partners; your purchases via these links can benefit Serious Eats.

  "latent_7559": "Putting NC BBQ on the Map...\n\nWith over 250 restaurants, shacks, and eateries, this road map will be the most comprehensive listing of NC BBQ joints to be found. Everything will be included on the NC barbecue spectrum, from those hole-in-the-wall, weekday-only heritage spots to the new-fangled, spiffed-up interpretations. Hey, we don't judge - we're leaving that up to you!\n\nThe NC BBQ map will resemble any other road map that you've used: around 18\" x 28\" flat, folded up into a typical 4\" x 9\" size for carrying around with you wherever you go. And you'll want to keep this map in your glove box, because it'll be handy any time you find yourself on the road in North Carolina craving a little 'cue. It's good for grabbing a weekday lunch, finding a perfect road trip meal, or planning an entire barbecue tour around your area of choice.\n\nThis will be an easy-to-use map that will be as practical as it is good-looking. We'll bring in some classic BBQ imagery through the map symbols and graphics. A symbol for each restaurant on the map will give you its basic BBQ facts in just a glance. Map symbols will designate 3 basic BBQ facts: (1) whether the 'cue is whole hog or made with part of the pig, (2) if it has Piedmont or Eastern style sauce, and (3) if its an eatery that smokes their meat the traditional way.\n\nTurn the map over for a list of each restaurant with address, phone number, and hours, as well as a little North Carolina barbecue history. And if 250 barbecue joints aren't enough to satisfy your appetite, a list of annual NC barbecue festivals will also be included.\n\nNorth Carolina's BBQ Culture:\n\nWhen people think about barbecue, usually their state's favorite tradition is called to mind. For North Carolina, that means pulled pork and a sauce that involves vinegar and red pepper - a little tomato too, if you're in a certain part of the state. It means different things for different states. But the history of barbecue is as old as the discovery of fire, itself - the act of cooking slow and low over hot coals or smoky wood.\n\nWhat we consider barbecue today got it start right here on the Carolina and Virginia coast when British colonists combined some of their own cooking techniques with what they saw Native Americans doing with their meat. The British introduced basting to the Native American technique of pit-cooking to help keep the meat moist, and they did this with either vinegar or butter. The addition of red pepper came from African slaves via the Caribbean, where they picked up a taste for peppers.\n\nWhen the Scotch-Irish and Germans took up this form of cooking in the Piedmont region of the state, they too introduced some of their own traditions - tomatoes in the sauce (now seen more likely in the form of ketchup) and a topping of cabbage-based coleslaw. The coleslaw tradition has now spread all over the state as a common barbecue accompaniment.\n\nWhat developed in this region so many centuries ago gave birth to other states' BBQ traditions, as these new Americans migrated and different settlers added in their own culture's influences. And of course, even in NC, there are places that bring in those influences across state lines, especially along the borders. Maybe they mix in a little South Carolina mustard, or they spice or sweeten the pork beyond just pepper flakes and tomatoes. But as long as they do pulled pork - the single thing that unites all NC styles, they'll all be included on the map.\n\n.................................\n\nWhy We decided to Make a BBQ Map...\n\nWe're a guy and a gal from the tiny town of Mt. Pleasant, NC who have called this beautiful state home all our lives. We've grown up on barbecue and enjoyed it in every corner of the state, from our hometown joint to annual church and fire department fundraisers, to roadside eateries along our frequent travels. And we've devoured the history and heritage of NC 'cue as wholeheartedly as we have the hog.\n\nWhile Paul works an 8-5 as a GIS Technician (mapper of sorts), after getting my start in the marketing/PR field, I now work from home part-time as a grant writer. I chose to do that to have the flexibility to travel and to flex my creativity. When asked, \"What do you do?\" I would consider \"adventurer\" part of that answer. I believe that every day can be an adventure, and I'm happy to be able to bring Paul along with me on many of those adventures, traveling the country, our state, and even our newer hometown - Charlotte, NC.\n\nWe've always loved working barbecue stops into our trips, not just for a fine meal, but also for the culture, the heritage, the people and places (a large part of why we adventure in the first place). We know there are lots of others out there who feel the same way, and that is evidenced by the many books published on the subject and websites out there with information on NC 'cue. We are grateful for those who have come before us to document the history and legends of NC's BBQ culture, but there is no NC barbecue map in existence. And a map is absolutely essential to approaching our state's fine delicacy as a traveler or adventurer.\n\nIt takes an immense amount of time and research to go through the current stack of resources out there to route BBQ stops into our travels, and beyond that, no current resource is comprehensive. They've taken more of a sampling than a full-on survey of NC 'cue, so you really do have to dig... and drive... to find some of these places. So building on my years of travel research, love of design, background in marketing and running my own business before this, and on Paul's cartographic skills, we decided to put our heads together and make a map. In short, we saw a hole in the market and decided to jump in!\n\nOur Team: We are partnering with a fantastic team of other Carolina locals to create one light and easy-to-use map of every single damn barbecue place we could find in this great state! And here is the line-up:\n\nRaleigh-based Good South will be our graphic design team for the map and logo. They are most well-known for their label design for Slingshot Coffee Company's Cold Brew bottles, featured on Buzzfeed's 34 Coolest Food Packaging Designs of 2012. We are over the moon to be working with this talented, South-loving duo!\n\nMap-printing extraordinaire, Meredith-Webb, has been an innovator in its industry for over 50 years, and now they will be able to add The Great NC BBQ Map to their list!\n\nWitty wordsmith, Nikki Mueller of Not Made in China, will be creating Kickstarter-exclusive swag featuring her zippy quip \"I got my pork pulled in North Carolina.\" I met Nikki through the group for crafty entrepreneurs I founded, Crown Town Handmade.\n\nAnd as you've witnessed above, we've already secured the creative genius of Stephen Davis at Fast Ship Visual Media, who filmed and edited our awesome Kickstarter video.\n\n.................................\n\nThe Genius of Kickstarter\n\nWe know that many of you are new to Kickstarter, so thank you all for making it here to take a look around. Basically, through this page you can help to launch our project by pledging money and get a pretty cool reward for doing so. Just browse the levels to the right and see what you're interested in.\n\nWe only get the funds pledged through Kickstarter if we meet our $10,000 goal (and your card gets charged only if we do). That gives us both a peace of mind - us, that we'll have enough money in hand to get going; you, that once your card is charged, the project will happen and you'll get your reward.\n\nA Note About Rewards... I think we've provided you all with some pretty stellar rewards for helping to back this project. I hope you agree! If you want to basically just pre-order maps, that's an option we give you. But if you want something fun and creative - and maybe even a little adventurous - you have that too. We've posted more info about our East vs. Piedmont launch party (the $100 pledge reward) in one of our updates, so check that out for some exciting developments. Note that aside from the map itself, these awards really are exclusive to our Kickstarter campaign, so get 'em while you can! You only have 30 days!\n\n.................................\n\nOur Budget & What You're Helping Us Achieve\n\nThe $10,000 budget will cover the cost of map design, printing, and packaging for this first round of maps, as well as general start-up costs, such as web domain and hosting, licensing, and fees/costs associated with Kickstarter. (Those awesome rewards don't pay for themselves!)\n\nWe have researched every single cost associated with creating this map and launching what is to become our very own niche map publishing company (YES! That's the even bigger news!). And then we researched it again. And then we checked the numbers one more time to be sure. Beyond that, we've polled friends, read stacks of books, done market research, and met with small business advisors to review our business plan. In other words, we've done every single thing short of consult a psychic to be sure that we can make a map with $10,000.\n\nAs the Kickstarter campaign progresses and after it concludes, we will keep you up-to-date on the progress of the project. We've already done a lot of legwork going into this and invested some our own personal funds, but we need those pledges in order to pass everything off to the graphic designers and then the printer. As soon as we hit our goal, we are ready to hit the ground running!\n\nThe Stretch Goal... We will be grateful for every dollar you pledge to help us meet our $10,000 goal! So. Grateful. Ideally though, you all will believe in this project as much as we do and help us rocket past that goal so that we can do even more with this project. Going past $10,000 would mean an even bigger launch, allowing us to attend local festivals and events to promote the map, and perhaps even creating an extended line of themed products and goodies available to you via our website. This will also help us launch even faster into the wholesale phase of this project, offering the map to BBQ joints and shops to sell to their pork-loving customers. And if you really lay on the big bucks, it will help us be on the way to phase two - turning the map into an app.\n\nBeyond Kickstarter... As I mentioned, this project will help launch our niche map publishing company! With your help, The Great NC BBQ Map will be the start of something amazing. We have plans to go on to map the other great barbecue states, and beyond that, the ideas go on and on. While we've traveled, we've noticed other things missing from the map world that we're just dying to create! So please go ahead and make our acquaintance on Facebook and Instagram, and bookmark our website. We do hope to keep in touch as this great adventure continues.",

  "latent_7856": "by BARRY WILSON\n\nOTTAWA — In a fiery speech to farm leaders attending the Canadian Federation of Agriculture annual meeting Feb. 24, New Democratic Party leader Thomas Mulcair promised the NDP will be vigorous advocates for the industry in the new Parliament.\n\nDespite the party’s diminished parliamentary presence after losing more than 50 seats in the October election and falling from Official Opposition to third party status, the Montreal lawyer and grandson of a Quebec dairy farmer promised to hold the governing Liberals accountable for how they treat the industry.\n\nHe promised his MPs will:\n\nPush the government to make certain that a fair share of the promised billions of dollars in infrastructure spending make their way into rural communities through stronger broadband service, improved transportation and other rural priorities;\n\nAdvocate for increased funding for business risk management programs that saw funding cuts when the current Agricultural Policy Framework took effect in 2013.\n\nDefend supply management in the face of trade deals negotiated under the Conservatives and not repudiated by the Liberals that would weaken some system protections against imports;\n\nAdvocate for compensation for supply-managed farmers if the trade deals are implemented. During the election campaign, the Conservatives promised $4.3 billion in compensation over the next decade or more but the Liberal government has yet to indicate if it would honour the promise;\n\nSupport Prairie farmers who are calling for a re-creation of the Canadian Wheat Board monopoly dismantled by the Conservative government.\n\nMulcair called his NDP caucus the “progressive” opposition party in the House.\n\n“I won’t abandon my promise to stand four-square behind supply management,” he said.\n\nWhile free trade advocates and their political defenders criticize the protectionist system as a drag on the Canadian economy “this is just economic theory. It doesn’t hold water.”\n\nMany CFA members, who earlier had sat through a wooden and tightly-scripted performance by new agriculture minister Lawrence MacAulay, praised the NDP leader for his vigorous promises.\n\nHowever, Mulcair did find himself in trouble when he bemoaned the loss of “30,000 small- and medium-sized farmers during the past decade” while the presence of corporate farms grew in the industry.\n\nNorm Hall, president of the Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan, called out the politician on the issue.\n\nHall told Mulcair he took exception to the NDP leader’s characterization of the sector as increasingly corporate at the expense of family farms. He argued it reduced consumer confidence in the industry and unfairly diminished the image of producers.\n\nHall asked the delegates how many had incorporated their operation. Most raised their hands.\n\nAnd how many of those operations were family farms? Most raised their hands.\n\n“Corporate farms are family farms,” the Prairie farm leader said. Most farmers incorporate for tax reasons.\n\nMulcair quickly backtracked. He said he understood the advantages of incorporation for tax purposes and did not intend to tar farmers with the party’s anti-corporate brush.\n\n“I take your point,” he said. “I did not explain myself well.”\n\nMulcair also appeared to promise that an NDP government would support re-establishing the CWB monopoly, even though World Trade Organization rules forbid the creation of new trading monopolies.\n\nCanada would have to renounce its long-standing WTO membership to accomplish the promise.\n\n“We would return collective bargaining to farmers,” the NDP leader promised, arguing that the end of the monopoly is costing Prairie grain farmers “billions of dollars each year” and farmers “unanimously” have called for a return to the monopoly.\n\nHe was referring to a recent meeting of approximately 50 farmers in Swan River, Man., organized by the Canadian Wheat Board Alliance, that voted unanimously to return to the monopoly.\n\nThe assets of the former CWB have been sold to a company controlled by American agrifood multinational corporation Bunge and a Saudi Arabian company.\n\nTory agriculture critic Chris Warkentin, MP Grande Prairie-Mackenzie, addressed meeting goers earlier in the day.

When the MLK Memorial was recently built in Washington DC, the family was able to get nearly $800,000 just to use his words and likeness.The FftF video was not just the MLK video, but contained some additional explanation of how expanding copyright laws could impact people for doing something as simple as sharing the MLK video -- and then it included some of the speech. So I guess it should come as little surprise that the \"I have a dream...\" video that FftF was urging people to share has already been taken down (it's unclear if the takedown was due to a notice or Vimeo being proactive).It seems fairly ridiculous that on Internet Freedom Day, and just before MLK Day, we're still dealing with takedowns on such powerful words.\n\nFiled Under: copyright, fight for the future, i have a dream, internet freedom, martin luther king jr., takedowns",

  "latent_8680": "Using stem cell technology, scientists have produced male and female mice from two fathers, a breakthrough that could conceivably allow same-sex couples to have their own genetic children.\n\nThe multi-generational technique combines genes from the chromosomes of two male mice and uses surrogate mothers, according to researchers at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas.\n\nTo produce the male and female offspring, the team first manipulated tissue cells from a male mouse fetus to produce an induced pluripotent stem cell line. Without explaining why, the team says about one percent of these iPS cells spontaneously lost their Y chromosomes, resulting in XO cells. In humans, this monosomy is known as Turner syndrome; girls with the disorder usually have various physical abnormalities and cognitive defects. Normally, people have one pair of sex chromosomes in each cell — women have two X chromosomes and men have X and Y.\n\nThe scientists injected the XO stem cells into blastocysts from donor female mice, and these early embryos were implanted into surrogate mothers. When the mothers gave birth, their female offspring were XO/XX chimeras — they had one X chromosome from the original male mouse cells. Finally, the researchers harvested egg cells from these chimeras and mated them with normal male mice. The result was male and female offspring that had chromosomes from two fathers — from the regular male and derived from the stem cells.\n\nThe team said their results are a new form of mammalian reproduction, and that it could be used to combine genetic traits from two males without having to involve any women. It could even be possible to produce sperm and eggs from one male, the researchers say.\n\nOne day, they might even be able to produce human eggs from male stem cells in a living male. This would eliminate the need to produce XO chimeras, the researchers say.\n\nBut don't worry, fellow XXers: We're not obsolete, because women will still be necessary to carry the two-father pregnancy to term.

  "latent_9065": "Jed York invokes memory of his Super Bowl-winning uncle\n\nNiners CEO Jed York wants to follow in the sizable footsteps of Eddie DeBartolo Jr., but York recently has learned he can’t adopt some of his combustible uncle’s personality traits that flew under the radar 30 years ago.\n\nFor example, York’s this-performance-wasn’t-acceptable tweet to fans immediately after a blowout loss to Seattle in November 2014? Yes, classic rant-now-and-think-later Eddie D., who didn’t have Twitter at his disposal when he was the 49ers’ owner.\n\n“I’m emotional,” York said. “I learned that from my uncle. Both of us put holes in walls. … I can’t be a distraction to this team. The world is so much different today than I think when my uncle ran the team.”\n\nIt can be argued that York stood before a media throng Monday, contrite and humbled, because he allowed his emotions to affect his oft-stated goal of winning Super Bowls. Just more than 12 months ago, York parted with head coach Jim Harbaugh and replaced him by promoting defensive line coach Jim Tomsula.\n\nThe swap, of course, was an epic disaster. Harbaugh won 49 games, including playoffs, in his four-year tenure, which is three more than the 49ers managed in the eight seasons before his arrival. Tomsula? He was fired Sunday night after a 5-11 season, prompting York’s news conference about 15 hours later.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers CEO Jed York walks off the stage after speaking at Monday’s news conference at Levi’s Stadium.

In this area, York didn’t follow his uncle’s lead.\n\nOn Monday, York earned overall favorable reviews by addressing some of his recent missteps directly. However, he was less forthcoming when asked if he regretted what’s widely perceived to be his biggest mistake: Didn’t he wish he’d found a way to keep Harbaugh?\n\n“Jim Harbaugh is a good football coach,” York said. “His success at Michigan doesn’t surprise me at all. We need to make sure that we look forward to the next head coach.\n\n“In terms of Jimmy T., we took a chance on somebody that we believe strongly in, certainly his character, his leadership ability, what he was able to do. And ultimately, that didn’t work out. And I feel like watching what my uncle did, watching what my grandfather did, you have to learn from mistakes.”\n\nIt will be interesting to see if York has, indeed, learned from his mistakes after the 49ers hire their next head coach. During his final season, Harbaugh repeatedly was undermined by leaks to national media outlets, information which was believed to be coming from the front office and, possibly, an unhappy York.\n\nOn Sunday, it appeared little had changed. Hours before the 49ers’ regular-season finale, there was a wave of reports stating Tomsula would be fired after the game. York said the 49ers’ lips had been sealed.\n\n“Having things come out of the building and having the leaks like that are harmful to the team, harmful to Jimmy T, somebody that’s been here for a long time, harmful to our players, harmful to our fans,” York said. “That’s not in my best interest. … We have no interest in leaking information out of this building. If I find people that are leaking information, they are not going to be a part of this team.”\n\nYork bolstered his battered image Monday, but those were merely words. He now can make the frustrated faithful more sanguine by hiring the right head coach. General manager Trent Baalke will lead the search, but York will be involved. He consulted with DeBartolo early Monday morning and received counsel.\n\nAs York noted, DeBartolo wasn’t immune to mistakes. In 1978, for example, he hired head coach Pete McCulley, who was fired after nine games, and replaced him with Fred O’Connor, who coached the remaining seven. Nearly four decades later, Tomsula became the first head coach since McCulley and O’Connor to last one season or less with the 49ers.\n\nDeBartolo rebounded in 1979 by hiring Walsh, who won the first three of the franchise’s five Super Bowl championships. On Monday, York insisted the ability to win titles was his only concern when asked if he needed a head coach who possessed a personality with which he felt comfortable.\n\n“We’re in need of somebody that can win Super Bowls,” he said.\n\nDidn’t he already part with that coach? When asked that end-of-the-news-conference question, York didn’t finish by flashing his fire, but he did show a little spark.\n\n“We haven’t won a Super Bowl since 1994,” he said.\n\nEric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

  "latent_9144": "With the general election creeping ever closer here in the United States, now seemed like a good time to get an official stance from the four presidential candidates who will be on the ballot about critical issues around technology and privacy.\n\nI narrowed my list of questions for them down to just four (my original list was around 12) in order to make this easy for each campaign to answer. And each campaign was asked the exact same questions—with no variation whatsoever.\n\nEven so, the only campaign to respond to me in any real way was Jill Stein’s. The Hillary Clinton, Gary Johnson and Donald Trump campaigns declined to provide concrete stances or clarifications—though I did get some helpful links from a Johnson surrogate.\n\nAs such, I took a little time to try to find existing quotes and the positions of the other candidates on the topics, which was harder than it should have been. Whenever I needed to include my own words in order to explain their views, I put those words in brackets to make it clear they are not direct quotes from the candidates.\n\nIf I was unable to find a position/statement from a candidate on a question (there are a few of those moments), I would love to hear if anyone else is able to. This is all about getting accurate information about the candidates and their positions on tech/security issues, not about spinning things to make one candidate look better than another. Along those lines, if the individual campaigns would like to make any clarifications or corrections to this, reach out to me and I will gladly post an update.\n\nAlso note: The candidates’ responses are in alphabetical order based on their last names.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nLunduke: What is your stance on end-to-end encryption for private citizens?\n\nClinton: “Encryption of mobile communications presents a particularly tough problem. We should take the concerns of law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals seriously. They have warned that impenetrable encryption may prevent them from accessing terrorist communications and preventing a future attack.” – from TechDirt.\n\n[It should be noted that this article points out that the Clinton campaign itself relies on encryption but does not believe other citizens should be allowed to.]\n\nJohnson: “Security is important, for sure. But throwing away our right to privacy has the opposite effect of protecting our freedom. That’s why the Fourth Amendment says that the government can’t snoop into our private lives unless they have a good reason to do so. Besides, is the government more likely to secure our freedom by collecting trillions of bits of unmanageable data or by identifying real threats and focusing their efforts on properly warranted searches?” – from JohnsonWeld.com.\n\nStein: “End-to-end encryption should be an internet standard, just like SSL for financial transactions.”\n\nTrump: [I found it difficult to figure out what Donald Trump’s position on this issue is. He doesn’t appear to have made any sort of direct statement. But he is a supporter of bulk data collection of U.S. citizens, which suggests he would be against end-to-end encryption (which makes that data collection more difficult).]\n\nLunduke: What is your stance on open source software usage within state and federal government agencies?\n\nClinton: “The federal government spends nearly $90 billion in information technology, but the American taxpayer doesn’t get $90 billion in value. Hillary will make it easier for the federal government to find, try and buy innovative technology—including open source software. She would also break large federal IT projects into smaller pieces, so it will be easier to stop projects that are over budget or failing to meet user needs, and also more feasible for small and medium-sized businesses to support public service projects.” – from HillaryClinton.com\n\nJohnson: [I could find no time that Johnson has mentioned the words “open source,” “free software” or any other related phrases.]\n\nStein: “We are in favor of open source software usage within state and federal government agencies as long as regular audits are performed to protect vital data from being unknowingly transmitted. Using open source software is an excellent way for government agencies to save money. Ideally, agencies should contribute any code customizations back to Free/Libre Open Source Software projects.”\n\nTrump: [I was unable to find any time that Donald Trump referenced open source software in any way.]\n\nLunduke: Do you agree with the ACLU and Human Rights Watch that Edward Snowden (and other whistleblowers) should be pardoned?\n\nClinton: “Because he took valuable information and went first to China and then is now under the protection of Vladimir Putin, I think that raises a lot of questions about everything else he did. So, I do not think he should escape having to return and answer for what he has done.” – from TheHill.com\n\nJohnson: “Based on what I know about Edward Snowden, I would pardon Edward Snowden.” – from TexasTribune.org\n\nStein: “Yes. We would pardon Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning, John Kiriakou, Jeffrey Sterling, Julian Assange and other whistleblowers.”\n\nTrump: “I think Snowden is a terrible threat. I think he’s a terrible traitor. And you know what we used to do in the good old days when we were a strong country — you know what we used to do to traitors, right?” – from WashingtonTimes.com\n\nLunduke: What is your stance on the current activities of the NSA in regard to surveillance and data gathering of U.S. citizens?\n\nClinton: On NSA’s spying power, Clinton said, “... how much is too much? And how much is not enough? That's the hard part. I think if Americans felt like, number one, you're not going after my personal information, the content of my personal information. But I do want you to get the bad guys because I don't want them to use social media, to use communications devices invented right here to plot against us. So, let's draw the line. And I think it's hard if everybody's in their corner. So, I resist saying it has to be this or that. I want us to come to a better balance.” – from TheAtlantic.com\n\n[It should also be noted that Clinton voted for, and voted to re-authorize, the Patriot act.]\n\nJohnson: \"The NSA is a complete executive order as it is under Truman. We could turn those satellites on what is supposed to be the enemy. The fact that they’re pointed on us right now, doesn’t that cause everyone a bit of concern? It should. Look, there’s due process for spying, but due process is not blanket collection of all of our data.\"\n\nAsked if he could eliminate the NSA via executive order: \"Apparently. I’m waiting for someone to prove me wrong. This is what I’ve been told.” – from TheHill.com\n\nStein: “The ubiquitous surveillance conducted by the NSA erodes fundamental rights to privacy and free association, while furnishing a gigantic surveillance-industrial complex with taxpayer dollars. The warrantless internet and phone dragnets were ineffective in providing predictive value for anti-terrorist initiatives, as there was simply too much data to filter in any meaningful way, and instead were used as a repository of potential evidence (gathered without a warrant) only after an accusation had been made.\n\n“We have become the most surveilled population in history, and the potential for abuse is enormous. The way to stop terrorism is to stop funding and arming terrorists and countries that support terrorism and to end U.S. wars and foreign policies that create blowback—not through unconstitutional spying that treats every cell phone and computer user as a suspected enemy of the state.”\n\nTrump: “Well, I tend to err on the side of security, I must tell you, and I’ve been there for longer than you would think. But, you know, when you have people that are beheading if you’re a Christian and frankly for lots of other reasons, when you have the world looking at us and would like to destroy us as quickly as possible, I err on the side of security. And so that’s the way it is, that’s the way I’ve been, and some people like that, frankly, and some people don’t like that.” – from TruthInMedia.com",

  "latent_9186": "Laughter, key to quickly forming social bonds, may have been a key tool of evolution that helped humanity in ways similar to bonding rituals such as grooming in other primates, say researchers at the University of Turku. Photo by TawnyNina/Pixabay\n\nTHURSDAY, July 6, 2017 -- Sharing a laugh can make you feel closer to someone else, and that quick-forming social bond may have been a big evolutionary boon to human survival, a small study suggests.\n\nThe act of laughing out loud triggers the brain to release its very own \"feel good\" neurotransmitters, known as endorphins, the study's brain scans showed.\n\nEndorphins are naturally occurring opioids that may produce a sense of euphoria, calmness and stress reduction, the researchers said.\n\nAnd once laughter causes endorphin levels to go up, so too do feelings of closeness and connection between those \"in\" on the giggle.\n\nFor many animals, primates especially, mutual grooming helps boost social bonds. And humans do this, too. But laughter may work quicker.\n\n\"Touching is probably the most powerful way of bonding in humans,\" said study author Lauri Nummenmaa, \"but it is very time-consuming, as an individual can touch a maximum of [only] two people at the same time.\"\n\nNummenmaa is an associate professor of modeling and medical image processing at Turku PET Centre and the department of psychology at the University of Turku in Finland.\n\nRELATED Combo immunotherapy may change treatment for kidney cancer\n\nLaughter, on the other hand, gets the job done faster and more efficiently, Nummenmaa said, noting that it's \"highly contagious, and may occur simultaneously in large groups.\n\n\"Such contagion,\" he added, \"allows the endorphin responses to spread throughout the group, increasing the effectiveness of this type of 'vocal grooming.' Thus, the evolution of laughter may have enabled humans to significantly expand their social circles.\"\n\nThe Finnish study included 12 healthy men between the ages of 20 and 32. First, they completed mood questionnaires to determine their usual levels of happiness, tension, pain, pleasure and calmness.\n\nTwo opioid-tracking brain scans were then conducted. The first took place after each participant spent a half-hour alone in a room, with the goal being to get a snapshot of routine opioid levels. The second took place after each participant watched a half-hour of pre-chosen comedy clips with two close friends.\n\nAudio recordings indicated that, during the comedy screenings, \"social laughter\" outbursts among the participants and friends clocked in at an average of a little more than one per minute.\n\nBrain scans indicated that as social laughter increased so did the levels of endorphins and other brain opioids similarly linked to arousal and emotions.\n\n\"Also,\" said Nummenmaa, \"we found that the more opioid receptors the participants had in their brain, the more they laughed during the experiment. This suggests that individual differences in the brain's opioid system could underlie individual differences in sociality.\"\n\nBut one thing that everyone has in common, said Nummenmaa, is that \"laughter is also highly contagious. And we often have a hard time resisting laughing when we hear others doing so, even when we know that the laughter is fake or intentional, as in canned laughter [and] laughter tracks in sitcoms.\"\n\nCoupled with the investigation's observation that laughing boosts opioid release, this contagiousness, he said, lends weight to the notion that \"laughter may support bonding via similar molecular mechanisms in humans as grooming does on other primates.\"\n\nBut Dr. John Ferro, a neurologist at Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., cautioned that \"with a sample size of 12, there are a lot of assumptions being made\" by the study authors.\n\n\"Obviously we would like to know the neurobiology of laughter and why it makes us feel good,\" Ferro acknowledged.\n\n\"But this article,\" he said, \"teases us to believe that the tickling of our opioid receptors is the only reason to live in a group.\"\n\nFerro said there are likely many good reasons people seek out strong social bonds, including a search for the advantages a group can offer in terms of safety, commerce, education and cultural advancement.\n\n\"I think,\" Ferro said, \"human interactions may be a little more complex than just the pleasure principle.\"\n\nThe study was published recently in the Journal of Neuroscience.\n\nThe AARP has more about the benefits of laughter therapy.\n\nCopyright © 2017 HealthDay.

The public response was so great that police were forced to turn away volunteers.\n\nLuke Shambrook is attended to by medical staff after being reunited with his family. Photograph: ABC\n\nHe was found about 11.55am local time on Tuesday about 1.8 miles (3km) from the campsite, after a helicopter search crew spotted him sitting among trees.\n\nIn the footage Luke was sitting on sloped ground with his legs straight out in front of him. Once his location was communicated to searchers on the ground, the camera captured the moment a rescuer ran over and crouched next to him.\n\nShortly after another person ran over with emergency medical supplies, pulling out a foil blanket to wrap around the boy.\n\nVictoria Police acting assistant commissioner Rick Nugent told reporters at the scene that Luke was suffering from exhaustion, hypothermia and dehydration.\n\nActing Sergeant Brad Pascoe from the police air wing described the moment he spotted Luke from the helicopter.\n\n“I just out of the corner of my eye caught a little flash of something,” Pascoe said. “It wasn’t much, but it was enough to make me get the guys to turn the aircraft around and have a further look.\n\n“As we got closer and were able to have a better look at him, we saw that it was a person on the ground and we were able to train the camera in and confirm that it was actually Luke.\n\n“All of us in the crew are parents ourselves and we can only imagine what the parents of Luke have been going through. It’s just such a reward for everybody’s efforts.”\n\nLuke was “one courageous, strong, determined young man”, Nugent said. “Four days, four nights in this terrain, it really is a miracle that he’s alive and well.”\n\nLuke’s mother kisses him after searchers bring him out of the bushland. Photograph: ABC\n\nPhotos from the scene showed Luke’s mother cradling his face and leaning in to kiss him as he was carried on a stretcher.\n\nA message on the Luke Shambrook support page on Facebook said the family was very happy to be reunited.\n\n“He gave Tim [his father] a big thumbs-up when they saw each other.”\n\nThe spot where Luke was found was in dense scrub and he must have climbed a number of large, steep rocks to get to his position, local radio reported. Luke’s speech is limited, so the details of his ordeal may never be known. Nugent said Luke had been unable to communicate with his rescuers but drank the water and ate a bread roll he was offered.\n\nDespite night-time temperatures as low as 3C and rainfall in the area, Luke’s family and police had maintained optimism throughout the weekend that he would be found alive.\n\nHis family had warned searchers it was possible that Luke did not know he was lost because of his autism. They thanked those involved in the search for their son.",
  "latent_9705": "Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. REUTERS/Scott Morgan The Obama administration is confirming for the first time that Hillary Clinton's unsecured home server contained some closely guarded secrets, including material requiring one of the highest levels of classification.\n\nThe revelation comes just three days before the Iowa presidential nominating caucuses in which Clinton is a candidate.\n\nThe State Department will release more emails from Clinton's time as secretary of state later Friday.\n\nBut The Associated Press has learned that seven email chains — reportedly containing 22 emails— are being withheld in full for containing \"top secret\" material.\n\nDepartment officials wouldn't describe the substance of the emails, or say if Clinton had sent any herself.\n\nSpokesman John Kirby told the AP that no judgment on past classification was made. But the department is looking into that, too.\n\nBrian Fallon, the Clinton campaign's press secretary, called the State Department's declaration \"overclassification run amok.\"\n\n\"We firmly oppose the complete blocking of the release of these emails. Since first providing her emails to the State Department more than one year ago, Hillary Clinton has urged that they be made available to the public. We feel no differently today,\" he said in a statement.\n\nOf the nature of the emails, he added: \"We understand that these emails were likely originated on the State Department's unclassified system before they were ever shared with Secretary Clinton, and they have remained on the department's unclassified system for years. And, in at least one case, the emails appear to involve information from a published news article.\"\n\nThe 37 pages of withheld emails include messages recently described by a key intelligence official as concerning so-called special access programs — a highly restricted subset of classified material that could point to confidential sources or clandestine programs like drone strikes or government eavesdropping.\n\nThese emails have since been allocated a special-access program (SAP) designation, according to a letter that the intelligence community's inspector general, Charles McCullough, sent to lawmakers this month.\n\nSAPs are designed to safeguard information deemed more sensitive than even \"top secret.\"\n\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nKirby also said that some emails between Clinton and President Barack Obama would be withheld. He said the department had discovered 18 emails between the secretary and president. None will be publicly released. Kirby said none of those emails contained classified information.\n\nThe FBI has also been looking into whether classified material was mishandled during Clinton's tenure at the State Department from 2009 to 2013. Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, has repeatedly insisted that she never sent or received information on her personal account that was marked classified at the time.\n\nNo emails released so far were stamped \"CLASSIFIED\" or \"TOP SECRET,\" but reviewers previously had designated more than 1,000 messages at lower classification levels for public release. Friday's will be the first at the top secret level.\n\nFor those that Clinton only read, and didn't write or forward, she still would have been required to report classification slippages that she recognized. But without classification markings, that may have been difficult, especially if the information was in the public domain.\n\nKirby said the State Department's focus as part of the Freedom of Information Act review of Clinton's emails was on \"whether they need to be classified today.\" Questions about their past classification, he said, \"are being, and will be, handled separately by the State Department.\"\n\nPossible responses for classification infractions include counseling, warnings or other action, State Department officials said, though they declined to say if these applied to Clinton or senior aides who've since left the department. The officials weren't authorized to speak on the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nFriday's release is coming at an awkward time for Clinton. The Iowa caucus is on Monday, and her main challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), is running neck and neck with her in the polls there and leads solidly in New Hampshire. Clinton still holds a strong advantage in national polls.\n\nThe emails have been an issue for Clinton's campaign since it became known 10 months ago that she exclusively used a nongovernment account linked to a homebrew server while in office. Clinton first called the decision a matter of convenience and then termed it a mistake, even if doing so wasn't expressly forbidden. But the matter could prove more troublesome now that Clinton's former agency has confirmed that business conducted over the account included top-secret matters.\n\nClinton and Bernie Sanders. NBC/YouTube\n\nLike Clinton, the State Department discounted such a possibility last March. Both also said her account was never hacked or compromised, which security experts assess as unlikely, and that the vast majority of her emails were preserved properly for archiving purposes because she corresponded mainly with government accounts. They've backtracked from the archiving claim, while the AP discovered several phishing attempts on her server connected to Russia.\n\nThe question of special access programs first surfaced last week, when McCullough, the inspector general for U.S. intelligence agencies, cited examples on Clinton's account in a letter to Congress. Republicans pounced on the report, though Clinton's campaign insisted none of the exchanges were \"classified at the time\" and accused McCullough and GOP lawmakers of selectively leaking materials to damage her presidential hopes.\n\nKirby confirmed that the \"denied-in-full emails\" are among those McCullough recently cited. One of the emails, he said, was among those McCullough identified last summer as possibly containing top secret information.\n\nThe AP reported last August that one focused on a forwarded news article about the classified U.S. drone program run by the CIA. Such operations are widely covered and discussed in the public sphere, including by top U.S. officials, and the State Department immediately pushed back against McCullough's claim. The other concerned North Korean nuclear weapons programs, according to officials.\n\nAt the time, several officials from different agencies suggested the disagreement over the drone emails reflected the government's tendency to over-classify material, and the lack of consistent policies across different agencies about what should and shouldn't be classified.\n\nThe FBI also is looking into Clinton's email setup, but has said nothing about the nature of its probe. Independent experts say it is highly unlikely that Clinton will be charged with wrongdoing, based on the limited details that have surfaced up to now and the lack of indications that she intended to break any laws.\n\n\"What I would hope comes out of all of this is a bit of humility\" and an acknowledgment from Clinton that \"I made some serious mistakes,\" said Bradley Moss, a Washington lawyer who regularly handles security clearance matters.\n\nLegal questions aside, it's the potential political costs that are probably of more immediate concern for Clinton. She has struggled in surveys measuring her perceived trustworthiness and an active federal investigation, especially one buoyed by evidence that top secret material coursed through her account, could negate one of her main selling points for becoming commander in chief: Her national security résumé.\n\nNatasha Bertrand contributed to this report.",

Roughly 1,000 people to date have found jobs because of these events.\n\nCo-founder Dave Phillips adds, “Please do not bring your resume to this event, even though it is a job fair. Simply bring business cards and have a solid message.”\n\nOver 150 recruiters were at the last event in March with over 700 job seekers attending, looking to fill 1000s of local IT jobs.\n\nHiring managers and recruiting managers tout that their time to hire has been reduced up to 20x by simply meeting 3-4 experienced professionals at an event, interviewing 2-3 and hiring 1 instead of posting a job online, getting 900-1000 resumes and having to filter through them all. While job seekers get actual face time with said hiring managers and recruiters, instead of getting a postcard with a URL from an intern.\n\nRecruiters and hiring managers will have lanyards, and job seekers and those simply looking to expand their networks and meet others in the industry will have a name badge.\n\nIt is 100% free to attend for both job seekers and recruiters; however guarded parking at the Majestic is $5.\n\nMore information, FAQs and pictures from prior events can be found at http://www.itinthed.com\n\nAbout IT in the D\n\nFounded in 2001, IT in the D’s mission has been to create a venue for Information Technology professionals in Metro Detroit to offer a safe and agenda-free networking venue.

  "latent_10317": "It's no secret that women earn 20 percent less than men do—both because they're paid less for the same work and end up in fields that come with a lower salary in the first place. And a new report from the Institute for Women's Policy Research underscores the economic effect that closing the wage gap would have for women: pay women the same amount as men, and half of women currently below the poverty line would no longer be poor.\n\nAcross the board, women are more likely to live in poverty than men, says the report: 15.5 percent, compared to 11.9 percent of men, overall. That disparity holds true even for millennial women, who are more likely to have a college degree than millennial men.\n\nAnd single moms have the highest poverty rate—43 percent—compared to any other family set-up. \"Raises for women could drastically change the financial picture for a lot of families,\" writes Danielle Paquette at the Washington Post's Wonkblog. That's because women are the money-earners in 40 percent of American families with kids.\n\nGender isn't the only way to slice the pay gap, of course, even if it is the one that receives the most attention. Factoring race into the difference between men and women widens that gap significantly: Native American, Black, and Hispanic women are over twice as likely to live in poverty compared to white women, says the report. And there exists a pay gap among men, too: Black men make 73 percent of what white men make, reports the Nation.\n\nYou can explore the results from the report in the Institute's interactive map, here.",

The fix is in.\n\nBUT there is something that strikes me as strange. Director Comey told us ALL the things she did wrong and phrased it in such a way that there is NO doubt she IS guilty and yet.

And, most shocking, Mr. Comey even admitted it’s likely foreign governments hacked her emails — and our adversaries could know critical secrets about the U.S. government because of Hillary’s actions.\n\nYET she got off.\n\nWe have to question why he went to those lengths to point out her “criminality” and untrustworthiness. I believe he was controlled by forces outside of himself that prevented him from convicting. Maybe it was a real threat or an understanding that he would be ruined if he had submitted to Loretta Lynch a recommendation for an indictment. But if that is that case, he did the next best thing he could do and offer an honest account as to how bad she did and how righteous the investigation was. He was treated very badly, as was his staff and I think he was played up to the last. Though the decision to indict her was taken off the table, he was going to let everything else spill.\n\nWhy? Because fuck her. She gets her way, but the public gets to know how crappy she was when in a position of trust.

She deserves it.\n\nI hope she loses. I hope she loses badly.\n\nFurthermore I hope that her expectation of consolidating the Democratic Party vote is dashed. I hope the Sanderites refuse to vote for her and instead vote for Jill Stein of the Green party (a very Progressive Party). It will mean that Hillary will go down.\n\nIt would mean that Trump would win BUT it would also be the splitting of the Democratic Party and an establishing of a new political order of three viable parties. The Moderate Liberals, The Republicans and The Progressives. THIS is something I ultimately think is good. A large enough green vote would mean that Sanders and his ideas would be able to at least be bought to the table. Instead of being dismissed by a rigged system where he has no input, Jill and Bernie would be able to be courted a little by the other parties.\n\nI think there is a place for Progressive values. I think that they ought to have a voice. I do think that seeking to act as not only an alternative to the two parties BUT as a policy backer and policy pusher and policy negotiator is where a lot of strength is. Even if The Green Party did not get high enough numbers to threaten either party in the poll, as long as the numbers were high enough they could be seen as someone to negotiate with first before pushing forward with policies or to compromise with.\n\nIt would keep both parties honest. They would fight the fights worth fighting and concede on the smaller battles. It would also mean that the Green Party would be not subject to domination or dismissed by the Democratic Party.\n\nThis is my thoughts only. Let me know what you think.\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_10365": "Ghibli 101: Past, Present, and Future of Studio Ghibli\n\nContents\n\nOfficial Web Page: http://www.ghibli.jp/ (in Japanese)\n\nUnofficial Web Page: http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/ghibli/\n\nQuestions answered on this page:\n\nQ: What is Studio Ghibli?\n\nStudio Ghibli is a Japanese animation studio, led by one of animation's greatest creators, Hayao MIYAZAKI. The studio creates very high quality animated movies, which is rather unique, since most Japanese animation studios depend on TV series or OVAs. They consistently beat Disney movies in box office revenues in Japan and have received numerous awards. Miyazaki and Ghibli movies are well respected and loved by all Japanese people, children and adults alike.\n\nGhibli was established in 1985, to make the film, \"Laputa: The Castle in the Sky\". However, the beginning of the studio can be dated back to 1983, when Tokuma Shoten (Tokuma Publishing, Co., Ltd) decided to produce \"Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind\". Tokuma is a Japanese publishing company which publishes \"Animage\", an animation magazine, in which Miyazaki had been serializing the manga \"Nausicaa\" since 1982. After the success of \"Nausicaa\", Tokuma and Miyazaki decided to make their second movie, \"Laputa\", and they established Studio Ghibli.\n\nTokuma was the parent company of Studio Ghibli until March 2005 when it was spun off as an independent company.\n\nQ. What does \"Ghibli\" mean?\n\nGhibli means \"hot wind blowing through the Sahara Desert\". The name was used for Italian scouting airplanes during World War II. Miyazaki, who loves airplanes (and Italy), named his studio after it.\n\nQ. How do you say \"Ghibli\"?\n\nEven though \"Ghibli\" is an Italian word, it is said jee-blee (or ji-bu-ri in Japanese) when referring to Studio Ghibli. That's how Miyazaki says it, so that's the official pronunciation.\n\nQ: What has Ghibli made?\n\nPlease visit our Ghibli Films page for a complete list.\n\nQ. Did Miyazaki direct all of Studio Ghibli's films?\n\nNo. Miyazaki directed \"Nausicaa\", \"Laputa\", \"Totoro\", \"Kiki\", \"Porco\", \"On Your Mark\", \"Mononoke Hime\", \"Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi\", and \"Howl's Moving Castle\".\n\n\"Grave of the Fireflies\", \"Only Yesterday\", \"Pom Poko\", and \"Yamada-kun\" were directed by his long time colleague and another creative head of Ghibli, Isao TAKAHATA.\n\nMiyazaki produced \"Only Yesterday\" and \"Pom Poko\". Ghibli has also been trying to make anime by directors other than Miyazaki and Takahata. \"Mimi wo Sumaseba\" was directed by Yoshifumi KONDO, who had been the top animator at Ghibli for several years. Sadly, he passed away in January 1998. Miyazaki wrote the script, drew the storyboards, and produced \"Mimi\". \"Umi ga Kikoeru\" was directed by Tomomi MOCHIZUKI (director of the Kimagure Orange Road movies), who is not a member of Ghibli. A complete list of Studio Ghibli films is located here.\n\nQ: Why doesn't Ghibli make TV series?\n\nGhibli was established specifically to make films. TV anime in Japan are made under such tight schedules and budgets, that it's almost impossible for Miyazaki to make the high quality anime he wants to make. This is rather risky, since Ghibli can produce only one movie per year or so, and one movie flop will really damage Ghibli financially. However, the strategy has paid off so far. Ghibli has tried TV with a TV movie, \"Umi ga Kikoeru\", which was made by the younger staff, but it went way over budget and schedule.\n\nQ: What is this Disney/Tokuma alliance?\n\nDisney has acquired the global distribution rights for \"Mononoke Hime\", and video rights for 8 Ghibli movies (except \"Grave\"). Disney will release English (and other language) dubs. The agreement can be expanded into other fields, such as CDs, merchandise, and games in the future.\n\nTo learn more about the Disney/Tokuma deal:\n\nFAQ: http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/disney/\n\nCompilation of newspaper articles: http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/disney/media-coverage.html\n\nQ. Does Ghibli use Computer Graphics?\n\nMiyazaki had been rather skeptical about the use of computers in anime. He once commented \"Why do we need computers to do what human hands can do?\"\n\nThe first time Ghibli used CG was in \"Pom Poko\", in the scene where the camera panned the library shelves. Such a scene is very difficult and time consuming for animators to do, and yet, does not require creativity and therefore is boring for animators to do. \"Whisper of the Heart\" used digital composition in the fantasy scenes, meaning that elements (animated by traditional means) of a scene were composed using a computer, \"On Your Mark\" used some computer generated images, and \"Mononoke Hime\" used computers extensively. Ghibli bought several Silicon Graphics workstations and set up a CG Division.\n\nGhibli went full digital with the film \"Yamada-kun\". In short, the movie used use no traditional cels.\n\nQ: I heard that Miyazaki retired after Mononoke Hime. Is this true?\n\nNo, Miyazaki did not retire, at least not exactly. He is going to make short films to be screened at the \"Ghibli Museum\" (to be opened in October 2001) in Mitaka City in Tokyo. The films will be based on children's books. Ghibli's younger staff members are supposed to make these films, and production is supposed to start after they've taken a break following the completion of My Neighbors the Yamadas. Whether or not Miyazaki will direct these films is still unclear, although he has written storyboards for them.\n\nAt a press conference following the completion of Mononoke Hime, Miyazaki said \"I think that [ Mononoke Hime ] will be the last [feature-length] movie that I make in this way.\" You have to understand what \"this way\" means.\n\nMiyazaki is an animator, first and foremost. He personally checks almost all the key animation, and often redraws roughs when he thinks they aren't good enough or characters aren't \"acting right.\" This isn't the typical way in which a director works. (For example, Mamoru Oshii doesn't even check key animation. He has a technical director to do that. Takahata checks key animation, but he tells the key animators to redraw the roughs.) Miyazaki feels this hands-on approach is the only way for him to make the films he wants to make.\n\nHowever, Miyazaki felt he was getting too old. He said his eyes aren't as good as they used to be, and his hands can no longer move so quickly. And he felt that spending every day for more than two years working on Mononoke Hime took too much out of him. Hence, he said that he wouldn't direct a film in that way anymore. He also said that his career as an animator has ended.\n\nOf course, most journalists in Japan didn't bother to check what he meant by \"in this way,\" so they just wrote big headlines like \"Miyazaki announced retirement!\" Since then, this news has taken on a life of its own.\n\nMiyazaki also said that he was leaving Ghibli to make way for young people. However, he also stated that he \"may assist in some capacity in the future,\" such as producing and writing scripts. Sadly, judging from his eulogy for Yoshifumi Kondo, it seems that he was planning to write and produce another film for Kondo to direct, as he did with Whisper of the Heart.\n\nMiyazaki formally quit Ghibli on January 14th, 1998. He built a new studio, \"Butaya\" (Pig House), near Studio Ghibli as his \"retirement place.\" However, on January 16th, 1999, Miyazaki \"formally returned\" to Studio Ghibli as Shocho (this title means roughly \"the head of office\").\n\nQ. How many times has Miyazaki \"retired\"?\n\nSeveral. After completing Mononoke Hime (noted in the previous question) he came back to direct Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi. Miyazaki annoucement his retirement from hands-on directing (again) soon after the completion of \"Sen\", but stepped up to direct Howl's Moving Castle after the original director left the project.\n\nQ: Can I write to them?\n\nYes. You can write a letter, or you can send them e-mail. However, they will not reply. They are busy making films, and they receive many mails. You can get Studio Ghibli's address here.\n\nQ: How can I see the Ghibli movies?\n\nPlease see the Shopping Guide as well as the Availability page for each film.\n\nMany of the films are being shown at film festivals around the world.\n\nThis page is brought to you by Team Ghiblink.",
  "latent_10433": "Across the board, projects started by women were more likely to fulfill their funding goals than those started by men. Interestingly, female-headed projects had the starkest advantage in the category of technology, an industry often thought of as hostile to women.\n\nKickstarter Success Rates for Men and Women, by Product Category\n\nwsj.com (Data: Greenberg and Mollick)\n\nIt struck the researchers that women's success on Kickstarter wasn't concentrated in female-heavy categories. This led them to believe that Kickstarter's relative fairness might be derived from its ability to match female entrepreneurs with a small but dedicated audience of female funders interested in supporting women in female-unfriendly industries.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, they showed subjects Kickstarter projects that had already been successfully funded, keeping all aspects of the projects constant except for the name, gender, and picture of the entrepreneur. When the researchers constructed the identities of these founders, they took care to find ethnically similar people of average attractiveness—this being academia, they consulted another study to determine what that would look like—and had them throw on a neutral gray T-shirt for their profile pictures.\n\nThe results of this experiment confirmed that women who indicated an interest in promoting women in male-heavy industries were more likely to support female-headed projects. That’s why the female-backed campaigns that were likeliest to succeed weren't, say, children's books, but rather smartwatches.\n\nThe empowerment of female entrepreneurs plays into a larger conversation about how to achieve corporate gender equality. More and more business leaders are supporting quotas for women in decision-making roles, but, as Greenberg and Mollick's study suggests, numerical representation only goes so far. It seems a key ingredient in promoting gender equality might be an opinionated group of influential women who will go out of their way to help other women make their way through unwelcoming industries.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

As with prior entries in the Sucker Punch produced property, you’ll be free to shape the superhero in the manner that you wish – and director Nate Fox reckons that you’ll need to play through the game twice to see everything that the release has to offer.\n\n“The choices that you make along the way will not only impact Delsin’s story, but also the way that his powers mature and evolve, and the way that other characters around you evolve and change,” he told our friends over at VG247 as part of a meaty telephone conversation. “It’s very, very different. You’ve got to play the game twice to see it all.” Fox reiterated that the title will feature more powers than the smoke and neon abilities that we’ve already seen, but hinted that these may not be fully detailed until around the time of the open world escapade’s release.\n\nHowever, he was willing to confirm that the Seattle-based studio’s invested a lot of work into improving the believability of the title’s sandbox – an attribute made possible due to the power of Sony’s new system. “The game world does react to you,” he stressed. “You make choices throughout the game with pretty serious consequences, so that serious choice and consequence theme is still there. You matter in the world.” One relationship that will evolve during the course of the campaign is the one with your brother Reggie, who’s torn between family and his role as a police officer.\n\nIf you’re worried that the sequel's morality may still be a little on the nose like its PlayStation 3 cousins, Fox insists that while the game will still let you know which path you're taking, it won’t reveal the consequences of your actions immediately. “We try and make it pretty clear when you’ve done something evil, mainly because it really sucks when it’s nebulous,” he concluded. “But at the same time we try to put situations in front of the player that are frankly tough, because that’s what games are good for.”\n\nOf course, the proof will be in the pudding – but fortunately you won’t have to wait too long to dig out your DualShock 4-shaped spoon. As announced late last year, the next-gen adventure's set to take flight on 21st March in North America, and you should probably expect to see a lot more of the release in the run up to launch.

That’s for the top people. I’m sure if you shout loud enough, [Worldwide Studios president] Shuhei Yoshida will make it happen.”\n\nShould it get the go-ahead, though, Moore cautioned that a straight conversion of the console title would be unfair on fans of the fledgling portable. “The thing with the Vita version is because of the touch screens and stuff, you’d want to incorporate something more,\" he said. \"You could just do a straight port, but I don’t think that’s best for Vita owners.”\n\nYou know what you need to do if you want to see Kutaro and crew take to the stage on the Vita’s delicious OLED display, then.

The love of your life is probably another year and a half away...\n\nDeadline is reporting that after intense negotiations between CBS, the show's studio, 20th Century Fox, and the stars, How I Met Your Mother will indeed be returning for Season 9.\n\nIt had previously been reported that Jason Segel was the most reluctant to return for another season, and with everyone’s contract up, Deadline says the actor was initially intent on not signing for another year. Creators Craig Thomas and Carter Bays had said they would not continue the show without the entire cast and Deadline says, that being the case, “The show was literally dead” until Segel had a last minute change of heart and agreed to sign for one more year, along with his costars, Josh Radnor, Cobie Smulders, Neil Patrick Harris and Alyson Hannigan, for what Deadline is calling the final season.\n\nBays and Carter had been quite vocal about the fact that they were at a cutoff point as far as having to know whether this was the final season or not - Given the ongoing storylines of How I Met Your Mother, they needed to know if they were about to go into production on the very last episodes or not, in the latter half of Season 8. Meanwhile, CBS had made it clear they wanted the show to come back, but the key was securing the cast for a new deal. As Deadline notes, CBS was extra keen to close deals on How I Met Your Mother – still a big hit for them – given that they also have to go through contract re-negotiations on Two and a Half Men soon.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nAs Deadline notes, CBS, 20th Century Fox and the cast are currently keeping quiet on the new deal – likely having intended to announce it next month at the TCA press tour.

And unfortunately, its creator has announced that this project is no longer under development.\n\nFiveM was a multiplayer modification for Grand Theft Auto V which aimed to offer an advanced multiplayer environment for people to play on dedicated servers with user-made game modes.\n\nFiveM would built on the solid multiplayer framework set by the Rockstar Studios themselves as part of the RAGE engine, which has gone through rigorous testing since its first release in 2008, adding high-level customizability features.\n\nHowever, as NTAuthority noted, the reasons behind FiveM’s shut down was the lack of an initial release (that was planned for a June/July release) and a lot of obstacles that could not be resolved.\n\nThe setbacks from the past 3 months have placed FiveM at a point where it simply has no market value anymore. — NTAuthority (@NTAuthority) September 22, 2015\n\nThe procedure followed for FiveM development was only ever to be successful if an initial release was done by June/July. — NTAuthority (@NTAuthority) September 22, 2015\n\nThe fact that one still is not released, and a lot of obstacles still exist, are grounds for me to shut the project down. — NTAuthority (@NTAuthority) September 22, 2015\n\nNTAuthority also claimed that another alternative/competitor to FiveM is currently under development and may be the ideal alternative for GTA Online.\n\n@EFOTEAM There's already another project going on that provides more classic (no AI, 'idiot' team) multiplayer – they're the main problem. — NTAuthority (@NTAuthority) September 22, 2015\n\n@EFOTEAM Competitor to FiveM, own netcode, no AI, but large following and way better marketing. — NTAuthority (@NTAuthority) September 22, 2015\n\nUPDATE:\n\nNTAuthority got in touch with us and told us that the public part of FiveM is the only part of the project that is currently no longer under development, and that the base framework is still being developed.\n\n“If you followed my full Twitter (http://twitter.com/NTAuthority) or even had a single glance at the FiveM project page (http://fivem.net/), you’d have known that the only part of the project that was ‘no longer under development’ (for the time being) was the public part of FiveM – not the base framework, which would be able to be used by anyone (as the HTML comments on fivem.net indicate); including to create exactly what FiveM originally consisted of. This measure was necessary as the amount of people on the FiveM community forums (and greater GTA community) spouting disbelief in FiveM ever ‘being finished’ (and reposting the same ‘bugs’ in the initial release — that was never meant to be, but was only officially released as the initial builds from the source code repository became slightly too popular and had massive flaws) became only a hindrance to further development.”",
  "latent_10649": "This is first in a series of portraits of American evangelical Christians in the age of Donald Trump, examining the changes, tensions and challenges in this group through individual stories.\n\n_____\n\nHELENA, Ark. — I can remember moments of spiritual euphoria from my youthful days in church when I raised my hands toward the ceiling, closed my eyes, and received a vision from the Holy Spirit, one of blacks and whites equal and united.\n\nIt was a recurring image in my mind in those days of heightened religious zeal, and adulthood never stole the dream from me. I remained convinced that the teachings of the Christian faith held the greatest promise for overcoming racism.\n\nThis is a common desire among Christians of all political stripes. I grew up in a conservative evangelical culture, and many right-wing Republicans I knew believed that Christianity had the potential to tear down the walls of racial division, and they hoped it would happen.\n\nBut like many whites, I thought of racism and reconciliation in terms of individual relationships rather than in terms of laws, systems and institutions. The true scope of what justice might mean had not occurred to me.\n\nAnd then in the age of Trump, things fell apart. They had been unraveling for years, ever since America elected its first black president, setting off a slow motion backlash among some whites. In President Obama’s second term there came a staggering rush of video footage filmed on cellphones showing an established pattern of police brutality against African-Americans.\n\nAnd there was a growing popular awareness that America’s history had been literally whitewashed in the popular imagination, glossing over the dark decades of Jim Crow. For me it took the form of movies like “13th,” which traces the roots of mass incarceration, and from hearing, for the first time, about the Tulsa race riots of 1921 and the destruction of the business district once known as the “Black Wall Street.” As I read more about this episode and others like it, I asked friends and acquaintances if they too knew about these things. They did not.\n\nBut new calls for racial justice and talk of systemic white supremacy — a system set up during Jim Crow with continuing consequences today — mostly fell on deaf ears. Many white conservatives were sick of hearing about racism, believing that Democrats had cynically played the race card for black votes for decades.\n\nIt hasn’t just been some whites who have been on a journey of discovery regarding the ways in which white supremacy was institutionalized, with effects that continue today.\n\nJemar Tisby, a 36-year old PhD student at the University of Mississippi, was just a few years ago a rising star in the majority-white branch of American evangelical Christianity known as the Reformed movement.\n\nHe wanted to bring blacks and whites together — starting inside the church — and had devoted much of his life to that cause. But at the time, when discussing the black community’s struggles with poverty and crime, he emphasized individual moral failings and theological shortcomings in the black church more than historic, systemic causes.\n\nOver the last few years, however, his focus has shifted. His study of the history of race and religion in America had turned his focus toward systemic causes of racial inequality, and the ways in which American history has ignored them.\n\n“When it comes to knowledge of our racial history, black history, we don’t know our own stories,” he told me one night recently in his hometown of Helena, a once-thriving Mississippi River port town.\n\nTisby’s writings and his podcast, “Pass the Mic,” had helped me process my own evolving attitudes about race. In many ways, though he was black and I was white, Tisby and I came from similar backgrounds and had similar ways of thinking. The racial venom in our streets and our discourse grieved both of us.\n\nWe both still shared a hope in the power and the teachings of the Christian faith to overcome racism, but reality looked grim. The day after the election last fall, Tisby had been frank on his podcast, processing things in real time. “It feels like the work of developing racial unity among believers took a monumental step backwards, or it didn’t move at all and I just thought it was in a different place than it really was,” he said then.\n\nAnd so in August I traveled to the Delta to find out what Tisby wanted to do, now that his dream — one I shared — had been so badly deflated. We sat on a porch in the dark, drinking wine, swatting mosquitoes, searching for answers.\n\n*****\n\nThe morning after Donald Trump was elected president, Tisby’s wife, Janee, learned the election result from him. They consoled one another with a hug. “Sometimes words fail you,” he said. He told his professors at the University of Mississippi, where he’s a PhD student studying the history of American race and religion, that he needed to skip class that day. “I’m literally not feeling well,” he told them.\n\n“There’s this sense that the nation wasn’t what we thought it was. It’s not what we hoped it was, at the very least,” Tisby said on his podcast that day. “Something about this really felt like a gut punch that really pushed back everything we’ve been doing by several steps.”\n\n“So many of my bothers and sisters in the faith still don’t understand where I’m coming from as a racial minority,” he said. “It was devastating.”\n\nTisby had been an influential voice for racial reconciliation, a process that he thought could and should begin with the church. With that in mind he had built an influential organization, the Reformed African-American Network, or RAAN, which hosted the “Pass the Mic” podcast and published articles on faith, race and politics. The podcasts have been ranked in the top 20 in the “Religion & Spirituality” category on iTunes, and RAAN’s website has hosted more than 2 million visitors.\n\nBut in recent years he had become discouraged, a process that accelerated after Trump’s election, and paralleled a growing sense of futility among other black evangelicals who had been working toward the same goal. They were asking themselves a simple question: If blacks and whites who are brothers and sisters in Christ cannot reach across the racial divide, what hope is there for the nation as a whole?\n\nA makeshift memorial in Ferguson, Mo., for Michael Brown, who was fatally shot by Police Officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9, 2014. (Photo: Joshua Lott/AFP/Getty Images) More\n\nThe shift in Tisby’s thinking began in 2014, with the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., at the hands of a white police officer, a tragedy that elicited widely different reactions among whites and blacks. Tisby noticed and became increasingly bothered by what he regarded as the indifference among whites to a pattern of police brutality against blacks.\n\nAs he gradually become more outspoken about racial justice, he saw white Christians responding negatively, often insisting that he should talk about “the gospel” rather than race. “It’s the idea that if you start talking about so-called social issues, which — how do you define that? — then you automatically have stopped talking about spiritual or ‘gospel issues,’ salvation and things like that,” he said. “And we get a lot of that. I get a lot of that.”\n\nConservative evangelicals also had an enormous blind spot concerning politics, literally an inability to conceive that sincere Christians could be Democrats. “In my conservative theological circles, you could be a publicly declared Republican, but if you were a publicly declared Democrat you might get somebody who grabs you by the elbow and takes you off and whispers in your ear, ‘Hey brother, I’d love to share the gospel with you,’” Tisby said.\n\nSo he has decided that he does not want to spend as much time and energy as he has in the past trying to reach and convince a white audience that they should care about systemic racial inequality.\n\n“I think a lot of us are realizing that without losing any love for our white brothers and sisters, it is taking our limited time and energy and resources to constantly address and educate them,” he said.\n\nTisby was raised outside Chicago in a middle-class home and after college at Notre Dame moved to Helena in 2003 as an idealistic Teach for America recruit. He took up the cause of charter schools, starting as a sixth-grade teacher and then moving on to be the middle school principal at a KIPP charter school.\n\nIn 2011, he went to Jackson, Miss., to study at one of the preeminent evangelical seminaries in the country, Reformed Theological Seminary. There, he became assistant to and friends with the school’s chancellor, Ligon Duncan, one of the most prominent figures in the Reformed wing of American evangelicalism. This movement aimed to correct what it saw as a drift in American evangelicalism away from theological precision and toward a faith more oriented around man than it was around God. It was a return to Calvinism, and this movement has been a robust component of evangelical Christianity for almost two decades now.\n\nTisby started RAAN at that time. He was becoming a key figure connecting African-American Christians and the overwhelmingly white evangelical church.\n\nTisby had been deeply influenced during his undergrad days at Notre Dame by the book “Desiring God,” by a Baptist preacher from Minnesota, John Piper. Piper was another prominent thinker in the Calvinist tradition. Tisby himself articulated some of this view in a 2012 blog post, where he lauded the “big God” approach of Reformed theology. But in retrospect, the post is evidence of how much he has changed in five years.\n\nAlthough he stipulated that white Reformed churches had “much to learn from the Black church tradition,” Tisby’s overall critique of the African-American church was harsh. He wrote that there had been an “infiltration of man-centered ideas like legalism and prosperity theology into the pulpits and pews of Black churches.”\n\n“The damage is evident as individuals in African American communities stumble and sometimes run toward sin and folly,” Tisby wrote. “I lived and worked as an educator in the Mississippi Delta for seven years. The Black community there is bruised by generational poverty, lack of education, poor health care, single parent homes, apathetic men, and nearly every other social ill that exists. Yet the norm for my students and their families was to attend church. As I daily encountered the fruits of these dysfunctions I asked myself, ‘Where is the Gospel transformation?’”\n\nJohn Piper speaking in Capetown, South Africa, in 2010. (Photo: Micah Chiang via Flickr) More\n\nThis rhetoric from an African-American was palatable to many white Christians. But they are much less inclined to agree with what he’s been saying since 2014, that the black community has been and continues to be systematically disadvantaged by a culture in which whites dominate the power structure and whiteness is considered more valuable than dark skin in the collective consciousness.\n\nWhen I asked Tisby recently about his 2012 blog post, he completely rejected what he had written. “This represents an immature understanding of both Reformed theology and the black church tradition on my part. The condescending tone toward the black church is reprehensible and inexcusable,” he wrote.\n\n“I was searching for a way to communicate biblical truth to my students and their families in the Delta. I erred first by thinking they weren’t getting this truth in the first place and second by thinking that Reformed theology as formulated by white men was the solution. I would never write such a piece now. I need to take it down,” he said.\n\nNow, Tisby and others at RAAN are in the process of changing the name of their organization. The word “Reformed” will no longer be part of the name. He told me this was a “pivot to emphasize African American concerns and highlight the black church tradition … while retaining a Reformed theological foundation.”\n\nTrump’s election had capped his conviction that had been growing for years, that white Christians did not really care that much about what he had to say, even if they were willing to politely listen.\n\n“It was almost a slap in the face to me,” Tisby told me.\n\n“We said, like, ‘This man is dangerous to us.’ And I was like, ‘I go to the same churches with you. You’ve held my child in your arms. And none of that has impacted you to the point where you would change anything really. What has it really cost you, white evangelical, to have me in your presence? Versus, what does it cost me to be in your presence?” he said.\n\n“Because you certainly aren’t going to black churches. We’re coming to you. And as we come to you, we’re saying, ‘Hey, our presence needs to actually make a difference here. It needs to actually change the way you do things. Otherwise, you’re just asking for uniformity, not unity.’”\n\n*****\n\nIn June, Tisby quietly resigned his position as director of the African-American Leadership Institute at Duncan’s Reformed Theological Seminary. He has stopped submitting articles to websites like the Gospel Coalition or Desiring God, which cater to a predominantly conservative evangelical audience.\n\nTisby had once been in the forefront of a small but growing number of black ministers and leaders who had found common cause with the white-dominated Christian Reformed movement. Some still remain in that movement, but the support for Trump by an overwhelming majority of white evangelical Christians has deeply troubled many African-American church leaders and thinkers.\n\n“The Trump election did it for me. For the first time I said, ‘Wow, I don’t think this is really going to get better,’” said Eric Redmond, a professor at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago who helped edit a 2009 book called “Glory Road: The Journeys of 10 African-Americans into Reformed Christianity.”\n\n“We’re in 2017, and a lot of my brothers still don’t get it and I don’t know if they’re going to get it,” Redmond said. “There’s huge repercussions, but for people of color it just means we’re going to figure this out on our own.”\n\nWhen I visited Tisby in his hometown in August, we spent the better part of a day exploring Helena, talking about the events of the last few years. He said that his focus was moving toward speaking and writing for a black audience primarily, rather than for whites.\n\n“We have a lot of white evangelicals coming to us through RAAN. And that demonstrates a willingness to learn and a level of humility. And I’ll ride with you. I mean I’m not turning anybody away. But I’m not chasing you. I think that’s one way to characterize the difference,” he said.\n\nVoters wait to cast their ballots last Nov. 8 in Alexandria, Va. (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images) More\n\nTisby’s path shares similarities with that of other prominent black Christian leaders who have spent significant time in Reformed Christian circles, such as Thabiti Anyabwile, a Washington, D.C., pastor.\n\nAnyabwile has been a speaker at a prominent biannual conference for Reformed evangelicals, “Together for the Gospel,” in the past and has also faulted the black church for its lack of theological rigor. But he was one of the few religious conservatives, along with the Southern Baptist Convention’s Russell Moore, to forcefully criticize Trump. Anyabwile also publicly rebuked Christians who supported him, and argued that evangelicals should support Hillary Clinton despite disagreements over issues like abortion.\n\nThe backlash from white conservative Christians to Anyabwile’s comments during the election was intense. But in March of this year, Anyabwile and others organized a conference attended mostly by black Christians, pushing back against pressure from within white Christianity to stop talking about racial justice and inequality. The Gospel Coalition helped sponsor the event.\n\n*****\n\nPart of Tisby’s tour through Helena took us through Magnolia Cemetery, a place of burial for Helena’s African-American population that had only recently begun to be reclaimed by members of the local community from decades of neglect.\n\nWe walked down a gravel road past crumbling headstones, surrounded by deep forest on both sides and by the deafening chirping of summer insects in the trees.\n\n“I am sobered, chastened a bit in my hopefulness,” Tisby said. He added that he was “not hopeless.”\n\n“I think I have a more realistic picture of what we’re facing when it comes to race and the church, and America more broadly. This is a long slog, and sometimes the best we can do in terms of success is to say we were faithful. We may not ever see the progress we desire. But I’m not despondent or cynical. I think I’m bolder now,” he said.\n\nTisby admitted he had been “naïve about some things, simply because I was young.” Namely, he overestimated how easy it would be to bring about racial reconciliation.\n\nHe said in subsequent conversations that he has not given up on the idea of reconciliation and still sees it as foundational to racial justice. But there are many Christians who are moving away from talk of racial reconciliation because they believe it “confuses white emotional catharsis with racial justice,” as Erna Kim Hackett, with the Christian organization InterVarsity, put it.\n\n“[Black Lives Matter] insists on addressing systemic issues, and white Christianity is pathologically individualistic,” she wrote. This “explains why people love a photo of a cop hugging a black person, but dismiss claims of systemic racism in policing. It pretends that injustice is resolved when individuals hug.”\n\nBut Tisby hasn’t given up on relationships with white evangelicals. He still sees it as vital. During our conversation on the porch of the Edwardian Inn, a bed and breakfast in Helena, Tisby explored the paradox that while black progress requires overcoming systemic injustice and inequality, white Christians are resistant to that message, so progress will depend on personal interactions among individuals.\n\nProtesters march in Boston against a planned “Free Speech Rally” a week after the violent “Unite the Right” rally in Virginia left one dead and dozens injured. (Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images) More\n\nHe concluded with an audible sigh that he and others will have to keep explaining themselves to whites, often having the same exhausting conversation over and over, one person at a time, because this is a primary way that African-Americans will make progress.\n\nTisby affirmed that his identity as a Christian supercedes his racial identity. And it’s this very belief that holds so much promise to many for racial reconciliation. It’s why black and white Christians have long held out hope of showing the way forward on race. Their faith teaches, in passages like the third chapter of Galatians, that all people are guilty of sin, but are adopted into one family through Christ’s salvific life, death and resurrection.\n\nBut after emphasizing this spiritual side of the coin for many years, Tisby does not want to allow Christian doctrine to be used as an excuse to gloss over the hard conversations around race that need to be had. “My tone has shifted, not to be disrespectful, but not to let people off the hook,” he said.\n\n“We know these things. This knowledge is available. It’s always been there,” Tisby said. “And it’s willful ignorance, if not culpable ignorance, for us — particularly as Christians — not to know our history as a nation and a church when it comes to race, and not to respond appropriately.”\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:",
  "latent_10659": "At the end of this year, the targets set by the United Nations in 2000 for developing countries will expire. In this project, we take those eight Millennium Development Goals and examine how some communities in the United States measure up. We have applied each goal to the U.S. by looking at an indicator used to measure a country’s development success and interpreting it for a specific community in America. The eight goals are: eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve universal primary education, promote gender equality and empower women, reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS and other diseases, ensure environmental sustainability, and develop a global partnership for development. An indicator for the first goal — eradicating extreme poverty and hunger — is the proportion of the population below the minimum level of dietary energy consumption. In this piece, we look at the health consequences of a lack of access to fresh food in Navajo Nation.\n\nSteven Thompson grew up poor on Navajo Nation. After nearly three decades on a diet built around potatoes, lunch meat and canned goods, he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes; his right leg was amputated as a result of complications from the disease eight years ago.\n\nNow, at the age of 54, Thompson tries to stay active and eat the food his doctor recommends to prevent further complications from the disease, but it's not easy: the closest grocery store is 32 miles away and he has chronic pain.\n\n“It’s really hurting, but you don’t to heal no more, you know, and then your whole leg aches like your leg’s still there … They gave me this [medicine] to try to help it, but it don’t really help me,” he said.\n\nThe nearly 300,000 residents of the Navajo Nation — an area roughly the size of South Carolina — are served by only 10 grocery stores. Gas stations and trading posts fill the vast spaces in between those stores, selling foods loaded with salt, sugar, fat and preservatives. According to the Diné Community Advocacy Alliance, a Navajo think tank, 80 percent of food sold in the Navajo Nation could be considered junk. One in three residents is diabetic or prediabetic, and recent studies show that heart disease is the second-leading cause of death among tribal citizens living on the reservation.",
  "latent_10708": "This week my favourite particle is the electron (one of the best things about working in particle physics is that it accommodates my fickle heart and mood swings perfectly)\n\nElectrons occupy every atom in the universe. There is one in the hydrogen atom, two in the helium atom, three in lithium and so on. The electron content of an atom completely governs how likely it is to form a bond with another atom, making a molecule.\n\nSo an electron has great power really, but only a very tiny mass. The hydrogen atom's other occupant, the proton, has a mass nearly 2000 times bigger. All of the atom's mass comes from its nucleus, but all of its size comes from the fact that the electron refuses to get too close to the proton. Most of the atom is empty space. Vacuum.\n\nAlso the mass of the proton is pretty contrived: it comes from the various constituent particles (quarks and gluons) but actually almost all of it comes from virtual particles popping in and out of the vacuum within it. In contrast, the mass of the electron is a constant of nature. We have no idea why it has a mass of 9.11x10-31kg. Some of us think it might have mass because it interacts with the Higgs field, but as far as I'm aware nobody has anything solid to say on why it has this particular mass.\n\nElectrons also have a property called spin. The spin of all electrons is +/- 1/2. What this means is that if you were an electron the world would not look the same if you spun around once. We are spin 1: we have to turn around 360 degrees to get the same view. Electrons have to turn 720 degrees, as if on some terrible acid trip*. All particles that have this strange property of \"spin 1/2\" are known as fermions. They are named after the wonderful Enrico Fermi.\n\nEnrico Fermi. Legend.\n\nIf you know about particle physics you might be thinking that none of these things is really an argument for electrons being special. It is true that being present in every atom, having an unexplained bare mass and having spin of 1/2 are also equally true of the two lightest quarks, 'up' and 'down'. The up and down quarks are certainly just as much a part of our world as electrons are; in fact every bit of matter in the universe, from a strawberry, to your left hand, to the atmosphere of Jupiter, is basically made up of just these three particles; up quark, down quark and electron. Every other fermion is unstable (well, not the neutrinos, but they have other 'issues').\n\nAlso, there is a particle even more strikingly similar to the electron: the positron. A positron behaves exactly like an electron in every way that our imaginations and utilisation of opposable thumbs has allowed us to measure; all except one. They have opposite charge. A positron is the 'charge reflection' of an electron. It is the electron's antiparticle. My only preference for the electron over the positron is that we live in world made of particles (matter) rather than anti-particles (anti-matter), but actually we could just as well live in an anti-matter anti-world with anti-people, we would notice no difference as far as I know. The only thing that matters is that we have more of one kind than of the other, which is a total mystery in itself. A mystery for another day.\n\nSo, I don't really know how to justify my love for the electron. Perhaps it is because an electron has no location.\n\nElectrons interact via the electromagnetic field, aka the photon. All the electrons in the universe and all the photons in the universe are talking to each other all the time. They are all connected, no matter how far apart, by the electromagnetic field, which has infinite range**. They can be thought of as little clouds which have a dense foggy core and then misty edges, but that would be wrong because there are no edges. The mistiness goes on for ever, overlapping with every other misty cloud everywhere in the universe.\n\nIf that's all a bit air-fairy for you, don't forget that electrons are really very useful. Okay, this is stating the bleeding obvious. I think most people who have experienced a power cut (or even their phone battery dying) are very much aware how heavily we depend on electricity. But our dependence on electricity goes even deeper than light-bulbs and Google. We are 'electric'. Our brain is able to control our body by sending electricity to the nerves, which then send more electricity to our muscles to make them move. Perhaps even more incredible is the electricity in our brain enables us to absorb and process vast amounts of information, then to put this information together in such a way that we can create. Works of art, inventions, love – all down to electricity.\n\n*A Higgs boson, incidentally, is spin zero ...\n\n** unlike the color*** field that deals with quarks, which has a finite range of just 10-15m.\n\n*** I haven't gone American. It's not the same as colour.",

The company plans to compile the information about online activity — what users are Googling, which sites they favor, and what products they click on — to sell higher-priced personalized advertisements.\n\nThe pricing strategy is an interesting new twist on advertising that pits AT&T against free Internet services like Google and Facebook, which also serve customized ads based on users online activities.\n\nBut AT&T’s model has alarmed privacy-rights advocates because the Internet Preferences program monitors all online activity — not just activity on a search engine or social network.\n\n“The idea that your Internet service provider is going to be spying on the contents of your traffic, even in an automated way, is very disconcerting,” said Jeremy Gillula, staff technologist with the San Francisco digital-rights organization Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\n“What if data about your browsing history gets out?” he said. “What if there’s a data breach?”\n\nGigaPower relies on fiber-optic cables, thin strands of glass that carry data at faster speeds than older copper-wire networks. AT&T is adding this higher level of service to its selection of U-verse Internet, TV and voice services (all three cost $180 a month for those willing to part with their data, and $209 a month for those gun-shy about their browser history).\n\nAT&T hopes to court customers who have a need for speed such as online gamers and those who use video-chat services such as Skype.\n\nAT&T is also racing against fiber-optic competitors such as Google to roll out GigaPower, which is now in six markets in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, with plans to expand to 10 other markets in the coming months.\n\nThe company last week touted that it has invested more than $2.2 billion in the last three years on its network in just the Bay Area.\n\nAt a news conference, Cupertino Mayor Rod Sinks said he is proud his city became the first community west of Kansas City to have GigaPower, putting it on par with other high-speed cities like Seoul and Stockholm.\n\n“If you think about remote learning, if you think about tele-medicine, if you think about entertainment, a faster Internet is essential to being competitive in the future,” Sinks said.\n\nCupertino streamlined its permit process to hasten installation of GigaPower equipment. AT&T installed equipment that could reach thousands of homes in the city, but only began taking orders for the service Monday morning and had yet to sign up any local customers. AT&T executives would not say which area cities are next in line.\n\nWith GigaPower, AT&T can monitor traffic to determine what type of specific ads to serve individual customers, and then charge advertisers to reach those customers.\n\nFor example, if a customer browses a car dealership site, AT&T would know to pop an auto manufacturer’s ad onto their screens — an arrangement that could prove lucrative for AT&T.\n\nTerry Stenzel, AT&T’s Northern California vice president and general manager, said the company can use those ads to help keep down the price of its service. He also said that all browsing data are kept in-house and that AT&T will not sell customers’ information, including credit card information, to any third-party company.\n\n“I love the fact that if I’m going to go online and use different sites that AT&T knows what I’m doing and can save me money by sending me coupons and making recommendations based on what I have done in the past,” he said.\n\nDan Marcec, spokesman for online advertising research firm eMarketer, said customers might not have a problem trading their privacy for discounts and coupons.\n\nPeople “generally don’t have issues with advertising that they feel like they’ve raised their hands to receive,” he said.\n\nBut “$29 a month to opt out of advertising is a big ask, especially if this product is already priced at a premium,” he said.\n\nAnd only the heaviest Internet users are likely to notice the speed boost enough to switch, he said.\n\nThe move to monetize privacy comes after Internet service providers such as AT&T lost their fight for the ability to charge Internet users or sites for access to an online fast lane — challenging a principle known as net neutrality. Charging for privacy could be a new frontier for Internet service providers.\n\nGillula said the Internet Preferences program does not appear to violate the Federal Commmunications Commission’s net neutrality rules because customers must agree to opt in to the program. “And if a customer agrees to it, they (AT&T) can pretty much do anything they want,” he said.\n\nBut he warned potential GigaPower customers to read all of the fine print to become “aware of what they’re giving up.”\n\n“It really is trade your privacy or pay more,” he said.\n\nBenny Evangelista is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

  "latent_10821": "Nick Clegg believes the Brexit campaign was “the biggest con trick in politics” - but is the ongoing fallout from the EU referendum winning back voters to the Lib Dems? Chris Burn joins him on the campaign trail in Sheffield.\n\nJust two years ago, an emotional Nick Clegg made what now seems a highly-prescient resignation speech as he stood down as Liberal Democrat leader after a crushing general election defeat where the junior partner in the coalition Government lost 49 of their 57 MPs.\n\nNick Clegg is inspired by the success of new French president-elect Emmanuel Macron, (AP Photo/Francois Mori, Pool)\n\n“One thing seems to me is clear: liberalism, here, as well as across Europe, is not faring well against the politics of fear,” Clegg said.\n\n“Years of remorseless economic and social hardship following the crash in 2008 and the grinding insecurities of globalisation have led for people to reach to new certainties: the politics of identity, of nationalism, of Us versus Them is now on the rise.\n\n“Fear and grievance have won, liberalism has lost. But it is more precious than ever and we must keep fighting for it.”\n\nFast-forward 24 months and the liberal values he mentioned seem to be in even greater retreat in the age of Brexit and President Donald Trump. But despite the country seemingly preparing to hand the Conservatives a landslide majority and the Liberal Democrats losing seats in last week’s local elections, Clegg believes there are signs of optimism for a liberal revival both here and abroad.\n\nSpeaking the day before Emmanuel Macron - a man Clegg has met and describes as “a Liberal to his fingertips” - was elected French president with a resounding victory, the former deputy prime minister said he believes the need for liberalism to fight for its future is giving it “a clearer and stronger voice” across the world.\n\nIronically enough, fresh hope for the Liberal Democrats in this country has come in the form of something they fundamentally oppose - Brexit.\n\nWhile Clegg did manage to cling on to his Sheffield Hallam seat in the 2015 election, he saw his majority cut from more than 15,000 to just over 2,000 in a bitterly-fought contest with Labour. Clegg admits that some voters in Sheffield two years ago were “very unhappy” and “wanted to give me a piece of their mind” over the decisions made by the coalition Government but says things have changed this time around.\n\nAs Clegg canvassed potential voters in the constituency where he is hoping to re-elected once again, he said the reaction on the doorstep from voters in Sheffield is “utterly different” to the 2015 campaign, with Brexit acting as a “Year Zero moment” resetting the clock on the way many people view the nation’s political parties.\n\nAnd while reaction on the doorstep in the genteel village of Worrall to the north of Sheffield was far from unanimous - one young activist gets a brusque ‘No, thanks’ and a door closed in his face when he says he is out campaigning with Clegg - it was notable how the former Liberal Democrat leader is largely well-received when he asks residents for their support, greeted with handshakes and wishes of good luck.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have very deliberately positioned themselves as the party of “the 48 per cent” who voted Remain and Clegg says the stance is resounding on the doorstep.\n\n“Quite a lot of people quite understandably don’t see the world just through the Brexit prism. But people do see the connection between Brexit and bread and butter issues. People get the Government has admitted there is a large black hole in the finances because of Brexit which puts further pressure on hospitals and schools and social care. They are aware the fall in the pound means their summer holiday will be more expensive.\n\n“People think Brexit is going to be a lot more complex than they were told.”\n\nWhile the Liberal Democrats have been pushing the idea of another referendum once the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU are clear, Clegg accepts there is currently no great public appetite for another vote. But he believes that will change once the shape of the Brexit deal becomes clear and even rejects the idea it would be a “second referendum”.\n\n“It would be a first referendum of what Brexit actually means in practice - it is not asking anyone to change their minds on what they voted for the first time. Since we had no idea about what leaving really means in practice, it seems right to book-end the whole process so the British people can sign that process off.\n\n“The last election campaign was just 24 months ago. Things are moving so fast I think [that people not wanting another referendum] may change dramatically in the next 18 months.”\n\nHe also does not accept the argument that Remain supporters would have dismissed calls for a second vote should Britain have voted to stay in the EU.\n\n“If we had won 52-48, we wouldn’t have then pursued a hard Brexit, taking us into the eurozone, into a European army, into the Schengen zone. They have taken a very narrow victory in the most uncompromising and damaging way possible.”\n\nClegg, who worked in the European Commission and was in the European Parliament before becoming an MP, insists he is “not some European fantatic” but does not shy away from his passionate belief that Brexit is a mistake for the nation.\n\nHis views on those involved in campaigning for Leave, who he believes “sold Brexit on a completely false prospectus and should be held to account”, are even more withering. Clegg highlights claims that quitting the EU would free up £350m per week for the NHS, provide a quick solution to immigration issues and allow the UK to easily negotiate trade deals with countries outside the EU as examples of where he feels the public was misled.\n\n“I feel nothing but contempt for people like Farage, Gove and Johnson and the lies they spread,” he says.\n\n“I have nothing but respect for those who voted for Brexit, I have no dispute with that at all. But I’m angry at the Brexit leadership. It is the biggest con trick in modern British politics. I was accused of not doing what I said. The colossal scale of the lies spread by the Leave campaign makes the claims that the Lib Dems misled the public over tuition fees pale in comparison’.\n\n“Pulling the wool over the people’s eyes about every aspect of Britain’s future as the leading Brexiteers did is infinitely worse than the painful compromise we made on one policy as part of the Coalition Government at a time when there was no money.”\n\nDespite their punishment at the ballot box in 2015 - partly influenced by the infamous U-turn over university tuition fees - Clegg insists he does not regret the party’s time in Government.\n\n“I have regrets about individual decisions but I’m incredibly proud of what we managed to do. We managed to provide stable, sound, moderate Government for half-a-decade when governments in Europe were toppling like nine-pins and the country was recovering from the devastating economic heart attack of 2008. Anyone in Government was to be in Government when people’s real incomes were being hit, created by a financial crisis which preceded us.\n\n“It was an unforgiving outcome for the Lib Dems. It was a Government that broadly speaking was doing the right things for the country as a whole. We put country before party.”\n\nBut even for an optimist like Clegg, the much-vaunted “Lib Dem fightback” that the party has been promoting can be generously described as a work in progress. When asked what would constitute success in this election, he says the party hope to achieve “somewhere between what we have now and the number of seats in 2015”.\n\nVoters will soon deliver their verdict on whether the tide really has turned for the Lib Dems.\n\n‘I never thought of walking away’\n\nNick Clegg says he was determined to remain in politics after the 2015 General Election despite his party being almost wiped out in Parliament.\n\nWhile some expected him to leave politics after quitting as Lib Dem leader, he says he never seriously considered it.\n\n“I definitely wanted to stick around to do my bit to get us up off the canvass, I didn’t want to flee for the hills. I felt a sense of duty that I should stick around.”\n\nHe said while he was unsure of whether he would have stayed in frontline politics after 2020 had the next General Election been held then as was originally planned, Theresa May’s decision to call a snap election has left him determined to fight out and win re-election in Sheffield Hallam once again.",
  "latent_10899": "Mike Pence Announces Major Policy Change That Iraqi Christians Have Been Begging For\n\nEmail Print Whatsapp Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin\n\nWASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence promised Christian leaders from the Middle East Wednesday night that their days of receiving little to no help from the United States government to rebuild their ancient communities \"are over.\"\n\nWhile giving the keynote address at an annual solidarity dinner sponsored by the international advocacy organization In Defense of Christians, Pence announced that President Donald Trump has ordered the State Department to enable U.S. aid funding to go directly to faith-based organizations actively supporting Christians and other religious minorities displaced by the Islamic State.\n\nThe announcement comes as human rights advocates have urged the administration to make a change to a previous policy that required all U.S. humanitarian and reconstruction aid funding for Iraq to be funnelled through the United Nations. However, displaced Christians and other religious minorities have not received much help to rebuild their destroyed ancient communities even though the U.S. has given more than $1 billion in humanitarian aid and hundreds of millions in reconstruction aid.\n\n\"Our fellow Christians and all who are persecuted in the Middle East should not have to rely on multinational institutions when America can help them directly,\" Pence assured. \"And tonight, it is my privilege to announce that President Trump has ordered the State Department to stop funding ineffective relief efforts at the United Nations. And from this day forward, America will provide support directly to persecuted communities through [the United States Aid Agency.]\"\n\nPence's announcement was met with a 25-second applause.\n\n\"We will no longer rely on the United Nations alone to assist persecuted Christians and minorities in the wake of genocide and the atrocities of terrorist groups,\" he added. \"The United States will work hand-in-hand from this day forward with faith-based groups and private organizations to help those who are persecuted.\"\n\nPence slammed the U.N. for too often failing \"to help the most vulnerable communities\" and leaving \"countless people [to] continue to suffer and struggle needlessly.\"\n\n\"Here is the sad reality,\" Pence explained. \"The United Nations claims that more than 160 projects are in Christian areas. But for a third of those projects, there are no Christians to help. The believers in Nineveh Iraq have had less than 2 percent of their housing needs addressed and the majority of Christians and Yazidis remain in shelters. Projects that are supposedly marked finished have little more than a U.N. flag hung outside an unusable building, in many cases a school.\"\n\n\"While faith-based groups with proven track records and deep roots in these communities are more than willing to assist, the United Nations too often denies their funding requests,\" the vice president added. \"My friends, those days are over.\"\n\nDuring Pence's speech, his official vice president Twitter account posted about the policy change.\n\n\"As we begin to see the tides of terror recede, I can assure you that President Trump is committed to help persecuted peoples reclaim their lands, return to their homes, rebuild their lives and replant the roots in their ancient place of birth,\" Pence continued.\n\nPence also announced in his speech that the president has asked him to visit the Middle East in December. Pence will travel to Israel and Egypt.\n\n\"I promise you that one of the messages that I will bring to leaders across the region is that now is the time to bring an end to the persecution of Christians and all religious minorities,\" Pence said.\n\nPence also assured that the Trump administration is calling the acts committed by ISIS against the religious minority communities in Iraq and Syria for what they truly are — \"genocide.\"\n\n\"They are genocide and they are crimes against humanity and we will call them what they are,\" he stressed.\n\nCarl Anderson, supreme knight of the Knights of Columbus who introduced Pence at the event, celebrated the Trump administration's actions, noting: \"A year ago, the U.S. used the right word to describe what was happening to Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East. That word was genocide. Tonight, those words were put into action.\n\n\"For almost two years, the K of C has warned that Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East have been falling through the cracks in the aid system, and has been urging the U.S. government to provide aid directly to genocide-targeted communities. We are pleased that the administration has promised to do just that,\" said Anderson, who also serves as vice president of the Washington session of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family.\n\n\"The hope this announcement will give to Christians in the Middle East — and the real world impact it will have on the survival of threatened minority communities — cannot be underestimated,\" he added.\n\nFrank Wolf, distinguished senior fellow at the 21<sup>st Century Wilberforce Initiative who recently returned from Iraq and has since testified before both the House and the Senate about the dire situation, said the Trump administration's policy change \"should impact humanitarian aid for those living as Internally Displaced Persons and refugees and stabilization assistance for the Christians and Yezidis returning to areas seized from them by ISIS.\"\n\nThe 21<sup>st Century Wilberforce Initiative released a report in August containing recommendations regarding northern Iraq where the Christian population has dwindled from 1.5 million in 2003 to just 250,000 today.",
  "latent_11215": "- A mother wrestled her own daughter from the arms of a would-be kidnapper inside a Citrus County Dollar General Store Tuesday morning, moments before an off-duty deputy arrested the fleeing suspect at gunpoint.\n\nIt all started just before noon at the Dollar General in Hernando. Deputies said a man -- whom they later identified as Craig Bonello -- tried to snatch a 13-year-old girl who was shopping with her mother.\n\nSurveillance video released to deputies by the store shows he tried to run towards the exit with the girl in his arms, but the teen's mother caught up and a \"tug of war\" ensued.\n\nBonello, 30, finally let go of the girl and ran out the front door just as an off-duty deputy was getting out of his patrol car to enter the store. The store manager yelled to Deputy Jonathan Behnen, who pulled his car around to block Bonello in the parking lot.\n\nDeputy Behnen pulled out his service weapon and ordered Bonello from his car. Bonello hesitated, but complied and was taken into custody.\n\n\"In my 10 years on the road I have never seen anything like this,\" Sgt. Craig Callahan said at the scene. \"He truly intended to abduct this child right in front of everyone in the store.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office said deputies have arrested Bonello several times before, most recently in February for trespassing. His other charges were misdemeanors, except for an aggravated battery on a law enforcement officer back in 2009. He is not a registered sex offender.\n\nWATCH: Mom stops man trying to abduct teen in Dollar General\n\nHe now faces charges of kidnapping and child abuse.\n\n\"We are very fortunate our deputy was there as quickly as he was. We are very fortunate that the mother had that motherly instinct and did what she did.\" Sgt. Callahan said. \"She may have saved her daughter's life today. I don't exactly know a motive, but I know it wasn't a good one.\"\n\nDeputies said the mother and her daughter were uninjured, although both very rattled. The victim is being offered counseling services.\n\n\"Behnen is a bona fide hero today,\" said Capt. Ricky Grant, who was also on scene. \"If it weren't for him, this guy would have gotten away.\"",
  "latent_11405": "Drew Scanlon is a former Giant Bomb video producer and current proprietor of video thing Cloth Map. He is also an Internet sensation that’s sweeping the nation’s grandmas’ Facebook accounts.\n\nWell HELLO, friends! Nice to see you all once again! This year has been pretty wild for me, but thankfully I’ve been able to take a few dips into 2017’s pool of particularly good video games. I spent a fair amount of time this year on planes, so that may have something to do with this list being pretty mobile-heavy, but that aside, I still wish I could play everything on the Switch. That thing is great! Anyway, here are some games:\n\nI loved the original SteamWorld Dig for how laid-back it was, but fell off once I got my fill of the simple loop of digging and upgrading. Dig 2 keeps the lackadaisical nature of the series but has more going on like crafting and a simple quest system that extended the time I spent with it. I eventually got stuck and haven’t gone back to it, but I think the game is symbolic of the kinds of games I want to be playing these days: low-impact, low barrier to entry, low-stress. If you’re looking for that, SteamWorld Dig 2 has it… in spades.\n\nI am a casual Destiny 2 player, as I was with the first Destiny. In neither have I gotten to the end-game content, and that’s just fine with me. Destiny 2 is the game I chill out in, without really caring about advancing the story. All I want to do is put crosshairs on aliens and make them blow up, and Destiny 2 is the perfect game for that.\n\nI’ve played a few PUBG matches, but mostly I like to admire the game from afar. It’s just so TENSE, a testament to the game’s phenomenal design. It makes sense that the design speaks to me after hearing Mr. UNKNOWN on Giant Bomb’s E3 show talking about how the game was partially influenced by one of my favorite games of all time, America’s Army. All the hallmarks of the game I played almost nightly in high school are there: a suite of movement controls for every occasion; powerful, tactical weapons; limited health; engaging wide-open and close-quarters combat; and an endless supply of tense moments. It’s not every day a game comes along where every match is a toss-up between a humiliating defeat or one of your greatest gaming stories of all time.\n\nI have lamented the lack of a good golf game for years. And when I say “good,” I mean “like I played when I was a kid.” My gold standard is PGA Tour Golf for the Sega Genesis, an unassailable classic. Golf Story is different in basically every respect except the one that matters: the golfing. The three-tap system needs no improvement. Golf Story knows this and leaves it alone, merely adding additional functionality without detracting from its holy purity. The thing about golf games, though, is that they can get tedious. Eighteen holes is a lot of holes. Golf Story, true to its name, creates plenty of other things for you to do in your mostly linear quest to become a golf champ. You’ll impress cavemen by hitting from every kind of surface, you’ll learn unique course quirks like the ability to bounce your ball off turtles in the water, you’ll microwave food. These tasks are not only well-written and funny, they also teach you to be better at the sport of gods.\n\nI often find open-world games to be intimidating, given their size and the daunting number of things to complete. But Horizon’s beautiful, well-realized world had plenty of mystery to keep me going. Additionally, the slate of abilities is wide enough to allow for a good range of play styles. I could be stealthy when I wanted to, but also felt confident in high-action scenarios when the need arose. I jumped back into the game for a few hours before writing this, just to see if it was possible or if I had forgotten everything. I’m pleased to say that it wasn’t so bad, especially after I turned the difficulty down to “Story,” its lowest setting ;D\n\nPyre is a game made by craftsmen. And each craft--writing, design, art, music, voice work, sound effects--is held to the same high standard. Everything in Pyre feels lovingly handmade, making the game a joy to play. While I initially found the transitions from the story sequences to the “game” parts somewhat jarring, I quickly fell into a rhythm of eagerly anticipating whichever was coming next. I never felt like I was very good at the game, but that just added to the excitement when I would inevitably win at the last possible moment.\n\nFor decades, I and others stood by, watching the gleaming silver name of Sonic tarnish in the toxic air of time. We kept silent as the atrocities spawned; PRETENDERS, merely bearing the likeness of Sonic, not the soul. Not the blistering speed, not the pixel-perfect controls, not the sprawling, branching levels with nigh-infinite replayability. Just abomination after abomination, thrust upon us that we might submit and lose faith.\n\nNO LONGER.\n\nThe standard has been raised aloft! A trailing blue banner snaps in the wind! HERE, friends, is the reclamation! What we have always known in our heart of hearts is now, finally, laid bare for all to see: Sonic is good. Sonic always was good. SONIC WILL ALWAYS BE GOOD.\n\nSuper Mario 64 was the last Mario game I truly loved, and to have what is effectively a sequel to that game fills my heart with joy. Astonishingly, Odyssey lives up to it, too. The game even improves on its predecessor in a number of ways, mainly by streamlining star/moon acquisition, without losing the core fun of navigating weird 3D landscapes and solving their puzzles. The only thing I found lacking (or perhaps just different) about Odyssey was the density of the levels. I felt like I was blowing through them, rather than learning them intimately as in Mario 64. But if I’m honest with myself, I’m not sure I would have the patience for that these days. Odyssey, it seems, has grown up with me, but still makes me feel like a little kid.\n\nWith Breath of the Wild, it feels like Nintendo’s designers have ascended to some other level, delivering a remarkably fresh take on an impacted genre. “Stand back,” they say. “We’ll take it from here.” My principal issue with open-world games is one of motivation. My compulsion to complete the always-urgent mainline story quest is so often at odds with the promise of exploring an open-ended world at my leisure that I tend to get frustrated quickly. Breath of the Wild provides a brilliant solution: a clearly defined end goal, but only a vague route to get there. This encourages the player to explore the world and accomplish what they see as the most pressing issue, creating, in effect, their own quest line. Couple that with an incredibly rich sandbox of a world, ripe for experimentation and accidental discovery, and you have a truly special game.\n\nOkay, TECHNICALLY Solitairica didn’t come out this year (I actually learned of it from Rich Gallup’s 2016 Game of the Year list), but I’m including it for two reasons: 1) DLC for the game was released this year, which I think counts for something, and 2) it is, by far, the game I played the most in 2017.\n\nWhen I tell people about the game, they initially regard it with wariness, fearing it’s yet another slow, mindless solitaire game. This is not the case. Yes, there are cards, but that’s about where the similarities end. In reality it’s more of a turn-based roguelike. The game is easy to learn, but requires careful strategic attention to excel in the more difficult encounters. It’s also got a perfect balance of per-run and persistent progression that keeps you playing but won’t frustrate you when you lose. No microtransactions, either. It is, in my opinion, the perfect mobile game.",
  "latent_11603": "Russia's Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin The Russian central bank is encouraging the country's ailing banks to accept losses on foreign currency mortgages in a bid to stop ruble falls from further weakening the sector.\n\nIn a letter to banks dated January 23 the Bank of Russia wrote (emphasis added):\n\n\"Due to the increased levels of credit and currency risks in financial markets, the Bank of Russia recommends credit institutions consider restructuring mortgage loans (including fines and penalties) to individuals in foreign currencies, including the conversion of these loans into Russian rubles.\"\n\nMost interestingly, the central bank recommends that the banks do not use current foreign exchange rates but instead \"use the official exchange rate of foreign currency...as determined by the Bank of Russia as of 10.01.2014\".\n\nWith the ruble relatively stable in recent years the appeal of lower interest rates that came with foreign-currency loans had increased for Russian borrowers. The collapse in the value of Russia's currency over recent months, however, has sent the cost of those debts soaring in ruble terms.\n\nIn October last year the exchange rate was 39 rubles to the dollar and 50 rubles to the euro, but the collapse in global oil prices and Western sanctions over Russia's role in the Ukraine crisis have meant that today the equivalent rates are 67.8 rubles to the dollar and 77 rubles to the euro.\n\nConverting the loans into rubles at October 2014 rates would effectively mean taking mark-to-market losses of over 40% — but that might be seen as preferable to even larger losses in the case of Russian borrowers defaulting on their obligations. In effect, the central bank is asking Russian banks to impose losses now rather than allowing the situation to gradually deteriorate.\n\nAs Standard & Poor's ratings agency explained of its decision to downgrade Russia's sovereign debt rating to junk earlier this week:\n\nS&P on Russia. Standard & Poor's\n\nIn recent weeks the central bank has moved to make it easier for financial firms to swap loans on their books for cash. In December the central bank announced that banks would no longer have to mark their assets to market and could use the average exchange rate from the previous quarter to assess how much foreign capital they require to cover foreign-currency denominated debt repayments. In essence, the central bank is allowing the banking sector to indulge in a bit of balance sheet fiction during a time of stress.\n\nBank of Russia emergency measures for Russian companies. Bank of Russia\n\nThese measures come on the back of large scale bank recapitalisations by the state. Last month the government was forced to inject $2.4 billion into financial institutions, including state-owned lenders VTB and Gazprombank. That bill is expected to rise with analysts suggesting that bailouts could cost the government a further $40 billion this year.",
  "latent_11702": "The move will combine Kmart, one of the original discounters -- whose \"Blue Light Specials\" and \"Attention Kmart shoppers\" announcements are embedded in the American lexicon -- with Sears, a middlebrow department store that blazed a mercantile trail across the country starting in the 19th century but has been on the wane for the last 40 years.\n\nWhether the two retailers can be winningly put together is uncertain, and the ultimate strategy has not been fully spelled out. The goal is less to compete with Wal-Mart directly and more to focus on profitable opportunities in selected markets.\n\nIts success, analysts said, will largely depend on whether the new company can achieve cost savings through economies of scale, and whether it can bring itself up to speed with technology that has been so beneficial to Wal-Mart and Target.\n\nIt also hinges on the new company's finding a strong identity -- one that will persuade shoppers to come to its stores. Customer traffic and sales have been sluggish at both Kmart and Sears.\n\n\"This is going to be an enormous undertaking,\" said Mr. Lampert, who is Kmart's chairman and will become chairman of the new company, to be called Sears Holdings. \"We're really not looking to have two separate cultures. We're hoping to blend these into one great culture.\"\n\nWhenever the deal receives regulatory approval, Mr. Lampert is sure to dominate the new company, with Kmart having seven board seats and Kmart's newly minted chief executive, Aylwin B. Lewis, running both retailers. Sears will name three directors, including its current chief executive, Alan J. Lacy.\n\nThough Kmart's team will control the finances, the Sears name is expected to be front and center for consumers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nExpressing faith in Mr. Lambert's track record of squeezing profit from poorly managed companies, Wall Street cheered the news yesterday. The share price of Kmart rose nearly $8, to close at $109. Sears, Roebuck jumped $7.79, or more than 17 percent, to $52.99.\n\nUnder the deal's terms, Kmart shareholders will receive one share of Sears Holdings for every Kmart share they own; Sears stockholders will have a choice of $50 in cash or half a share of the new company.\n\nSears employees learned of the announcement through an e-mail message sent early yesterday, and many watched a Webcast featuring Mr. Lacy, Mr. Lambert and Mr. Lewis addressing a Midtown Manhattan news conference.\n\nMr. Lacy, the chief executive of Sears who will become vice chairman of the new company, said the deal would add impetus to his existing strategy of opening more Sears stores outside shopping malls, where nearly all Sears's 870 stores are situated.\n\nA number of stores are likely to be sold, Mr. Lacy said.\n\nWhile insiders said discussions between the companies had been under way for months, the deal was put together in a rush over the last couple of weeks.\n\nMr. Lampert said his goal was to make all the stores in the combined empire profitable. \"I don't think any retailer should aspire to have its real estate be worth more than its operating business,\" he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Both of these companies are faltering, and if you take a look at the size of the new company, it's still only 20 percent of Wal-Mart in terms of sales.\"\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe sale of Sears also appears to spell opportunity for Martha Stewart's company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, which sells a line of products exclusively through Kmart in the United States. In a statement, its new chief executive, Susan Lyne, said the merger \"will create for us a broader retail presence that reaches millions of new consumers.\" Its stock rose $1.09, to $18.49.\n\nMr. Lampert, an often maverick investor from Greenwich, Conn., bought up chunks of Kmart debt while it was operating under bankruptcy protection two years ago. With an investment estimated at $700 million to $1 billion, he won control of the emerging company, and pushed it to close stores and make other strategic changes during and after its reorganization.\n\nAll the while, he has remained a large stakeholder in Sears, which has been struggling to reinvent itself while larger and more nimble chains, including Wal-Mart, Target, Home Depot and Lowe's, spirited away once-loyal Sears customers with better merchandise, better prices or both.\n\nSears began in 1886 as a watch dealer, progressed to mail-order merchant and by 1925 opened its first stores, becoming the nation's dominant retailer before World War II.\n\nBut by the 1970's its retail fortunes were in decline, and with the hope of diversifying, it adopted a \"socks and stocks\" strategy, entering the financial services business in 1981 with its purchases of Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker. Twelve years later, it sold or spun them both off, along with a mortgage division.\n\nSears sought more buyers for its refrigerators, stoves and other appliances with the help of its credit division, which was started at the depths of the Depression. But after higher-than-expected defaults by cardholders in recent years hurt earnings, it sold the unit to Citigroup last year.\n\nSears is seeking to attract a fresh clientele to its stores by designing new formats and adding to its selling floors brands like Lands' End, the mail-order clothing company it bought in 2002 for $1.9 billion.\n\nIt is not clear whether Mr. Lampert lost patience with Mr. Lacy's efforts to turn around Sears and decided to force a strategy of his own on the company. But it is clear that as Sears ploddingly created its freestanding \"Sears Grand\" prototype stores, opening the first outside Salt Lake City a year ago and since adding three more, competitors like Wal-Mart, Target and Lowe's were opening stores far faster. Wal-Mart held 300 ribbon cuttings last year and has announced plans for as many as 500 in the coming year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKmart and its predecessors also have a long history, starting in 1899 as the five-and-dime S.S. Kresge. It took an early lead in discount retailing after it opened the first Kmart stores in 1962. But by the 1980's, the renamed Kmart had lost ground to Wal-Mart, which emerged from small-town roots to consistently offer lower prices, more products in stock and a more efficient supply network.\n\nKmart fell from its perch as the biggest discounter and became better known for corporate bumbling than for anything it sold; by the 1990s, customers who found its ad circulars in their Sunday papers often expected not to find the featured items in the stores.\n\nIn autumn 2001, Kmart's chief executive embarked on a plan to sell thousands of products at prices that undercut Wal-Mart's. The strategy was widely seen as worsening Kmart's financial woes, and by January 2002, it had filed for bankruptcy protection, the biggest retail bankruptcy in American history.\n\nCombined, the two companies are expected to save money on back-office operations and purchasing, experts said. Executives forecast $200 million in savings from cross-selling merchandise and converting some Kmarts to Sears stores, along with $300 million in savings from tighter purchasing and a streamlined supply chain. But to survive as retailers over the long haul, they will need to find a successful sales formula.\n\nPeter J. Solomon, an investment banker who advised Lands' End during its sale to Sears and owns a minority stake in Mr. Lampert's company, ESL Partners, said: \"If you eliminate $500 million of overhead, you can create very valuable earnings and cash flow without ever changing the merchandising. I would say that Eddie has done that to a great extent at Kmart.\"",

  "latent_11754": "Jack Eichel isn’t concerned with being the next great American hockey hope.\n\nHe’s not particularly concerned about being the No. 1 pick in the 2015 NHL Draft, or Connor McDavid, or anything else he has been associated with of late.\n\n“What can’t get lost in all this is that he just turned 18. It’s like parenting,” said Boston University coach David Quinn of his prized freshman. “He’s still 18 years old, and he’s by no means the perfect player, but he wants to be, and that’s the key.”\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nEichel has been in the spotlight as the United States’ answer to McDavid and the probable No. 2 pick in the upcoming selection process. But he’s by no means a polished robot, as seems to happen with players in any sport who have been doing interviews since their mid-teens.\n\nHe has thoughts and opinions – on his schoolwork, college hockey vs. junior hockey, and why a Northeasterner would ever want to play hockey for Arizona State. And all the answers don’t seem contrived. Eichel generally feels what he says … or at least that’s how it seems.\n\nWe caught Eichel via phone on a Thursday afternoon, in the middle of Finals at Boston University, and a couple of weeks before World Juniors to chat about the aforementioned topics and a few others. Enjoy…\n\nQ: What is your finals schedule and how does that jibe with your world juniors schedule?\n\nEICHEL: I’m not the first guy from BU to be going to the world juniors at this time. I have two finals I did on my own. I had a take-home final and an essay that was due last Friday, and then I had to make a proposal yesterday morning. I’m only missing one final, which is next Wednesday, because I have one early Monday morning. So I'll be able to take that final and finish the class...\n\nStory continues\n\nIt hasn’t really been a problem. The teachers have all been really good.\n\nWhat was your proposal on?\n\nIt’s a rhetoric class, argumentative thinking. My proposal was basically how libraries are becoming outdated and more people are using online resources, and I was just making proposals about what we can do to change the library to make it more of a favorite destination for students, and just get more people using it as it once was.\n\nArgumentative thinking? You couldn’t be like, ‘I should be the top pick in the NHL draft and here is why?’\n\nNo, the professor decides the topics.\n\nWhat is the final after the world juniors?\n\nI have a social science final in January.\n\nAre you going to do any studying at the world juniors?\n\nNo, I will not be doing any studying. I will be 100-percent focused on helping our team win. I’ll take care of that final when I come back to Boston.\n\nWhat is your favorite class?\n\nI take a history of Western Civilization class. I wouldn’t say the class itself is super interesting, but I like the way the teacher teaches it. It’s not too difficult, he’s a pretty good guy. But the social science class isn’t bad either. It’s a lot of useful stuff.\n\nWhat do you learn in Western Civ?\n\nRenaissance, a lot of religious things. The teacher moves pretty quickly.\n\nYou’ve probably seen or heard of a lot of these places because you’re so well-traveled because of hockey, no?\n\nA lot of times we’re talking about Rome and Italy. If you start talking about Finland and Sweden I would know a lot more, but some of the places he talks about I haven’t been to.\n\nWhy the NCAA route? What about college enticed you? It had to be more than just taking classes?\n\nI grew up in Boston and watching Hockey East and the Beanpot, so it was always my dream to play at a school like BC or BU. I never dreamed of going to Quebec and playing for a team there, so I guess that’s first and foremost is this is my dream to go here. And then looking at the pros, a lot of people say it’s a disadvantage that I’m not playing as many games.\n\nBut I can look at it as an advantage of I’m spending more time in the weight room. There’s a lot more emphasis on each game. Everything is a lot more detailed if you’re playing 40 games in comparison to playing 80 to 100. That’s one thing. And I just thought the college game was better for me. I had played a few years of junior and I didn’t think another year of junior was the best route. I felt I needed to go challenge myself again against older, bigger and stronger competition, where it would challenge me night-in, night-out more than I believe the CHL would. I think on top of all that I was able to get the experience of going to college. Living in Boston. This is everything I’ve wanted, so it was kind of a no-brainer.\n\nHow do you stay patient on the ice, since you’re probably targeted pretty much every game?\n\nI think that’s pretty important – staying focused on what I want to do, and not letting people take me off my game, because if they’re taking me off my game they’re doing their job and I’m not doing mine. My job is to create offense for our team and help us win. If I’m getting mixed up in the extracurricular things on the ice, I’m not doing my job. But with that being said, I still have to protect myself and stand up for myself. If a guy is giving me a hard time, I don’t have a problem finishing a check or getting in somebody’s face. I don’t shy away from the physical play at all. I think that’s part of it and you need to do it.\n\nHave you ever felt the urge to fight?\n\nYeah, there’s definitely the urge sometimes to do something. But with it being college, obviously you can’t. Sometimes … I don’t think I’m looking to fight the other team’s fourth-line center. But … I think I like being more physical with their top guys, because that’s who I’m matched up against and I think that makes more of a statement. If I’m physical against them I’m doing my job because I’m shutting them down, and that’s what I try to do.\n\nWhen all is said and done, and before you go to bed at night, do you ever check the bottom of the standings?\n\nNo, I’ll be totally honest, I don’t. It’s so early in the season and so much can happen before the end of the year, so I don’t really check it too much. I don’t really care about what team I go to or what team is there. I would just be thrilled to get drafted in general.\n\nDo you feel being in the United States you’re not under as much of a microscope as Connor McDavid in Canada?\n\nI think I have plenty of pressure on myself playing in the U.S. I’ve gotten a lot of attention. I think there’s pressure on me every night to perform because if I don’t, I think people are pretty quick to jump all over me, but I think I try to do the same thing no matter when and who we’re playing against. But that being said, I think I’m the guy who puts the most pressure on anyone, I think I put the most pressure on myself.\n\nA few games ago, I was going through kind of a skid where I wasn’t getting the bounces and I wasn’t performing or producing as many points as I would have liked to early in the season, and I was talking to my dad after one of the games, and he was saying that I need to relax and stop putting pressure on myself because everything will take care of itself. The next night I just went out there and played and tried to move my feet and keep things simple, and I ended up having a successful night. It’s just keeping things simple, and not putting too much pressure on myself because at the end of the day, everything will probably take care of itself.\n\nArizona State recently announced they’re going to start a Division I college hockey team. Why would that be enticing to a college hockey player from the north to play in Arizona from a college hockey perspective?\n\nWhy would Arizona State be enticing?\n\nYeah.\n\nYou ever see the girls who go to that school? That might help.\n\n(Laughter)\n\nI’m serious … the have a lot of advantages with recruiting that a lot of other schools won’t. It’s a really nice climate and kids like to enjoy their social college life and Arizona has a really nice social life. For me, they don’t have the tradition, the history a place like BU or North Dakota would have. I’m sure they’ll do wonderful. I feel it could be tough to get kids to go to Arizona State who are wanting to a place like BC, BU or Michigan, who have all this tradition and rivalry. You’re carrying on a legacy of players who have played before you like Mike Eruzione or Jack O’Callahan or Chris Drury. You take a lot of pride in playing at BU. You’re representing something that means a lot more than you and your team. You’re carrying such a huge legacy. When you walk around BU’s rink and you see the posters of all the players who have played here.\n\nYou take a lot of pride in playing here, but I’m sure Arizona State will do everything in their power to get good players to go there and I’m sure will have a special program.\n\nIf the program existed during your recruitment, would you have taken a visit?\n\nI committed to BU pretty early, and I was committed to BU before I took an official visit. I took unofficials. But say they were around, and I was uncommitted, I’m sure I wouldn’t have minded heading out to Arizona for a weekend to take an official visit. I’m sure that wouldn’t have been too bad.\n\nMORE FROM YAHOO HOCKEY",
  "latent_12025": "Thohir: 'Inter follow US model'\n\nBy Football Italia staff\n\nErick Thohir is confident Inter will be back at the top by 2016 and he’ll revamp the organisation on the American model.\n\nThe new President was a guest on Italian TV show ‘Che tempo che fa’ this evening and gave a better idea of what his plans are for the club.\n\n“There are a lot of rumours on players, but what we’ll do with Inter is to construct a system. I don’t think it’s possible to make decisions on players by myself, as it means discussing it with the Coach and directors.\n\n“We want to form a team that can make the fans happy and it’s very important to see a team playing good football.\n\n“I met the squad with the Coach and meeting these superstars I’d seen on TV was surprising for me too. I had to let them know as President that the team would be supported and in every game they had to give their best. If you play with heart, you will win any game.\n\n“I always believe that if you want to make it in life, you must always work with others, have a clear objective and work hard,” continued the Indonesian investor.\n\n“I see these qualities in Walter Mazzarri and I thank Massimo Moratti for having chosen him. For the next two to three years we have things set out, then in 2016 the Champions League Final will be in Milan, so Inter must get prepared. I don’t know if we’ll win it, but with targeted work we can be back in the Champions League soon.”\n\nMany expect Thohir to come in with a huge transfer war chest, but he insists there are other ways of forming a modern club.\n\n“In England three or four clubs have entered into American hands, like Manchester United. I know the States well because I love basketball and there I realised how Americans make sport into an industry. They play the long game, know how to expand and become stronger.\n\n“If Inter don’t follow that model, they won’t be competitive in future. The first thing is to be strong, then the fans must see entertaining matches. If you don’t have a good business plan, then investment will never be remunerative. It is fundamental to create this system to support the team.”\n\nIt is also a big change from Moratti’s family-oriented approach to the club, where he ploughed millions into the squad.\n\n“The first time I saw Moratti was five or six months ago. I told him I wasn’t there to replace him, but to create a team spirit that would support Inter. I’d never have been able to do what he did in 18 years and working together we’ll become stronger.\n\n“In future only 10 teams will be remembered and I want Inter to be one of them. How long before the first Scudetto win? We’ll let God decide that.”\n\nThohir also assured his love for Inter was not something that sprung up overnight.\n\n“When we were kids, we wanted to play in Serie A, which was one of the greatest things football could offer to the world. My friends and I became big Inter fans in the 1980s, the years of the Germans like Lothar Matthaus, Andreas Brehme and Jurgen Klinsmann.\n\n“Now there is competition from the Premier League or Bundesliga, but I am convinced Serie A can again be the best League in the world if everyone wants to make it better.”",
  "latent_12178": "In this exclusive excerpt from her autobiography, I Am Malala, young activist Malala Yousafzai recounts the day she was shot by the Taliban.\n\nIn a country that’s seen more than its share of violence, the fate of one teenager might not seem to count for much. But somehow Malala Yousafzai of Pakistan has managed to become an international inspiration. She was only 11 when she took on the Taliban, demanding that girls be given full access to school. Her campaign led to a blog for the BBC, a New York Times documentary (watch it below), and a Pakistani peace prize. But all that was only a prelude to even more extraordinary events. Last October, Taliban assassins attacked Malala, then 15, on her way home from school, shooting her in the head. Here, Malala describes that day and offers her hopes for the future.\n\nTuesday, Oct. 9, 2012, wasn’t the best of days to start with, as it was the middle of exams—though as a bookish girl I didn’t mind them as much as some of my classmates did. That morning we arrived in the narrow mud lane off Haji Baba Road in our usual procession of brightly painted rickshaws sputtering diesel fumes, each one crammed with five or six girls. Since the time of the Taliban, our school has had no sign and the ornamented brass door in a white wall gives no hint of what lies beyond.\n\nFor us girls, that doorway was like a magical entrance to our own special world. As we skipped through, we cast off our head scarves and ran helter-skelter up the steps. At the top of the steps was an open courtyard with doors to all the classrooms. We dumped our backpacks in our rooms, then gathered for assembly under the sky, our backs to the mountains.\n\nThe school was founded by my father before I was born, and on the wall above us, “Khushal School” was painted proudly in red and white letters. We went to school six mornings a week, and as I was in Year 9, my classes were spent chanting chemical equations or studying Urdu grammar, writing stories in English with morals like “Haste makes waste” or drawing diagrams of blood circulation—most of my classmates wanted to be doctors. It’s hard to imagine that anyone would see that as a threat. Yet outside the school lay not only the noise and craziness of Mingora, the main city of the province of Swat, but also those, like the Taliban, who think girls should not go to school.\n\nBecause it was exam time, school started at 9 instead of 8 that morning, which was good, as I don’t like getting up and can sleep through the crows of the roosters and the prayer calls of the muezzin.\n\nMalala as a toddler with her brother Khushal in Mingora, Pakistan.\n\nI slept in the room at the front of our house. The only furniture was a bed and a cabinet that I had bought with the money I’d been given as an award for campaigning for peace in our valley and the right for girls to go to school. On some shelves were the gold-colored plastic cups and trophies I had won for coming first in my class. There were a few times I had not come out on top—both times I was beaten by my class rival, Malka-e-Noor. I was determined it would not happen again.\n\nThe school was not far from my home and I used to walk, but since the start of the last year I had been going with other girls in a rickshaw and coming home by bus. It was a journey of five minutes along the stinky stream, past the giant billboard for Dr. Humayun’s Hair Transplant Institute, where we joked that one of our bald male teachers must have gone when he suddenly started to sprout hair. I liked riding the bus because I didn’t get as sweaty as when I walked, and I could chat with my friends and gossip with Usman Ali, the driver, whom we called Bhai Jan, or “brother.” He made us all laugh with his crazy stories.\n\nI had started taking the bus because my mother worried about me walking on my own. We had been getting threats all year. Some were in the newspapers, and some were messages passed on by people. I was more concerned the Taliban would target my father, as he was always speaking out against them. His friend and fellow campaigner Zahid Khan had been shot in the face in August on his way to prayers.\n\nOur street could not be reached by car. I would get off the bus on the road below, go through an iron gate and up a flight of steps. Sometimes I’d imagine that a terrorist might jump out and shoot me on those steps. I wondered what I would do. Maybe I’d take off my shoes and hit him. But then I’d think that if I did that, there would be no difference between me and a terrorist. It would be better to plead, “Okay, shoot me, but first listen to me. What you are doing is wrong. I’m not against you personally. I just want every girl to go to school.”\n\nI wasn’t scared, but I had started making sure the gate was locked at night and asking God what happens when you die. I told my best friend, Moniba, everything. We’d lived on the same street when we were little and had been friends since primary school. We shared Justin Bieber songs and Twilight movies, the best face-lightening creams. Moniba always knew if something was wrong. “Don’t worry,” I told her. “The Taliban have never come for a small girl.”\n\nIn a photo taken before the attack, Malala is reading a story on the whiteboard at her school in Pakistan.\n\nWhen our bus was called, we ran down the school steps. The bus was actually a white Toyota truck with three parallel benches. It was cramped with 20 girls and three teachers. I was sitting on the left between Moniba and a girl named Shazia Ramzan, all of us holding our exam folders to our chests.\n\nInside the bus it was hot and sticky. In the back, where we sat, there were no windows, just plastic sheeting, which was too yellowed to see through. All we could see out the back was a little stamp of open sky and glimpses of the sun, a yellow orb floating in the dust that streamed over everything.\n\nThen we suddenly stopped. A young bearded man had stepped into the road. “Is this the Khushal School bus?” he asked our driver. Usman Bhai Jan thought this was a stupid question, as the name was painted on the side. “Yes,” he said.\n\n“I need information about some children,” said the man. “You should go to the office,” said Usman Bhai Jan. As he was speaking, another young man approached the back of the van.\n\n“Look, it’s one of those journalists coming to ask for an interview,” said Moniba. Since I’d started speaking at events with my father, journalists often came, though not like this, in the road.\n\nThe man was wearing a peaked cap and had a handkerchief over his nose and mouth. Then he swung himself onto the tailboard and leaned in over us. “Who is Malala?” he demanded.\n\nNo one said anything, but several of the girls looked at me. I was the only girl with my face uncovered.\n\nThat’s when he lifted up a black pistol. Some of the girls screamed. Moniba tells me I squeezed her hand.\n\nDuring her stay in the hospital, Malala received thousands of letters and cards, many of them from children. (University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust. Used with permission of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham)\n\nMy friends say he fired three shots. The first went through my left eye socket and out under my left shoulder. I slumped forward onto Moniba, blood coming from my left ear, so the other two bullets hit the girls next to me. One bullet went into Shazia’s left hand. The third went through her left shoulder and into the upper right arm of Kainat Riaz.\n\nMy friends later told me the gunman’s hand was shaking as he fired.\n\nIn the year since that fateful day, Malala has undergone a recovery that is nothing short of miraculous. The bullet narrowly missed her brain, and doctors at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, England, where she was brought in a medically induced coma six days after the attack, marveled that she was able to stand within a week of her arrival. Malala underwent multiple surgeries and spent nearly three months in the hospital (which specializes in treating wounded soldiers), though mercifully it was found she had suffered no major permanent neurological damage. The ordeal did, however, solidify her will: “It feels like this life is not my life. It’s a second life. People have prayed to God to spare me and I was spared for a reason—to use my life for helping people.”\n\nClick here to read about Malala’s life today »\n\nWatch Class Dismissed, a New York Times documentary about Malala’s grassroots struggle, filmed in 2009:\n\nMalala addresses the United Nations General Assembly on July 12, 2013, her 16th birthday:",

Europe will be getting the game on December 5, followed by Australia and Japan on December 6.\n\nFor the record, only four of the 58 Nintendo-published games on the Wii or Wii U had their release dates announced less than 46 days before their eventual release (there are currently 45 days until November 21), meaning Nintendo waited almost as long as possible to confirm the release date. On its release,fans will have waited 1,263 days sincewas first publicly announced on June 7, 2011, by far the largest such gap in Nintendo history.\n\nThe release date announcement follows the release of the 3DS version of the game over the weekend in Europe and North America, and that first portable Smash is already a huge success. Nintendo announced sales of more than 2.8 million copies worldwide. To put that number in context, Nintendo had sold just over three million Wii U hardware units in the Americas as of June 30, and best-seller Mario Kart 8 hit two million worldwide sales on the Wii U after about a month on sale.\n\nNintendo didn't break down how Smash Bros.' 3DS sales shook out by region, but Japanese tracking firm Media Create notes that the game has sold 1.37 million copies in Japan during its first three weeks on sale, suggesting healthy weekend launch numbers in the West.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. for Wii U will launch alongside the first set of 12 Amiibo figures, which allow players to store and transfer character data through near-field communications technology. Those $12.99 figures will work with only Smash Bros. at launch, but they will eventually work with Mario Kart 8 and future Nintendo titles like Mario Party 10 and Yoshi's Woolly World. Six more Amiibo figures are planned for a December release.\n\nThe previously announced Gamecube controller adapter for the Wii U will also hit North American stores on November 21 for $19.99 or as part of a bundle with the game and a Smash-logo-sporting Gamecube controller for $99.99 (the controller alone will be available for $29.99).

  "latent_12465": "A recent Freelance project got me thinking on this topic. And since it’s the holiday season, let’s talk about something non-awful for a change.\n\nI’ve been a scion of Science Fiction since childhood, and during moments where I’m feeling particularly iniquitous I’m apt to say it’s the only genre left where there’s room to create Art; Clint Eastwood tapped the last of the Western stories waiting to be told, and I think Shakespeare pretty much covered everything else.\n\nBut that’s just my own prejudice, and it’s not what I’m going to write about today. Instead I want to talk about what separates these two closely related genres – Fantasy and Science Fiction.\n\nAt first glance the two seem to be part of a spectrum, rather than distinctly separate taxona. If you were to walk into your local bookstore and try and separate all the books in the Scifi/Fantasy section you’d get something more like a like a Venn Diagram, than a phylogenetic tree. Memes cross pollinate, after all.\n\nSo first, let’s define some basic terms. Science Fiction at its quintessential is a type of fiction which deals with game-changing devices, exploring their ramifications. These devices can be as real as a chimp discovering how to sharpen a bone, or as silly as a device which perfectly predicts your moment of death. While game-changing devices aren’t unknown in Fantasy (Lord of the Rings comes to mind), the important distinction is that Science Fiction asks: What are the consequences of this device? It explores how the chimp society changes with this new tool, how the Life Insurance companies deal with the ruination of their industry.\n\nFantasy, meanwhile, focuses on the spiritual aspects of the human condition. Frodo’s growing obsession in Lord of the Rings is often compared to an opiate addiction; what happens when your devotion to Truth and Good requires the sacrifice of your very personality? Then there’s my all-time favourite post-modern Fantasy, The Last Unicorn. The question asked there is: What happens when the Avatar of Beauty is forced to learn of mortality? Even the earliest examples of Fantasy, such as the Mabinogion, deal with impossible and unexplainable devices and characters, never explores the how or why they exist, but instead uses them to draw out moral lessons. It’s a genre which deals with imaginary, impossible concepts, almost like the Mathematics of Infinity, or imaginary numbers, to provide comment on the human condition.\n\nSo with that out of the way, let’s contrast a couple of examples where the lines are blurred.\n\nOn the one hand we have Star Wars, a pulp scifi setting with mystical powers, and a single Knight Errant changing the course of Galactic History. On the other we have Dungeons and Dragons, a setting where magic follows distinct rules (as opposed to the “Magic do as you will!” style in The Last Unicorn), and mechanical devices built by Gnomish Technology are common. Doesn’t this show that there’s a middle ground between the two extremes?\n\nNo, it doesn’t.\n\nFirst, let’s consider that these are some of the worst examples of their genre; which isn’t to say that they’re bad in and of themselves. I’m a huge fan of both. But at the end of the day, both settings are nothing more than excuses to tell the story of Joseph Campbell’s thousand-faced hero. Neither have the pretension or ambition of saying anything profound, they’re just good stories. In Star Wars, Jedi philosophy is nothing but Taoism Lite, and its technology is incoherent and anachronistic. In D&D the fact that Good/Evil/Law/Chaos are confirmable Ontological Truths gives the characters a cheat sheet when it comes to figuring out How To Live The Good Life – a cheat sheet which is always ignored.\n\nThe difference between a good Star Wars/D&D story and a bad one, is that we have simply have a great time while reading/watching/playing the former, while in the latter we notice all the gaping flaws.\n\nHow, exactly, are the Sith ‘evil’ and to what end?\n\nCouldn’t you achieve a higher standard of living through the use of Clerical spells and accident/life insurance policies, than we currently enjoy in the modern world?\n\nWhy do all the spaceships seem to move at Jet Fighter speeds across interstellar distances?\n\nExplain to me why the Archons don’t get involved in this reality-shaping quest, instead relying upon us 10th level adventurers?\n\nAnd what’s the deal with Princess Leia’s sovereignty?\n\nStar Wars isn’t Hard Science Fiction, and D&D isn’t Deep Fantasy – but despite that both adhere to the rules of their own genre.\n\nStar Wars might have a magical-sort of psychic ability, but ultimately it’s very prosaic: telekinesis, a touch of clairvoyance, and a mastery of swordplay which is more a matter of Karateka Discipline than Divine Blessing. Notice what we don’t have: non-human immortals or absolutes, scrutable Gods (the Force may be a Power, but it lacks personality or intention), Destiny (ignoring the films-we-shall-not-name) or Divine Intervention. The plot might conveniently deliver the characters to exactly where they need to be, but no higher power is messing with the story. It’s a mechanically-consistent reality; in it people die for tragic, meaningless reasons.\n\nD&D, meanwhile, relies upon rationalizations to prevent the setting from going to its logical conclusions: the world must remain medieval in nature, despite magic which can regrow limbs, communicate instantly across any distance, and power streetlamps indefinitely at no cost. The most dire battles of universe-shaping proportions will always boil down to something regular people can solve, by finding the One and Only McGuffin (until you buy the Epic Levels Handbook, of course). And most importantly of all, the world is built around the tropes and conventions of High Drama. It’s an emotionally consistent reality; everything happens thanks to the Hands of Fate.\n\nScience Fiction and Fantasy are two separate genres, and never the twain should meet. And yet earlier I said that if you sorted out all the books in the bookstore, you’d wind up with a Venn Diagram. So what exactly are you getting in the middle pile?\n\nTo put it simply, you’re getting the utter hack writing. Authors who buy into modern-age woo, yet love reading Popular Science; who utterly fail to understand the analytic method present throughout Science, History, and Engineering, while also failing to show any depth on their analysis of the human condition. Stinking garbage is what you’ll find here. Let’s explore a couple of examples.\n\nOne novel I’m sad to say I purchased was a post-modern Japanophile’s foray into Cyberpunk. I forget many of the details – largely because the plot was nonsensical and lacking in Scientific concepts such as ‘Causality’ – but essentially this is what happened: a bunch of entities which existed solely on the Interweb decided to craft a virus, so they could trap everybody who was jacked in to their Muhmorpaguhs (MMORPGS) in Virtual Reality. Their reason for doing this was that they wanted to merge the two worlds, so that OL could take over RL. Think Serial Experiments Lain, with less Loli, and more You Fail at Internet. The resolution in this novel – unlike Serial Experiments Lain, which required Lain to do something consistent with the imaginary tech already established – required the protagonist to make peace with the OL shadow of his dead wife to gain the spiritual power to beat the Interwebs.\n\nThe whole thing was utter crap. The only reason I finished it was because of my deep-seated self-hatred and masochism.\n\nThe other example I’m going to give you isn’t actually a published book, it’s only the idea I heard from someone (not that there isn’t plenty of this crap out there, I’m just usually pretty good at sniffing it out before I buy). It goes like this: a magical meteor hits the earth, splitting it into two halves; on one half the world of Technology still reigns, on the other half the powers of Magic reassert themselves.\n\nIf that’s the case, I have a few questions:\n\nTo what extent does Science still operate on the Magical half? Specifically I’m thinking of Chemistry, Atomic Structure, and Thermodynamics. If I go to visit the Magical side, does my gut still digest a sandwich the same way? What if I leave a piece of meat to rot under a glass jar, will maggots form? Can I build a perpetual motion machine? If the answers are, respectively, “Yes, No, and No,” then answer me this – why won’t my atomic weapons work, and where do you disspate the heat energy from my machine gun bullets bouncing off your Mage Shield?\n\nIncidentally, the same questions apply to that Wiccan cream-dream series written by Creepy Castrado S.M. Stirling. In Dies the Fire it’s established that gunpowder burns at the same rate as tobacco, bloody steam engines don’t work any more, and yet metallurgy, gas lamps, and – of course – digestion are unchanged. Why? Because metallurgy is a natural technology – everybody knows that Swords are Good, and Guns are Evil!\n\nYou show me a Scifi/Fantasy mixer, and I’ll show you a liberal arts major who wishes their degree was useful.\n\nIn the end what it all boils down to is that Magic and Science are incompatible metaphysical constructs. Technology follows counter-intuitive rules, with no regard of the creators intention – it doesn’t even care about the creator’s hubris. In this awful reality, Doctor Frankenstein is as likely to get rich, as he is to destroy humanity; rain falls upon the heads of the just and the unjust alike. Magic, on the other hand, is by definition intuitive. It’s the outward manifestation of our emotional make up, and in some situations it actually works – just look at the ‘group mind’ experienced by concert audiences, or the effectiveness of Tai Chi against believers. This doesn’t mean that it’s true – it just means that we wish it was.\n\nThe amount of mixed Science Fantasy seems to have started ballooning in recent decades. I have a theory as to why. Just look to the device you’re reading this on.\n\nFifty years ago technology was simple – it had a switch to turn it on or off, and maybe a rheostat to adjust how much it was on. The back panel could be screwed off, and the wires played with. Even the most technically ignorant person recognized that a toaster was, in essence, just a very complex lever.\n\nNowadays our technology is so complex, that unless you’re Richard Stallman, most of everything you use is going to be a black box. I’m a huge Linux junkie (I run Fedora because Ubuntu is too hippy-dippy for me), but I’ll be the first to admit that even something as relatively basic and technical as root commands in a terminal window are far closer to Magic, than they are to the tech-savvy process of building a circuit board.\n\nWe think Magically, so we have designed our technology to behave Magically. Every so often we’re reminded of its scientific basis (how often does a Sending Spell cut out because of excess network traffic?), but it’s easy to miss if you’re not technically savvy. Our Machines do what we want them to do as if they were some sort of animate Golems. As the Apple commercials used to say, “It Just Works” – and if you think it’s crazy now, just imagine what it’ll look like in two-hundred years.\n\nIgnorance of the technology underlying our Magical Black Boxes is understandable; but that doesn’t mean you can have Magic in a Science Fiction Story, and still have it be a good story. The two Metaphysics are inconsistent, they negate, and that spills over into the genre. By all means, have your Science Fiction story with psychic abilities; have your Fantasy story with anachronistic elements. But decide from the beginning which genre it’s going to be.\n\nIt’s like Violent Whiskey Drunks and Family Dinners – both are great in their own right, but they go together poorly, and really shouldn’t be mixed at all.\n\nReddit comment thread here.",

  "latent_12556": "The federal government has recently taken two strong initiatives linked to the troubled state of the world — one designed to counter potential corruption and bribery by Canadian firms abroad, the other to confront the jihadist threat at home.\n\nBoth are meant, at least in part, to toughen up Canada's image in the world, and both have stirred up considerable opposition among those who think Prime Minister Stephen Harper is expanding government powers too far.\n\nThat opposition, mind you, is vastly different. One is made up of the nation's corporate elite, the other is the civil liberties crowd, backed by at least some of the opposition parties in Parliament.\n\nIt will be interesting to see which has the most muscle in Harper's often populist Ottawa. Personally I'd bet on the boardrooms.\n\nAlready, corporate Canada looks to have pushed the government into retreating on its tough new anti-corruption rules, which were rushed into place in 2013 and then much strengthened by Public Works and Public Safety Canada without serious consultation with those firms actually trading overseas.\n\nAll indications are that Ottawa will announce changes to the rules, possibly as early as next month.\n\nWhat this shows is how impressive the push-back campaign has been as it was only mounted a few months ago, albeit by a grand coalition representing 250,000 businesses in associations such as The Canadian Council of Chief Executives, Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, and the Information Technology Association of Canada.\n\nThese business leaders are not objecting to all regulations against overseas corruption. Just those they deem too ambitious and clumsy, and which have slammed Canadian companies with more restrictions abroad than any of their competitors from the U.S., Britain, Germany or Japan.\n\nThe Harper government clearly meant to clean up the weak image Canada has long had internationally for its tepid response to how certain Canadian firms were behaving overseas.\n\nBut the business argument was that these rules were recklessly harsh and put Canadian companies at a disadvantage in foreign trade, with potentially serious consequences for jobs at home.\n\nCaught in the net\n\nSo what do these regulations do? They create new punishments for any Canadian companies and citizens deemed to have made any form of payment to gain business regardless of where it takes place.\n\nThey even bar minor \"facilitation\" payments to foreign government functionaries to speed up sluggish bureaucracy, a form of gratuity previously permitted, and still OK even under the strict U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nThey also take the limits off fines, which now might run into the tens of millions of dollars, for overseas bribery, and they stunned the business world by hiking potential prison terms to up to 14 years.\n\nWhile bribery and corruption is considered almost the norm in many part of the world, lawyers are now warning their Canadian clients that the risk of any impropriety in seeking a foreign contract is just too high now.\n\nAllies at times, John Manley (right), head the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, has been leading the campaign to have Stephen Harper rethink the government's new \"integrity framework\" on corporate corruption, which business groups say goes too far. (The Canadian Press)\n\nIndeed, the RCMP is currently said to be pursuing at least 35 significant cases of bribery abroad.\n\nWhat particularly riled board rooms was the new initiative to bar companies, including foreign ones, from selling any products or services to the Canadian government for a full decade if, at any time in the last 10 years, they or even their foreign affiliates were found guilty of having bribed abroad.\n\nThis cast a net so wide that five global giants have been snagged, including Hewlett Packard, Siemens and BAE Systems.\n\nIn fact, it has been the fierce protests over these big-name cases that seem to have moved Ottawa to start weakening its regulations.\n\nCanadian companies are warning of potentially billions of dollars in lost contracts when our important trading partners, furious over their firms being barred for competing for Canadian contracts, launch some sort of tit-for-tat retaliation.\n\nOttawa has been rattled. According to a recent Globe and Mail story, an effort to \"placate critics is under way,\" an effort that includes a special review committee to look at the regulations \"with the help of a number of industry groups.\"\n\nThe other campaign\n\nStill, any weakening of these regulations will present its own set of problems as global corruption is said to be growing, by an estimated 10 per cent a year, and a strong case can be made that it's a graver threat to the world than even terrorism.\n\nThe World Bank estimates corruption siphons away up to $1 trillion a year from developing nations and helps create the failed states that terror groups thrive in.\n\nIt's that threat of terrorism, of course, that brings us back to the other campaign underway, the one by critics hoping to restrain Harper's new anti-terrorism legislation, which greatly extends the of powers of CSIS, our domestic spy agency, without increasing political oversight.\n\nNDP Foreign Affairs critic Paul Dewar has been in the forefront of the opposition campaign to temper Harper government's new anti-terror bill. (The Canadian Press)\n\nThese new powers give CSIS unprecedented, near-police powers that would allow agents to move in forcefully to disrupt the lives of anyone they believe \"might\" act in support of a terrorist action at home or abroad, and to seek detention without charge for up to seven days.\n\nYes, there is provision for some judicial oversight in the new law, but critics argue that this isn't enough, and they are far from satisfied with the current five-member Security Intelligence Review Committee, which once a year reports on CSIS.\n\nThey want legislative oversight of intelligence operations — along the lines of our main counterterrorism partners, the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nBut while the Harper government wants to bring Canada more in line with these partners in terms of toughening up our security and spying powers, it sees no reason to spend extra money on creating similar oversight by elected officials.\n\nThis sets up an important debate over the nature of security in Canada today, especially given our country's frankly shaky record of failures to protect rights whenever we have been unnerved by threats in war or peace.\n\nIt remains to be seen, of course, whether in such nervous times the stand for civil rights protection and oversight can be as effectively championed in Ottawa as the case for corporate freedoms seems to have been.",

  "latent_12601": "Share. Satoru Iwata and Reggie Fils-Aime talk about Nintendo's future. Satoru Iwata and Reggie Fils-Aime talk about Nintendo's future.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is that we’ve been here constantly. We’ve been betraying people’s expectations, in a good way, for a long time.\"\n\nSatoru Iwata's confidence, both in his company's strategy and products, is inescapable. I walked into my meeting with Nintendo's global president with a list of questions asking about Nintendo's past mistakes and options for the future. And while I did ask those questions, I left with a better understanding of what Iwata hoped to accomplish, and why he is still confident that the oldest company in the games industry can turn its fortunes around. Iwata speaks with an unwavering, yet friendly and optimistic, conviction. He's realistic about Nintendo's struggles and weaknesses, while still describing all past choices within a framework of a company that time and time again has defied the odds and overcome hurdles that might spell the doom of any other company.\n\n\"Have you heard of the theory or the story of the four-minute mile?\" Iwata asked me, leaning forward with a fixed, unwavering yet not unfriendly gaze.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nThat's not a question I expected to hear during an interview with Nintendo's president, but it certainly fit the tone of our discussion to that point. Iwata doesn't give brief answers to direct questions, mostly because he wants to make sure you completely understand the background and context for his beliefs. Sometimes the simplest ideas are formed from very complicated histories. Iwata wants Nintendo to be understood on a fundamental level. He wants you to intuitively grasp the publisher's strategies for the future.\n\n\"For a very long time in the past, it was believed to be impossible that a human could run a mile in four minutes,\" Iwata told me. \"However, once one person broke the record, 23 more people broke the record themselves in the following year. Many things we can’t do are simply because we think we can’t do them.\" I replied \"So basically the impossible is possible?\" Iwata, who understands English intuitively and rarely needs a translator for my questions, smiles and nods firmly. \"Yes,\" he replies.\n\nThe meaning of Iwata's story stands clear, which he quickly ties to the company he has guided for over a decade. Nintendo is constantly doubted, and constantly questioned, mostly because it routinely challenges the direction of the industry and the conventional wisdom that comes with it. \"To put it another way, if we start thinking we can do something, we can do it,\" Iwata said.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nOf course, Iwata isn't alone in this belief. As the Chief Operating Officer and president of Nintendo of America, Reggie Fils-Aime plays an incredibly important role in Nintendo's global business, and reports directly to Iwata, who recently became the CEO of NOA. Talking to Fils-Aime is completely different than interviewing Iwata. Perhaps due to the fact that we've chatted many, many times over the past several years, Reggie is far more relaxed and a bit less formal when we sit down to talk about Nintendo's strengths and weaknesses since the last time we spoke, several months prior to the launch of Wii U. Much has changed since that time.\n\nAs it happens, though not to my surprise, Fils-Aime has his own anecdote to counter the latest wave of skepticism to cross Nintendo. I can tell he has been expecting this. He's ready - as always, and as the popular Nintendo-related meme goes.\n\n\"I saw a video clip from 1990 or 1991. It was a clip off of Good Morning America,\" Fils-Aime told me in a separate interview (you can see the clip below). \"It was just before the transition here in the Americas from NES to SNES. The broad themes were, “Is Nintendo dead? Can they make the transition to the next system with other devices getting stronger?” They were talking about PCs. “Is the dedicated gaming system dead?” 1990 or 1991. This industry has been declared dead so many times. Nintendo has been declared dead so many times. It’s just noise.\"\n\nCertainly seeing cries of doom and gloom from 20 years ago reinforces what Iwata and Fils-Aime are saying. Nintendo understands its games, its hardware and its potential customers better than outsiders. Wii U's momentum has certainly slowed to a crawl, but looking over at the Nintendo 3DS, which could be argued is the most consistently entertaining platform in 2013, shows that quality games can change everything.\n\n\"Fundamentally, this is the entertainment business,\" Fils-Aime said. \"If we entertain people, if we put smiles on their faces, they’re going to buy our products – hardware and software. They’re going to support our brands. We will continue to be a very effective and a very, dare I say, successful company. It’s about the content.\"\n\nFlip the page for Iwata and Reggie's thoughts on how Nintendo will solve its current Wii U crisis...",
  "latent_12656": "Photo\n\nBANGALORE, India — “Today we are going to talk about becoming a big girl. Who here has become one?” Sinu Joseph, a social worker, said to about 50 squirming 13- and 14-year-old girls earlier this month during a visit to Renuka, a tiny government school in Bangalore.\n\nPredictably, there were giggles, groans and whispering. But when that subsided, nearly everybody raised a hand.\n\nThe girls were getting ready to watch a pioneering animated video titled “Mythri” (“Friend” in Sanskrit), a comprehensive guide to menstruation, a topic that is often avoided in Indian households. The 23-minute video was made in 2010, based on feedback from girls, parents and teachers in government schools across the southwestern state of Karnataka, after Ms. Joseph found existing materials were too graphic, too technical or just too depressing.\n\n“We were given Unicef handouts to take around tribal areas, with naked pictures of boys and girls to teach menstruation and sex education,” said Ms. Joseph, 31. “None of the teachers would use them because they were too embarrassed. Other material focused way too much on the suffering of women, scaring the girls away.”\n\n“Mythri,” which features a teacher who addresses a classroom of girls, explains in the state language of Kannada why menstruation happens as well as how often to change a sanitary napkin. It keeps cultural sensitivities in mind by only showing fully clothed girls, and yet covers sex education and changing bodies.\n\nThrough the video, Ms. Joseph wanted to jettison the baggage of shame that came with talking about menstruation. “Nobody would talk about the details of it at all, because they were too shy,” she said. “The teachers would say things like ‘This is a curse you have to bear.’ No wonder the girls were so depressed about menstruating.”\n\n“Mythri” has been shown to nearly 5,000 girls already in Karnataka, and the state government recently agreed to show it in all government schools, hoping to reach an estimated 2.2 million adolescent girls.\n\nThe principal of Renuka had invited Ms. Joseph to screen the video and conduct a question-and-answer session afterward. After the video was shown, the questions came fast and furious. “Why do only girls get their periods? Is it because the blood of boys is purer?” asked one gawky teenager with pigtails.\n\n“If a boy touches my arm, will I get pregnant?” asked another, worriedly.\n\nMs. Joseph, who took the queries with no hint of embarrassment, was more like a stand-up comic than a teacher. There was much joking, bantering and goodhearted teasing.\n\n“When did you get your first period?” she asked a shy 13-year-old girl.\n\n“On Jan. 26,” the girl stammered.\n\n“Wow, Republic Day, what a great day to get it!” Ms. Joseph said, laughing. “Let’s hope the rest of you get it on Independence Day.”\n\nAt another point, she talked about how she had been convinced she had mortally injured herself when she got her period at age 11. “Nobody told me anything about it before, so I shouted, ‘Help, I have hurt myself!’ Then my sister asked if she should get me a Band-Aid,” Ms. Joseph said.\n\nThe girls erupted into giggles at everything she said, but behind Ms. Joseph’s practiced patter was a serious subject. India has the highest number of deaths from cervical cancer in the world, and one of the contributing factors is poor menstrual hygiene.\n\nWomen in rural areas use cloth during their periods, which are fine if used properly, but the women often do not change and wash the cloths regularly. Even those who have switched to sanitary napkins often do not know that they need to be changed regularly.\n\nMs. Joseph said women needed to laugh at menstruation and at themselves. “Girls will respond to your tone,” she said. “If I am embarrassed, the girls will be, too. If I laugh and treat it as normal, so will they, and see it as normal.”\n\nGirls in India are taught to think about menstruation — and their bodies — as impure. The girls at the Bangalore school aren’t any different.\n\nWhen Ms. Joseph asked them, “Is menstrual blood bad?,” most of them yelled “Yes!”\n\n“No, it’s not,” Ms. Joseph said, before proceeding to explain the function of menstruation.\n\nA girl asked why she is considered “dirty” and not allowed to go to the temple when she has periods. “In olden times, girls did not have sanitary napkins and could not keep themselves clean,” Ms. Joseph said. “Now, you can. Listen to your parents now, but when you have girls of your own, let them go where they want to.”\n\nMs. Joseph’s post-video sessions also include discussions about sex, rape and sexual abuse. She also explains the difference between a “bad touch” and a “good touch.”\n\n“What will you do if a man touches you?” she asked the girls.\n\n“Hit him with my chappal,” was the response from one girl, referring to her sandal.\n\n“No,” said Ms. Joseph, who then instructed them to scream loudly, leave the house, go for help and report it to the police. The class began practicing their screams at once.\n\n“Don’t let anyone touch you, or talk to you improperly, but if they do, it’s not your fault,” Ms. Joseph said.\n\nMeanwhile, both teachers and parents have welcomed the video. “In these times, sexual abuse is happening all around us, even at home,” said Bhagya, a teacher at the school who goes by only one name. “Girls should know about their bodies. I would have been embarrassed to teach them myself.”\n\nThe success of the video in Karnataka has led to the central government asking Ms. Joseph to write a chapter on menstruation in a textbook for girls in the sixth standard, or 12- to 13-year-olds, in several languages for other states. Next, she plans to make a Hindi-language version of “Mythri” for schools in northern India.\n\nThe girls at the Bangalore school said “Mythri” had taught them a great deal. “I didn’t know I had to change pads so often,” said Aishwarya, 13, who goes by one name. “We were so shy to talk about this before; now we are not.”\n\nLavanya, 14, added that she “often wondered why boys didn’t have periods. Or why we needed to suffer. Now I know.”\n\nKavitha Rao is a freelance journalist based in Bangalore. Follow her on Twitter @kavitharao.",
  "latent_12912": "Exclusive: With corruption rampant and living standards falling, Ukraine may become the next failed state that “benefited” from a neoconservative-driven “regime change,” though the blame will always be placed elsewhere in this case, on the demonized Russian President Putin, writes Robert Parry.\n\nBy Robert Parry\n\nNearly two years since U.S. officials helped foment a coup in Ukraine partly justified by corruption allegations the country continues to wallow in graft and cronyism as the living standards for average Ukrainians plummet, according to economic data and polls of public attitudes.\n\nEven the neocon-oriented Wall Street Journal took note of the worsening corruption in a Jan. 1, 2016 article observing that “most Ukrainians say the revolution’s promise to replace rule by thieves with the rule of law has fallen short and the government acknowledges that there is still much to be done.”\n\nActually, the numbers suggest something even worse. More and more Ukrainians rate corruption as a major problem facing the nation, including a majority of 53 percent last September, up from 48 percent last June and 28 percent in September 2014, according to polls by International Foundation for Electoral Systems.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine’s GDP has fallen in every quarter since the Feb. 22, 2014 putsch that overthrew elected President Viktor Yanukovych. Since then, the average Ukrainian also has faced economic “reforms” to slash pensions, energy subsidies and other social programs, as demanded by the International Monetary Fund.\n\nIn other words, the hard lives of most Ukrainians have gotten significantly harder while the elites continue to skim off whatever cream is left, including access to billions of dollars in the West’s foreign assistance that is keeping the economy afloat.\n\nPart of the problem appears to be that people supposedly responsible for the corruption fight are themselves dogged by allegations of corruption. The Journal cited Ukrainian lawmaker Volodymyr Parasyuk who claimed to be so outraged by graft that he expressed his fury “by kicking in the face an official he says owns luxury properties worth much more than a state salary could provide.”\n\nHowever, the Journal also noted that “parliament is the site of frequent mass brawls [and] it is hard to untangle all the overlapping corruption allegations and squabbling over who is to blame. Mr. Parasyuk himself was named this week as receiving money from an organized crime suspect, a claim he denies.”\n\nThen, there is the case of Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko, who is regarded by top American columnists as the face of Ukraine’s reform. Indeed, a Wall Street Journal op-ed last month by Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, hailed Jaresko as “a tough reformer” whose painful plans include imposing a 20 percent “flat tax” on Ukrainians (a favorite nostrum of the American Right which despises a progressive tax structure that charges the rich at a higher rate).\n\nSestanovich noted that hedge-fund billionaire George Soros, who has made a fortune by speculating in foreign currencies, has endorsed Jaresko’s plan but that it is opposed by some key parliamentarians who favor a “populist” alternative that Sestanovich says “will cut rates, explode the deficit, and kiss IMF money good-bye.”\n\nYet, Jaresko is hardly a paragon of reform. Prior to getting instant Ukrainian citizenship and becoming Finance Minister in December 2014, she was a former U.S. diplomat who had been entrusted to run a $150 million U.S.-taxpayer-funded program to help jump-start an investment economy in Ukraine and Moldova.\n\nJaresko’s compensation was capped at $150,000 a year, a salary that many Americans would envy, but it was not enough for her. So, she engaged in a variety of maneuvers to evade the cap and enrich herself by claiming millions of dollars in bonuses and fees.\n\nUltimately, Jaresko was collecting more than $2 million a year after she shifted management of the Western NIS Enterprise Fund (WNISEF) to her own private company, Horizon Capital, and arranged to get lucrative bonuses when selling off investments, even as the overall WNISEF fund was losing money, according to official records.\n\nFor instance, Jaresko collected $1.77 million in bonuses in 2013, according to WNISEF’s latest available filing with the Internal Revenue Service. In her financial disclosure forms with the Ukrainian government, she reported earning $2.66 million in 2013 and $2.05 million in 2014, thus amassing a sizeable personal fortune while investing U.S. taxpayers’ money supposedly to benefit the Ukrainian people.\n\nIt didn’t matter that WNISEF continued to hemorrhage money, shrinking from its original $150 million to $89.8 million in the 2013 tax year, according to the IRS filing. WNISEF reported that the bonuses to Jaresko and other corporate officers were based on “successful” exits from some investments even if the overall fund was losing money. [See Consortiumnews.com’s “ How Ukraine’s Finance Minister Got Rich .”]\n\nThough Jaresko’s enrichment schemes are documented by IRS and other official filings, the mainstream U.S. media has turned a blind eye to this history, all the better to pretend that Ukraine’s “reform” process is in good hands. (It also turns out that Jaresko did not comply with Ukrainian law that permits only single citizenship; she has kept her U.S. passport exploiting a loophole that gives her two years to show that she has renounced her U.S. citizenship.)\n\nPropaganda over Reality\n\nYet, as good as propaganda can be especially when the U.S. government and mainstream media are moving in lockstep reality is not always easily managed. Ukraine’s continuing and some say worsening corruption prompted last month’s trip to Ukraine by Vice President Joe Biden who gave a combination lecture and pep talk to Ukraine’s parliament.\n\nOf course, Biden has his own Ukraine cronyism problem because three months after the U.S.-backed overthrow of the Yanukovych government Ukraine’s largest private gas firm, Burisma Holdings, appointed his son, Hunter Biden, to its board of directors.\n\nBurisma a shadowy Cyprus-based company also lined up well-connected lobbyists, some with ties to Secretary of State John Kerry, including Kerry’s former Senate chief of staff David Leiter, according to lobbying disclosures.\n\nAs Time magazine reported , “Leiter’s involvement in the firm rounds out a power-packed team of politically-connected Americans that also includes a second new board member, Devon Archer, a Democratic bundler and former adviser to John Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign. Both Archer and Hunter Biden have worked as business partners with Kerry’s son-in-law, Christopher Heinz, the founding partner of Rosemont Capital, a private-equity company.”\n\nAccording to investigative journalism inside Ukraine, the ownership of Burisma has been traced to Privat Bank, which is controlled by the thuggish billionaire oligarch Ihor Kolomoysky, who was appointed by the U.S.-backed “reform” regime to be governor of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a south-central province of Ukraine (though Kolomoisky was eventually ousted from that post in a power struggle over control of UkrTransNafta, Ukraine’s state-owned oil pipeline operator).\n\nIn his December speech , Biden lauded the sacrifice of the 100 or so protesters who died during the Maidan clashes in February 2014, referring to them by their laudatory name “The Heavenly Hundred.” But Biden made no heavenly references to the estimated 10,000 people, mostly ethnic Russians, who have been slaughtered in the U.S.-encouraged “Anti-Terror Operation” waged by the coup regime against eastern Ukrainians who objected to the violent ouster of President Yanukovych, who had won large majorities in those areas.\n\nApparently, heaven is not as eager to welcome ethnic Russian victims of U.S.-inspired political violence. Nor did Biden take note that some of the Heavenly Hundred were street fighters for neo-Nazi and other far-right nationalist organizations.\n\nBut after making his sugary references to The Heavenly Hundred Biden delivered his bitter medicine, an appeal for the parliament to continue implementing IMF “reforms,” including demands that old people work longer into their old age.\n\nBiden said, “For Ukraine to continue to make progress and to keep the support of the international community you have to do more, as well. The big part of moving forward with your IMF program — it requires difficult reforms. And they are difficult.\n\n“Let me say parenthetically here, all the experts from our State Department and all the think tanks, and they come and tell you, that you know what you should do is you should deal with pensions. You should deal with — as if it’s easy to do. Hell, we’re having trouble in America dealing with it. We’re having trouble. To vote to raise the pension age is to write your political obituary in many places.\n\n“Don’t misunderstand that those of us who serve in other democratic institutions don’t understand how hard the conditions are, how difficult it is to cast some of the votes to meet the obligations committed to under the IMF. It requires sacrifices that might not be politically expedient or popular. But they’re critical to putting Ukraine on the path to a future that is economically secure. And I urge you to stay the course as hard as it is. Ukraine needs a budget that’s consistent with your IMF commitments.”\n\nEroding Support\n\nBut more and more Ukrainians appear to see through the charade in Kiev, as the poll numbers on the corruption crisis soar. Meanwhile, European officials seem to be growing impatient with the Ukraine crisis which has added to the drag on the Continent’s economies because the Obama administration strong-armed the E.U. into painful economic sanctions against Russia, which had come to the defense of the embattled ethnic Russians in the east.\n\n“Many E.U. officials are fed up with Ukraine,” said one Western official quoted by the Journal, which added that “accusations of graft by anticorruption activists, journalists and diplomats have followed to the new government.”\n\nThe Journal said those implicated include some early U.S. favorites, such as Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, “whose ratings have plummeted to single digits amid allegations in the media and among anticorruption activists of his associates’ corrupt dealings. Mr. Yatsenyuk has denied any involvement in corruption and his associates, one of whom resigned from parliament over the controversy this month, deny wrongdoing.”\n\nThe controversy over Yatsenyuk’s alleged cronyism led to an embarrassing moment in December 2015 when an anti-Yatsenyuk lawmaker approached the podium with a bouquet of roses, which the slightly built Yatsenyuk accepted only to have the lawmaker lift him up and try to carry him from the podium.\n\nIn many ways, the Ukraine crisis represents just another failure of neocon-driven “regime change,” which has also spread chaos across the Middle East and northern Africa. But the neocons appear to have even a bigger target in their sites, another “regime change” in Moscow, with Ukraine just a preliminary move. Of course, that scheme could put in play nuclear war.\n\nTaking Aim\n\nThe Ukraine “regime change” took shape in 2013 after Russian President Putin and President Barack Obama collaborated to tamp down crises in Syria and Iran, two other prime targets for neocon “regime changes.” American neocons were furious that those hopes were dashed. Ukraine became Putin’s payback.\n\nIn fall 2013, the neocons took aim at Ukraine, recognizing its extreme sensitivity to Russia which had seen previous invasions, including by the Nazis in World War II, pass through the plains of Ukraine and into Russia. Carl Gershman, neocon president of the U.S.-funded National Endowment for Democracy, cited Ukraine as the “biggest prize” and a key step toward unseating Putin in Moscow. [See Consortiumnews.com’s “ What the Neocons Want from Ukraine Crisis. ”]\n\nInitially, the hope was that Yanukovych would lead Ukraine into an economic collaboration with Europe while cutting ties to Russia. But Yanukovych received a warning from top Ukrainian economists that a hasty split with neighboring Russia would cost the country a staggering $160 billion in lost income.\n\nSo, Yanukovych sought to slow down the process, prompting angry protests especially from western Ukrainians who descended on Maidan square. Though initially peaceful, neo-Nazi and other nationalist militias soon infiltrated the protests and began ratcheting up the violence, including burning police with Molotov cocktails.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S.-funded non-governmental organizations, such as the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (which receives money from USAID and hedge-fund billionaire George Soros’s Open Society), hammered away at alleged corruption in the Yanukovych government.\n\nIn December 2013, Nuland reminded Ukrainian business leaders that the United States had invested $5 billion in their “European aspirations,” and in an intercepted phone call in early February 2014 she discussed with U.S. Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt who Ukraine’s new leaders would be.\n\n“Yats is the guy,” Nuland said of Arseniy Yatsenyuk, as she also disparaged a less aggressive approach by the European Union with the pithy phrase: “Fuck the E.U.” (Nuland, a former aide to ex-Vice President Dick Cheney, is the wife of arch-neoconservative ideologue Robert Kagan.)\n\nSen. John McCain also urged on the protests, telling one group of right-wing Ukrainian nationalists that they had America’s backing. And, the West’s mainstream media fell in love with the Maidan protesters as innocent white hats and thus blamed the worsening violence on Yanukovych. [See Consortiumnews.com’s “ NYT Still Pretends No Coup in Ukraine. ”]\n\nUrging Restraint\n\nIn Biden’s December 2015 speech to the parliament, he confirmed that he personally pressed on President Yanukovych the need to avoid violence. “I was literally on the phone with your former President urging restraint,” Biden said.\n\nHowever, on Feb. 20, 2014, mysterious snipers apparently from buildings controlled by the far right fired on and killed policemen as well as some protesters. The bloodshed sparked other violent clashes as armed rioters battled with retreating police.\n\nAlthough the dead included some dozen police officers, the violence was blamed on Yanukovych, who insisted that he had ordered the police not to use lethal force in line with Biden’s appeal. But the State Department and the West’s mainstream media made Yanukovych the black-hatted villain.\n\nThe next day, Feb. 21, Yanukovych signed an accord negotiated and guaranteed by three European nations to accept reduced powers and early elections so he could be voted out of office if that was the public’s will. However, as police withdrew from the Maidan, the rioters, led by neo-Nazi militias called sotins, stormed government buildings on Feb. 22, forcing Yanukovych and other officials to flee for their lives.\n\nIn the West’s mainstream media, these developments were widely hailed as a noble “revolution” and with lumps in their throats many journalists averted their misty eyes from the key role played by unsavory neo-Nazis, so as not to dampen the happy narrative (although BBC was among the few MSM outlets that touched on this inconvenient reality ).\n\nEver since, the major U.S. news media has stayed fully on board, ignoring evidence that what happened was a U.S.-sponsored coup. The MSM simply explains all the trouble as a case of naked “Russian aggression.\n\nThere were kudos, too, when “reformer” Natalie Jaresko was made Finance Minister along with other foreign “technocrats.” There was no attention paid to evidence about the dark underside of the Ukrainian “revolution of dignity,” as Biden called it.\n\nThough the neo-Nazis sometimes even teamed up with Islamic jihadists were the tip of the spear slashing through eastern Ukraine, their existence was either buried deep inside stories or dismissed as “Russian propaganda.”\n\nThat was, in effect, American propaganda and, as clever as it was, it could only control reality for so long.\n\nEven though the fuller truth about Ukraine has never reached the American people, there comes a point when even the best propagandists have to start modifying their rosy depictions. Ukraine appears to have reached that moment.",
  "latent_13031": "LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Along with a vast musical legacy and legions of adoring fans, pop superstar Michael Jackson leaves behind a mountain of debt and an unfulfilled comeback many hoped would rake in millions and erase his financial troubles.\n\nPop star Michael Jackson gestures during a news conference in Munich's Olympic stadium in this June 9, 1999 file photo. Jackson, the child star turned King of Pop who set the world dancing but whose musical genius was overshadowed by a bizarre lifestyle and sex scandals, died on June 25, 2009. He was 50. REUTERS/Michael Kappeler/Files\n\nThe King of Pop died suddenly on Thursday at the age of 50, after a career spanning 40 years that included the biggest-selling pop album of all time, “Thriller.”\n\nDespite taking in hundreds of millions of dollars as one of the most successful pop musicians of all time, Jackson racked up about $500 million of debt, according to sources cited by The Wall Street Journal earlier this month.\n\nHis top assets, however, including copyrights to his own songs and a stake in the Beatles’ song catalog, are worth more than $1 billion, according to a music industry source.\n\nJackson’s career and image were tarnished by his mounting financial and legal troubles in recent years.\n\nKnown for huge shopping sprees for toys and antiques, Jackson was accused by an accountant during his 2005 trial on child molestation charges of spending $20 million to $30 million more than he was bringing in per year.\n\nThe lavish lifestyle was made possible in part by a $200 million loan secured by his stake in the Beatles catalog. Jackson owned the music in a joint venture with Sony Corp known as Sony/ATV. Jackson refinanced those loans in 2006 in a bid to stave off insolvency.\n\nIn addition, Jackson last November had to hand over the title on his Neverland estate in California to a company made up of himself and Los Angeles-based real estate investment trust Colony Capital LLC, the firm that holds his $23 million loan on the property.\n\nColony Capital has been sprucing up the ranch and planned to sell it, according to the Journal. Colony Chief Executive Tom Barrack told the newspaper last month the estate could fetch $70 million to $80 million, or more if Jackson’s career were revitalized.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Barrack said he was “deeply saddened” by Jackson’s death, but did not comment on the impact on Colony’s business.\n\nPLANNED BIG COMEBACK\n\nTo help turn around his financial fortunes, Jackson was planning a major comeback in London this summer, 12 years since his last tour.\n\nAEG Live, which was promoting the 50-concert run at the 02 Arena, stands to lose as much as $40 million if its insurance is not substantial enough to cover what it has already spent on the production, Billboard reported, and one attorney said the company would not be able to recover any of those costs from Jackson’s estate.\n\n“The concert promoters can’t sue the estate,” said Bob Rasmussen, dean of the Gould Law School at the University of Southern California. “Once he dies, he doesn’t have any obligation to perform.”\n\nAEG, wholly owned by privately held Anschutz Co, will also certainly miss out on the $400 million the company estimated it could raise through a 3 1/2-year plan to work with Jackson.\n\nBut Jackson’s greatest financial returns may come in the wake of his death. His long-term record company, Sony Music Entertainment, will likely reissue special versions of some his biggest-selling albums and possibly even rare recordings.",
  "latent_13035": "I am so thankful I waited until our son was over 15lbs to review this baby carrier. I LOVE it! When he was an infant, the Moby wrap seemed to work best. But once he passed the 15 pound mark, as Boba recommends, I stopped using the other carriers all together. I have tried the Moby Wrap Baby Bjorn , and a sling. Compared to these, The Boba baby carrier is by far my favorite, being the most comfortable and easy to use. I am rarely without my Boba carrier.We live in Arizona and the Moby wrap and Baby Bjorn get really warm, but the Boba's fabric is light and cool, while also sturdy enough to support our 24 pound 10-month-old! The fabric feels like a soft breathable canvas.Ever since my first pregnancy I have had back pains that are aggravated by carrying children. The Boba provides quite a bit of support for my back, and among the Moby, Baby Bjorn, baby slings, and the Boba, the Boba seems to position my son so our center of gravity is optimal for my back.I am 5'4\" 130lbs and built completely different than my 5'6\" 100lb sister-in-law. I had her try the Boba for a few hours with her 1 year-old and she said, \"If I was not on my 3rd and last baby I would buy one of these in a flash `cause it is SO comfortable!\" Then my 6-foot tall sister in law tried it and found it comfortable as well. So it seems to fit a variety of builds and is easily adjustable by the wearer on the fly even with the baby in the carrier.I have read negative comments about the foot straps, but I really like them. They serve an important purpose. Our oldest child had to use a brace because her hip sockets were not deep enough. I have to wonder if having the Boba carrier for her would have made a difference because the straps keep their feet positioned like the brace did. The frog-like position that the Boba with foot straps puts their legs in is perfect for their developmentMy only complaint is that the Boba does not include a pocket. It seems like it would be very easy to create a small pocket to drop keys, a cell phone, and some credit cards into. I use the Boba carrier when I go shopping and I would really like to not have to carry a bag as well. I would even like a pocket large enough to hold a diaper, but don't think that is essential. Maybe an idea for Boba II?",

The investigation, which cleared Clinton and her aides, grows more suspect with every late-Friday document dump and WikiLeak release. A special prosecutor under a Trump administration could clarify disturbing and unanswered questions. It could also help cleanse the ethical and legal stain that has hallmarked Department of Justice in President Obama’s tenure.\n\nThe investigation’s flaws are manifest and growing. Tuesday’s release of John Podesta’s hacked emails revealed “DOJ folks” had apprised Clinton’s campaign of events in one email-related civil suit. What DOJ privately told Clinton operatives is paramount as it implicates partiality.\n\nBut even without illegally obtained sources, DOJ’s review of Clinton and close aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson raises questions only a subpoena-powered outsider can answer.\n\nMills and Samuelson are key figures as Clinton charged them with sorting emails before a technician “bleached” the private server. An earnest search for truth would have leaned hard on those two subordinates. The opposite happened here.\n\nContravening both ethics rules and possibly federal law, DOJ treated the aides with a deference reserved for foreign dignitaries at a state dinner. It allowed both to claim an implausible attorney-client privilege to avoid questions about the server’s set up and operation and incredibly let Mills attend Clinton’s FBI interview as a “personal attorney.”\n\nDOJ left unchallenged the aides’ “personal attorney” claim despite working with Clinton at State in non-legal policy roles. As fact witnesses and possible accomplices, legal ethics rules barred them from representing Clinton, as did their status as former government officials involved the case. Finally, federal law prohibits former government officials from trying to influence an investigation they were involved in, as a “personal attorney” presumably would.\n\nAnd before taking the aides’ evidence-stuffed personal computers, DOJ granted them immunity and allowed irresponsible restrictions. The feds immunized Mills and Samuelson for any illegalities found on their computers and didn’t search for documents dated after January 31, 2015. Immunity was unnecessary; DOJ could have convened a grand jury and subpoenaed the computers. And the January cutoff omits any conversations the two had with the technician who “bleached” the server on March 31.\n\nAmazingly, amidst Congressional investigations and FOIA suits, DOJ apparently agreed to destroy the computers and any potential evidence therein. The House Judiciary Committee has asked DOJ’s Inspector General to review the handling of Mills and Samuelson.\n\nThe investigation’s flaws should not surprise. It continues DOJ’s politicization throughout Mr. Obama’s tenure. Yet it’s unrecognized by former Attorney General Eric Holder who tweeted after Trump’s “jail” remarks:\n\nIn the USA we do not threaten to jail political opponents. @realDonaldTrump said he would. He is promising to abuse the power of the office — Eric Holder (@EricHolder) October 10, 2016\n\nHolder’s implied claim to rule-of-law purity is risible.\n\nDOJ criminally prosecuted conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza for a minor campaign finance violation — pushing a stiff jail term — while ignoring Obama’s hefty 2008 campaign transgressions.\n\nJustice oversaw the illegal transfer of 1.25 million pages of conservative nonprofit’s tax returns including protected donor information from Lois Lerner to its criminal division during the 2010 midterms.\n\nThe feds also raided a guitar maker with Republican ties on bogus wood-importing charges while ignoring the same behavior from his Democrat-supporting rival.\n\nAnd the House held Holder in contempt over ‘Fast and Furious’ obstruction.\n\nCurrent Attorney General Loretta Lynch met with former President Clinton for 30 minutes during the crucial charging-decision phase of the email investigation to supposedly chat about topics including Mr. Clinton’s golf game. And under her watch U.S. Attorneys have lied so openly in once case the judge wanted them retrained.\n\nThe email-scandal fallout should have left DOJ embarrassed and contrite. But justice was seemingly secondary to massaging a political problem. Given DOJ’s posture over the past eight years that is unsurprising. A special prosecutor could help find justice at Justice.\n\nJossey is a campaign finance lawyer in Alexandria, Virginia.

Adhiban has just scored half a point from the last round and had scored 2.5 points from 8 games. Chen’s score of 4.5 out 8 is far better considering his rating.\n\nThe four knights game between Wei Yi and Sasikiran was the third game to finish. A safer approach by Wei disallowed Sasi to unleash any tactics despite his Queen and knight being closer to White King. An attack on the f7 square by Wei forced Sasikiran to take a draw by repetition in 44 moves. Sasikiran ended up the event with no wins, scoring 4 draws and 4 losses, a lackluster performance from a player of his calibre. Much was expected in scoring terms from Wei Yi, who holds an impressive Elo rating of 2706.\n\nWith the match still tied by 1.5 points each, the onus was on Sethuraman to bring some consolation to the home team. The Zaitsev variation of the Ruy Lopez chosen by Ding Liren allowed less space to maneuver on both sides. At the end of the first time control Sethu missed a tactical shot on the 36th move to get the better of Ding. A rook sacrifice on the g6 square coupled with another piece would have exposed black king enough. An uncompromising attitude by both was a treat to the spectators, with Sethu going for the kill and Ding standing tall in defense. Sethu went for an unsound pawn sacrifice on the 62nd move, instead of going for piece exchange which would have ended in a draw. Ding went up by 2 pawns in the rook endgame and Sethuraman threw in the towel at the end of 74th move. Sethuraman was impressive in his 5/8 and Ding has the similar score for China.\n\nSri.

  "latent_13730": "World Cup favourites Spain suffered a shock defeat by Switzerland as South Africa 2010 served up its first major upset.\n\nThe European champions enjoyed almost total control of the game in Durban but were wasteful in front of goal and went behind after 52 minutes when a long ball eventually found its way through to Gelson Fernandes, who, after a series of errors, bundled it into the net.\n\nWith Barcelona trio David Villa, Andres Iniesta and Xavi unable to conjure a breakthrough, coach Vicente Del Bosque threw on Fernando Torres, Jesus Navas and Pedro, but to no avail as the Spanish slumped to only their second defeat in 49 games.\n\nThe result piles pressure on Spain, who were widely-tipped to finally end decades of underachievement on the game's biggest stage and Del Bosque's men could now be forced to face Brazil in the second round if they finish Group H as runners-up. Chile beat Honduras 1-0 in the earlier match.\n\nFor the unfancied Swiss, it was a historic first victory over the Spanish and another triumph in the glittering career of their German coach Ottmar Hitzveld.\n\nDel Bosque's men had quickly settled into their rhythmic short passing game and, with Switzerland struggling to get the ball out of their own half, the match came to resemble a training session.\n\nThe first real opening fell to Spain right-back Sergio Ramos, who received the ball in space on the right before dragging his shot wastefully wide, much to the anger of his better-placed team-mates Xavi and David Villa.\n\nMoments later, Iniesta slipped a pass through to Gerard Pique, who cut inside his man before firing straight at goalkeeper Diego Benaglio.\n\nThe next attack saw David Silva chip a delightful ball over the Switzerland defence for Iniesta, who was brought down on the edge of the area as he tried to get his shot away. Villa fired the resultant free-kick straight at the wall.\n\nThe Swiss were forced into a change midway through the half when former Arsenal defender Philippe Senderos limped off with a foot injury and was replaced by Steve Von Bergen.\n\nLone striker Villa looked skilful and lively, but when he finally found space in the box, he opted to pass, and chipped tamely across the face of goal.\n\nThe second half began in a similar vein until the Swiss took the lead with the first real attack of the game.\n\nA long goal-kick was flicked through to Eren Derdiyok, who bundled it past goalkeeper Iker Casillas and the falling Pique to leave former Manchester City midfielder Fernandes with a simple finish.\n\nSpain, who won all 10 of their World Cup qualifiers, looked visibly shaken and Del Bosque responded by sending on Torres and Navas just after the hour mark.\n\nIniesta and Torres both curled shots wide before former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso almost broke the crossbar with a stunning strike from just outside the area.\n\nWith Spain committing more men forward, the game became stretched and Switzerland came within a whisker of taking a 2-0 lead when Derdiyok cut inside Pique and Carles Puyol before flicking a shot which had Casillas beaten but bounced back off the post.\n\nThe last 10 minutes were a predictable Spanish onslaught but, with Torres looking rusty on his return from knee surgery, Spain seemed to run out of ideas as their efforts became increasingly desperate.\n\nAs it was, Switzerland held firm for a truly memorable victory - their first in a World Cup opener since 1954.",

  "latent_13803": "The history writing by the British was a deliberate and systematic effort. The British used history of India as a tool for demoralizing the natives. History of India was twisted, falsified and misinterpreted on a grand scale. In a letter dated December 16, 1868 the famous Indologist Max Muller wrote to the Duke of Argyll, the then Secretary of State of India, ‘India has been conquered once, but India must be conquered again and that second conquest should be a conquest by education’.. (Ref: ‘The Life and Letter of F. Max Muller, edited by Mrs. Max Muller, 1902, Vol.1, p.357). Prof. Max Muller was not just a philosopher, he was also an examiner for the Indian Civil Service (ICS) examination. Teaching of falsified history played a great part in this ‘second conquest’.\n\nWho were these British history writers ? They were mainly army officers and administrators of the East India Company. For example: Major General John Malcolm – A Memoir of the Central India (1824)\n\nCaptain Grant Duff – History of the Marathas (1826)\n\nGen. Briggs – History of the Rise of Mohammedan Power in India (1829)\n\nLt.Colonel James Todd – Anals and Antiquities of Rajasthan (1829-32)\n\nM. Elphinstone (Resident at Peshwa Court, later Governor of Bombay), History of India (1841)\n\nJoseph Cunningham (brother of Gen.A.Cunningham) History of Sikhs (1849)\n\nLt. R.F.Burton – History of Sindh (1851) Thus this is akin to victors writing the history of the vanquished. How many American Western movies depict the generosity and the bravery of the native Americans ? Do you know of a single British movie depicting the courage, intelligence and skill of the German and Japanese soldiers? Hence we can imagine what kind of ‘history’ these British officers and administrators must have written or the slant there in.\n\nBut these very books became standard textbooks in India and were prescribed for teaching the later day examinees of the Indian Civil service and the Indian army.\n\n2. Effect of British Version of History on Indian Leaders\n\nSince almost all our leaders were educated under the British system this slanted history had tremendous impact on the psyche of our leaders. By learning such history our leaders developed a severe inferiority complex, and suffered from loss of self confidence and self esteem. They started despising their ancestors. They became convinced that unless they followed the West blindly, borrowed ideas, concepts and technology from her India had no salvation. Let us see what our leaders were saying over the years: “These (British) Gurus have been sent by God from far off lands” G.H. Deshmukh alias Lokhitawadi in 1848 CE in Shatapatre no.46. This view was also shared by Justice M.G.Ranade and Mahatma Phule. “It must indeed be considered our good fortune that when Christian missionaries set out to spread Christianity in the world, they did not forget India…” Keshavachandra, Brahmo Samaj leader in 1860 CE.\n\nMahatma Phule started Satya Shodhak Samaj (Society for Search of Truth) in 1873 CE. Everyone joining the society had to take an oath of allegiance to the British Crown. “How can Hindus, who were ruled by Muslims for 700 years and are being ruled by the British for last 75 years claim to have a glorious past?” – G.G.Agarkar in ‘Sudharak’ (Reformer) in 1885 CE. Of course Agarkar would not say the same about the Spaniards or the Portuguese who were ruled by the Arabs for 600-700 years. Agarkar’s native Maharashtra was ruled by Muslims for 380 years (1296 to 1674 CE) and not 700 years, but that did not matter). Gopal Krishna Gokhale founded Servants of Indian Society in 1905. The members of this order were committed to a frank acceptance of the British connection as ordained in the inscrutable dispensation of Providence for India’s good (Ref: Political India 1832-1932′,J.Cunning ,editor, 1932, p.186). This despite the horrors of British administration during the plague outbreak of 1897 and 7 years of suppressive reign of Curzon (1898-1905). ‘The Hindus’ has been a life of continuous defeat. It is a mode for survival of which every Hindu will feel ashamed’– Dr.Ambedkar in 1937. Even the anti-Hindu writer of ‘Early History of India’ like Vincent Smith dismisses such fantastic statements. Savarkar wrote a resounding reply to Ambedkar’s outburst and said ‘What Ambedkar says is false. Hindus have survived the onslaughts of the foreigners over the centuries because of their bravery. But even if what Ambedkar says were true, should he not be determined to avenge past defeats ?’ Amazing ! What kind of history of India was taught to our leaders ?\n\n3. British Version of Indian History\n\nThe history of India, written by British authors was, in a nutshell, as follows: Until the invasion of India by Alexander the Great, there was nothing worth mentioning in India. After Alexander, the Greeks taught civilization to Indians, and gave them the Western ideas. Then came the Shakas, Huns, Kushans etc. They also kept teaching the natives. In the eighth century Mohammed bin Kasim invaded India. It marked the begining of the Muslim rule. Then came the Ghazanvis, Ghoris, Gulams, Turks, Afgans, Khiljis, Tughalaqs, Lodis and Mughals. They were very brave and noble. They carried out reforms after reforms. Lastly came the English. They could not tolerate the prevailing anarchy. ‘We rule India’ they said. Some kings accepted their protection. Those who resisted, collapsed like a deck of cards. The British taught peace and prosperity to this troubled land. Under them everyone is happy. They introduced rule of law which Indians never knew before. Thus the history of hindus (according to the British) is as dark as coal tar. There is nothing in it to be proud of. It is natural that only foreigners should rule India. The best the natives can do is to serve the British by becoming their obedient servants. Why could Indians not counter them with our own version of history ?\n\n4. Neglect of History in India\n\nIt must be admitted in all fairness, that it was the British who first wrote the history of India. The Hindus probably are the only race, who despite having such intelligence, bravery and tremendous capacity for successive revivals, have showed such pathetic neglect of history.\n\nThere was utter lack of historical sense. Lokamanya Tilak writes ‘.. Even if we read the whole of Harsha-Charita by Banabhatta, we cannot make out when did this famous king rule or what was the extent of his kingdom ? Had it not been for the Chinese traveller Hsuen Tsang (and the English scholars who translated his memoirs from Chinese into English) we would have never known the history of Harsha ..’. Records were not properly kept and where they were kept they were not preserved. Even today very important documents are getting rotten and destroyed by insects, in many families, but the owners will not give them to historical societies. History as a subject did not always have a place in education. For example, Maharaja of Jaipur, JaiSingh I never learned about the history of Bappa raval, Prithvi raj Chuhan, Mahmud of Ghazni, Mohammed Ghori and others. During the upbringing of Peshwa Bajirao I, he learnt nothing about the East India Comapny and its resistance to Shivaji at Surat, the history of the Mughals or the history of Maratha-Mughal struggle. Far reaching consequences of such neglect were never realized. A true historian should have the ability to doubt the validity of currently held beliefs in light of new evidence. reject the traditional line of thinking when it becomes evident that it was based on wrong assumptions or weak, flimsy foundations. Analyze the evidence critically and establish the facts based on common sense, reason and logic. All this was cleverly disallowed by the British. Historical research was reduced the drab work of compiling data and translation of documents. The faculty of interpretation was strongly discouraged.\n\nIt is therefore essential that Indian history be rewritten.\n\n5. Rewriting Does Not Mean Fabrication\n\nIt must be emphasized that rewriting of Indian history does not mean fabrication, as was done by the Nazis or the Communists. Savarkar wrote in 1937 : ‘ To praise one’s ancestors out of affection for them may be foolish, but humane. However to tolerate deliberate denunciation of the ancestors without challenging the allegations is disgraceful. Because such falsehoods, if repeated often will make us lose self respect and confidence’. ‘Only those people avoid mention of their defeats in the past that are not strong enough to avenge the defeats’. ‘When writing history the writer must write the events as they happened. He should not concern himself about the effect of that writing on present situation. .. It is natural to write about glorious deeds of our forefathers, but we are reluctant to describe disgraceful event or disasters, defeats. A historian must avoid such hiding of facts. Whatever happened in the past it should be described as it happened…’\n\n6. Late Awakening\n\nThere were some scholars during the British Raj who realised the importance of history in nation-building. They were furious at the state of affairs. Rajwade, Vasudevshastri Khare and others started work around 1900 CE. The formidable task of collecting and compiling evidence was so immense that Rajwade could not foresee the starting of writing of the History of the Marathas, in his life time. In 1907 Savarkar came to London. After studying the contemporary British books in India Office Library he concluded that he had to reject the traditional view of the Great Revolt of 1857. It was not a Sepoy Mutiny as commonly believed. The British authors themselves do not use the term Sepoy Mutiny, instead they call it Indian Mutiny. Savarkar Proclaimed that it was a War of Independence in which everyone from the Maharajas to the road sweepers took part. His book was promptly proscribed even before its publication ! Savarkar protested on September 17, 1909 ‘If my book is seditious, why does not the Government show courage to take me to court ?’ The British Authorities did not prosecute Savarkar for his book. Such is the importance of true history. In 1991 Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal (Indian Society for Historical Research) was formed.\n\nIn 1918 Mr.N.C.Kelkar, one of Lokamanya Tilak’s lieutenants, published a book “Marathas and the English’ which dismissed the traditional theory that Marathas lost due to internal dissensions, lack of unity and lack of foresight. In 1923 Major B.D.Basu wrote ‘The Story of Satara’ exposing the barbaric behavior of the British to Maharaja Pratapsingh of Satara who was falsely accused and dethroned in 1839. G.S.Sardesai’s ‘New History of Marathas’ came out in 1946 exactly 120 years after Grant Duff’s History of the Marathas. Incalculable damage had been done in 120 years. But the awakening had begun. The question then arises, why did not things change after the British left India in 1947 ?\n\n7. Appeasement of Muslims By Congress Leaders\n\nThe reason why Indian history was not rewritten much after 1947, is to found in our freedom struggle. Gandhi returned to Indian in 1915 and after Lokmanya Tilak’s death became the leader of the freedom struggle. Gandhi himself had shamelessly supported the British during the British -Boer war, British-Zulu war (also known as Kaffir Wars) and the World War I. In fact, Gandhi volunteered to organize a brigade of Indians to put down the Zulu uprising. Sergeant-Major Gandhi, the deputy commander of his cops – himself carried the stretcher of the mortally wounded British commanding officer from the Zulu war battle field for miles over the sun-baked veldt. Thence he was awarded Victoria’s coveted War Medal for valor under fire. However by the time of his return to India Gandhi was so obsessed with Ahimsa (non-violence) that he condemned Rana Pratap, Shivaji and Guru Govind Singh for their armed struggle. Savarkar proclaimed ‘We Hindus on our own can win our freedom from the British’. Gandhi lacked Savarkar’s confidence and conviction. This led to his perpetual capitulation to Muslim demands and finally culminated in the horrors of partition. After the horrible Mopla riots in 1921 when over 5000 Hindus were killed by the Moplas of Malbar. But Gandhi had no hesitation calling them ‘My brave Mopla brothers!’ In December 1926 when a fanatic Muslim Abdul Rashid killed Swami Shraddhananda who had converted thousands of Muslims to Hinduism, Gandhi immediately pleaded that Brother Abdul Rashid’s life be spared. But he refused to plead for life of Bhagat Singh and others only six months later. In 1938 Hindus launched an unarmed struggle for their legitimate rights in Hyderabad state, Gandhi did not support them and said ‘I do not want to embarrass the Nizam’. Congress was in power in C.P., U.P., Bihar, Orissa, Bombay and Madras from 1937 and 1939. Not once the Congress ministers stood up to unreasonable demands of the Muslims. The same lieutenants became chief ministers of various states in 1946. After independence Nehru’s secularism always meant capitulation to Muslims and anti-Hindu politics. Thus under Nehru years and early Indira Gandhi rule Gandhian appeasement hangover was still intact. It must be noted that during all the Lok Sabha elections after 1947, the Congress party todate has NOT EVEN ONCE received even 50 percent of popular vote. Thus a 10 percent vote swing can change the power equation in New Delhi. Under these conditions, Muslim vote bank had disproportionate importance. Thus in later years (particularly after emergency) capitulation to the Muslim demands and appeasement became a tool for staying in power.\n\nIn the zeal for retaining the power, true history has become the first victim.\n\n8. Effect of Appeasement of Muslims\n\nEncyclopedia of Britannica says “Hindu Architecture .. It should be noted that there exists in India a vast technical literature known as Shilpa Shastra.. dating back to Gupta period perhaps much earlier, the medieval compilations are still in use by Indian Architecture.” The first victim of appeasement is Hindu architecture which is not taught at all in the Architecture and engineering schools. What ever insignificant part is taught is taught with Greek or Roman titles under ‘Indo-Sarcenic architecture’. Veer Savarkar delivered lectures in 1950-51 exposing how the Indian history is written with a strong anti-Hindu slant. These later appeared in newspapers. However no publisher dare publish his book ‘Six Glorious Epochs of Indian History’ (This book destroys the myth that Hindus suffered defeat upon defeat, and asserts that Hindus survived aggressions because they fought tooth and nail to preserve their religion and culture. A MUST READ BOOK FOR ALL HINDUS – you have read British and Muslim Version of your history, why not read your own side of it.) foreign invaders. A school in Bombay used to teach Gita as the part of studies. It was not objected to by the British. But in 1963 Education Department of Maharashtra threatened to stop the Government grant until Gita teaching is stopped. Of course the government provides grants to Madrsas and convents without hesitation. Nehru even wanted to remove word ‘Hindu’ out of Benaras Hindu University, but not the word ‘Muslim’ from Aligarh Muslim University. When Abdul Reheman Antulay was chief minister of Maharashtra, a deputation of Muslims demanded following: Urdu should be a compulsory subject in schools\n\n25 % of seats in Police and Civil Service be reserved for Muslims\n\nGovernment land be given to build mosques After this, an Urdu Academy was started in Maharashtra. Government newspaper Lokrajya is now published in Urdu and Marathi. There are no prizes for guessing how many people in Maharashtra speak Urdu (If you consider Muslims from Miraj as Urdu speakers, you must be calling Bombay Hindi as the best Hindi ever spoken). Urdu was made second state language in Bihar in December 1980 even though the regional language Maithily spoken by 5 times more people was denied the status. In U.P. Urdu was made a second language in February 1982. In December 1981, Indira Gandhi recognized the Moplas as patriots, freedom fighters despite their barbaric atrocities on Hindus in 1921. July 18, 1982 issue of ‘Shree’ a Marathi weekly from Mumbai carried an article by Mr.D.B.Pradhan entitled ‘Pre-Islamic Vedic Religion in the Gulf States’. Government of Maharashtra immediately banned the issue under the pretext that it hurt sentiments of Muslims. Mumbai High Court later declared the ban illegal. The most flagrant and unashamed example of Muslim appeasement came under V.P.Singh who declared Prophet Mohammed’s birthday an Indian national holiday. In his obsession for Muslim appeasement he did not realize that the birth and death of Prophet Mohammed fall on the same day. That day, Id-e-Milad was already a national holiday! Last year Doordarshan started a Urdu news broadcast in Banglore even though there are more people in Karnatak speaking Marathi, Telugu, Tamil than Urdu. These led to riots when Muslim pelted stones from a mosque on a peaceful procession. During the past 5 years how many times have you heard from the GOI about the 300,000 Hindus from kashmir valley who are refugees out by in their own country. How many times has GOI spoken about rights of minorities in Kashmir valley ? None of the recent 3 prime ministers ever bothered to visit refugee camps even in New Delhi.\n\nMeanwhile GOI provided free plane rides to evacuate mostly Muslim Indians from Kuwait and Iraq in 1992.\n\n9. Appeasement of Muslims Leads to Falsification of History by GOI\n\nIn December 1937, Savarkar said ” Following appeasement of Muslims, the government is now trying to pervert history. It is well known that in 1318, Harpaldev of Devagiri was skinned alive by Kutb-uddin Khilji of Delhi. This fact is hidden and the history books tell us that he was simply arrested. Sambhaji, the brave Maratha king was also tortured to death by Aurungzeb. But history books say that he too was simply arrested. How shameless can they be!” In the same year Savarkar wrote “Look at the present attempt by Gandhi and his followers to suppress the atrocities of Muslim rulers and even glorify them (for e.g. Siraj-uddaula and Tipu) .. But has this perversion stopped the riots and the arrogance of Muslims ? No.. It is nonsense to say that if we describe the battles or conflicts of the past, the present generation will fight battles again!” The practice of perverting history continues. Here are some examples: In the medieval times the main source of government income was the land revenue. Under Hindu rulers its used to be 16 %. Under Akbar it became 33 %. It stayed same under Jehangir. Under the ‘Golden’ rule of Shah Jahan it was raised to 50 % and it stayed the same during Aurungzeb who added Jizya tax on Hindus. Under Allauddin Khilji the land revenue also was 50 %. This information is kept out of history books. We are taught that in 1303 CE Allauddin Khilji defeated Rajputs and captured Chitod Fort. But we are never told that Hamer Singh, a Rajput prince defeated and recaptured the fort 10 years later. It is well known that Prophet Mohammed fled from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE. Muslims all over the world accept the fact. But in 1982 under pressure from Muslims Maharashtra government ordered that word ‘fled’ must be deleted. So now it reads that Prophet Mohammed went from mecca to Medina in 622 CE. Even Nehru would have been amazed by this because in his book ‘Some Glimpses of World History’ he does say that Prophet Mohammed fled from mecca to Medina. In 1982 the Central Ministry of Education issued guidelines for writing and teaching of Indian history which among other things forbid describing the medieval period as a period of conflict between Hindus and Muslims. In short, Shivaji’s virtues should not be glorified and Aurungzeb’s bigotry and despotic nature must not be described ! In 1982 Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in their publication ‘Taj Museum’ admitted that on the site of Taj Mahal stood the mansion (manzil) of Raja Man Singh which was at the time of in possession of his grand son Raja Jai Singh. So what happened to the mansion ? The answer is simple. It is the same as Taj mahal. But that much ASI official would not concede. In 1984 Prof.Marvin Mills wrote Director General of Archaeological Survey of India that the Taj dispute be settled by scientific tests on brick samples taken on 20 locations. The Director General replied “The Taj is well dated on documentary evidence. BARC, Bombay and PRL, Ahmedabad are also seized of the problem. (this was a lie. Both the labs did not receive any samples for testing) and IT IS NOT CONSIDERED DESIRABLE TO HAVE ANY FURTHER INVESTIGATION AT THIS STAGE. Such has been Government of India. What about the historians ?\n\n10. Attitude of Indian historians\n\nIn 1984 , the discovery of so called Hitler’s diaries by Stern Magazine created an international sensation. Initially the British historian Prof. H.T.Roper said the diaries were authentic. Later when the diaries were found to be forgeries, Prof. Roper candidly admitted “If I am wrong, I am wrong. .. even experts can err”. Indian historians lack such intellectual honesty. Let us look at following examples. Historicity of many theories has not been challenged by Indian historians. In December 1963, the ‘Hazarat Baal'(supposedly Prophet Mohammed’s hair) disappeared from the shrine in Srinagar. It was ‘found’ a few days later. Firstly, no Indian historian has bothered to ask that if even Mecca and Medina do NOT contain any relics of the Prophet, where did this hair come from 700 YEARS AFTER THE PROPHET’S DEATH ? Also no Indian historian has asked that since the Hazrat Baal, the hair disappeared in 1963 and reappeared a few days later, is it the same hair ? Suddenly all the historians consider it an authentic historical relic. Second of course is the case of Taj mahal. Shah Jahan’s ‘Badshahnama’ which is the only major Mughal document the British did NOT translate (perhaps intentionally) categorically states that it was Raja ManSingh’s palace that was taken over by Shah Jahan. In 1968 when P.N. Oak published his theory based on his translation of Badshahnama, suddenly those very pages were declared irrelevant and out of context by Indian historians. If Mr. Oak’s translation is wrong then why do the Indian historians have courage to publish word to word translation of the Badshahnama as Mr. Oak has done or accept his translation. Two letters exposing falsity of Taj Mahal legend by Mr Oak, et al. were published in the internationally renowned ‘Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Journal in June and September 1980. No architect or historian has challenged these letters. Indian historians have of course kept quiet. The most glaring intentional scientific fraud by historians under government payroll, came after December 6, 1992. During the destruction of Babri structure various remnants of the pre-existing temple surfaced. These included a shila-lekh describing the origin and scale of a magnificent temple at the very site of Ram Janma Bhumi, several intricate carvings and an image of Shri Ram. Instead of verifying or falsifying the historicity of the evidence in the field, 70 of these ’eminent’ historians and archaeologists (from JNU) took at out full page advertisements in national newspapers the very next day proclaiming ‘the evidence was planted’. Of course they did not want to perform scientific tests on the evidence. What if the truth is revealed ? Of course no Indian historian questioned why only the key pages from Babarnama, for the 3 months of 1528 CE during his stay in Ayodhya are missing ?\n\n11. Reasons for the attitude of Indian historians\n\nThe reason for the deliberate distortion of history by Indian historians is that they are afraid to lose their jobs or the government patronage. What kind of a job would a history professor get if he is branded a Hindu reactionary and sacked ? Also what will happen to their historical societies if the government patronage were stopped. ALL THIS IS UNDERSTANDABLE. but then they should at least admit that their work has limitations, their freedom is restricted and that they do have to bow to political pressure. But THEY PRETEND OTHERWISE and mislead the people. Let us look at another example of how the government pressurizes historians to conform to its ‘party line’.\n\nB.M. Purandare’s predicament: Mr. B.M.Purandare has to his credit “Raja Shiv Chhatrapati”. But he also maintains silence on subjects like Padmini and Taj Mahal. Here is how the Congress government makes him silent. Mr. Purandare raises money for many charitable causes, from his lectures on Shivaji. An institution (a school, orphanage, a trust etc) would arrange his lectures. The money raised by ticket sales would be given to Mr.Purandare, which he would promptly donate to the relevant charity. A noble act indeed ! But the ‘secular’ government officials did not see it that way. Income tax officials said that the money thus raised was given to Mr.Purandare. So it is his income and as such he must pay tax on it ! While the Maharashtra Government officers maintained that by delivering lectures on Shivaji, Mr.Purandare was entertaining people. As such he must pay entertainment tax ! After a great deal of public outcry Mr. Purandare’s lectures were given exemption from the entertainment tax. But Mr.Purandare knows well that the secular government can remove that exemption any time and therefore he cannot expose its Muslim appeasement. Isn’t it amazing that Maharashtra Government considers movies on Gandhi and Ambedkar exempt from entertainment tax, but lectures on Shivaji for a charitable organization are not exempt ? (Other examples of historians maintaining silence despite evidence to the contrary are Mr.D.V.Potdar, Dr.G.H.Khare, Mr.Setu Madhavrao Pagdi and Prof. Ram Nath.)\n\n12. Conclusion\n\nSo dear reader, neither the Government of India nor the Indian historians are going to write the true history of India. Not only that, Government of India is perverting Indian history in the name of national integration ! If you feel uneasy and annoyed at the state of affairs and are concerned about the fate of the nation it is for you to help us. Remember the teaching of falsified history affects us all, whether we stay in India or abroad. It molds our mentality.\n\nIt determines how we behave with one another and with non-Indians and what is more important, how non-Indians treat us.",

SPEAKING OF WHICH (what a damned good segue), here's a new trailer. I'm sad about the art, which has lost a lot of crunchy detail in the move away from pixel art, but hey, it's still Day of the Tentacle.",

  "latent_13934": "Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nJERUSALEM - Israel believes Syria has retained caches of combat-ready chemical weapons after giving up raw materials used to produce such munitions under pressure from foreign powers, a senior Israeli official said on Thursday.\n\nSummarizing Israeli intelligence estimates that were previously not disclosed to avoid undermining the Syrians' surrender of their declared chemical arsenal, the official said they had kept some missile warheads, air-dropped bombs and rocket-propelled grenades primed with toxins like sarin.\n\n\"There is, to my mind, still in the hands of Syria a significant residual capability ... that could be used in certain circumstances and could be potentially very serious,\" the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.While saying Israel had a \"high degree of confidence\" in its information, he declined to give figures for chemical weapons allegedly kept by Syria, citing secrecy concerns as well as the possibility some had been destroyed or used by President Bashar Assad's forces.\"What we are saying is that there are a number of questions here that still have to be clarified, still have to be looked at very closely\" by international inspectors, the official said.Israel is an old foe of its northern Arab neighbor and in April 2013 its intelligence service was the first to accuse Assad's regime of using chemical weapons against areas held by Syrian rebels in the on-going civil war.Western powers soon echoed the charge and Washington threatened Damascus with air strikes.Assad agreed to give up the chemical arsenal, which Damascus had previously not acknowledged having. However, he denied his forces had used them and accused rebels of such attacks.International diplomats told Reuters this week that Syria had revealed a previously undeclared research and development facility and a laboratory to produce the ricin poison.Those disclosures appeared to support Western assertions in recent months that the Assad regime had not been fully transparent in detailing its chemical weapons program.GAME-CHANGERThe Israeli official said the 1,300 tonnes of mustard gas and precursors for sarin and VX surrendered by Syria largely matched Israeli assessments of its total stockpile of such materials. The shelf-life of any deployable munitions held back was limited given the chemicals' deterioration, he added.Those assessments appear to contribute to overall Israeli relief at the Syrian chemical disarmament, even if Assad has reneged in part. The Israeli official voiced confidence that \"our deterrence\" - usually a coded reference to Israel's superior military and assumed nuclear arsenal - would continue to keep Damascus in check.Using chemical weapons against Israeli targets, even on a small scale, \"wouldn't be a game-changer, it would be a game-ender\" for Syria, the official said.He was less sanguine, however, when asked about the possibility that Islamic State insurgents in Syria and Iraq might get hold of Assad's remaining chemical weapons.Israel had no indication that this had happened, he said, indicating Israeli intelligence knew where Assad's remaining chemical arms were kept and that these sites were still safe - something he declined to confirm or deny directly.\"I haven't seen any information that they (Islamic State) have received them. I would not be surprised if they are interested, though, in receiving them,\" he said.While using higher-yield munitions like air-dropped bombs might be beyond the insurgents, they could easily launch attacks with \"a bunch of grenades with sarin\" if this became available, the official added. He noted Israel's concern at the entrenchment of Islamist rebels along its ceasefire line with Syria in the occupied Golan Heights.According to regional sources, Israel has on several occasions bombed sites in Syria to thwart the suspected handover of conventional weapons from Assad to allied Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas. Israeli officials have not formally confirmed carrying out the strikes but say they are poised to take similar action to prevent insurgents getting chemical weapons.\"When we have seen things that we are concerned about, whatever has been done has been done, and that's it. We have been very careful not to be sucked in. So that policy will continue,\" the Israeli official said.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_14008": "The case of Julia Trigg Crawford versus the Keystone XL oil pipeline will soon return to the headlines.\n\nCrawford, a northeast Texas farmer, is fighting to keep TransCananda, the pipeline’s owner, from invoking the right of eminent domain to cross her property. A Lamar County judge ruled against her last month, but Crawford says she plans to file an appeal soon — probably to the state’s 6th Court of Appeals in Texarkana.\n\n“We feel good about a panel of judges” hearing the case for the court, she says.\n\nEminent domain rules, the issue at stake in the Crawford case, allow pipelines or other utilities to cross the property of unwilling landowners (who get compensated). Texas has thousands of pipelines, but the Keystone XL has drawn national attention because it would transport an especially dirty form of oil, a prospect that infuriates environmentalists.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nBut Crawford’s case is only the most visible in what some legal experts describe as a rising tide of property-rights cases across Texas. Just last week, the Texas Supreme Court handed down four decisions on land-use issues, including a ruling that allows the city of Austin to take over a downtown block belonging to lawyer Harry Whittington for use as a parking garage and chilling station.\n\n“There is a lot more activity [on property-rights cases] down at the trial court level,” says Renea Hicks, a lawyer who worked on the city of Austin’s case.\n\nThe burst of activity stems from basic economic changes. The hydraulic-fracturing boom has increased oil and gas activity around the state, creating demand for more pipelines that cross private property. The wind-power boom, similarly, has resulted in the construction of major transmission lines in rural areas.\n\nDemographics also play a role, according to Matthew Festa, an associate professor at the South Texas College of Law. Texas’ population is growing quickly, and “the more neighbors you have, the more controversies [arise],” he says. That tension is evident in cities as well as rural areas; as an example, Festa cited the long-running clash in Houston over plans to build a 21-story luxury tower, known as the Ashby high-rise, in a residential neighborhood.\n\nFinding patterns in the way the Texas courts rule is more challenging. Partly that’s because the cases often hinge on specifics. “Land-use cases are pretty fact-intensive,” Festa said.\n\nThe four property-rights-related Supreme Court decisions released Friday all went against landowners, though they were on different topics, ranging from the city of Beaumont's right to demolish a neglected building to a dispute over the admissibility of expert testimony and land values at the site of a natural gas processing facility.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nTerry Jacobson, a Corsicana lawyer involved in a case (also decided Friday) involving plans for swampland on the site of a potential future reservoir in Titus County, described it as \"Black Friday for pro-property rights.” Some earlier decisions, he said, had gone in the other direction. “Many lawyers who are involved in property-rights litigation had sensed maybe a positive trend in some of the more recent opinions of the court, but the results of last Friday suggest that perhaps our optimism was premature,” Jacobson said.\n\nMajor land-use cases that have drawn recent public attention include a beach-access case, in which a property owner won the right to keep the public off the beachfront after erosion had propelled her house essentially onto the beach. Another landmark case, decided in February by the Supreme Court, held that landowners own the groundwater beneath their land.\n\nOn eminent domain, legal experts cite two recent cases of particular importance. One, decided in August 2011, involved an East Texas farmer who contested the right of a company called Denbury to use eminent domain to build a carbon-dioxide pipeline across his land. He won, and the Texas Supreme Court refused several times — most recently last month — to rehear the case.\n\nThe other is the Keystone case. Some legal experts say that Crawford has an uphill battle. TransCanada argues that the pipeline will serve as a public vessel because other companies will be able to send oil through it, too. The case is “not necessarily a complicated legal issue, at least under Texas law, right now … as long as pipelines are open for public tie-ins, at least at a price,” said Timothy Mulvaney, an associate professor at Texas Wesleyan School of Law. He added that Texas has “delegated the eminent domain power to utilities in a very generous way — I’d say more generous than in many other states.”\n\nCrawford thinks she can win her case — and do so while bringing more public attention to the issue of eminent domain. “I’m hopeful that what we’re doing is at least shining a light on these loopholes and these flaws in the system,” she said.\n\nAnother court battle to watch for, says Festa of the South Texas School of Law, will be challenges over a state law on eminent domain passed last year. He cited no concrete case, as yet, but the law, Senate Bill 18, strengthened some requirements for companies seeking to use eminent domain powers. “That will be interesting to see which way [the Texas Supreme Court goes] on that,” he said.\n\nTexas Tribune donors or members may be quoted or mentioned in our stories, or may be the subject of them.

Sock won the regular season-ending Master Series 1000 tournament in Paris, rocketing the Kansas City resident into the Top 10 for the first time in his career, and qualifying him for the ATP World Tour Finals. The 2017 Finals, which are played in London, are reserved for the best eight players from the just-completed season. Sock is the first American playing in the event since Mardy Fish qualified in 2011.\n\nDel Potro narrowly missed qualifying for the Finals, with his inclusion coming down to the Paris event where he reached the quarterfinals. The Argentine’s late-season run included winning the Stockholm title and reaching the final in Basel.\n\n“We were saying over the summer that we already had our best field in history, but with Sock and Delpo’s incredible finish to 2017 and with the new trio who have signed with us —that puts it over the top,” said tournament director Mark Baron.\n\nQuerrey has enjoyed an amazing two-year run that began with his 2016 Delray Beach Open title. Since then, he has reached the quarterfinals or better at three Grand Slam events, made a semifinal appearance at Wimbledon, reached a career-high No. 13 ranking, and won ATP World Tour titles in Acapulco and Los Cabos to highlight his 2017 season.\n\nWhile Querrey will be making his 10th appearance in Delray Beach, the buzz surrounding the two young stars can’t be overstated.\n\n“These youngsters are two of the most exciting players on Tour,” said Baron. “Nick Kyrgios and Denis Shapovalov are going to be household names in tennis for years to come.”\n\nKyrgios, 22, followed his 2014 Wimbledon run with a breakout season in 2016, winning three ATP titles with six wins over Top 10 players and a career-best No. 13 ranking. He has continued to be among the world’s best in 2017, with three more wins over Top 10 players, a first Master Series 1000 final in Cincinnati and semifinal finishes at the Indian Wells and Miami 1000 series events.\n\nKyrgios, whose coaching team includes former ATP pro and Boca Raton resident Sebastien Grosjean, is looking forward to his first appearance in Delray Beach.\n\n“I am super excited to make my debut in Delray Beach,” said Kyrgios. “It is a place I know well and have very fond memories of as I’ve spent a lot of time in the local area over the past few years. I feel very comfortable in Delray and I look forward to stepping out in front of the great crowds and putting on a good show for the fans.”\n\nThe Israeli-born Shapovalov, chosen by his peers as the ATP’s “Most Improved Player of 2017,” was one of eight players to qualify for the ATP’s inaugural “Next Gen” Finals that features the world’s best under-21 players. The 18-year-old became the youngest player in the Top 100 in August—right on cue before breakout tournaments at the US Open and Master Series 1000 in Montreal.\n\nShapovalov upset del Potro and then-world No. 2 Rafael Nadal in front of home crowds on his way to the Montreal semifinal and then beat world No. 12 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to reach the fourth round at Flushing Meadows. Now he’s moved into the Top 50, and the ATP also chose him as its 2017 “Star of Tomorrow.”\n\nWhen the six players arrive in Delray Beach in February, the tournament could have five in the Top 20—a first for the ATP 250 series event.\n\nShapovalov’s first-round match has been scheduled for Tuesday, Feb. 20 in the 2:30 pm time slot, giving the day session an all-Canadian flair with 2017 Delray Beach Open runner-up Raonic featured in the 12:30 pm match.

  "latent_14267": "On the tenth anniversary of 9/11, I reached out to a Wall Street corporate lawyer turned yoga instructor, journalists and writers, and a former Army combat medic for their stories about how the terrorist attacks of that day changed their lives.\n\nStuart Dean, Wall Street corporate lawyer turned yoga instructor.\n\nFor seven years I was an attorney at Cahill Gordon & Reindel, a ‘Wall Street’ law firm, a few blocks east of what was the World Trade Center. From my office on the 17th floor I could see the South Tower and, beyond it, New Jersey, where I lived. My commute took me by train from Montclair to Hoboken and then by ferry to the World Financial Center: from there I would walk to Cahill’s offices and that typically meant I would cut across the plaza between the Twin Towers--usually around 9:00 am--sometimes a bit earlier, sometimes a bit later. And it was ‘around 9:00 am’ that the airplanes struck: the North Tower first before 9:00, the South Tower next, shortly after 9:00 am. But I was not there then. I was at home eating breakfast and heard about it on WCBS and then ran to the television. So my initial experience of 9/11 was much like that of millions of people. Well not quite. I happened to turn on the television right when the second plane hit the South Tower and I knew from the jet profile that it had to be a commercial airline. It is precisely because I was not there at that moment that I now realize it was, ironically, but uniquely traumatic for me. Why that is relates to the fact that lower Manhattan had been where I worked for 7 years. And why that is involves the possibility of having met one of the terrorists. And it involves being at a funeral when I could just as easily have been at work had I not felt the obligation to show respect for someone I barely knew. And it involves all the ‘familiar strangers’ of my pre-9/11 commute, strangers some of whose faces I never saw again--perhaps they were victims or perhaps their commute patterns simply changed as a result. I will never know, just as I will never know if I really met one of the terrorists. As well it involves the fact that I am no longer a part of the world I once inhabited: my career as a corporate attorney ended in 2009 and I now practice and teach Yoga. College at Tulane (class of ‘76) made me familiar with NO’s levees and Lake Pontchartrain: having grown up in New Mexico I was deeply suspicious of the ability of some man made hills to hold back water. When it rains in NM it is usually short but violent and the arroyos fill up quickly and dangerously. Every summer it seems there is at least one story of someone drowning. I walked often from the Tulane campus across Audubon Park to the Miss river. The question was never ‘whether’ but ‘when.’ I had a sense of impending doom. A change of career took me from NM to Ithaca (Cornell) for law school and then to NYC (Cahill Gordon & Reindel). While in law school the first bombing of the WTC took place. And I always had a sense that they would be back. I commuted from Montclair to Hoboken, then took the ferry to the World Financial Center/Merrill and walked from there in between the twin towers and down to my office at Water and Maiden Lane; my personal office was on the 17th floor, looking west, right up Cedar Street. The towers scared me. Not only were they, to me, hideously ugly, but I could not help but think that they remained, after the initial failed bombing, prime targets. They were analogous to the levies in NO: a disaster of some sort waiting to happen. There were many times when I would see a jet flying overhead and wonder--what if? One day in the late summer or early fall of 1999 or maybe 2000 I was in Battery Park right by where the subway stop is and a Middle Eastern teenager/man in oddly incongruous garb--a camouflage jacket--asked me ‘where is the WTC?’ The odd thing about that was all he needed to do was turn around and look up to have his question answered. For a moment I thought maybe I should tell someone: it was a “if you see something say something” (a slogan that only was adopted after 9/11) and regardless, I seriously doubt anyone could have done anything with the information of that brief encounter. But I was not there. A neighbor’s father had passed away and while we were not very close it seemed the right thing to attend the funeral. It was to have been on the 10th but then got postponed to the 11th. By the time we arrived at the church both towers had collapsed. It is a Catholic Church just north of route 3 in between Montclair and Clifton--on a hill where you could just see the smoke rising from lower Manhattan. As people gathered there everyone could only guess at the loss of life to our east. Some of the other attendees of that funeral had in fact been due at a breakfast meeting at Windows on the World. It was a week before lower Manhattan was even close to being open for business. Cahill was in a shabby ‘back office’ building--old enough that you could open your window if you wanted. But of course then you did not. The air was thick with the smoldering remains of the WTC and, as became apparent, it was a gigantic crematorium. Yes they have that sort of thing on the Ganges but they are ready for it and do it right. This was a slow painful gag inducing burn: metal, fibers of whatever sort and human bodies smoldering for weeks, months. The incense of hell. There is a line from the Gospel of John that seems as if it was written with this scene in mind. I started describing the smell--and it really was not just a smell--it was an immersion in an atmosphere that you sensed permeating your skin and body--to a friend who happened to have been in Vietnam in the late 1960s-early 70s. He stopped me mid-sentence holding up his hand: “I know that smell--those are bodies.” Lower Manhattan was for months a giant open air crematorium. No one talks about that. For months too, the narrow streets--some do not deserve the name--they are little more than alleys--had cables strung along and across them. It looked like someone was attempting to recreate a scene from the Monty Pythonesque movie Brazil. And for months the only way in and out of lower Manhattan for most NJ commuters was a ferry ride that instead of going directly across to the WFC was re-routed to South Port and forced to go at row boat speed. Why the speed limit was imposed is beyond me--the beginning I suppose of the obsessive overly cautious policies that have made travel of any sort these days annoying. But that meant that you had, especially in the evenings, a view of the twisted metal and smoke of the WTC--twisted tombstones. All of it illuminated with the garish Klieg lights. So 9/11 is not a day for me. It was, for me, months of living in and around horror. And I know all too well it is not just a day for the relatives of those who died and the suffering of the first responders and their families. Rather than the memory of what was the beautiful crystal clear blue sky of Tuesday September 11th what I have are memories of days and nights of smoke and stench. It also marks for me the beginning of a trajectory of personal change that is at least indirectly related to 9/11. Less than a year after 9/11--in late August 2009--I was laid off by Cahill. I should have seen it coming: my bonus for 2001 had been less than I expected and that was attributed to fewer hours billed than was considered acceptable. That seemed a particularly callous criterion to use considering that for at least two months following 9/11 corporate legal work was hardly proceeding normally for anyone. Furthermore, it seemed that Cahill in fact benefited from 9/11, as its shabby back office building was substantially renovated a year of two later, probably financed by government incentives to keep lower Manhattan from becoming a ghost town. But I managed to get a position in the legal department of Bank of America after that. That, though, ended with layoffs in early 2009 that followed the financial turmoil of 2008. I say ‘layoff’ but that is surely is a euphemism George Carlin would begrudge me using. To say you are ‘fired’ aligns the experience with the military metaphor of shell shock. That ultimately led to selling our house in Montclair and moving into an apartment in NYC. Combined with the fact that our daughters are now grown and have moved out (for the most part) creates for me a psychological as well as physical distance from the trauma of 9/11 and the prior life I had. But it is that distance that itself I now realize is itself traumatic. It is analogous to the phantom limb that amputees sense: it quite obviously is ‘not there’ and yet the sense that it is ‘there’ keeps coming back.\n\nLauren Rae Orsini, journalist and blogger.\n\nEncouraged by a middle school teacher, I managed to enroll in journalism class as a ninth grader. What I didn’t predict though, was all the older students in the class already being friends. I took to sitting in the corner by the TV, so it became my job to turn it on for the news-viewing section of the lesson. Except this time, I switched it on just in time for the second plane to crash. On the small, fuzzy screen, the events seemed completely removed from reality. Pearl Harbor had come out that summer, so it was hard to believe this wasn’t more special effects. Unlike the movies, though, nobody was sitting quietly. “Was that the Twin Towers?” someone’s voice quavered. It was. My family had just taken a trip to New York City in July. After seeing some of the sights, we’d decided to put off seeing the Towers until “next time.” My first thought was selfish in the way only fourteen-year-olds can be: “Now I’ll never get to see them.” And then the Pentagon exploded. I thought my teacher was a jaded cynic. A former journalist, she never seemed moved by the sometimes vivid newspaper clippings we covered in class. But now she seemed close to tears. The gravity of the situation was finally forcing itself into my self absorbed brain. My uncle worked in the Pentagon. Just about all of us knew people who worked in the Pentagon. Cell phone use was strictly banned at school, but nobody minded the rules that day. Everyone was on the phone, seeing if our families were okay. After I found out my uncle was fine (he worked two offices away from the impact), I still found myself shaking with worry for my friends who still hadn’t found out. Even then, I knew what I felt was nothing in comparison. This was the first news event of this magnitude in my lifetime, and the first time I realized how reliant we are on quick, accurate reporting. It was also the first time my introverted teenage self took a genuine interest in other people’s lives. We spent the rest of the day’s classes like zombies, transfixed by the news coverage on screen. That day, every class was journalism class.\n\nAnonymous.\n\nI was in Richmond, VA that day. Left the office where I was working around 10:30 that morning because the market never opened. Driving across the James River I kept looking up in the sky expectantly because that's what you did that day and couldn't believe how incredibly clear it was, no contrails, nothing -- all the flights had been grounded -- just deep, deep blue. It was very quiet. The contrast was overbearing. And I cried. At a toll booth a few miles later I looked over at a car next to me, a white sedan. A woman, blonde, maybe in her late 40s, was gripping the stirring wheel of her car. She was crying, too.\n\nRichard Rushfield, journalist and author.\n\nTen years ago, I was visiting New York, staying with a friend in Soho, a couple blocks above Canal Street. I had come to the city for a friend’s wedding, which had happened the previous Saturday and stayed on to visit for a few days more. That Tuesday I was planning to go museuming. I was to leave the next day. On September 11th I was awakened by a huge crashing sound. I lay in bed trying to figure out what I had heard. It sounded like a horrible car crash, but the sounds of the streets didn’t carry up to this apartment. Within moments it sounded as though every police siren in the city was going off down below. I lay trying to puzzle it out and my friend knocked on the door telling me to come look. His living room window framed a spectacular view of the Twin Towers. As I stumbled into the living room, I saw that one of them had a giant hole in its center and flames were pouring out. A friend called and said it had been a small UPS plane that had accidentally crashed into it. We stood watching out the window, trying to make sense of it for a while until from there other tower, we saw a huge explosion and a fireball fill the sky. I remember seeing the air filled with all the paper blown out of the building. After watching out the window, I decided to go down to the street and see what was happening. Layafette Avenue was filled with people streaming up from the financial district. As I got to the street, everyone was staring back up at the Towers, many crying, shaking their heads. I looked back up at them. Something looked wrong, but I couldn’t figure out what it was. I stared and said this doesn’t look right, something beyond the flame pouring out was amiss but I just couldn’t see it...Then I heard someone say, “I can’t believe they brought the whole thing down” and looked back up and realized there was only one, just one tower standing then. An hour or so later, I remember talking to a woman in her fifties, covered in soot, who told me in a calm, unemotional voice, like she was telling me what she had for lunch, how she had been leaving the tower with her best friend who had been hit by debris and killed. The woman was wiping at her jacket with napkins and said, “And now I don’t know how I’m ever going to get this jacket clean.” She kept wiping and wiping. Three days later, when the airport reopened I flew back to Los Angeles. It was very very quiet in the terminal. Across from me in the waiting area was a young middle eastern man with his father. I noticed his father was crying. On the plane, it seemed no one spoke the whole flight, or watched the movie or even read a book. For a while I tried to make sense out of what I had experienced, before deciding that this was not my tragedy to make sense of. What happened to those people wasn’t about giving a lesson to me about living life to the fullest or anything else. It was a terrible thing. I was about twenty blocks from it and that’s all I take away. When you witness something up semi-close, there’s a instinct to try and own your story, to see it as unique. But in the end, I decided my experience really wasn’t any different than people who were 20 miles away or watching it on TV in California. It was other people’s tragedy and we all witnessed it - and then witnessed it replayed over and over and over. And what we’re supposed to do with that I still don’t know.\n\nAngeliska Polacheck, writer.\n\nI was on the fourth and last day of a grueling cross-country train trip, headed back home to New Orleans from visiting my sister in Eugene, Oregon. As in any situation where humans are forced into tight quarters with each other for days at a time, factions formed, and alliances between various groups of old people, bad kids, and timid Mennonites solidified. Because I liked to play cards in the club car and smoked cigarettes, I found myself packed in with the bad kids. We orchestrated elaborate plans to heist mini-bottles of wine from the train bar, but were foiled by the irate conductors. We gambled and cursed and told tall tales to pass the time. I made friends with a teenage anarchist train-hopper kid from Gainesville, Florida. He was in his 20's but looked about 14, and was hopping around on crutches because he'd broken his leg jumping off a roof. This was the first time he'd ever ridden a passenger train, rather than just riding the rails for free. We made a little gang with this Czech cellist who turned out to be my neighbor down the street on Esplanade Avenue. We spent the night of September 10th locked in the ladies' lounge smoking his dirt-weed, while he regaled me with tales of New Orleans' queer underground mafia and the various politicians and crooks he'd had as lovers. He referred to himself as a \"Gun Moll\", but it took me a few times to understand what he was saying because his accent was so thick, and because he had gotten me so stoned. I fell asleep in my seat late that night in a stupor of stories and smoke, and was woken too early by my motley crew shaking me and jabbering excitedly about planes and explosions. The tiny anarchist waved his crutches in the air and crowed, \"It's so fucking awesome! Eight planes smashed into the Whitehouse, and the Pentagon! It's the apocalypse! It's finally happening!\" I groaned and rolled back into fetal position, feeling hungover and not at all ready to deal with what I was being told. The old folks had all turned grayer than before, and were shuffling around like scared cows. One of the old men reprimanded the crutch-kid for his excited outburst, telling him: \"This is nothing to be glad about, son. People have been killed, and our daughter was on a plane flying to New York today.\" No one had cellphones, laptops or any way to get information about what had really happened, except for the people with radios and televisions sequestered in their sleeper cars. Everyone milled around the dining car, scared and speculating wildly about what might be next. Our train got stopped in Houston so that every single bag could be searched for explosives. We were delayed in the Houston Amtrak/Greyhound station for ten hours, and I was out of food, cigarettes and money. Four days of sleeping curled up in my seat, surrounded by other humans, and watching the country jostle by had given me a fierce longing for the relative peace of home. You know it's bad when you find yourself craving the \"safety\" of a city like New Orleans, or the \"quiet\" of your apartment on the raucous corner of Bourbon and Esplanade. By the time we pulled in at 3am, I felt like a zombie. I walked out of the deserted station, feeling like I was still swaying with the rhythm of the train. Finally back after a month of travel, I sat in my parlor with my head in my hands and watched in shock as the first images I'd seen of the towers burning and falling were replayed over and over again. I felt nothing but horror, knowing what was coming next – the calls for war, retribution, and revenge. The world had changed – brutally, irrevocably, while I was in motion. I'm not sure that I ever caught back up to it.\n\nJaeson Parsons, former Army combat medic and creator of The Graffiti of War Project.\n\nI took the train into work that morning, making the early train, for once and arrived in downtown Chicago around 7:30. I took a cab to the office from the train station, as the train was running a bit late that morning. When I came out of Union Station, I noticed that where I usually found my cab was not taken up by what can only be described as federal vehicles. The dark black, dark tinted window SUV’s that the feds usually ride around in. I remember thinking whether President Bush was visiting Chicago today as that is the only reason I could figure out. I found my cab and headed to my office, asking the driver what was going on today with all the fed vehicles, he was the first person to let me know that a plane had hit the World Trade Center. My first thought, how the hell does a pilot miss a 110 story building at the tip of Manhattan? I really don’t remember thinking anything of it except a comment that I doubt that pilot will have a job after that. I walked into the trading floor for Refco and I knew something was up, the phones were ringing off the hook and Greg Cieply was unusually flustered for before 8 am. I sat down and started my work, grabbing trades, making markets and trying to get a handle on the exact situation we were dealing with. Our office was surrounded by flat-screen TVs with news feeds from all the major networks, CNN, CNBC, and NBC, etc. and all seemed to be showing the same smoke billowing out of 1 world trade. It was hard not to just stare at it. I was just mesmerized by what I was seeing. And then the unthinkable happened, we all saw the second plane hit on live TV. None of us said a word, for what seemed like minutes, but probably closer to seconds. My mind was frozen; I just couldn’t believe my eyes. The phone began chirping, one after another, and we were all in a fury of business, closing out trades, making markets for those who were trapped so they can begin to get out. We had a direct line to NYC to some of our trading partners, notably Cantor Fitzgerald, and Credit Suisse and they spent their precious minutes of life trying to ensure they closed out their trades so they wouldn’t leave their companies money on the table when it all came to a screeching halt, in a matter of minutes. Most of them would never make it out and that haunts me to this day. Our options trader, located just across the street was giving us a play by play of the events as they unfolded, telling us of the carnage, of the people jumping, sometimes falling, but other times, hand in hand. Thinking about that now, I cannot get through it without tearing up. Just the thought, of holding hands with the one you love on the way to certain death…..how could you not be forever changed after seeing that, my God, such a tragedy. Being in Chicago, a major financial center, many thought we might be in danger. In fact they evacuated the Sears Tower, but we remained open and were the only Forex desk outside in Chicago and New York that did so. Financially, we did well, but my love for the business drained from my soul on 9/11. Money, made on this tragedy, is blood money, ill-gotten gains. Watching those towers fall, I truly cannot express what that did to me and many of us. It was more than a building to us, more than a monument; it represented a part of humanity that was wiped out by some very sick men, so much loss, that there remains a giant hole in my soul to this day. Years later, I never got over that day, and my love for my job and making money in derivatives and foreign exchange was diminishing. The paychecks is what kept me doing what I continued to do. I was a natural they said, had the gift of gab, made people comfortable, was genuine, but by 2005 I just couldn’t do it any longer. During a dinner in New York with some old friends from the company, many of them joked how well the company did during 9/11 and how we should have more days like that. I left the dinner, got on a plane and signed up for the Army in less than a month. I wanted to make a difference and give something back to the country that lost so much, to those who sacrificed so much on that day and the days that continue during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. I miss the markets, sure, I miss the city, the bright lights, but I have earned my right to be a citizen of this nation, my right to say I gave something beyond myself, to stand with those men and women at ground zero and say to each of them, I gave something of myself for each of you as a remembrance of what you are, what you gave and what you and your family sacrificed and that can never be taken away from me.\n\nDan Solomon, freelance journalist.\n\nI was living in San Antonio, and I worked in a comic book store. I assumed that we'd probably be closed after the first tower fell -- who can think about comics at a time like that? -- but I called my boss and she told me that the store would be open as usual, and that I needed to go in. It was really empty for the first few hours, which is what I expected, but then around mid-day just about every one of the store's regulars stopped by for at least a little while. With that crowd, I don't think there are a lot of places they can go to feel like they're part of a community, which is what most of us seemed to want that day. I got to hear a lot from tough-guy nerds about what they'd have done if they'd been on the planes, which was such an absurd thing to hear that I found it almost hilarious, like these dudes would have summoned the power of the Iron Fist on the hijackers or something. But I also got it -- if you're the sort of person who's drawn to stories where a single brave hero can successfully stand in the way of unspeakable evil, you want to believe that it's the way the world really could work. It wasn't really about how tough or brave they'd have been, just about how scary the world is when you realize that things are so much more complicated than you think. Mostly, I just stayed behind the counter at this comic book store, playing bartender to a lot of lonely men who were looking for somewhere to go where things made sense.\n\nClaire Zulkey, author and blogger.\n\nIn September 2001 I was 22 years old and living at home with my parents in Evanston, IL: I had just graduated from college in June. I was late for work that morning partially because I didn’t like my job, partially because I was driving that day and let myself take more time to get ready than usual. I typically took the El into work but that morning I borrowed my dad’s car; he had meetings in Washington DC and then New York that day (and had tickets to the Yankees/White Sox game that evening, in hopes of seeing Roger Clemens win his 300th game.) I was eating cereal and listening to 93.1 WXRT when I heard news of a plane hitting the World Trade Center, but the way it was described, I thought it was a tiny prop plane that ran afoul and somehow bounced off the building or something. Driving down Sheridan Road to get to Lake Shore Drive, though, I heard the news announcer saying grimly “It’s getting worse,” talking about the second plane. I called my dad and left him a voicemail letting him know about the attacks. I almost hit another car, I was so distracted. Usually I walked from my dad’s office at the Prudential Building to my own but I was running so late I took a cab. When I started approaching my office, I got a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach; my office building was across the street from the Sears Tower. I got to work and nobody could focus--we were all online, trying to figure out what was going on, sitting down and then immediately jumping back up. “You guys can leave if you don’t feel comfortable,” one of the partners said, and for a moment I thought, “Nah, we’ll be OK,” but more than anything I realized that even if we were perfectly safe, there was no way in hell I’d be getting any work done that day. I offered a co-worker a ride home with me and we walked back to the Prudential Building (next to the Aon Center). The Loop was strangely busy yet strangely quiet for about 11:00 in the morning. In order to make myself feel better I nervously joked that I liked the knee-high high-heel boots on display in the window of the Sears near our office. We got to the Prudential Building and drove out. I was really happy once we got above lower Wacker Drive, because not being able to see the sky freaked me out a bit. I got home and learned that my dad was stuck in DC--he had landed fine and had taken the Metro into the city, stopping at the Pentagon within minutes of its attack but made it to his meeting, which was eventually canceled. He eventually rented a car and drove back to Chicago. I spent the rest of the day calling every single person in my cell phone who lived in New York or DC and, like the rest of the country, waiting to get more information and feeling frightened and helpless.\n\nAnonymous.\n\n9/11 was a good day for me. I had landed in Washington, D.C., on the evening of September 9 ready to find an apartment and start my first real job out of college. Between apartment viewings that Tuesday morning, I had retreated to a Dupont Circle cafe, perusing the Washington Post in print (remember those?). Then my Dad called, an early warning radar to tell me to get somewhere safe because terrorists had just flown a plane into the Pentagon. When I \"there you go again'd\" him about \"terrorists,\" he shut me up with \"a plane hit the World Trade Center, too.\" And, for a change, my Dad really shut me up. He was right. So new to Washington I felt really lonely, but I did not feel scared. \"The worst is over,\" I kept thinking. I ducked into another coffee shop with a TV and watched the 2nd tower fall, Aaron Brown narrating like an open wound from a rooftop for CNN, and then we were all whisked out of the cafe by its manager. It was weird to be so alone at a moment of such social panic. Maybe that's why I felt secure: I was by myself, which made it difficult to feed off of anyone else's fear or worry very easily. And that lack of sharing actually created some bemusement. I started walking south while all of workplace Washington was fleeing to the north. \"This must be exciting for all these office-workers,\" I mused as they sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic. \"They get to imagine that the work they do is worth targeting!\" You were probably a jerk when you were 23, too. My friend didn't have a TV, so I was wandering toward my office with my new co-workers, all of us crowded around a little television watching all the rumor, confusion and innuendo dressed as news. And it was in that office setting that it became clear why 9/11 was sort of a good thing for me. Our little thinktank working on security issues had feared that the new president would cut the budget for the programs we worked on - making us, in Washington terms, irrelevant. But suddenly, this terrorist threat that drove our agenda was real! It was my introduction to inside-the-beltway cynicism, the bending of the world's objective conditions to a set of self-interested concerns. And from that day forward, my laboring was lightened by a feeling that my work \"mattered\" because of what had happened on that Tuesday morning. For the next few years, just like so much of Washington, D.C., has ever since, I was making a buck off of 9/11. It was the rest of America, and the world, that would have to pay for me and all the other hucksters in Washington to have our \"good day.\" Of course, as we all know, we'll never stop paying for it in our lifetimes.\n\nDavid Abrams, novelist and former Army combat journalist.\n\nMy family and I were living in Anchorage, Alaska where I was serving in the Army as a sergeant first class. Dawn had just barely started seeping into the sky when my wife and I were snapped out of a deep sleep by the phone ringing next to our bed. It was my mother-in-law. \"Have you seen what's happening?\" \"What?\" my wife said groggily. \"Go turn on the TV, then call me back.\" We went downstairs, flicked on the TV and were just in time to see the smoking towers minutes before the first one crumpled, the hundreds of floors pancaking to the ground in a sickening cloud of dust, papers and human bodies. We were just waking up, but by this time, the rest of the world in earlier time zones had been dealing with the impossible-to-believe for at least an hour. As my wife and I watched the world change, we couldn't speak, could barely breathe. Without a word, I rushed back upstairs and started getting into my uniform, lacing my boots tight. I didn't even shower or eat breakfast. I knew I was needed at U.S. Army Alaska headquarters immediately. My mind was already racing ahead, trying to think of what we would do in the face of events like this. I realized that even my worst-case scenarios didn't include foreign invasions or death-by-jetliner. In that moment, I knew exactly how residents of Pearl Harbor must have felt sixty years earlier. This was the unfathomable. Later that day, we went on full alert at headquarters, the pucker-factor running high, as we received word that a Korean Air Line jet was bound for Anchorage after the pilot had punched in a \"hijack\" code that alerted FAA controllers. High-rises in downtown Anchorage were evacuated, fighter jets from Elmendorf Air Force Base were scrambled to escort the plane through our airspace, and everyone nervously watched the sky. Eventually, the flight was diverted to Yukon Territory (the confused pilots trying to explain they never meant to signal they were being hijacked), and everyone went about their business. But it was not business as usual. Now we had to pass through metal detectors on the way to the office, now the gates of our military installation were scenes of miniature traffic jams as military police checked and re-checked our IDs and bomb-sniffing dogs circled our vehicles, now we knew our job in the military was suddenly a stone-cold sober mission to guard the nation. Four years later, I was in Baghdad, serving with the 3rd Infantry Division. Here's an excerpt from my journal for Sept. 11, 2005: When I go to lunch at the dining facility on Camp Liberty, I stop at the dessert table. The cooks have baked a large sheet cake in commemoration of Sept. 11th. Over top of the chocolate-and-yellow cake layers, the frosting is thick and runny. A fireman with “FDNY” on his helmet looks out at me earnestly from the frosting—his lips are a garish red and his eyes bulge, as if he’d been drawn by an amateur who took too much pride in his talents. The cake is more than half gone when the cheery Filipino baker cuts my slice. I imagine the other half of the cake had the World Trade Center towers with little blossoms of smoke curling from their mid-sections. When I take the cake back to my room and start to eat it, I have to put it down after only two or three bites. It’s too sweet and cloying—not at all what a 9/11 cake should be. At the very least, there should be dark, bitter chocolate on this cake. Two years after that tour of duty in Iraq, I had a new assignment: the Pentagon. My office in the E Ring corridor was on the western side of the building. It was, quite literally Ground Zero for the 9/11 Pentagon attack. Where I sat in my cubicle, a scream of metal once passed through in a split second of fire and fuel. I could rise from my desk and walk over to the now-shatterproof windows and trace the path of a jetliner through the sky over Washington, DC. If I was still enough, I could hear the ghost of screams.I worked in the Pentagon for two years and never once did I report to work without thinking about the lives lost and the character of a nation that had changed with the three attacks that crisp blue September morning. My office, a city block in Manhattan, a farmer's field in Pennsylvania--they all serve as alarm clocks, waking us to vigilance. We should never hit the snooze button and go back to sleep.\n\nEric Spitznagel, journalist and father.\n\nI was in a cabin in northern Michigan, ending a year of pretending to be Thoreau and getting ready to move back to Chicago. As I watched the Towers fall on my tiny black-and-white TV, I remember thinking, \"I picked the worst possible fucking time to leave the safety of seclusion and return to a huge terrorist target. What the fuck is wrong with me?\" But I went anyway, because pretending to be Thoreau is a shitty way to live.\n\nRead my Forbes blog. Email me. Follow me on Twitter. Visit my blog.",
  "latent_14328": "Date Sat 27 May 2017 Tags haskell / cryptography / spake2\n\nThere’s a joke about programmers that’s been doing the rounds for the last couple of years:\n\nWe do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they would be easy.\n\nThis is about how I became the butt of a tired, old joke.\n\nMy friend Jean-Paul decided to start learning Haskell by writing a magic-wormhole client.\n\nmagic-wormhole works in part by negotiating a session key using SPAKE2: a password-authenticated key exchange protocol, so one of the first things Jean-Paul needed was a Haskell implementation.\n\nEager to help Jean-Paul on his Haskell journey, I volunteered to write a SPAKE2 implementation in Haskell. After all, there’s a pure Python implementation, so all I’d need to do is translate it from Python to Haskell. I know both languages pretty well. How hard could it be?\n\nTurns out there are a few things I hadn’t really counted on.\n\nI know next to nothing about cryptography Until now, I could summarise what I knew about cryptography into two points: It works because factoring prime numbers is hard I don’t know enough about it to implement it reliably, I should use proven, off-the-shelf components instead This isn’t really a solid foundation for implementing crypto code. In fact, it’s a compelling argument to walk away while I still had the chance. My ignorance was a particular liability here, since python-spake2 assumes a lot of cryptographic knowledge. What’s HKDF? What’s Ed25519? Is that the same thing as Curve25519? What’s NIST? What’s q in this context? python-spake2 also assumes a lot of knowledge about abstract algebra. This is less of a problem for me, since I studied a lot of that at university. However, it’s still a problem. Most of that knowledge has sat unused for fifteen or so years. Dusting off those cobwebs took time. My rusty know-how was especially obvious when reading the PDFs that describe SPAKE2. Mathematical notation isn’t easy to read, and every subdiscipline has its own special variants (“Oh, obviously q means the size of the subgroup. That’s just convention.”) For example, I know that what’s in spake2/groups.py is the multiplicative group of integers modulo n, and I know what “the multiplicative group of integers modulo n” means, but I understand about 2% of the Wikipedia page on the subject, and I have even less understanding about how the group is relevant to cryptography. The protocol diagrams that appear in the papers I read were a confusing mess of symbols at first. It took several passes through the text, and a couple of botched explanations to patient listeners on IRC before I really understood them. These diagrams now seem clear & succinct to me, although I’m sure they could be written better in code.\n\npython-spake2 is idiosyncratic The python-spake2 source code is made almost entirely out of object inheritance and mutation, which makes it hard for me to follow, and hard to transliterate into Haskell, where object inheritance and mutation are hard to model. This is a very minor criticism. With magic-wormhole and python-spake2, Warner has made creative, useful software that solves a difficult problem and meets a worthwhile need.\n\ncrypto libraries rarely have beginner-friendly documentation python-spake2 isn’t alone in assuming cryptographic knowledge. The Haskell library cryptonite is much the same. Most documentation I could find about various topics on the web pointed to cr.yp.to pages, which either link to papers or C code. I think this is partly driven by a concern for user safety, “if you don’t understand it, you shouldn’t be using it”. Maybe this is a good idea. The problem is that it can be hard to know where to start in order to gain that understanding. To illustrate, I now sort of get how an elliptic curve might form a group, but have forgotten enough algebra to not know about what subgroups there are, how that’s relevant to the implementation of ed25519, how subgroups and groups relate to fields, to say nothing of how elliptic curve cryptography actually works. I don’t really know where to go to remedy this ignorance, although I’m pretty sure doing so is within my capabilities, I just need to find the right book or course to actually teach me these things.\n\nProtocols ain’t protocols The mathematics of SPAKE2 are fairly clearly defined, but there is a large gap between “use this group element” and sending some bits over the wire. python-spake2 doesn’t clearly distinguish between the mathematics of SPAKE2 and the necessary implementation decisions it makes in order to be a useful networked protocol. This meant that when translating, it was hard to tell what was an essential detail and what was accidental detail. As Siderea eloquently points out, software is made of decisions. When writing the Haskell version, which decisions do I get to make, and which are forced upon me? Must this salt be the empty string? Can I generate the “blind” any way I want? Eventually, I found a PR implementing SPAKE2 (and SPAKE2+, SPAKE2-EE, etc.) in Javascript. From the discussion there, I was able to synthesize a rough standard for implementing. Jean-Paul helped by writing an interoperability test harness, which gave me an easy way to experiment with design choices.",

Well-known rodents include mice, rats, squirrels, prairie dogs, chipmunks, porcupines, beavers, guinea pigs, hamsters, gerbils and capybaras. Other animals such as rabbits, hares, and pikas, whose incisors also grow continually, were once included with them, but are now considered to be in a separate order, the Lagomorpha. Nonetheless, Rodentia and Lagomorpha are sister groups, sharing a most recent common ancestor and forming the clade of Glires.\n\nMost rodents are small animals with robust bodies, short limbs, and long tails. They use their sharp incisors to gnaw food, excavate burrows, and defend themselves. Most eat seeds or other plant material, but some have more varied diets. They tend to be social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other. Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy, to polygyny, to promiscuity. Many have litters of underdeveloped, altricial young, while others are precocial (relatively well developed) at birth.\n\nThe rodent fossil record dates back to the Paleocene on the supercontinent of Laurasia. Rodents greatly diversified in the Eocene, as they spread across continents, sometimes even crossing oceans. Rodents reached both South America and Madagascar from Africa and were the only terrestrial placental mammals to reach and colonize Australia.\n\nRodents have been used as food, for clothing, as pets, and as laboratory animals in research. Some species, in particular, the brown rat, the black rat, and the house mouse, are serious pests, eating and spoiling food stored by humans, and spreading diseases. Accidentally introduced species of rodents are often considered to be invasive and have caused the extinction of numerous species, such as island birds, previously isolated from land-based predators.\n\nCharacteristics [ edit ]\n\nDrawing of typical rodent tooth system: The front surface of the incisors is hard enamel , whereas the rear is softer dentine . The act of chewing wears down the dentine, leaving a sharp, chisel-like edge.\n\nThe distinguishing feature of the rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp, open-rooted incisors.[1] These incisors have thick layers of enamel on the front and little enamel on the back.[2] Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to wear them down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a chisel.[3] Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars. A gap, or diastema, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths.[4] Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors.[5]\n\nIn many species, the molars are relatively large, intricately structured, and highly cusped or ridged. Rodent molars are well equipped to grind food into small particles.[1] The jaw musculature is strong. The lower jaw is thrust forward while gnawing and is pulled backwards during chewing.[2] Rodent groups differ in the arrangement of the jaw muscles and associated skull structures, both from other mammals and amongst themselves. The Sciuromorpha, such as the eastern grey squirrel, have a large deep masseter, making them efficient at biting with the incisors. The Myomorpha, such as the brown rat, have enlarged temporalis muscles, making them able to chew powerfully with their molars. The Hystricomorpha, such as the guinea pig, have larger superficial masseter muscles and smaller deep masseter muscles than rats or squirrels, possibly making them less efficient at biting with the incisors, but their enlarged internal pterygoid muscles may allow them to move the jaw further sideways when chewing.[6] The cheek pouch is a specific morphological feature used for storing food and is evident in particular subgroups of rodents like kangaroo rats, hamsters, chipmunks and gophers which have two bags that may range from the mouth to the front of the shoulders.[7] True mice and rats do not contain this structure but their cheeks are elastic due to a high degree of musculature and innervation in the region.[8]\n\nVolume rendering of a mouse skull (CT) using shear warp algorithm\n\nWhile the largest species, the capybara, can weigh as much as 66 kg (146 lb), most rodents weigh less than 100 g (3.5 oz). The smallest rodent is the Baluchistan pygmy jerboa, which averages only 4.4 cm (1.7 in) in head and body length, with adult females weighing only 3.75 g (0.132 oz). Rodents have wide-ranging morphologies, but typically have squat bodies and short limbs.[1] The fore limbs usually have five digits, including an opposable thumb, while the hind limbs have three to five digits. The elbow gives the forearms great flexibility.[3][9] The majority of species are plantigrade, walking on both the palms and soles of their feet, and have claw-like nails. The nails of burrowing species tend to be long and strong, while arboreal rodents have shorter, sharper nails.[9] Rodent species use a wide variety of methods of locomotion including quadrupedal walking, running, burrowing, climbing, bipedal hopping (kangaroo rats and hopping mice), swimming and even gliding.[3] Scaly-tailed squirrels and flying squirrels, although not closely related, can both glide from tree to tree using parachute-like membranes that stretch from the fore to the hind limbs.[10] The agouti is fleet-footed and antelope-like, being digitigrade and having hoof-like nails. The majority of rodents have tails, which can be of many shapes and sizes. Some tails are prehensile, as in the Eurasian harvest mouse, and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald. The tail is sometimes used for communication, as when beavers slap their tails on the water surface or house mice rattle their tails to indicate alarm. Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all.[1] In some species, the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off.[3]\n\nRodents generally have well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and vision. Nocturnal species often have enlarged eyes and some are sensitive to ultraviolet light. Many species have long, sensitive whiskers or vibrissae for touch or \"whisking\". Some rodents have cheek pouches, which may be lined with fur. These can be turned inside out for cleaning. In many species, the tongue cannot reach past the incisors. Rodents have efficient digestive systems, absorbing nearly 80% of ingested energy. When eating cellulose, the food is softened in the stomach and passed to the cecum, where bacteria reduce it to its carbohydrate elements. The rodent then practices coprophagy, eating its own fecal pellets, so the nutrients can be absorbed by the gut. Rodents therefore often produce a hard and dry fecal pellet.[1] In many species, the penis contains a bone, the baculum; the testes can be located either abdominally or at the groin.[3]\n\nSexual dimorphism occurs in many rodent species. In some rodents, males are larger than females, while in others the reverse is true. Male-bias sexual dimorphism is typical for ground squirrels, kangaroo rats, solitary mole rats and pocket gophers; it likely developed due to sexual selection and greater male-male combat. Female-bias sexual dimorphism exists among chipmunks and jumping mice. It is not understood why this pattern occurs, but in the case of yellow-pine chipmunks, males may have selected larger females due to their greater reproductive success. In some species, such as voles, sexual dimorphism can vary from population to population. In bank voles, females are typically larger than males, but male-bias sexual dimorphism occurs in alpine populations, possibly because of the lack of predators and greater competition between males.[11]\n\nDistribution and habitat [ edit ]\n\nOne of the most widespread groups of mammals, rodents can be found on every continent except Antarctica. They are the only terrestrial placental mammals to have colonized Australia and New Guinea without human intervention. Humans have also allowed the animals to spread to many remote oceanic islands (e.g., the Polynesian rat).[3] Rodents have adapted to almost every terrestrial habitat, from cold tundra (where they can live under snow) to hot deserts.\n\nSome species such as tree squirrels and New World porcupines are arboreal, while some, such as gophers, tuco-tucos, and mole rats, live almost completely underground, where they build complex burrow systems. Others dwell on the surface of the ground, but may have a burrow into which they can retreat. Beavers and muskrats are known for being semiaquatic,[1] but the rodent best-adapted for aquatic life is probably the earless water rat from New Guinea.[12] Rodents have also thrived in human-created environments such as agricultural and urban areas.[13]\n\nThough some species are common pests for humans, rodents also play important ecological roles.[1] Some rodents are considered keystone species and ecosystem engineers in their respective habitats. In the Great Plains of North America, the burrowing activities of prairie dogs play important roles in soil aeration and nutrient redistribution, raising the organic content of the soil and increasing the absorption of water. They maintain these grassland habitats,[14] and some large herbivores such as bison and pronghorn prefer to graze near prairie dog colonies due to the increased nutritional quality of forage.[15]\n\nExtirpation of prairie dogs can also contribute to regional and local biodiversity loss, increased seed depredation, and the establishment and spread of invasive shrubs.[14] Burrowing rodents may eat the fruiting bodies of fungi and spread spores through their feces, thereby allowing the fungi to disperse and form symbiotic relationships with the roots of plants (which usually cannot thrive without them). As such, these rodents may play a role in maintaining healthy forests.[16]\n\nIn many temperate regions, beavers play an essential hydrological role. When building their dams and lodges, beavers alter the paths of streams and rivers[17] and allow for the creation of extensive wetland habitats. One study found that engineering by beavers leads to a 33 percent increase in the number of herbaceous plant species in riparian areas.[18] Another study found that beavers increase wild salmon populations.[19]\n\nBehavior and life history [ edit ]\n\nFeeding [ edit ]\n\nMost rodents are herbivorous, feeding exclusively on plant material such as seeds, stems, leaves, flowers, and roots. Some are omnivorous and a few are predators.[2] The field vole is a typical herbivorous rodent and feeds on grasses, herbs, root tubers, moss, and other vegetation, and gnaws on bark during the winter. It occasionally eats invertebrates such as insect larvae.[20] The plains pocket gopher eats plant material found underground during tunneling, and also collects grasses, roots, and tubers in its cheek pouches and caches them in underground larder chambers.[21]\n\nThe Texas pocket gopher avoids emerging onto the surface to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its jaws and pulling them downwards into its burrow. It also practices coprophagy.[22] The African pouched rat forages on the surface, gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out sideways. It then returns to its burrow to sort through the material it has gathered and eats the nutritious items.[23]\n\nAgouti species are one of the few animal groups that can break open the large capsules of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.[23]\n\nCapybara grazing\n\nA strategy for dealing with seasonal plenty is to eat as much as possible and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation.[23] Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.[24]\n\nAlthough rodents have been regarded traditionally as herbivores, a number of species opportunistically include insects, fish, or meat in their diets and more specialized forms rely on such foods. A functional-morphological study of the rodent tooth system supports the idea that primitive rodents were omnivores rather than herbivores. Studies of the literature show that numerous members of the Sciuromorpha and Myomorpha, and a few members of the Hystricomorpha, have either included animal matter in their diets or been prepared to eat such food when offered it in captivity. Examination of the stomach contents of the North American white-footed mouse, normally considered to be herbivorous, showed 34% animal matter.[25]\n\nMore specialized carnivores include the shrewlike rats of the Philippines, which feed on insects and soft-bodied invertebrates, and the Australian water rat, which devours aquatic insects, fish, crustaceans, mussels, snails, frogs, birds' eggs, and water birds.[25][26] The grasshopper mouse from dry regions of North America feeds on insects, scorpions, and other small mice, and only a small part of its diet is plant material. It has a chunky body with short legs and tail, but is agile and can easily overpower prey as large as itself.[27]\n\nSocial behavior [ edit ]\n\nPrairie dog \"town\"\n\nRodents exhibit a wide range of types of social behavior ranging from the mammalian caste system of the naked mole-rat,[28] the extensive \"town\" of the colonial prairie dog,[29] through family groups to the independent, solitary life of the edible dormouse. Adult dormice may have overlapping feeding ranges, but they live in individual nests and feed separately, coming together briefly in the breeding season to mate. The pocket gopher is also a solitary animal outside the breeding season, each individual digging a complex tunnel system and maintaining a territory.[9]\n\nLarger rodents tend to live in family units where parents and their offspring live together until the young disperse. Beavers live in extended family units typically with a pair of adults, this year's kits, the previous year's offspring, and sometimes older young.[30] Brown rats usually live in small colonies with up to six females sharing a burrow and one male defending a territory around the burrow. At high population densities, this system breaks down and males show a hierarchical system of dominance with overlapping ranges. Female offspring remain in the colony while male young disperse.[31] The prairie vole is monogamous and forms a lifelong pair bond. Outside the breeding season, prairie voles live in close proximity with others in small colonies. A male is not aggressive towards other males until he has mated, after which time he defends a territory, a female, and a nest against other males. The pair huddles together, grooms one another, and shares nesting and pup-raising responsibilities.[32]\n\nAmong the most social of rodents are the ground squirrels, which typically form colonies based on female kinship, with males dispersing after weaning and becoming nomadic as adults. Cooperation in ground squirrels varies between species and typically includes making alarm calls, defending territories, sharing food, protecting nesting areas, and preventing infanticide.[33] The black-tailed prairie dog forms large towns that may cover many hectares. The burrows do not interconnect, but are excavated and occupied by territorial family groups known as coteries. A coterie often consists of an adult male, three or four adult females, several nonbreeding yearlings, and the current year's offspring. Individuals within coteries are friendly with each other, but hostile towards outsiders.[29]\n\nPerhaps the most extreme examples of colonial behavior in rodents are the eusocial naked mole rat and Damaraland mole rat. The naked mole rat lives completely underground and can form colonies of up to 80 individuals. Only one female and up to three males in the colony reproduce, while the rest of the members are smaller and sterile, and function as workers. Some individuals are of intermediate size. They help with the rearing of the young and can take the place of a reproductive if one dies.[34] The Damaraland mole rat is characterized by having a single reproductively active male and female in a colony where the remaining animals are not truly sterile, but become fertile only if they establish a colony of their own.[35]\n\nCommunication [ edit ]\n\nOlfactory [ edit ]\n\nNepotistic species such as house mice rely on urine, feces and glandular secretions to recognize their kin.\n\nRodents use scent marking in many social contexts including inter- and intra-species communication, the marking of trails and the establishment of territories. Their urine provides genetic information about individuals including the species, the sex and individual identity, and metabolic information on dominance, reproductive status and health. Compounds derived from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are bound to several urinary proteins. The odor of a predator depresses scent-marking behavior.[36]\n\nRodents are able to recognize close relatives by smell and this allows them to show nepotism (preferential behavior toward their kin) and also avoid inbreeding. This kin recognition is by olfactory cues from urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes they have in common. In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then non-volatile major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function as pheromone transporters, may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male house mouse (Mus musculus) excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs.[37]\n\nHouse mice deposit urine, which contains pheromones, for territorial marking, individual and group recognition, and social organization[38] Territorial beavers and red squirrels investigate and become familiar with the scents of their neighbors and respond less aggressively to intrusions by them than to those made by non-territorial \"floaters\" or strangers. This is known as the \"dear enemy effect\".[39][40]\n\nAuditory [ edit ]\n\nMany rodent species, particularly those that are diurnal and social, have a wide range of alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action.[41] Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information about the nature of the precise threat.[42] The urgency of the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call.[43]\n\nSocial rodents have a wider range of vocalizations than do solitary species. Fifteen different call-types have been recognized in adult Kataba mole rats and four in juveniles.[44] Similarly, the common degu, another social, burrowing rodent, exhibits a wide array of communication methods and has an elaborate vocal repertoire comprising fifteen different categories of sound.[45] Ultrasonic calls play a part in social communication between dormice and are used when the individuals are out of sight of each other.[46]\n\nHouse mice use both audible and ultrasonic calls in a variety of contexts. Audible vocalizations can often be heard during agonistic or aggressive encounters, whereas ultrasound is used in sexual communication and also by pups when they have fallen out of the nest.[38]\n\nMarmot whistling\n\nLaboratory rats (which are brown rats, Rattus norvegicus) emit short, high frequency, ultrasonic vocalizations during purportedly pleasurable experiences such as rough-and-tumble play, when anticipating routine doses of morphine, during mating, and when tickled. The vocalization, described as a distinct \"chirping\", has been likened to laughter, and is interpreted as an expectation of something rewarding. In clinical studies, the chirping is associated with positive emotional feelings, and social bonding occurs with the tickler, resulting in the rats becoming conditioned to seek the tickling. However, as the rats age, the tendency to chirp declines. Like most rat vocalizations, the chirping is at frequencies too high for humans to hear without special equipment, so bat detectors have been used for this purpose.[47]\n\nVisual [ edit ]\n\nRodents, like all placental mammals except primates, have just two types of light receptive cones in their retina,[48] a short wavelength \"blue-UV\" type and a middle wavelength \"green\" type. They are therefore classified as dichromats; however, they are visually sensitive into the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum and therefore can see light that humans can not. The functions of this UV sensitivity are not always clear. In degus, for example, the belly reflects more UV light than the back. Therefore, when a degu stands up on its hind legs, which it does when alarmed, it exposes its belly to other degus and ultraviolet vision may serve a purpose in communicating the alarm. When it stands on all fours, its low UV-reflectance back could help make the degu less visible to predators.[49] Ultraviolet light is abundant during the day but not at night. There is a large increase in the ratio of ultraviolet to visible light in the morning and evening twilight hours. Many rodents are active during twilight hours (crepuscular activity), and UV-sensitivity would be advantageous at these times. Ultraviolet reflectivity is of dubious value for nocturnal rodents.[50]\n\nThe urine of many rodents (e.g. voles, degus, mice, rats) strongly reflects UV light and this may be used in communication by leaving visible as well as olfactory markings.[51] However, the amount of UV that is reflected decreases with time, which in some circumstances can be disadvantageous; the common kestrel can distinguish between old and fresh rodent trails and has greater success hunting over more recently marked routes.[52]\n\nTactile [ edit ]\n\nVibrations can provide cues to conspecifics about specific behaviors being performed, predator warning and avoidance, herd or group maintenance, and courtship. The Middle East blind mole rat was the first mammal for which seismic communication was documented. These fossorial rodents bang their head against the walls of their tunnels. This behavior was initially interpreted as part of their tunnel building behavior, but it was eventually realized that they generate temporally patterned seismic signals for long-distance communication with neighboring mole rats.[53]\n\nFootdrumming is used widely as a predator warning or defensive action. It is used primarily by fossorial or semi-fossorial rodents.[54] The banner-tailed kangaroo rat produces several complex footdrumming patterns in a number of different contexts, one of which is when it encounters a snake. The footdrumming may alert nearby offspring but most likely conveys that the rat is too alert for a successful attack, thus preventing the snake's predatory pursuit.[53][55] Several studies have indicated intentional use of ground vibrations as a means of intra-specific communication during courtship among the Cape mole rat.[56] Footdrumming has been reported to be involved in male-male competition; the dominant male indicates its resource holding potential by drumming, thus minimizing physical contact with potential rivals.[53]\n\nMating strategies [ edit ]\n\nThe Cape ground squirrel is an example of a promiscuous rodent.\n\nSome species of rodent are monogamous, with an adult male and female forming a lasting pair bond. Monogamy can come in two forms; obligate and facultative. In obligate monogamy, both parents care for the offspring and play an important part in their survival. This occurs in species such as California mice, oldfield mice, Malagasy giant rats and beavers. In these species, males usually mate only with their partners. In addition to increased care for young, obligate monogamy can also be beneficial to the adult male as it decreases the chances of never finding a mate or mating with an infertile female. In facultative monogamy, the males do not provide direct parental care and stay with one female because they cannot access others due to being spatially dispersed. Prairie voles appear to be an example of this form of monogamy, with males guarding and defending females within their vicinity.[57]\n\nIn polygynous species, males will try to monopolize and mate with multiple females. As with monogamy, polygyny in rodents can come in two forms; defense and non-defense. Defense polygyny involves males controlling territories that contain resources that attract females. This occurs in ground squirrels like yellow-bellied marmots, California ground squirrels, Columbian ground squirrels and Richardson's ground squirrels. Males with territories are known as \"resident\" males and the females that live within the territories are known as \"resident\" females. In the case of marmots, resident males do not appear to ever lose their territories and always win encounters with invading males. Some species are also known to directly defend their resident females and the ensuing fights can lead to severe wounding. In species with non-defense polygyny, males are not territorial and wander widely in search of females to monopolize. These males establish dominance hierarchies, with the high-ranking males having access to the most females. This occurs in species like Belding's ground squirrels and some tree squirrel species.[57]\n\nPromiscuity, in which both males and females mate with multiple partners, also occurs in rodents. In species such as the white-footed mouse, females give birth to litters with multiple paternities. Promiscuity leads to increased sperm competition and males tend to have larger testicles. In the Cape ground squirrel, the male's testes can be 20 percent of its head-body length.[57] Several rodent species have flexible mating systems that can vary between monogamy, polygyny and promiscuity.[57]\n\nFemale rodents play an active role in choosing their mates. Factors that contribute to female preference may include the size, dominance and spatial ability of the male.[58] In the eusocial naked mole rats, a single female monopolizes mating from at least three males.[34]\n\nIn most rodent species, such as brown rats and house mice, ovulation occurs on a regular cycle while in others, such as voles, it is induced by mating. During copulation, males of some rodent species deposit a mating plug in the female's genital opening, both to prevent sperm leakage and to protect against other males inseminating the female. Females can remove the plug and may do so either immediately or after several hours.[58]\n\nBirth and parenting [ edit ]\n\nYoung bank voles in their nest beneath a wood pile\n\nRodents may be born either altricial (blind, hairless and relatively underdeveloped) or precocial (mostly furred, eyes open and fairly developed) depending on the species. The altricial state is typical for squirrels and mice, while the precocial state usually occurs in species like guinea pigs and porcupines. Females with altricial young typically build elaborate nests before they give birth and maintain them until their offspring are weaned. The female gives birth sitting or lying down and the young emerge in the direction she is facing. The newborns first venture out of the nest a few days after they have opened their eyes and initially keep returning regularly. As they get older and more developed, they visit the nest less often and leave permanently when weaned.[59]\n\nIn precocial species, the mothers invest little in nest building and some do not build nests at all. The female gives birth standing and the young emerge behind her. Mothers of these species maintain contact with their highly mobile young with maternal contact calls. Though relatively independent and weaned within days, precocial young may continue to nurse and be groomed by their mothers. Rodent litter sizes also vary and females with smaller litters spend more time in the nest than those with larger litters.[59]\n\nTwo Patagonian maras with young, an example of a monogamous and communal nesting species\n\nMother rodents provide both direct parental care, such as nursing, grooming, retrieving and huddling, and indirect parenting, such as food caching, nest building and protection to their offspring.[59] In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other than their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some question as to whether these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse.[60]\n\nInfanticide exists in numerous rodent species and may be practiced by adult conspecifics of either sex. Several reasons have been proposed for this behavior, including nutritional stress, resource competition, avoiding misdirecting parental care and, in the case of males, attempting to make the mother sexually receptive. The latter reason is well supported in primates and lions but less so in rodents.[61] Infanticide appears to be widespread in black-tailed prairie dogs, including infanticide from invading males and immigrant females, as well as occasional cannibalism of an individual's own offspring.[62] To protect against infanticide from other adults, female rodents may employ avoidance or direct aggression against potential perpetrators, multiple mating, territoriality or early termination of pregnancy.[61] Feticide can also occur among rodents; in Alpine marmots, dominant females tend to suppress the reproduction of subordinates by being antagonistic towards them while they are pregnant. The resulting stress causes the fetuses to abort.[63]\n\nIntelligence [ edit ]\n\nKangaroo rats can locate food caches by spatial memory.\n\nRodents have advanced cognitive abilities. They can quickly learn to avoid poisoned baits, which makes them difficult pests to deal with.[1] Guinea pigs can learn and remember complex pathways to food.[64] Squirrels and kangaroo rats are able to locate caches of food by spatial memory, rather than just by smell.[65][66]\n\nBecause laboratory mice (house mice) and rats (brown rats) are widely used as scientific models to further our understanding of biology, a great deal has come to be known about their cognitive capacities. Brown rats exhibit cognitive bias, where information processing is biased by whether they are in a positive or negative affective state.[67] For example, laboratory rats trained to respond to a specific tone by pressing a lever to receive a reward, and to press another lever in response to a different tone so as to avoid receiving an electric shock, are more likely to respond to an intermediate tone by choosing the reward lever if they have just been tickled (something they enjoy), indicating \"a link between the directly measured positive affective state and decision making under uncertainty in an animal model.\"[68]\n\nLaboratory (brown) rats may have the capacity for metacognition—to consider their own learning and then make decisions based on what they know, or do not know, as indicated by choices they make apparently trading off difficulty of tasks and expected rewards, making them the first animals other than primates known to have this capacity,[69][70] but these findings are disputed, since the rats may have been following simple operant conditioning principles,[71] or a behavioral economic model.[72] Brown rats use social learning in a wide range of situations, but perhaps especially so in acquiring food preferences.[73][74]\n\nClassification and evolution [ edit ]\n\nEvolutionary history [ edit ]\n\nDentition is the key feature by which fossil rodents are recognized and the earliest record of such mammals comes from the Paleocene, shortly after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs some 66 million years ago. These fossils are found in Laurasia,[75] the supercontinent composed of modern-day North America, Europe, and Asia. The divergence of Glires, a clade consisting of rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares and pikas), from other placental mammals occurred within a few million years after the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary; rodents and lagomorphs then radiated during the Cenozoic.[76] Some molecular clock data suggest modern rodents (members of the order Rodentia) had appeared by the late Cretaceous, although other molecular divergence estimations are in agreement with the fossil record.[77][78]\n\nRodents are thought to have evolved in Asia, where local multituberculate faunas were severely affected by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event and never fully recovered, unlike their North American and European relatives. In the resulting ecological vacuum, rodents and other Glires were able to evolve and diversify, taking the niches left by extinct multituberculates. The correlation between the spread of rodents and the demise of multituberculates is a controversial topic, not fully resolved. American and European multituberculate assemblages do decline in diversity in correlation with the introduction of rodents in these areas, but the remaining Asian multituberculates co-existed with rodents with no observable replacement taking place, and ultimately both clades co-existed for at least 15 million years.[79]\n\nThe history of the colonization of the world's continents by rodents is complex. The movements of the large superfamily Muroidea (including hamsters, gerbils, true mice and rats) may have involved up to seven colonizations of Africa, five of North America, four of Southeast Asia, two of South America and up to ten of Eurasia.[80]\n\nCeratogaulus hatcheri, a burrowing mammal of the late Miocene to early Pleistocene, is the only known horned rodent.[81] The horned gopher, a burrowing mammal of the late Miocene to early Pleistocene, is the only known horned rodent.\n\nDuring the Eocene, rodents began to diversify. Beavers appeared in Eurasia in the late Eocene before spreading to North America in the late Miocene.[82] Late in the Eocene, hystricognaths invaded Africa, most probably having originated in Asia at least 39.5 million years ago.[83] From Africa, fossil evidence shows that some hystricognaths (caviomorphs) colonized South America, which was an isolated continent at the time, evidently making use of ocean currents to cross the Atlantic on floating debris.[84] Caviomorphs had arrived in South America by 41 million years ago (implying a date at least as early as this for hystricognaths in Africa),[83] and had reached the Greater Antilles by the early Oligocene, suggesting that they must have dispersed rapidly across South America.[85]\n\nNesomyid rodents are thought to have rafted from Africa to Madagascar 20–24 million years ago.[86] All 27 species of native Malagasy rodents appear to be descendents of a single colonization event.\n\nBy 20 million years ago, fossils recognizably belonging to the current families such as Muridae had emerged.[75] By the Miocene, when Africa had collided with Asia, African rodents such as the porcupine began to spread into Eurasia.[87] Some fossil species were very large in comparison to modern rodents and included the giant beaver, Castoroides ohioensis, which grew to a length of 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) and weight of 100 kg (220 lb).[88] The largest known rodent was Josephoartigasia monesi, a pacarana with an estimated body length of 3 m (10 ft).[89]\n\nThe first rodents arrived in Australia via Indonesia around 5 million years ago. Although marsupials are the most prominent mammals in Australia, many rodents, all belonging to the subfamily Murinae, are among the continent's mammal species.[90] There are about fifty species of 'old endemics', the first wave of rodents to colonize the country in the Miocene and early Pliocene, and eight true rat (Rattus) species of 'new endemics', arriving in a subsequent wave in the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The earliest fossil rodents in Australia have a maximum age of 4.5 million years,[91] and molecular data is consistent with the colonization of New Guinea from the west during the late Miocene or early Pliocene followed by rapid diversification. A further wave of adaptive radiation occurred after one or more colonizations of Australia some 2 to 3 million years later.[92]\n\nRodents participated in the Great American Interchange that resulted from the joining of the Americas by formation of the Isthmus of Panama, around 3 million years ago in the Piacenzian age.[93] In this exchange, a small number of species such as the New World porcupines (Erethizontidae) headed north.[75] However, the main southward invasion of sigmodontines preceded formation of the land bridge by at least several million years, probably occurring via rafting.[94][95][96] Sigmodontines diversified explosively once in South America, although some degree of diversification may have already occurred in Central America before the colonization.[95][96] Their \"head start\" has relegated other North American rodent groups (sciurids, geomyids, heteromyids and nonsigmodontine cricetids) to a minor presence in the contemporary South American fauna.\n\nStandard classification [ edit ]\n\nThe use of the order name \"Rodentia\" is attributed to the English traveler and naturalist Thomas Edward Bowdich (1821).[97] The Modern Latin word \"Rodentia\" is derived from \"rodens\", present participle of \"rodere\" – \"to gnaw\", \"eat away\".[98] The hares, rabbits and pikas (order Lagomorpha) have continuously growing incisors, as do rodents, and were at one time included in the order. However, they have an additional pair of incisors in the upper jaw and the two orders have quite separate evolutionary histories.[99] The phylogeny of the rodents places them in the clades Glires, Euarchontoglires and Boreoeutheria. The cladogram below shows the inner and outer relations of Rodentia based on a 2012 attempt by Wu et al. to align the molecular clock with paleontological data:[100]\n\nThe living rodent families based on the study done by Fabre et al. 2012.[101]\n\nThe order Rodentia may be divided into suborders, infraorders, superfamilies and families. There is a great deal of parallelism and convergence among rodents caused by the fact that they have tended to evolve to fill largely similar niches. This parallel evolution includes not only the structure of the teeth, but also the infraorbital region of the skull (below the eye socket) and makes classification difficult as similar traits may not be due to common ancestry.[102][103] Brandt (1855) was the first to propose dividing Rodentia into three suborders, Sciuromorpha, Hystricomorpha and Myomorpha, based on the development of certain muscles in the jaw and this system was widely accepted. Schlosser (1884) performed a comprehensive review of rodent fossils, mainly using the cheek teeth, and found that they fitted into the classical system, but Tullborg (1899) proposed just two sub-orders, Sciurognathi and Hystricognathi. These were based on the degree of inflection of the lower jaw and were to be further subdivided into Sciuromorpha, Myomorpha, Hystricomorpha and Bathyergomorpha. Matthew (1910) created a phylogenetic tree of New World rodents but did not include the more problematic Old World species. Further attempts at classification continued without agreement, with some authors adopting the classical three suborder system and others Tullborg's two suborders.[102]\n\nThese disagreements remain unresolved, nor have molecular studies fully resolved the situation though they have confirmed the monophyly of the group and that the clade has descended from a common Paleocene ancestor. Carleton and Musser (2005) in Mammal Species of the World have provisionally adopted a five suborder system: Sciuromorpha, Castorimorpha, Myomorpha, Anomaluromorpha, and Hystricomorpha. These include 33 families, 481 genera and 2277 species.[104][105]\n\nOrder Rodentia (from Latin, rodere, to gnaw)\n\nInteraction with humans [ edit ]\n\nConservation [ edit ]\n\nDrawing of the critically endangered red crested soft-furred spiny rat\n\nWhile rodents are not the most seriously threatened order of mammals, there are 168 species in 126 genera that are said to warrant conservation attention[106] in the face of limited appreciation by the public. Since 76 percent of rodent genera contain only one species, much phylogenetic diversity could be lost with a comparatively small number of extinctions. In the absence of more detailed knowledge of species at risk and accurate taxonomy, conservation must be based mainly on higher taxa (such as families rather than species) and geographical hot spots.[106] Several species of rice rat have become extinct since the 19th century, probably through habitat loss and the introduction of alien species.[107] In Colombia, the brown hairy dwarf porcupine was recorded from only two mountain localities in the 1920s, while the red crested soft-furred spiny rat is known only from its type locality on the Caribbean coast, so these species are considered vulnerable.[108] The IUCN Species Survival Commission writes \"We can safely conclude that many South American rodents are seriously threatened, mainly by environmental disturbance and intensive hunting\".[109]\n\nThe \"three now cosmopolitan commensal rodent pest species\"[110] (the brown rat, the black rat and the house mouse) have been dispersed in association with humans, partly on sailing ships in the Age of Exploration, and with a fourth species in the Pacific, the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans), have severely damaged island biotas around the world. For example, when the black rat reached Lord Howe Island in 1918, over 40 percent of the terrestrial bird species of the island, including the Lord Howe fantail,[111] became extinct within ten years. Similar destruction has been seen on Midway Island (1943) and Big South Cape Island (1962). Conservation projects can with careful planning completely eradicate these pest rodents from islands using an anticoagulant rodenticide such as brodifacoum.[110] This approach has been successful on the island of Lundy in the United Kingdom, where the eradication of an estimated 40,000 brown rats is giving populations of Manx shearwater and Atlantic puffin a chance to recover from near-extinction.[112][113]\n\nExploitation [ edit ]\n\nExposition Universelle, Paris Chinchilla fur coat , exhibited at the 1900, Paris\n\nHumanity has long used animal skins for clothing, as the leather is durable and the fur provides extra insulation.[2] The native people of North America made much use of beaver pelts, tanning and sewing them together to make robes. Europeans appreciated the quality of these and the North American fur trade developed and became of prime importance to early settlers. In Europe, the soft underfur known as \"beaver wool\" was found to be ideal for felting and was made into beaver hats and trimming for clothing.[114][115] Later, the coypu took over as a cheaper source of fur for felting and was farmed extensively in America and Europe; however, fashions changed, new materials became available and this area of the animal fur industry declined.[116] The chinchilla has a soft and silky coat and the demand for its fur was so high that it was nearly wiped out in the wild before farming took over as the main source of pelts.[116] The quills and guardhairs of porcupines are used for traditional decorative clothing. For example, their guardhairs are used in the creation of the Native American \"porky roach\" headdress. The main quills may be dyed, and then applied in combination with thread to embellish leather accessories such as knife sheaths and leather bags. Lakota women would harvest the quills for quillwork by throwing a blanket over a porcupine and retrieving the quills it left stuck in the blanket.[117]\n\nConsumption [ edit ]\n\nAt least 89 species of rodent, mostly Hystricomorpha such as guinea pigs, agoutis and capybaras, are eaten by humans; in 1985, there were at least 42 different societies in which people eat rats.[118] Guinea pigs were first raised for food around 2500 B.C. and by 1500 B.C. had become the main source of meat for the Inca Empire. Dormice were raised by the Romans in special pots called \"gliraria\", or in large outdoor enclosures, where they were fattened on walnuts, chestnuts, and acorns. The dormice were also caught from the wild in autumn when they were fattest, and either roasted and dipped into honey or baked while stuffed with a mixture of pork, pine nuts, and other flavorings. Researchers found that in Amazonia, where large mammals were scarce, pacas and common agoutis accounted for around 40 percent of the annual game taken by the indigenous people, but in forested areas where larger mammals were abundant, these rodents constituted only about 3 percent of the take.[118]\n\nGuinea pigs are used in the cuisine of Cuzco, Peru, in dishes such as cuy al horno, baked guinea pig.[2][119] The traditional Andean stove, known as a qoncha or a fogón, is made from mud and clay reinforced with straw and hair from animals such as guinea pigs.[120] In Peru, there are at any time 20 million domestic guinea pigs, which annually produce 64 million edible carcasses. This animal is an excellent food source since the flesh is 19% protein.[118] In the United States, mostly squirrels, but also muskrats, porcupines, and ground hogs are eaten by humans. The Navajo people ate prairie dog baked in mud, while the Paiute ate gophers, squirrels, and rats.[118]\n\nAnimal testing [ edit ]\n\nRodents are used widely as model organisms in animal testing.[2][121] Albino mutant rats were first used for research in 1828 and later became the first animal domesticated for purely scientific purposes.[122] Nowadays, the house mouse is the most commonly used laboratory rodent, and in 1979 it was estimated that fifty million were used annually worldwide. They are favored because of their small size, fertility, short gestation period and ease of handling and because they are susceptible to many of the conditions and infections that afflict humans. They are used in research into genetics, developmental biology, cell biology, oncology and immunology.[123] Guinea pigs were popular laboratory animals until the late 20th century; about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the United States for research in the 1960s,[124] but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s.[125] In 2007, they constituted about 2% of all laboratory animals.[124] Guinea pigs played a major role in the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur, Émile Roux, and Robert Koch.[126] They have been launched into orbital space flight several times—first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9, 1961, with a successful recovery.[127] The naked mole rat is the only known mammal that is poikilothermic; it is used in studies on thermoregulation. It is also unusual in not producing the neurotransmitter substance P, a fact which researchers find useful in studies on pain.[128]\n\nRodents have sensitive olfactory abilities, which have been used by humans to detect odors or chemicals of interest.[129] The Gambian pouched rat is able to detect tuberculosis bacilli with a sensitivity of up to 86.6%, and specificity (detecting the absence of the bacilli) of over 93%; the same species has been trained to detect land mines.[130][131] Rats have been studied for possible use in hazardous situations such as in disaster zones. They can be trained to respond to commands, which may be given remotely, and even persuaded to venture into brightly lit areas, which rats usually avoid.[132][133][134]\n\nAs pets [ edit ]\n\nRodents including guinea pigs,[135] mice, rats, hamsters, gerbils, chinchillas, degus and chipmunks make convenient pets able to live in small spaces, each species with its own qualities.[136] Most are normally kept in cages of suitable sizes and have varied requirements for space and social interaction. If handled from a young age, they are usually docile and do not bite. Guinea pigs have a long lifespan and need a large cage.[64] Rats also need plenty of space and can become very tame, can learn tricks and seem to enjoy human companionship. Mice are short-lived but take up very little space. Hamsters are solitary but tend to be nocturnal. They have interesting behaviors, but unless handled regularly they may be defensive. Gerbils are not usually aggressive, rarely bite and are sociable animals that enjoy the company of humans and their own kind.[137]\n\nAs pests and disease vectors [ edit ]\n\nRodents cause significant losses to crops, such as these potatoes damaged by voles\n\nSome rodent species are serious agricultural pests, eating large quantities of food stored by humans.[138] For example, in 2003, the amount of rice lost to mice and rats in Asia was estimated to be enough to feed 200 million people. Most of the damage worldwide is caused by a relatively small number of species, chiefly rats and mice.[139] In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent. Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage cereals, groundnuts, vegetables and cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as rats and mice, species of Apodemus, Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as cereals. In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as Holochilus, Akodon, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Phyllotis, Sigmodon and Zygodontomys, damage many crops including sugar cane, fruits, vegetables, and tubers.[139]\n\nRodents are also significant vectors of disease.[140] The black rat, with the fleas that it carries, plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for bubonic plague,[141] and carries the organisms responsible for typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis.[142] A number of rodents carry hantaviruses, including the Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses, which can infect humans.[143] Rodents also help to transmit diseases including babesiosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Powassan virus, rickettsialpox, relapsing fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and West Nile virus.[144]\n\nBecause rodents are a nuisance and endanger public health, human societies often attempt to control them. Traditionally, this involved poisoning and trapping, methods that were not always safe or effective. More recently, integrated pest management attempts to improve control with a combination of surveys to determine the size and distribution of the pest population, the establishment of tolerance limits (levels of pest activity at which to intervene), interventions, and evaluation of effectiveness based on repeated surveys. Interventions may include education, making and applying laws and regulations, modifying the habitat, changing farming practices, and biological control using pathogens or predators, as well as poisoning and trapping.[145] The use of pathogens such as Salmonella has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals, and rodents often become resistant. The use of predators including ferrets, mongooses and monitor lizards has been found unsatisfactory. Domestic and feral cats are able to control rodents effectively, provided the rodent population is not too large.[146] In the UK, two species in particular, the house mouse and the brown rat, are actively controlled to limit damage in growing crops, loss and contamination of stored crops and structural damage to facilities, as well as to comply with the law.[147]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nFurther reading [ edit ]\n\nMcKenna, Malcolm C.; Bell, Susan K.

One of the key aims of the Back From The Brink project is to raise the public’s awareness of British wildlife declines and provide an opportunity for people to become more engaged with their local nature.\n\nThe project commences in 2016 and will run for four years.\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_14446": "MP’s are to explore the pros and cons of introducing a new ‘citizen’s income’ across Britain, a radical alternative to the current social security system, it has been announced today.\n\nThe Work and Pensions Committee is holding a one-off oral evidence session on citizen’s income, also known as ‘universal basic income’, at the University of Birmingham on 12 January 2017.\n\nA citizen’s income is a non-withdrawable guaranteed minimum income paid by the state to all citizen’s, regardless of wealth or means, and could negate the need for expensive means-testing.\n\nFrank Field MP, Chair of the Committee, said: “The idea of a citizen’s income has recently garnered interest in several different countries. In this session the Committee will hope to explore arguments for and against implementing such an initiative in our country’s welfare system.”\n\nSteve McCabe MP, Committee Member, said: “As we consider the implications of Universal Credit and the wider argument for reform of our welfare system, particularly given the changes in our society since its introduction, we should also look at ideas which are not new but may have achieved a new significance in terms of universality as the government tries to reduce means testing and the administrative costs of delivering welfare.\n\n“The concept of a citizen’s income is an idea which merits further consideration in this context.”\n\nSupporters argue a citizen’s income would remove the “stigma” attached to claiming and receiving social security benefits, which in turn could strengthen social cohesion.\n\nCitizen’s income could also remove work disincentives associated with the withdrawal of benefit payments in the current system, reducing poverty and hardship.\n\nSocial mobility could also be improved, as people would always have a minimum income to fall back on in the event of unemployment or other financial difficulties.\n\nPublic health is another area where a citizen’s income could have a positive impact, as well as reducing the cost of public services in tackling hardship and wide-spread deprivation.\n\nSome countries have already implemented some form of citizen’s income, such as a non-conditional residence-based pension in the Netherlands. The city of Utrecht and the Finnish Social Insurance Institution are both trialling a citizen’s income, set at a relatively high level.\n\nHowever, opponent’s cite political and practical issues in implementing a citizen’s income in the UK. They claim it would undermine the principle of contribution in the social security system, require higher rates of income tax and weaken work incentives.\n\nThere may also be difficulties in setting a minimum income at a sufficient enough level to cover housing costs, childcare and the extra support required by people with disabilities and long-term health conditions. Separate support systems would undermine the citizen’s income’s apparent simplicity, say critics.\n\nIn a referendum held earlier this year, voters overwhelmingly rejected proposals for a guaranteed minimum income in Switzerland – 77% to just 23%.\n\nIt would undoubtedly be difficult to convince UK voters of the merits of citizen’s income, especially in a climate where the poor and vulnerable are wrongly portrayed as “scroungers” in the media.\n\nAnyone interested in taking part in the Commitee session, should send a brief overview of their background and interest in the topic, including any relevant work, to workpencom@parliament.uk by Friday 2 December 2016.",

I’ll firmly back the legislation,” Grassley said, as reported by Politico and covered by IFP.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) also in a private meeting with 9/11 families in his office pointed out to the lately revealed evidence and said he will continue to work with colleagues in the Senate to back the legislation.\n\n“It should be 100-0, but I don’t expect that it will be,” Grassley said of a vote to override a veto of the 9/11 bill. “If people don’t want to override the veto, they should’ve expressed their opposition earlier.”\n\nRafic Hariri the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, was killed along with 21 others in an explosion in Beirut on 14 February 2005. During that time, media especially the Israeli daily Ha’aretz condemned Lebanese militia Hezbollah and made them responsible for the assassination.\n\nAlong with submitting 9/11 bill allowing families of victims to sue Saudi Arabia, voices came out that Saudi Arabia was also involved in Rafic Hariri’s assassination planned by Israel in 2005 and also it had role in promoting terrorism in the United states and Europe.

Zack Kassian is back in the lineup tonight, fully over the lower body injury that had kept him out of action.\n\nCue the “Kassian Deserves Top-Six Minutes” storyline once more? Not according to Kassian.\n\n“You guys run with that story — not me,” said Kassian, 23, a right winger who coach Willie Desjardins had skating with Shawn Matthias and Nicklas Jensen Saturday morning. “I’m actually sick of hearing it. I think everyone is.\n\n“I think we have to focus on the team and what’s best for the team and how this team can win. We haven’t done that in the past three years. This is a new year where everyone wants to come in and everyone is a little bit bitter with the way the season ended last year.\n\n“We want to be a team that competes and plays hard and rolls four lines. Wherever I might be is up to Willie and the coaching staff. I’m ready to play wherever they put me.”\n\nKassian has no points in two preseason games this season.\n\n2. Saturday is the final preseason tilt before Wednesday’s official curtain-raiser against the Flames in Calgary, and winger Derek Dorsett was saying after the morning skate how important it was to get into the regular-season mindset.\n\n“We have to make sure we bring that intensity tonight,” he said. “You have to make sure that intensity is there, because come Wednesday you’re not going to be able to just turn it on.”\n\nSaturday morning, Desjardins seemed to have his top two lines intact, with Henrik and Daniel Sedin skating with Radim Vrbata and Nick Bonino between Alex Burrows and Chris Higgins.\n\nBesides the Matthias line, he also had the all-righty line of Linden Vey centring Dorsett and Jannik Hansen.\n\nBrad Richardson and Tom Sestito both took the morning skate but Desjardins said they wouldn’t be playing. They have been dealing with injuries through the preseason, but Desjardins said they both could play.\n\nBo Horvat didn’t skate, and remains sidelined with an injured shoulder. There was no update on his progress.\n\nVancouver has 25 players on their roster, and they must get down to 23 by Tuesday.\n\n3. Kevin Bieksa didn’t take the morning skate after missing Friday’s practice with “soreness.”\n\nDesjardins said he was “coming along.” He wouldn’t elaborate on what the actual injury was.\n\nAs for whether he’ll play against Calgary, Desjardins said, “We’ll have to see over the next couple of days. I think he should be good. It just takes time. Guys react to treatment differently.”\n\nSaturday morning’s defence pairings were Alex Edler and Chris Tanev, Dan Hamhuis and Luca Sbisa and Ryan Stanton and Yannick Weber.\n\nFrank Corrado is sidelined as well with an upper-body injury.\n\nRyan Miller is expected to play in goal.\n\n4. Edmonton won’t have Taylor Hall or Ryan Nugent-Hopkins in their lineup, but they will have Jordan Eberle up front, along with Nail Yakupov and youngster Leon Draisaitl.\n\nJustin Schultz is among the blueliners expected to play for Edmonton, while Ben Scrivens is slated to start in goal.\n\n5. Onetime Canucks forward Steven Pinizzotto, who’s trying to catch on with the Oilers, isn’t slated to dress for what’s also Edmonton’s final preseason game.\n\n“I’ve been here before, I’ve been around the league, but, nah, it doesn’t get easier,” the 30-year-old winger told the Edmonton Journal of his emotions.\n\nThe Oilers had 34 players listed on their roster Friday. That includes four players currently injured.\n\nPinizzotto has two assists and two fights in four preseason games with Edmonton, including a tilt with Dorsett Thursday in Edmonton in a 2-1 Vancouver win.\n\n“Not many guys play my style. I like to do everything. Hit. Fight. Score sometimes. Get the assists. I like to lay it all out there and my game gets better with confidence,” he said.\n\nPinizzotto, who played 12 games with Vancouver in 2012-13, got into six last year with the Oilers after coming over from the Florida Panthers in a January trade. He spent the majority of last year in the AHL.",
  "latent_14628": "The biggest controversy gripping Russia today isn't explicitly political, but something Russians appear to get more passionate about – the choice of a mascot for the upcoming 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.\n\nCharges of plagiarism, amateurism, and bad taste are flying, and some are even hinting that popular voting for the mascot may have been rigged to ensure the candidate backed by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin would win.\n\nIt's not the sort of trouble the Sochi Winter Games needed, since they are already plagued by allegations of environmental recklessness and corruption as well as worries about deteriorating security in the northern Caucasus region.\n\nIn the first-ever open election for an Olympic mascot, more than 1.4 million Russians cast their votes by phone, text message, and e-mail over the weekend. On Monday, the Sochi Olympic Committee declared the winner to be a sleek, wide-eyed, snowboard-toting leopard that Mr. Putin had publicly named as his personal \"symbolic choice.\"\n\nTwo runners-up – a plump polar bear and a petit bunny rabbit – will serve as auxiliary mascots, representing the \"silver\" and \"bronze\" positions on the Olympic podium, officials said.\n\n\"All top three characters will become the Olympic Winter Games mascots,\" Olympic chief Dmitry Chernyshenko said in a statement. \"The mascots are the choice of our whole country and will remain in the history of the Olympic movement.\"\n\nThe mascots were selected from a short list of 11 designs, culled from more than 24,000 ideas submitted by the Russian public over the past year. The voting was kicked off by a TV marathon hosted by the chief of Russia's state-run Channel One, Konstantin Ernst.\n\nSome viewers began to suspect that all was not above board when one popular contender, a stylized version of Grandfather Frost (the Russian Santa Claus) was suddenly withdrawn in mid-vote over what organizers called a \"copyright issue.\"\n\nBut when the three winners were announced, a storm of controversy erupted.\n\nUltra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, deputy speaker of the Duma, slammed all three designs as unworthy. \"The bear is the dumbest animal,\" he said, \"the leopard is vicious, and the rabbit is a coward.\"\n\nViktor Chizhikov, who designed one of the most popular Olympic mascots of all time, a cuddly teddy bear named Misha who symbolized the Soviet Union's 1980 Moscow Olympic Games, claimed that his idea had been recycled to create the polar bear, which won second place in the voting.\n\n\"It's exactly the same as mine – the eyes, the nose, the mouth, the smile, even though it's been distorted,\" Mr. Chizhikov told the independent Ekho Moskvi radio station. \"I don't like it when people steal ideas; it's always very painful for an author.\"\n\nProfessionals sneered. \"This is complete madness; out of nothing they created an event of popular excitement,\" says Vasily Tsigankov, head of graphic design at the National Institute of Design in Moscow. \"These three wild symbols were made by amateurs. They are three clumsy designs, produced by people who don't know how to draw, and selected by people who are not professionals either. It looks like no trained artists even took part in the competition.\"\n\nSome commentators suggested that Putin's public embrace of the athletic snow leopard, which had earlier been lagging far behind in public polling, may have ensured its victory – in much the same way the hyper-popular Putin easily engineered the election of his own successor, Dmitry Medvedev, to Kremlin leadership three years ago.\n\nBut it was Mr. Medvedev – he may have favored the polar bear design (the Russian word for bear is \"medved\") – who dropped the heaviest hint of all.\n\nAt a government meeting to consider the adoption of a new electronic national ID card, Medvedev said he hoped the process of selecting a design for the card would be \"more equitable than the discussion of the symbols for our Olympics.\"",
  "latent_14725": "We have entered a public dispute against the management of a number of Subway branches in Brighton - motto ‘Eat Fresh!’ - after a former worker approached Brighton SolFed for support.\n\nThe worker was sacked without notice in July and is owed a considerable sum in contractual notice pay, holiday entitlement, overtime and for working a so-called training week in which no formal training was given and no prior indication that he was expected to give his labour for nothing but pure Subway profit. The worker tried to resolve these and other issues while in work by taking to the management and the appropriate authorities but, as we’ve heard so often before, this achieved nothing. Shockingly, the worker’s wife was offered a position at Subway Brighton which she declined after providing her ID, and instead had her national insurance number stolen and used illegally by Subway Brighton for 10 months.\n\nThe worker was also harassed into giving up a lot of the holiday leave he was entitled to and has a recording of the conversation in which the owner tells him that Subway Brighton isn’t ‘big enough’ to offer the lawful requirement. The management added insult to injury in a very literal sense by accusing the worker of engineering a workplace injury in which a ceiling collapsed on him while mopping up after a broken drinks dispenser. Their compassion overwhelms us. We supported the former worker to approach the owner with a demand letter and an offer to enter discussions to resolve the issues informally and amicably but, needless to say, the owner wouldn’t talk to us. This was after the worker, in a gesture of goodwill and conciliation, dropped a claim for compensation for having his livelihood snatched away and for the resulting in economic hardship for him and his family. Instead, we received an email from their solicitor the same day to make a derisory offer of compensation, denying all of the former worker’s demands and threatening us with legal action if we went ahead with a public campaign. Interestingly, the solicitor would not address the national insurance number theft issue, stating that Subway Brighton could not locate their records of this and so could not investigate further. How convenient for them.\n\nWe have visited Subway Brighton’s main office several times but the owner is still refusing to talk with us, while the solicitor’s stance remains immovable and threatening. Together with the worker, Brighton SolFed are now putting in place an escalation strategy, and have collected testimonies from several former workers at Subway Brighton confirming similarly shameful employment practice. We will not be deterred by threatening legalistic jargon, and during the conflict intend to support other workers at Subway Brighton by raising awareness of their rights and discussing any issues they have – ‘an injury to one is an injury to all’!",
  "latent_14915": "Opponents may think they are seeing double this season with Fabián Castillo and the newly signed Andrés “Manga” Escobar manning the flanks for FC Dallas.\n\nThough the two players don’t particularly look alike, they both have similar qualities. Both in their early 20s, they hail from Colombia, spent time with their country's Under-20 national team, played for Deportivo Cali and are good friends. They’re also known for one key element of their game: speed.\n\n“[They will] make this team very aggressive going forward, very attractive,” FC Dallas technical director Fernando Clavijo told media in a conference call on Friday morning.\n\nEscobar (pictured) will fill the void left on the outside by the mercurial Brazilian Jackson’s offseason trade to Toronto. The 22-year-old comes to Dallas on loan from Ukrainian powerhouse Dynamo Kiev – though most of his game appearances were while on loan with Ligue 1’s Évian – and FCD has an option to buy his contract at the end of the MLS season.\n\nDallas put in a discovery claim on Escobar three months ago, but he’s been on the club’s radar since it originally identified Castillo as a prospect more than four years ago.\n\nBut for all their similarities, Clavijo believes Escobar’s time in Europe gives him an edge to his game.\n\n“He’s exciting,” Clavijo said. “I think he’s a little bit more polished. I think his finishing is also better and he [played] for the last three years in a different environment in the Ukraine.”\n\nHe also had a sly warning for the rest of MLS: “You’re talking about two wingers coming at you with speed in Fabián and Andrés. I just don’t want to be a defender on the other team.”\n\nGet the latest FCD news at FCDallas.com\n\nClavijo expects both Escobar and Hendry Thomas – acquired in a trade with Colorado on Wednesday for allocation money – to accompany the team to Florida for the second half of its preseason. It puts Dallas two players over MLS’ 30-man roster limit, but Clavijo plans to wait to make any outgoing moves until the March 1 roster compliance deadline is closer to give the coaching staff more time to evaluate the team.\n\nHe also hinted that FC Dallas may not be done bringing in players.\n\n“We are still working to try and complete the roster, which hopefully we have another move,” he said. “If not, I’m OK, we can still always have a spot that’s open for what the summer window will bring. We addressed serious issues that we had with the team for this year, and we’re extremely happy with the way it is right now.”",

  "latent_15256": "The following is an edited excerpt from Mike Rose’s latest book, “Back to School: Why Everyone Deserves a Second Chance at Education.”\n\nWhen I was in high school in the early 1960s, the curriculum was split into three tracks: academic/college preparatory, general education and vocational. Upon entrance, students were placed in one of them based on their previous academic records or a measure of ability, typically an IQ score. The curriculum directed us toward a four-year college or university, possibly a community college; service or low-level managerial careers; or blue-collar work. The curriculum also contributed powerfully to our school’s social order. The college bound were in student government, edited the newspaper and the annual, and at year-end had a thick list of activities under their class photographs. Looking back on it all, the college prep crowd walked around campus with an air of promise.\n\nSince the mid-20th century, sociological and educational studies have documented the bias at work in the way students got placed in these tracks. For example, working-class and racial and ethnic minority students with records of achievement comparable to their advantaged peers were more frequently being placed in the general ed or vocational tracks rather than the college prep one. And there was the broader concern that this way of educationally stratifying young people was simply undemocratic. Eminent American philosopher John Dewey called it “social predestination.”\n\nA remarkable amount of effort by educators, policymakers, advocacy groups and parents has resulted over the last few decades in a dismantling of formal tracking. Though patterns of inequality still exist in the courses students take — vocational classes are overpopulated by poorer kids — we have in our time witnessed the emergence of a belief that college is a possibility for everyone. Today, however, we are also seeing the rise of a strong counter-voice, doubtful about the individual and societal value of channeling all young people into postsecondary education.\n\nThe skeptics are a diverse group. Many are economists who point to trends in the labor market that reveal a number of good and growing jobs that require some postsecondary occupational training but not a four-year — or even two-year — degree. Some are educators (including, but not limited to, career and technical education interest groups) who emphasize the variability of students’ interests and aptitudes, not all of which find fulfillment in a college curriculum. And some are social commentators who blend the economic and educational arguments with reflection on the value of direct contact with the physical world, something increasingly remote in our information age. Though these skeptics come from a range of ideological backgrounds, they share a concern that in pushing postsecondary education for everyone, we perpetuate a myth that personal fulfillment and economic security can be had only by pursuing a college degree.\n\nThis debate is an important one and is of interest to me because it directly affects the kinds of students I’ve been concerned with my entire professional life: those who come from less-than-privileged backgrounds and aren’t on the fast track to college. But my worry is that, as is the case with so many education debates, it will devolve into a binary polemic. The predictable result will be a stalemate or a partial and inadequate solution that will not address the web of concerns that underlies this discussion or honor the lives of the young people at the heart of it.\n\nBack to School: Why Everyone Deserves a Second Chance at Education By Mike Rose New Press, 224 pages\n\nLet me begin by acknowledging current labor market realities, for many low-income students are in immediate financial need. These students can commit to postsecondary education only if it leads to a decent wage and benefits. Furthermore, the record of postsecondary success is not a good one. Many students leave college without a certificate or degree that can help them in the job market, and, in many cases, they incur significant debt. There are good jobs out there that require training but not a two- or four-year degree, jobs that are relatively secure in a fluid global economy. The plumber’s and the chef’s work cannot be outsourced.\n\nIt is also true — and anyone who teaches and, for that fact, any parent knows it — that some young people are just not drawn to the kinds of activities that comprise the typical academic course of study, no matter how well executed. In a community college fashion program I’ve been studying, I see students with average to poor high school records deeply involved in their work, learning techniques and design principles, solving problems, building a knowledge base. Yet they resist, often with strong emotion, anything smacking of the traditional classroom, including the very structure of the classroom itself. This resistance holds even when the subject (textiles, history of fashion) relates to their interests.\n\nThe college-for-all versus occupational training debate is typically focused on structural features of the K-12 curriculum and on economic outcomes with little attention paid to the intellectual and emotional lives of the young people involved — their interests, what has meaning for them, what they want to do with their lives. A beginning student in a welding program gave succinct expression to all this, saying: “I love welding. This is the first time school has meant anything to me.”\n\nThe problem is that historically the vocational curriculum itself has not adequately honored the rich intellectual content of work. As the authors of an overview of such high school programs from the National Center for Research in Vocational Education put it, vocational education “emphasized job-specific skills to the almost complete exclusion of theoretical content.” And the general education courses — English, history, mathematics — that vocational students took were typically dumbed down and unimaginative. Reforms over the past few decades have gone some way toward changing this state of affairs, but the overall results have been uneven.\n\nThe huge question then is this: Is a particular vocationally oriented program built on the cognitive content of work and does it provide a strong education in the literacy and mathematics, the history and economics, the science and ethics that can emerge from the world of work? Few of the economists I’ve read who advocate an expansion of career and technical education address the educational (versus job training) aspects of their proposals.\n\nAnother point that the skeptics make is the troubling record of student success in postsecondary education. Do we really want to urge more students into a system that on average graduates about 50 to 60 percent of those who enter it? The doubters are right about the unsatisfactory record of student achievement. But their solution seems to fault students more than the colleges they attend and affords no other option but to redirect students who aren’t thriving into job-training programs.\n\nWe need to be careful about painting this broad group of students with a single brush stroke. Some are strongly motivated but because of poor education, family disruption, residential mobility or a host of reasons, they are not academically prepared. The question is what kind of course work and services does the college have to help them. (And it should be noted that many vocational programs recommended by the skeptics would require the same level of academic remediation.) Some students are unsure about their future and are experimenting. In my experience, it’s not easy to determine in advance who will find their way. We also know that a significant number of students leave college temporarily or permanently for nonacademic reasons such as finances, child care or job loss. Some of these cases could be addressed with financial aid or other resources and social services. So although I take the doubters’ point about the poor record of student success and agree that college is not for everyone and that a fulfilling life can be had without it, it is a simplistic solution to funnel everyone who is not thriving into a vocational program.\n\nSuch a solution also smacks of injustice. Right at the point in our society when college is being encouraged for a wide sweep of the population, we have the emergence of a restrictive counterforce that is seen by some as an attempt to protect privilege, or, at the least, as an ignorance of social history. Research by sociologists Jennie Brand and Yu Xie demonstrates that those least likely to attend college because of social class position — and thus, on average, have a less privileged education — are the ones who gain the most economically from a college degree. For such populations, going to college can also provide a measure of social and cultural capital. There is a long history of exclusion that has to be addressed before countering broad access to higher education.\n\nAll the above raises the basic question: What is the purpose of education? Both the college-for-all advocates and the skeptics justify their positions on economic grounds, but another element in the argument is that in addition to enhancing economic mobility, going to college also has important intellectual, cultural and civic benefits. These different perspectives on the purpose of college play into — and are shaped by — a long-standing tension in American higher education: a conflict between the goal of cultivating intellectual growth and liberal culture versus the goal of preparing students for occupation and practical life. I think this tension — like the divide between the academic and vocational — restricts the conversation we should be having. We should be asking how can we enhance the liberal studies possibilities in a vocational curriculum and enliven and broaden the academic course of study through engagement with the world beyond the classroom.\n\nA third option beyond college or work has emerged in the last few years: Linked Learning, which is also known by its former name, Multiple Pathways. There are various incarnations of Linked Learning, but a common one is a relatively small high school that is theme based and offers a strong academic curriculum for all students; the students then have options to branch off toward a career, an occupational certificate or a two- or four-year degree.\n\nBack to School: Why Everyone Deserves A Second Chance at Education By Mike Rose New Press, 224 pages\n\nIt is important to remember here that goals, expectations and what students imagine for themselves are deeply affected by information and experience. For a multiple pathways approach to be effective, students will need a lot of information about colleges and careers and plentiful opportunities to visit campuses and potential work sites such as hospitals, courts and laboratories. The differences in cultural and social capital between my UCLA students and those I know at inner-city community colleges are profound and widening as inequality increases in our country. Pathways advocates will have to confront this inequality head-on, for it is as important as the content of curriculum.\n\nThe college-for-all supporters would applaud an emphasis on a strong academic core but worry that this system could devolve into a new form of tracking. And the college-for-all skeptics, I suspect, would applaud the presence of a vocational pathway, though worry that anti-vocational biases would still stigmatize the option. These are legitimate concerns, and many backers of the Linked Learning approach acknowledge them. The advocates also realize the significant challenges facing such a reform: faculty development, curriculum design and the ancillary academic and social services needed to provide a quality pre-pathways education for all students. Still, this is a promising alternative, and some schools are demonstrating success with it.\n\nThough this college versus work debate can slip into a reductive either/or polemic, it does raise awareness of a number of important issues, ones not only central to education but also to the economy, the meaning of work and democratic life. These include the skyrocketing cost of college and the poor record of retention and graduation in higher education. The discussion also focuses attention on the disconnect between the current labor market and the politically popular rhetoric of “educating our way into the new economy.” And the debate demonstrates the significant commitment of financial and human resources that will be needed to make college-for-all a reality.\n\nOn a broader scale, the conversation considers the purpose of education in a free society. The issues here include the variability of human interests and talents and the class-based bias toward entire categories of knowledge and activity — a bias institutionalized in the structure of the American high school. There is, then, the need to rethink the academic-vocational divide itself and its postsecondary cousin, the liberal ideal as opposed to the vocational mission of the college. And finally we need to keep in mind that the college-for-all versus work debate takes place within a history of inequality and that the resolution will involve not only educational and economic issues, but civic and moral ones as well.",

  "latent_15514": "DAVIE—Here’s the thing about Dolphins offensive tackle Sam Young: He’s one of the most affable, funny personalities in the locker room in casual conversation, but in interviews he’s extremely gifted at giving the emptiest, most boilerplate answers anyone’s ever heard.\n\nWhen informed of that frustrating dynamic for reporters, he said thank you.\n\nAfter much prodding and instigating, Young finally relented and told a few interesting stories after practice today:\n\nYou were born and raised in South Florida, then went to Notre Dame. What was your first winter like in Indiana?\n\n“One of the first snowfalls, I was wearing flip-flops. That wasn’t fun. I went to a Notre Dame vs. Alabama basketball game, and it wasn’t that bad. But then I came out afterward and there was 4 inches of snow on the ground and I was in my flip-flops. I had to walk 10-15 minutes back to the dorm in that.”\n\nI’m sure you wised up eventually.\n\n“Yeah. I went to boat shoes after that.”\n\nClassic winter wear.This is your fourth team in eight seasons. It sounds rough not knowing where you’re going to live year to year.\n\n“Well, hold on. Think about that. It depends how you look at it. Some people love the idea of being born and raised in a town and never leaving. That’s what some people want to do. I love that I’ve been able to live in Indiana, Buffalo, Dallas, Jacksonville and here. I’ve gotten to live in a lot of cool places. I’m pretty content. I think it’s fun.”\n\nI’ve seen you set up Ted Larsen’s gear in his locker so it would fall down on his head. When did you become a prankster?\n\n“I’m not. That was a one-shot deal.”\n\nSo you just got Larsen that one time and that’s the only prank you’ve ever pulled.\n\n“I hate that you’re assuming I would be such a prankster. I’m not creative enough.”\n\nIs it difficult for you when you leave this locker room and have to go into the real world and act like an adult?\n\n“So you’re saying I don’t act like an adult in here? There’s so much side shade being thrown here. Unbelievable.”\n\nEvery day I come in here you’re drinking a green milkshake. It looks disgusting.\n\n“It tastes fine. You have options for what you want to put in it. I’m not one to eat a kale salad, but you can mix in that drink and I don’t know it’s there. It tastes like strawberry banana.”\n\nAre you a guy who has trouble keeping your weight up, or do you have trouble keeping it down?\n\n“Historically, keeping it up. It’s a different challenge when you have to eat to gain weight. In college, before weigh-ins, I used to have to eat two large pizzas just to make weight.”\n\nHow long did it take to wolf those down?\n\n“Not as long as you’d think. You get pretty good at it after a while. I can carbo-load like a boss.”\n\nWhat else?\n\n“Fine, I’ll give you something. They had a Bar Louie and every Wednesday was $2 burger night, so I’d go with my buddy. We’re sitting there one night and the waitress is like, ‘Oh, you guys gotta come back Friday for the tater tot eating competition.’\n\n“The hook is you get to drink whatever you want during the competition. And it’s a $250 gift certificate to Bar Louie. I’m in college, so hell yeah. So it was six minutes to eat as many as you can, and I ate like 3 1/2 pounds of tater tots in six minutes. I won—by like two tots. So I got a lot of $2 burger nights out of that.”\n\nWere you doing that to make weight or was that just for sport?\n\n“No, that was for making money, man.”\n\nI’ve heard o-linemen say they actually hate being this heavy. You’re 6-foot-8, 306 pounds. Do you long for the day when you don’t have to carry that weight?\n\n“I don’t want to be 300 pounds forever, especially when I’m not playing football. I’d like to think I’ll lose the weight. It’s healthier in the long run. I’d be able to go shopping again and actually fit in stuff.”\n\nWhat’s the worst part of being your size?\n\n“There’s been some roller coasters I haven’t been able to fit on.”\n\nHow long ago was that?\n\n“Not that long ago. It was at Disney, the Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster. Luckily I had FastPass, but I did wait in line the whole time and finally got to the front and they were like, ‘Uh, sorry sir. I don’t know how to tell you this, but, uh, you’re too big.’ Damn, I’d been on every other roller coaster.”\n\nYour agent is Drew Rosenhaus. He’s got an interesting reputation. Tell me something that will make people think differently about him.\n\n“Him and his brother, how they work is pretty neat to watch. Drew has this room in his house that has like 10 TVs in it, so he’s able to watch every game his clients are playing in. He’s on top of everything. He might have 150 clients and he could probably name most of the clients he’s ever had and how long they’ve played and details about them. That’s something people don’t see. He’s great at what he does. It’s been a great relationship. If I give him or his brother a call, it’s two rings and they pick up.”\n\nI heard you are one of the most involved players in the Dolphins Cancer Challenge (the main event is Feb. 10 at Hard Rock Stadium and features a concert by the Goo Goo Dolls, a 5K and a bike ride). Why is that particular cause important to you?\n\n“It’s just something I got involved with last year. My wife and I participated. The money stays local with the UM Sylvester Cancer Center. I’m no different than most people in that cancer’s affected my family and loved ones. It’s a good way that I can help make progress toward a cure. It’s as worthy of a cause as I can get behind.”\n\nYou and your wife ran the 5K?\n\n“My wife ran. I walked.”\n\nIs your wife faster than you?\n\n“Yeah. Oh yeah. She does marathons and half-marathons.”\n\nBut I think people underestimate how fast offensive linemen are. You could smoke me in a 40-yard dash, couldn’t you?\n\n“Depends on the time of year, but yeah.”\n\nHow far of a run would we have to do for me to be faster than you? A mile? Two miles?\n\n“I’m good for about 10 minutes, then I crap out. I’ve got a mile in me. You’d definitely have me in two miles. I can’t run two miles. You’d get me 10 times out of 10.”\n\n[Dolphins could take a hard look at OT Eric Smith over final two games]\n\n[Dolphins RB Kenyan Drake continues his rise]\n\n[Michael Thomas might actually be the Dolphins’ biggest Pro Bowl snub]\n\nCheck out The Palm Beach Post‘s Miami Dolphins page on Facebook",
  "latent_15597": "Breitbart News: What do conservatives have to do to resonate with young people?\n\nGG: They have to explain, succinctly, why their stuff works. And you have to do it with humor, minus jargon, minus anger. Freedom is fun. It’s not shrill.\n\nSimply looking at the dreadful state of things, and saying “thanks Obama,” and linking him to the apocalypse is already old hat. I get the simplicity–it’s what the left mastered with Reagan, and later with both Bush’s. At a certain point you have to offer an optimistic, breezy alternative that can be easily understood, without sweaty negativity that makes you appear as though you have a score to settle. It’s hard for conservatives, who despise government–and therefore despise governance–to come up with a “plan” for health care. I detest planning, but if you don’t do it–they will. Our plan will always be the “free market,” but we need to explain how that works (with examples–there are lots!) and that our alternative does not HURT people.\n\nThe challenge for us, is that our critics lazily call any of our beliefs exclusionary and painful to the underclass, when it’s precisely their practices that achieve those brutal realities. Kevin Williamson’s recent piece in National Review comparing the net worth of white and black families, tells you all you need to know about toxic liberal policy. It’s horrible. We need to explain how the opposition–recently with health care–is narrowing choice for young people, but also reducing potential for that young person to put his or her money elsewhere. One-size-fits-all health care for everyone means, ultimately less food and clothing for your child.\n\nLet’s compare the predicted outcomes of Obamacare from both ideological extremes. The left will call it a victory for the progressive ideal: expanding government to provide more goods and services to those who cannot provide for themselves. Well, we know this is only part of the case; it’s a costume. What this is, is an inventive disguise for wealth confiscation and transfer. But, is it going to be the hell, as the hard right envision? No–because it never is really as immediately bad (at once) as you say it is. That’s often the problem. Hell comes in small steps. And before you know it you’re there.\n\nSure the website is a fucking mess, but it will be fixed. Then… what’s your argument now? It’s got to be about the law. Pelosi and her brood shoved this thing through, and it’s a soulless, destructive beast that ultimately limits choice, and therefore, freedom. It’s a step backward into a world we beat. We are accepting the principles of those we bested.\n\nBut screaming that it’s Armageddon drives cynicism. You don’t have to shout. It’s why the defunding scheme was not simply a mathematical failure, it was a rhetorical one too. I get the impulse: standing on the cliff and shouting “stop!” at the growing blob of government. I’ve been shouting that for decades. But the difference between shouting “stop” and actually “stopping” it, comes through viable, likeable candidates, elections, and winning. It’s not achievable simply through the orgasm of talk radio, or bizarre candidates who appeal to the loudest voices. Sometimes we are too kind to candidates because we are too kind. And we think their uniqueness is refreshing, when it’s just odd. Even I thought Christine O’Donnell was delightfully quirky. Boy was I wrong on that one. Very wrong. I should have listened to a few RINOs on that one.\n\nWhich is why you have to explain that Obamacare doesn’t have to be deadly to be awful. If all Obamacare is, is providing you with less, that costs more–that’s already harmful and immoral. Think about it. The intrusive hand of government just took money from the middle class, ran it through the change machine that is bureaucracy, and that same middle class has less insurance for more money. So where did that money go? To cover people who didn’t ask for it. Obamacare just picked your pocket. And they spent it on something nobody wants. Those nobodies are everybody.\n\nWhat this means, plainly, is money was taken from Jane, to pay for Paul. If Jane’s life wasn’t impacted so negatively, we’d probably live with it (Medicaid is pretty much that model–a bottomless billion dollar pit–but at least it’s not threatening you by force to do something you don’t want to do). But Jane is not simply seeing her money go to someone else, her own personal happiness is eroded. This is not a first theft for big government, but it might be the most recent. And the most obvious, despite the disguise.\n\nRelated to Obamacare is the IRS corruption, and that’s the scandal a smart politician could work to great effect. It’s now the policing arm for the Democratic party, especially for Obamacare. You don’t agree with Obama, we’ll pay you a visit. If that’s not a scandal, then none of this matters. Meanwhile, as they chase down conservative groups, to help Obama win elections, they continue to dole out billions in earned income tax credits–the biggest scam this side of the pet rock. Here the IRS makes Madoff’s corruption look modest. Because of the whirlwind of other stuff–the NSA in particular, and Snowden–Obama escaped the IRS scandal, through a back door, created by the right jumping in bed with the hard left.\n\nBreitbart News: What is the biggest obstacle the right puts in its own path?\n\nGG: SABS. Self-appointed Bouncer Syndrome. It’s a phenomena often erupting among those of us who, imbued with strong ideological beliefs, feel compelled to tell you dismissively that you’re not as conservative as they are. I was like this person. For a long time. Calling someone a “RINO” makes you feel stronger about your own beliefs, even if it divides the team you belong to. The great thing about the Republican Party is that ALL of its members are “Republican in name only,” because there are so many different variations. Hell, I’m not even sure what I am. I registered as a Republican only once to vote in a primary (for my old drinking pal Pat Toomey in PA). I can’t remember if I changed back to Independent, which I always was. I never paid attention.\n\nIt would be helpful to look at the left, and see how unified they can be, when it comes to winning. I despise lockstep, but I’m talking about winning–coming together despite differences. The day that I’m called a liberal is the day this party is dead. I’ve been a screaming right winger for 25 years. When someone calls me a RINO because they discovered talk radio a year ago–sorry dude–I was reading Paul Johnson when you were pooping in your pants and swinging from monkey bars in the playground. When you debate over tactics, you cannot impugn those who disagree with you, as lacking in principles. It’s what your adversaries love. You’re supposed to focus your fight outward, not inward.\n\nThis bouncer syndrome occurs often among libertarians. They love announcing “you’re not really a libertarian!” Sometimes I wonder if that’s all some libertarians do: Hang around and tell you that you can’t come into their club of… one. By the way, what I’m advocating is also what I advocate about marriage. When you go buy a car, the couple must present a front, even if they’re vulnerable to different desires. The conflict should not be between spouses, but that couple and the guy trying to sell you undercoating. Know your opposition.\n\nSince I took my stance strongly defending the NSA, I got a lot of grief from preening types, who Googled Benjamin Franklin’s quote on security, and sent it to me triumphantly–as if that somehow undermines a fairly straightforward position, or elevates theirs. I admire all the guys at Reason, because they are consistently cynical toward government intrusion. And they give me a run for my money. But I’m mostly critical of those who despise the current administration so much, they join hands with people bent on dismantling certain safeguards against terrorism that are necessary to maintain the freedoms I cherish.\n\nAs a conservative with a libertarian streak, I believe the only way I can be free to do whatever I want, whenever I please, is to be as ruthless and powerful in advocating the security of this nation. I want a deadly defense, and the greatest spying capabilities possible. I want my freedoms protected. I am sacrificing nothing; Oh, on the contrary, I am aggressively demanding MORE. To conflate the compiling of email addresses with “reading our emails” is simplistic and dishonest. And when we find violations, we call them out. But they are few. We can just as easily find such violations in our military, and our police. Would you do away with them as well?\n\nThe canonization of Snowden was, sadly, more a reflex to jab a stick at Obama with–and it overlooks one great flaw. You are now siding with a segment of the left who wishes to dismantle the weapons we’ve created to fight terror. Seeing conservatives complimenting Glenn Greenwald is disturbing–for these conservatives fail to see how much contempt Greenwald holds for them. The case in point: the recent revelations about our spying on foreigners. So what’s the problem there? That’s what spies do. If you don’t like it, why do you go to James Bond movies? Spying is a necessary currency for adults. This is not a game played fairly by all participants. If you decide to play “fair,” they will only keep cheating. See the Russians.\n\nSo we must be the best at it, and make no apologies for our deviousness. Our deviousness is only criticized because we must be so damn good at it. That Snowden thinks this is somehow against the constitution is laughable, and destructive. My intuition tells me that if a Republican becomes President, many of the critics of the NSA on the right will dissipate. I admire the consistency of some on the left who hate such activity under Bush and Obama; and those on the right who supported it under Bush, and now. Anyone else–the flippers and the floppers on the left and right–they are willing to sacrifice our security before the altar of ideology.\n\nBreitbart News: As you mentioned, you’re a conservative with a libertarian streak. Do you believe that is the direction of the movement?\n\nGG: On social issues, yes. The world will do what it wants, and personal feelings toward it will not change things. You may not like gay marriage, but I think you’re wrong. Gay marriage is a conservative stance, in my opinion. It’s not an original one, but it’s mine. Abortion? I’m pro-life, but what can I do, but show people that there is a moral underpinning to my belief that exists independent of the bible. My pro-life beliefs are libertarian in nature, not religious. I don’t need a God to tell me there’s something sad about removing people from the finish line–who defied the odds to be “born.” Being born is the ultimate lottery, so being plucked as you cash that ticket seems beyond comprehension.\n\nBut I’m also a realist. The bed is made. Being pro-life is like being for total gun control. You want guns banned, because then no one will die by guns. If that were to happen, you’d be right. But it’s never going to happen. I’m pro-life. I’d like to see all babies born and made available through a vibrant adoption process. But that’s not going to happen, perhaps for a very, very long time. So all I can do is comment on the culture that creates a tumorization of the fetus. And at times, I admit, I am not as dedicated as those folks on the street, brandishing the garish photos of dead babies. But I do not see that going anywhere. I do not see victory for anyone here. So I move on.\n\nGive up on the drug war. Don’t make a big deal of it. Just stop. It’s not working, and it’s against human nature to deny an individual’s choice to mediate whatever predicament they’re in with oblivion. Oblivion should be legal. And if it’s legal, there is less harm to others who must endure their drive for oblivion. Legal heroin means no heroin addict will try to steal my car. I know a few people (I can count them on one hand) who do not need oblivion. I am not one of them.\n\nFree markets matter. Fighting regulation based on shoddy hypothesis matter. Climate change–whether you believe it’s marginal effect is manmade or not–cannot, nor should it be the furious engine that it’s designed to be for taxation and regulation. Hell, a little global warming saves lives. That’s science. The predicted apocalypse is wrong. We need to kill that beast. Libertarian writers excel at marshaling facts better than anyone because they exist outside the duopoly of right vs. left. It gives them the freedom to destroy your gun control arguments with statistics; it gives them the ease by which they brutalize the war on drugs rhetoric; it gives them the power to question the over-reach of climate change science. Facts matter, and the more they are simplified to tell a story, the better.\n\nThe problem with much of the ideas that affect our society is that they are boring. Climate change apostles used to win handily not because they had facts (they concocted consensus in a pretty complicated process that requires lengthy explanation), but because their rhetoric is far from boring. It’s romantically apocalyptic. Al Gore made a second career, and hundreds of millions, holding a sign reading “the end of the world is near.” The person refuting that makes pennies, by comparison. I can’t wait for that war to start. There are so many new fighters willing to dismantle the hysteria. As a luke-warmer, I can accept a slight increase in temperature over a century, but I’m far from convinced that requires drastic changes in our lives or economy. We spend twice as much on climate change as we do on borders. Out of fear.\n\nLibertarianism attracts the smartest people I know, so maybe I’m not as smart as I should be. Because I support the NSA–I have lost my libertarian card. So be it. But, again, I maintain that for America to remain the most free, the most “libertarian” outpost on the planet–we must protect it with every weapon viable. And spying, surveillance, cameras,–the whole bit–I welcome it. Save your Ben Franklin Google quote–I’ve thought about this more than you can imagine.\n\nBottom line: you want to beat a liberal democrat? Put forth a right wing Obama. Someone charming, likeable, accessible, who can convey your core beliefs succinctly, confidently, and without easily parodied mannerisms. For republicans, that’s really, really hard. The people I’d like to see run, won’t run. Even so, I veer from the hardcore Allen West to the charismatic, natural Chris Christie. I dig Gary Sinise. They are vastly, different, but they fall under the same umbrella: they aren’t big government liberals, and they have singular, resonating points of view. My dream of dreams is that a 90 lb. farm girl with the guts of 12 MMA fighters would enter the ring, but Dana Perino would never do it. If she did, I’d be her social secretary, and end up babysitting a dog. We need more Mia Loves.\n\nBreitbart News: You understand the value of pop culture and its impact on politics as much as anyone, why do you suppose this concept is not embraced by our side?\n\nGG: I’ll tell you why. Because we think everything is weird. It’s the nature of conservatism, I guess. We take risks with money, but not with much else. But that’s wrong. We wrinkle our noses at things we don’t understand. Rather than just understanding it. I see this whenever I pick music for one show I do. It’s not as obvious as it used to be. But the moment my segment opens, and the song I pick is played–something by Tobacco or Torche–you can sense the eyerolling. It’s “what the hell is this.” But as much as love the music–it can’t all be country music or classic rock. Try some doom, psychedelia, krautrock, or scuzzy electronica.\n\nLouis CK may be profane, but he’s also perceptive and honest. Alec Baldwin may be an ass, but he’s one of the finest comedic television actors in recent memory. I hate the phrase “open-minded,” but we must open our minds to the creativity you otherwise might find unnerving. To me, music is the closest thing I get to religion. It’s mathematics that nails your soul. These are simply equations created by other humans that affect complete strangers in ways that are novel–every singl, new melody or riff affects you in a new way. A new song does something to you that no previous song did before. It’s a miracle to me that I find a new song or album that blows me away. This new album by Fuzz. I play it daily. God, it’s great. I’m sure there will be another one that does that same thing, shortly.\n\nMy point: laughing at what is weird or different is not a conservative virtue. And I hate it with a passion. I’d rather hang with a liberal fan of the Melvins than a rightwinger who hates the Melvins. Look–Johnny Ramone was a rightwinger. And, under specific criteria, the Ramones might be the greatest band ever. It would be nice to see more Johnny Ramones.\n\nBreitbart News: Competing with the left’s monopoly on entertainment, media, and education is a daunting task. How do you think we can chip away at it?\n\nGG: That may never completely change. But it can change a little. The most obvious solution is to encourage offspring to engage in it. It might be too late for you. I’m not taking up guitar lessons again. I was too nervous, and had a bad experience with a squirrel (not a joke). The arts can be a business, so look at it that way. Creating something people like, and making money off it–that’s free market meeting the free mind at its most awesome.\n\nLook–there is no doubt that these people (artists in seedy downtown bedsits) hate you. But my theory is this: almost everyone involved in the arts who’s any good was mostly indifferent to politics. Reflexively liberal? Probably. What do you expect? But intensely political artists are intensely political because their art wasn’t that good enough. Performance artists are often left wing, because their “performance” is politically left wing to gain grants and attention. They get more than a pass. They get an invitation. Without their acceptable “radical” assumptions, their lack of talent would be unacceptable. That’s why Karen Finley would not exist if she were a Reaganite. You can shove yams up your ass, and get a grant for it, as long as you’re a lib. Look her up–I’m not kidding about the yams.\n\n“Satisfaction” is not a left-wing or right-wing song. The Stones just wanted to play music and get laid, and then get rich. I’d encourage people to get their kids interested in making things, and see what happens. My pessimistic feeling about progress in this arena is real. The left don’t veer toward banking and business because it’s scary and weird. That’s risk that scares them. The same could be said for the right and the arts. Maybe that will never change. I do notice, however, that many musicians who are older are rabidly right wing. Once they make money, they see the folly of demonizing a system that rewards them for hard work. Kid Rock is a great example. But there are many others.\n\nBreitbart News: How are you?\n\nGG: I’m okay. I’m tired. I’ve been doing two shows, sometimes three–every day for two years, and writing books at night. I do almost nothing else. I go to the gym. I read. I drink. But I’m tired. Not complaining, though. Being tired is better than the opposite–by a long shot. We should all be tired. Tired means you’re running on empty, and not leaving anything behind.",
  "latent_15642": "Story highlights July was the hottest month on record, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says\n\nNOAA predicts 2015 could be the hottest year on record\n\n(CNN) If you felt the heat this past July, you are hardly alone.\n\nJuly saw the highest average temperatures since record-keeping began -- globally, not just in the United States -- the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Thursday.\n\nGlobally, the first seven months of the year also had all-time highs. The latest global temperature data make it likely that 2015 will be the hottest year on record, the agency said.\n\nNOAA's findings follow reports by NASA and the Japan Meteorological Agency, which reached the same conclusion using their own data.\n\nPhotos: What's causing climate change? Meet the top 10 villains Photos: What's causing climate change? Meet the top 10 villains Electricity and heat: 30.6% – Burning fossil fuels for electricity and heat is, by far, the main driver of climate change. Emissions from those sectors account for nearly a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the World Resources Institute . These activities are the biggest climate villains, statistically speaking. Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: What's causing climate change? Meet the top 10 villains Transportation: 14.8% – Transportation -- driving, flying and the like -- makes up nearly 15% of global climate-change pollution, according to 2012 data synthesized by WRI. It's the second-most important cause of dangerous global warming. Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: What's causing climate change? Meet the top 10 villains Manufacturing and construction: 13.3% – Manufacturing and construction are less often discussed than transit, but they contribute nearly as much to climate change: 13.3% of emissions, WRI says. These activities are the third-biggest contributors of heat-trapping emissions. Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: What's causing climate change? Meet the top 10 villains Agriculture: 11.1% – Likewise, our food systems are villains in the fight against climate change. Advocates say giving up meat, especially beef, would help curb greenhouse gases. Agriculture makes up 11.1% of global emissions, according to WRI. Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: What's causing climate change? Meet the top 10 villains Other fuel combustion: 8.2% – Burning other types of fuel, including wood, accounts for 8.2% of emissions. Also included in this category are fuels burned in commercial and residential buildings, as well as burning fuel for agriculture and deep-sea fishing. Hide Caption 5 of 10 Photos: What's causing climate change? Meet the top 10 villains Industrial processes: 5.8% – Industry adds 5.8% of global carbon and greenhouse gas emissions, according to WRI. Cement and aluminum production, shown here, are among the major contributors. Hide Caption 6 of 10 Photos: What's causing climate change? Meet the top 10 villains Deforestation and land use changes: 5.7% – Forests trap carbon, so chopping down rainforests contributes considerably to the climate change problem. Estimates vary, but WRI says deforestation accounts for 5.7% of emissions linked to climate change. Other estimates put the number closer to 20%. Hide Caption 7 of 10 Photos: What's causing climate change?

She was murdered in 1999 in Baltimore Maryland and her boyfriend, Adnan Syed, convicted of the crime.\n\nBoyfriend: Adnan Syed was a high-school footballer and Hae Min Lee's boyfriend. The relationship was secret: His Muslim Pakistani parents and her Korean family would not, they believed, have approved\n\nTogether: The only image of the young couple together, along with other - unidentified - students at Woodlawn High School in Baltimore County, Maryland. The school was where the couple met\n\nSerial, a spin-off from the public radio documentary, This American Life, has proved a critical and popular hit.\n\nWith seven parts so far made available to listeners, it has detailed the violent death of Hae Min Lee and its aftermath, resulting in the conviction of Adnan Syed. Today a new episode is being posted.\n\nIts popularity has meant fans have used the internet to speculate on the case and whether Syed is in fact guilty. One section of the site Reddit devoted to it has more than 8,000 registered contributors.\n\nThe case began in the relatively poor area of Woodlawn, in Baltimore County, just over the county line from the port city in 1999.\n\nAt Woodlawn High School, Adnan Syed, 17, was the outstanding student of his year.\n\nA Muslim teenager with conservative parents who had immigrated from the Pashtun tribal areas of Pakistan, he was on course for straight As, wanted to be a doctor, and as well as a football player, was voted Homecoming King.\n\nSERIAL: WHO'S WHO IN PODCAST Adnan Syed: Convicted of murder of his ex-grilfriend Hae Min Lee. Serving life plus 30 years. Protests his innocence. Hae Min Lee: Found murdered in a park in Baltimore four weeks after vanishing. Her family have returned to South Korea. Jay Wilds: Knows only as Jay in the series, he provided evidence which led police to Syed, then testimony at his trial. Never went to prison and has moved to Los Angeles. Jennifer Pusateri: Friend of Wilds. Syed phoned her six times on the day Hae was found. Told police Wilds had told her that Syed had killed Hae. Detective William Ritz: Compiled case against Syed. Veteran officer retired in 2012 under a cloud over another miscarriage of justice.\n\nWhat his family did not know was that he had been in a relationship with Hae Min Lee. Equally gifted, she was the daughter of Korean immigrants, who were unaware that their 18-year-old was seeing a boy.\n\nBoth families, the teenagers appear to have believed, would have been against the relationship.\n\nBut both families were to learn of the secret romance in the most upsetting way imaginable.\n\nThe alarm was raised on 13 January when Hae failed to collect her six-year-old niece after school. it was immediately suspicious, as Hae was highly-responsible and it was unthinkable that she would not collect the girl.\n\nShe had last been seen driving her gray 1998 Nissan Sentra away from school, on her way to pick up her niece then go to her job in a local Lenscrafters shop.\n\nIt was clear that something was very wrong; a gifted athlete, Hae wanted to become an optician. She had tickets booked for a trip to France and was a popular pupil at the school.\n\nPolice contacted Adnan Syed - by then her ex-boyfriend - and others close to Hae, hoping they could shed light on her disappearance.\n\nOn 9 February, her body was discovered buried in a shallow grave in Baltimore's Leakin Park, which the city's folklore suggests is littered with murdered corpses.\n\nIt was found by a man who told police he had pulled over in his car to take an emergency bathroom break - although it was some distance from the road.\n\nThe discovery brought fresh energy to the case and on 12 February, an anonymous call to police told them that they should look at Syed as a suspect.\n\nSix days later, his cell phone records were subpoenaed.\n\nThey showed that on the day the murdered girl's body was discovered, there were six calls from Syed to a number belonging to Jennifer Pusateri, then a student at the University of Maryland Baltimore County.\n\nAs a result, she was questioned by police - and initially said that she knew nothing.\n\nBut the day later, on 27 February, she returned to the detectives and told them that her friend Jay Wilds had told her that Syed had killed Hae.\n\nIt appeared to be a crucial breakthrough. The next day Wilds was interviewed by police. He is not fully named in Serial.\n\nHope: Syed's mother, Shahmim Rahman, and her youngest son Yusuf, outside their home In Windsor Mill, Maryland. They hope a second appeal will be granted and clear Syed\n\nAll American: Syed was named Homecoming King at Woodlawn High School, but weeks after his girlfriend vanished, her body was found and he became prime suspect. He was convicted of her murder but continues to protest his innocence. His family believe the Serial hit podcast will boost his case\n\nCrime scene: Leakin Park, Baltimore's largest outdoor space, was where Hae's body was found four weeks after she vanished. Police were alerted by a man who said he had stopped for an emergency bathroom stop\n\nRus in urbe: Cyclists ride on a trail in Leakin Park, near the 4400 block of Franklintown Road, where the body of Hae Min Lee was discovered, on Feb. 9, 1999\n\nWilds was already known to police - aged 19, he was a small-time drug dealer but had become a friend of Syed.\n\nWilds told detectives that Syed had shown him Hae's body and led them to her car. Shortly afterwards the same day, Syed was arrested.\n\nHe told police he had smoked pot and gone to athletics practice after school.\n\nBut in a series of interviews, Wilds provided the police - who were led by a veteran homicide detective, William Ritz - with the case against his friend.\n\n'Adnan had a bright future. He was a grade-A student. He had been accepted at university to study medicine. But it was all taken away from him because the police wanted to clear up this murder case quickly Syed's brother Yusuf\n\nSerial plays tapes of police interview of Wilds in which it appears to some listeners that Baltimore City Police Department detectives coached the small-time drug dealer with his answers\n\nWilds claimed Syed told him he had strangled Hae in the Best Buy parking lot close to Woodlawn High School after he had persuaded her to give him a ride.\n\nWilds says Syed then recruited him to help dispose of the body, collecting shovels before driving to Leakin Park and digging a six-inch deep grave.\n\nWilds did not exhaustively explain Syed's motive, only that Hae Min Lee was humiliating him with her new, older boyfriend, according to the police tapes.\n\nThe older boyfriend was not identified.\n\nIt was enough to put Syed - who continued to protest his innocence - on the way to a trial.\n\nBut there was not to be one for Wilds. In September he pled guilty to accessory after the fact to the first degree murder of Hae.\n\nDetails of any deal or plea bargain Wilds made with the Baltimore City State Attorney are not available to the public, MailOnline has been told.\n\nWilds has now moved to Los Angeles. His trial evidence was hardly his last time in court; he has three convictions for possession of marijuana.\n\nA series of other cases against him have been brought, including assaulting a law enforcement official, breach of probation, and riding a bicycle without lights, but all were either stayed or declared inactive by prosecutors.\n\nDoomed romance: Hae and Syed were boyfriend and girlfriend - but in secret as they believed neither family would have approved. The couple studied at Woodlawn High School. Both had bright futures ahead of them.\n\nMurder location: This Best Buy off of Security Boulevard in Baltimore, Md. is allegedly where Hae Min Lee was strangled to death in 1999\n\nJenn Pusateri (left) received six calls from Syed on the day Hae's body was found. But she told detectives that Jay Wilds (right) had told her that Syed had confessed to the killing. Wilds plead guilty to being an accessory to first degree murder but was not jailed. He now lives in California\n\nLISTEN TO THE FULL EPISODE\n\nIn December, Syed went on trial, but within a week the judge - William Quarles - had declared a mistrial because the jury overheard him accusing Syed's lawyer, Christina Gutierrez, of lying.\n\nA second trial, overseen by Judge Wanda Heard, began in the New Year, almost a year after Hae's disappearance.\n\nState Prosecutor Kevin Urich made much of Syed's jealousy during his speech to the murder trial jury, focusing on the accused's Muslim background.\n\nI would like to forgive Adnan Syed, but as of now, I just don't know how I could.\n\nWhen I die, my daughter will die with me. As long as I live my daughter is buried in my heart Hae Min Lee's mother Youn Wha Kim\n\nHe told the jury of their 'secret' nature of their relationship and the pressure this put on them.\n\nIt was persuasive, overcoming a lack of forensic evidence – DNA, finger prints – linking Syed to Hae's body. Syed himself made no concession, claiming his innocence throughout the trial.\n\nUlrich persuaded the jury that Syed had strangled Hae Min Lee and they convicted him of first degree murder.\n\nAt a sentencing hearing, the impact on her family became clear.\n\nHae Min Lee's mother Youn Wha Kim told the court she had brought her children to America seven years previously so they could have a 'decent education and a decent future'. It had earlier been disclosed that their father had stayed in Korea and played no part in bringing up Hae and her brother, Young Lee, two years her junior.\n\nSpeaking through an interpreter at the sentencing she said: 'I would like to forgive Adnan Syed, but as of now, I just don't know how I could.\n\n'When I die, my daughter will die with me. As long as I live my daughter is buried in my heart.'\n\nDistraught Mrs Kim nearly collapsed when she stepped off the witness stand and was escorted sobbing out of the courtroom.\n\nShortly afterwards the family moved back to Korea. It is unclear now if they are aware of the attention their daughter's murder has gained because of the podcast.\n\nSyed was sentenced to life plus 30 years, meaning that he had no prospect of release until 2030 at the earliest.\n\n'Solely because of hurt pride, he chose to kill,' Ulrick told the judge. 'There is nothing here to excuse or explain the murder.'\n\nHeard agreed. Noting Syed's intellect and popularity at school, Heard said: 'You used that to manipulate people. Even today, I think you continue to manipulate even those who love you.'\n\nKey: Detective William Ritz, who retired from Baltimore Police in 2012 under a cloud. He compiled the case file in Syed's trial but was later named as being involved in a miscarriage of justice described by the victim as 'one of the most shameful episodes of police misconduct' in Baltimore's history\n\nCase file: This map in detectives' notes was drawn after an interview with Ju'uan, a friend of Adnan who said it showed where they went to smoke pot in the weeks after Hae's disappearance but before her body was found.\n\nEvidence: Syed drew this map for police to show where he had gone to smoke pot. It is the most secluded part of the Best Buy parking lot.\n\nBut Syed - who had already told the judge 'I have maintained my innocence since the begining' - has not given up his fight.\n\nHe and his legal team secured two reviews of his case - in 2002 and in 2012 - both of them unsuccessful. Neither of them has been disclosed to listeners to the podcast.\n\nBut now, MailOnline can disclose, a third review has been launched which will lead to an appeal hearing.\n\nBaltimore City State Attorney's Office say they cannot discuss the case.\n\nSpokesman Tony Savage told MailOnline: 'The case is currently on appeal and we don't comment on pending matters.'\n\nAlthough the prosecution will not discuss what has prompted the review, two new areas of evidence appear to have emerged.\n\nOne of them has featured in the podcast: testimony from a classmate of Syed - known as Asia - that she spent the day he went missing with him in the library.\n\nHOW CASE UNFOLDED 13 January 1999: Hae Min Lee, a senior at Woodlawn High School, vanishes 9 February: A man who stopped for an emergency bathroom break finds Hae's body in a shallow grave in a Baltimore city parl 12 February: Anonymous tip-off tells police to look at Adnan Syed as a suspect 18 February: Police seize his cell phone records 27 February: Jennifer Pusateri tells detectives Jay Wilds has told her that Syed killed Hae 28 February: Syed is arrested hours after Wilds shows police Hae's car 7 September: Wilds pleads guilty to accessory after the fact to first degree murder 15 December: Syed's first trial is declared a mistrial 25 February 2000: Syed is convicted of first degree murder 6 June: Syed begins life plus 30 years sentence 2003: Review of case but conviction remains 2012: Second review does not find in Syed's favor 3 October 2014: First episode of Serial\n\nA series of letters she wrote have featured and suggest that Syed could have an alibi. It would change the timeline presented at the first trial - and was never presented to it because his defense attorney did not make contact with her.\n\nHis family say that the attorney was acting incompetently, and that a future appeal should take the failure into account.\n\nThere is also an affidavit Asia wrote in March 2000, after Syed's conviction, which has also never been presented to a court.\n\nThe other new strand is over one of the investigators, and has not been disclosed in the show: Ritz, who led the murder investigation and compiled the file against Syed.\n\nRitz, 60, worked for the Baltimore City Police Department for 32 years before retiring last year under a cloud.\n\nThe veteran homicide investigator was one of 16 police officers sued by Ezra Mable who claims police pressured witnesses to lie and intentionally mishandled evidence leading to his wrongful conviction for murder.\n\nMable was only released after serving ten years in jail in what he called 'one of the most shameful episodes of police misconduct' in Baltimore's history.\n\nRitz has moved to Florida and declined to comment to MailOnline.\n\nThe development has given fresh hope to Syed's family. Syed's brother Yusuf told Mail Online: 'Serial has brought wide attention to Adnan's case.\n\n'No one was interested in our fight until Serial became involved.\n\n'We hope this will bring justice for Adnan and our family.\n\n'Adnan has always said he did not murder Hae and finally people are starting to listen.'\n\nThe family believe that Wilds. He has moved to Los Angeles and declined to speak to MailOnline.\n\n'Everything the police have on Adnan is from Jay. Witnesses who say they saw Adnan at a certain time are all linked to Jay.'\n\nSpeaking at the family's modest two-storey home in the district of Windsor Mill, his mother Shamim Rahman, 51, said: 'We have spent a lot of time with the people from Serial.\n\n'They talked with us for hours. They have taken away our pictures of Adnan. We hope they can help set him free.'\n\nThe family have known now of Syed's secret past for many years.\n\nSyed tells Serial: 'My mom thought I was a virgin. She did not know about the girls, the weed or the drinking and I was not going to tell her.'\n\nMissed evidence: This letter from Asia to Syed - whose name she spelled incorrectly - appearing to back up his alibi. But it was never seen by the jury after the defense attorney failed to contact her. Syed's family say the attorney was acting incompetently\n\nAffirdavit: After Syed was convicted Asia wrote this affidavit to once again tell how she had spent the afternoon with him in the library. But it has never been presented to a court.\n\nSyed's mother has confirmed she would not have approved of their relationship. 'I certainly would not have allowed it if I had known,' she told MailOnline.\n\nHowever any sense of disapproval is long in the past, as the family mourn a future Syed cannot have.\n\nHit producer: Sarah Koenig is the producer and former Baltimore Sun reporter who has created the cult podcast\n\nYusuf said: 'Adnan had a bright future. He was a grade-A student. He had been accepted at university to study medicine.\n\n'But it was all taken away from him because the police wanted to clear up this murder case quickly.\n\n'They could not wait to do their job properly so they sent an innocent kid to jail.\n\n'Serial has shown that people don't have to be guilty of a crime but still they get thrown in jail.'\n\nMrs Rahman added: 'I suffer constant pain knowing that Adnan is innocent but he has been sent to jail for the rest of his life.\n\n'His conviction destroyed the whole family.'\n\nMrs Rahman has become estranged from her oldest son Tanveer and her husband, Syed Rahman, a retired civil engineer, has become a recluse.\n\nWhat remains unclear about the podcast is the outcome: fans are hooked on its suspenseful, pacy presentation.\n\nOne of its episodes has been streamed or downloaded 2.1 million times.\n\nIts producer, Sarah Koenig, a former Baltimore Sun reporter - like David Simon, the creator of The Wire - has yet to reveal whether she thinks Syed in innocent.",
  "latent_16009": "It wasn't always clear, at least not right away, who was joking and who was serious at a contentious June community showdown over plans to rethink and remake Colorado Boulevard in Eagle Rock. The woman who warned that removing a traffic lane in each direction would turn her neighborhood into a Bantustan, like those ethnic enclaves in South Africa where ingress and egress were tightly controlled – it turns out that she was being serious. The man who listed a dozen or so dangers associated with re-striping for bike lanes – for example, city workers might accidentally stripe over small animals and become distraught at what they had done, and cyclists wearing tight-fitting outfits would be a titillating distraction to motorists – surely he was just having some fun at the expense of the bike opponents.",
  "latent_16043": "Arlington, Virginia - For the next two weeks until Election Day, pundits will speculate about Barack Obama and Mitt Romney's varying abilities to woo the elderly vote, the military vote, the Hispanic vote, the Jewish vote, the woman vote, the black vote, the white vote, the student vote, the small business owner vote and a slew of others.\n\nOne of the less sought-after \"votes\" this election? American Muslims.\n\nTrue, the United States' 2.6 million Muslims make up only about one per cent of the population, as compared to demographic groups more often pursued by politicians, such as veterans (7 per cent), Hispanics (16.7 per cent) and elderly voters (13 per cent).\n\nBut Muslims make up larger portions of the population in crucial swing states like Virginia and Florida, and they're the fastest-growing religious community in the US.\n\nMuslims even have the possibility of swinging this election: In 2000, George W Bush won a disputed poll after triumphing in Florida by a mere 537 votes. During his campaign Bush actively courted the Muslim community, who voted overwhelmingly for the Republican. In Florida, Bush won about 50,000 more votes from Muslims than his Democratic opponent, Al Gore.\n\nWary of Republicans\n\nIn the 2004 election, the controversial Patriot Act and the war in Iraq caused Muslim voters to flock en masse to the Democrats: About nine in 10 voted for John Kerry, and a similar portion backed Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nThough there's less enthusiasm for Obama among American Muslims today than there was four years ago, former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is unlikely to make big gains with the demographic.\n\nAt a presidential debate viewing party in Arlington, Virginia hosted by the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC) - a group promoting the civil rights of American Muslims - many of the roughly 50 people there were critical of some Obama policies. But no one this reporter spoke to said they planned on voting for Romney.\n\nOne factor driving Republicans' low support among Muslim voters? The party's primary process, during which several candidates made incendiary comments about Muslims.\n\nPizza magnate Herman Cain vowed not to appoint any Muslims to his cabinet were he elected president, a promise that would have violated Article 6 of the US Constitution, which prohibits imposing religious tests for office (Cain quickly backtracked).\n\nFormer Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich claimed in an interview that Palestinians are an \"invented\" people.\n\nAnd Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann claimed there are stealth efforts to impose sharia law on the US. In July - after she dropped out of the primary - she accused Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton's deputy chief of staff, of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nIn remarks made at a private fundraiser that was secretly videotaped, Romney declared that Palestinians have \"no interest whatsoever in establishing peace\". And on a trip to Israel this summer, Romney explained Israel's economic success vis-a-vis Palestine by saying \"culture makes all the difference\".\n\nShameem Ahsan, a New York native who is voting for Obama, said at the debate viewing party that Romney \"could have just not said anything. But he tried to, I thought, score points with people and take advantage of anti-Muslim sentiment in this country.\"\n\n'Muslims for Romney'\n\nBut there are some Muslims who, repelled by the Democrats’ positions on social issues, are voting Romney.\n\nUmar Ahmad Ghuman is a Pennsylvania voter and dual citizen who served as a minister of investment in Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf’s government.\n\nHe’s always voted Republican, but this election cycle Ghuman was inspired to launch an organisation called Muslims for Romney after he discovered the public school his eighth-grade son attended had given a writing assignment on a lesbian couple who had spoken there.\n\nMuslims for Romney, he says, aims to show both Republicans and Muslims “how similar our values are”, and to encourage Muslim voters “to wake up and fight against abortion and gay rights”. Decrying what he describes as the “unholy, unnatural alliance” between Muslim voters and Democrats, he urges Muslims to pay more attention to social issues within the US.\n\nObama let-downs\n\nDisappointment with the Republican Party is not translating into the energetic enthusiasm many had for Obama in 2008.\n\n\"I think the Muslim community's still going to vote for Obama in overwhelming numbers.\" - Congressman Keith Ellison (D)\n\nYasmin Hussein, MPAC's Young Leaders Coordinator, said the group conducted an informal survey after a viewing party for the first presidential debate.\n\nThe results?\n\n\"The majority of the people were actually undecided,\" she told Al Jazeera. She believes that was partly due to Obama's poor performance in the debate - but also because \"a lot of Muslims are really coming out strongly against\" the Obama administration's increased use of weaponised drones and the failure to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.\n\nSome are eyeing third-party candidates as a protest vote, she said.\n\nBut Aziz Poonawalla, a Wisconsin voter and a co-editor of website MuslimsForObama.com, thinks some have been unrealistic or overly harsh when judging Obama's presidency.\n\nPoonawalla noted that when running for president in 2008, \"[Obama] did say he was going to double down in Afghanistan. I think that a lot of people just weren't paying attention.\"\n\nAs for Guantanamo: \"Of course he also wanted to close Guantanamo, but he wasn't able to do that because of congressional resistance.\"\n\nRegarding news that the New York Police Department spied on Muslim communities, Poonawalla stressed that \"Obama didn't have anything to do\" with that surveillance programme.\n\nCongressman Keith Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota who is the first Muslim to be elected to Congress, said, \"I think the Muslim community's still going to vote for Obama in overwhelming numbers.\"\n\n\"But I think that this unbridled enthusiasm - it's a little more tempered\" in this election, he told Al Jazeera.\n\nOutreach\n\nBack in 2000, George W Bush won the votes of more than 7 in 10 Muslims, thanks largely to energetic outreach efforts.\n\n\"[Bush] met with the leadership of the American Muslim community,\" Corey Saylor, director of government affairs at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told Al Jazeera.\n\nSaylor (R) says US Muslims should create a power base of voters that candidates need to be elected [Al Jazeera]\n\n\"Al Gore at the time was like no, thank you.\" Saylor also noted that on the campaign trail, Bush often criticised the government's use of secret evidence in deportation cases, and promised to end the practice.\n\nIn this election cycle, however, neither Obama nor Romney have made substantial outreach efforts to potential Muslim voters.\n\nFarid Senzai, the director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, noted that although Obama has held annual Eid events and similar ceremonies, he has not done \"much in terms of direct, overt meetings\" with American Muslims.\n\nHe suspects this may be partly the case because a sizeable percentage of Americans continue to falsely think Obama, a Christian, is actually a Muslim.\n\nFor his part, Congressman Ellison said he thinks \"it's far healthier for the [Muslim] community to say look, we don't see it as Obama's job to get us out to vote. We're the ones who create a power base of voters so that he needs us to get elected, rather than us chasing him around and then having our feelings hurt because he won't come to a mosque or something like that.\"\n\nSwinging the vote in Virginia?\n\nAlthough American Muslims are not a big minority, CAIR's Saylor pointed out that Cuban Americans, an even smaller group, \"do a really effective job\" of affecting US policy.\n\n\"If a community with less numbers than us can have that kind of an impact on American policy,\" he said, \"there's no question that we can do the same.\"\n\nMuslims are the fastest-growing religious group in the US, with 66.7 per cent growth from 2000 to 2010. The percentage of Muslims has grown the most in the highly contested swing state of Virginia, said political scientist Michelle Claiborne of the University of Virginia's Cooper Center.\n\nSabah says the economy is still the most important factor in chosing a candidate to support [Al Jazeera]\n\nData from the Religious Congregations and Membership Study show a fourfold increase in Muslims in the state between 2000 and 2010; they now make up about 2.7 per cent of the state's population. That's still not a big number, but it's enough to swing Virginia in increasingly close elections.\n\nAhmed Sabah, a northern Virginia native who works at a Lebanese restaurant, noted that \"10 years ago going to prayer … there wouldn't necessarily be a full house. But now people are praying outside of the mosques\" because there is no room inside.\n\nGiven this growth, candidates \"are shooting themselves in the foot over the long term if they continue to alienate\" Muslim voters, Senzai told Al Jazeera.\n\nA growing non-white population in Virginia is one reason the state has been trending blue in recent years, says Claibourn. Virginia has traditionally been conservative, and had voted for the Republican presidential candidate in ten consecutive elections. But in 2008, Obama won the state's 13 electoral votes.\n\nEconomy still number-one issue\n\nAre Muslims more concerned about civil rights and foreign policy than the average voter? Probably - but for many American Muslims and non-Muslims alike, the most important issue in this election is the still-anaemic economy.\n\nSmoking a cigarette in Washington DC's Dupont Circle, Sabah, a Palestinian-American, told Al Jazeera that after Obama was elected in 2008, \"we had high hopes that our economy was going to grow, we were going to have better jobs, more opportunities … In my opinion he didn't really do too much of what he said he was going to do. I don't plan on voting for him or Romney.\"\n\nSabah said his father, who voted for Obama in 2008 and who has cast ballots in every election since he became a legal citizen decades ago, plans not to vote this year for the first time. He says the economic slowdown hurt business at his gas station and garage in Southwest DC, and is disappointed by Obama's performance on the economy.\n\n\"It's not necessarily that there's less money - but there's less opportunity, I feel,\" said Sabah. \"It's just harder to make a living than it was 15, 20 years ago.\"\n\nFollow Sam Bollier on Twitter: @SamBollier",
  "latent_16049": "a Oude markt, essentially one big bar\n\nOur final stop on the trip was Leuven. On checking into my hotel room, I found some brochures that made me look closer. Leuven beercapital, they announced. Leuven? The capital of (presumably Belgian) beer? That may sound a bit odd, but let's look at Leuven's credentials. (This is part 7 of the Scandinavian beer bloggers' tour.)\n\nLiterally across the road from our hotel was the Stella Artois brewery, an enormous, modern brewery complex. Next to it was also the headquarters of Anheuser-Busch Inbev, the world's biggest brewing conglomerate, owning such brands as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Bass, Brahma, Michelob, Hoegaarden, Leffe, Staropramen, Beck's, Corona etc etc etc etc. With more than 150,000 employees, it's actually a pretty big company.\n\na Stella Artois brewery\n\nWe were taken on a kickbike tour of Leuven, starting a few hundred meters from the hotel, by the canal. This canal, it turns out, is why the brewery is here. It goes to Mechelen, where it meets our old friend the Dijle, and was used to ship supplies into the Artois brewery and beer out of it. And as the guide explained to us, essentially this whole part of town was made up by the Artois brewery. When the brewery was modernized, it was all abandoned, and now makes up a kind of wasteland along the canal.\n\nHowever, the guide told us, there is now a plan to tear most of it down, and replace it with modern housing. The remaining bits will be renovated and turned to new uses. The huge grain silos, for example, was to become a hotel. The demolition has begun already, and the first houses have been built. Still, there was more than enough left to give some idea of just how vast this brewery once was.\n\na Old grain silos\n\nThen we go kickbiking off, and within a couple of minutes we are suddenly in the medieval part of Leuven. The transition is abrupt and disorienting. As we move along, the guide keeps pointing out the locations of former breweries. In one street by the river there were more than 30 breweries. In another place, city records show a brewery some distance from the river was granted the right to build a pipeline to get river water. So clearly brewing in Leuven was about a lot more than just the Artois Brewery.\n\nThe kickbike tour ends up at the Domus brewpub, where we are having lunch. The brewpub is in an old historic building, and quite nice inside. The food is good, too. The beers, on the other hand, are more average, and to be honest quite bland. For the thirsty beer lover, Leuven has quite a few more places to offer, however, to be covered in the next blog post. Among them a bar with 3000 different beers.\n\na At Domus\n\nLeuven has more going for it than just this. Recall that professor Delvaux set up a Malting and Brewing Lab at the local university, and other research institutes in Leuven seem quite strong on research into the biology of yeast. Also, if you remember the article about brewery de Kroon, Leuven used to be home to two beer styles that are now just about extinct: Leuvenbier and peeterman. The latter has been brewed by both Domus and Artois as late as the 1990s. Leuvenbier is, as far as I know, extinct, but de Kroon is just 10 kilometers outside Leuven, and now brews a peeterman.\n\nSo, while Leuven probably isn't the first city in Belgium beer enthusiasts would think of visiting, neither should it be the last. Headquarters of the world's biggest brewery conglomerate, a whole suburb essentially made up of a regenerated brewery complex, two historic beer styles, and a beer cafe with 3000 beers on the menu. Plus two major beer research institutions.\n\na 18th century brewery\n\nAnd, trying to think of a Belgian city that deserves the beer capital title more it strikes me that, in fact, in Belgium most of what's interesting in the way of beer takes place outside the big cities. Even some of the best bars and restaurants are in small villages or just by the side of the road.\n\nIt may well be that the best way to explore Belgian beer is by bicycle. It's not like the attractions are far apart.",

  "latent_16162": "NEW DELHI: India’s innate fascination with gold continues as Indian households hold gold worth over $950 billion which in turn is around 50% of the country’s GDP in dollar terms, says a report.Gold consumption is part of India’s culture and tradition and the country is the world’s largest consumer of gold, followed by China. Indian households hold 18,000 tonnes of gold which represents 11% of the global stock and worth more than $950 billion, around 50% of India nominal GDP in dollar terms, says global research firm Macquarie According to Macquarie, 78% of India’s $329 billion in household savings was held in gold in 2009-10 . With gold evolving as a store of value more than an adornment, rising prices have also contributed towards increasing Indian households’ “perceived wealth”.Macquarie used the term “perceived wealth” because most Indian households are reluctant to part with their gold jewellery and other gold holdings, even at times of crisis , as doing so is considered a stigma, it said.",
  "latent_16246": "I felt like I had lost my best friend. Some of my friends had told me they had felt the same way when they went through it. It didn’t stop me though. I knew what I had to do and there comes a point where enough is enough. I rolled down the window and felt the instant blast of the desert heat somewhere between Baker, CA and the Nevada border on the way to Las Vegas with my band mates and simply threw my cigarettes out. I hadn’t planned it, but I had reached bottom. I had been waking up with my throat hurting, raw and gritty. I had fears that I was surely headed towards one of those tricorder-looking things that smokers have to hold up to their throats to talk after they’ve had their vocal chords removed. I had had other such tantrum moments where I tried to quit but this one stuck and I have not inhaled anything since May 4, 1990. For a while it truly was like mourning.\n\n“God, please forgive me while I work through this, while I work through these irritating but persistent sticky questions that have a direct impact on whether you can even really exist or not.”\n\nDismissing faith was not unlike losing a best friend all over again. I had practice. This prayer was sincere and I did pray it, even as I knew it was also completely absurd right at that moment. If God isn’t real, then there is no there there, and if God is real, I felt I probably needed to be terrified. Religious fear is powerful. He was slipping away at an intellectual level (and that is significant because the bible makes a great number of claims about the world and time-space events that should be verifiable), not at an emotional level (I was not bitter, disenchanted, or anything like that).\n\nThe sense of attachment to all things Christian, including the fear of the consequences of heresy and apostasy was still potent. There comes a time though when you have to do what you have to do and in the same way I realized that cigarettes were not any kind of friend at all, neither was a God I had to fear while sincerely working through difficult questions and doubts. For the first time I was able to look that fear right back in the face and cut myself some slack anyway, even if God could not. I was still afraid and still felt like I had lost some kind of tether – to something, I’m not sure what – but a tether, a lifeline, an anchor, or perhaps a best friend. Any number of metaphors might work.\n\nWhen I consider the reactions to my dismissal of faith, I first have to remember my own reaction, and it was a reaction. I was very much an observer of my own process as much as a participant. None of it was easy. I was eventually able to consider the idea that, “I may just be an unbeliever,” (although I felt then that I could never adopt the label of “atheist”). What was it like to be an unbeliever, maybe an atheist whether I wanted to be one or not, as outrageous an idea as that sounded? What would that mean? What are the implications for my friends, family and especially my children, for those who knew me as the guy in Undercover, an outspoken Christian songwriter, performer, producer and evangelist who had led altar calls and worship from the stage, started a bible study and became the figurehead for a Christian record label? What would that mean for my eternal fate and destiny, an excruciating question because it can never be answered definitively, enough to drive many to avoid the question altogether?\n\nMy identity had been so wrapped up in my faith that I now felt dissociated, without a rooted sense of recognizable self, even though in a strange way I felt I was more myself than I had been in years. I had no context for what life would be like without religious belief anymore than I had a context for a daily routine without cigarettes. Smokers and former smokers know what I mean. Former believers know what I mean too. Many people simply live on in their dissonance between what they feel they need to believe and what we know makes sense because they cannot imagine a context or an identity without faith. Richard Dawkins, hinted at this when he was asked if he had any friends who are believers. He answered, “I’m friendly with some bishops and vicars who kind of believe in something and enjoy the music and the stained glass.”\n\nOf course religion runs much deeper than cigarettes and this helps me understand the surprising reactions of others to my dismissal of faith. The range of those reactions, too many to list here, and their intensity never ceases to amaze me. I keep a collection of the more interesting ones. There is one that keeps coming up in different forms much more than any other, from the somewhat reasonable and generous to the more judgmental, and that’s the one I want to focus on – not so much to answer, but to try to understand it.\n\nSadness\n\nSo many artists from earlier days in the Christian scene who have since abandoned or radically altered their former belief system tend to be far more bitter and antagonistic towards Christians who have “stayed the course,” for lack of a better phrase, and I appreciate your gentleness and civility in being the opposing side to the discussion, though I confess you’ll have to forgive me for being saddened at where your journey has thus far led you. I still appreciate you, and your body of work that was such a source of inspiration to us as young adults.\n\n———\n\nBut for me, to think of anyone being without the Jesus of Scripture as a living Presence in their lives is not just sad, it is a tragedy. And for someone to have once known that Presence and not know it any longer… can you see how I would think that is not just a tragedy, but a horrific tragedy? As someone who appreciates reason, Ojo, I think you’ll see the reasonableness of this: If the Jesus Story as recorded by Scripture is true, and you reject it, your story is a tragedy. If the Jesus Story is false, and I embrace it, that too is a tragedy… esp. because truth in my life was the mainspring behind my intense search for (or subverting of) belief in God.\n\n———\n\nI would no sooner read leftist propaganda from the Huffington Post than you would Truth from God’s Word. Still can’t believe I’m talking to “Ojo” from Undercover. (name withheld) had warned me, but It’s just very sad to me. I’m pretty sure you won’t want me to, but I’m going to make it a point to pray that God will soften your heart and draw you back to Himself. You obviously have a dysfunctional relationship with your Father (whose gifts and callings are without repentance).”\n\n———\n\nThey were once the favorite band of my 86 y/o mother. When I let her read some of Ojoes [sic] essays about atheism and agnostism [sic], she broke down and cried.\n\n———\n\nAnd so it goes. There are simply too many people who have this response to call it an anomaly. But notice that while they all express sadness, nobody explains why they are sad, what they are actually sad for. I have asked and asked without result. I can only come up with a few possibilities.\n\nI’m OK\n\nFirst is the belief that I have been harmed somehow. But I have not lost a limb or been diagnosed with cancer, I have not lost a loved one (recently) or anything like that. Most people don’t realize what they’re really suggesting is that I am, contrary to my own assessment of my own life, somehow worse off as a result of my journey! What is there to be saddened about? I’ve said many times that my life is better in every way since I have left orthodoxy – every single way, including a deeper sense of meaning in this life. Some religious people just cannot bring themselves to imagine that possibility, because of what that would mean. But for me it’s absolutely true. In what sense has my life been harmed, or is now being squandered, or wasted?\n\nMy Eternal Soul\n\nSecond is the possibility that the sadness is not about my life here, but about other-worldly stuff like forgiveness of sins, life or torment in the hereafter, spiritual warfare, relationships with heavenly hosts of one kind or another, basically all things which, once alleged, end the conversation. As Delos McKown says, “The invisible and the non-existent look very much alike,” and there is just nowhere to go with all that stuff. If the supernatural has no observable effect on the natural world, then why even talk about it? Even still though, what would there be to possibly be sad about?\n\nThe angle the second comment above seems to be making is an over-simplified variation of Pascal’s wager. If the Jesus story of the Bible is true and I do not accept it, it is a tragedy (for some reason, presumably eternal damnation), just as it would be for him if it was not true. Life is wasted in either case. But the same could be said of any of the world’s religions! If the Allah story of the Quran is true, is it not also a tragedy as well for those who do not believe it? Or if the Jesus story of the Westboro Baptists is true, is that also a tragedy for those who do not embrace it? Most American Christians have no problem dismissing these out of hand, but are genuinely dismayed when their own Jesus story and all that goes with it are similarly dismissed. I understand that everyone thinks only their own religion is unequivocally true and the others heretical or worse, but none are any more convincing than another on the merits.\n\nAgain I have to ask though, where is the cause for sadness? Is it because I will be going to hell? If so, the conversation ends there. Hell exists only in the realm of faith. Even conceding the point, why so sad that I am going to hell but not equally or even more sad that certainly members of one’s own family, certain friends, or billions of the world’s children of God are going there too? Why not then live in perpetual and infinite sadness?\n\nSad For God’s Sake\n\nPerhaps this sadness is on behalf of Jesus. Some have suggested that to move away from Orthodoxy is to break the heart of God. There is no need for sadness! To any living, loving deities that may exist, Jesus, any, I am a resounding and unequivocal “Yes!” I call out to love, cry out with open arms for any way I can know and relate as intimately as I can! I hold no ill will or malice against any possible benevolent deity and mean no harm to love. Even physicist and renowned atheist Victor Stenger writes that the honest unbeliever must acknowledge the possibility of God’s existence if real evidence ever shows up. Heaven has kept its secrets well, so while I am open, I am left in the absence of any evidence to stumble along on my own, doing the best I can imperfectly with what I have at my disposal. I simply will not and cannot just take on faith what I know is not true or what I even suspect is not true, what we have learned is not true. If there is “sin” it is that, the denial of my conscience, my heart, and my intellect.\n\nI Have Abandoned The Community\n\nInstead, maybe the most likely and also the most dangerous explanation for sadness might be the idea that I am no longer “part of the team.” All that stuff I mentioned earlier, a founder of Undercover, Christian songwriter, performer, producer and evangelist who had led altar calls and worship from the stage, bible study leader and Christian record label figurehead and owner, has now all been tossed aside apparently; or not.\n\nMy band has been my closest community and in many ways it still is. It has been the platform and chronicle for so much of my personal journey as an artist and a man. Some of the music I’ve written, especially in the early years is immature, but lots of it still has deep meaning for me. The band, the music, the songs and concerts have been meaningful for our audience as well, a sort of rite of passage for us all and the basis of magnificent relationships with many people. How many great artists have I been able to produce, providing a channel for their music and their own voices! What grounds are there to be sad about any of this, and what is there to be sad about, exactly?\n\nIs my dismissal of faith sad because I am no longer actively working to fulfill my part of the Great Commission and build the kingdom of God? If so, is life really that utilitarian? Is that the source of meaning for a human life? Is it like a sporting event where once people cheered but now they mourn because this is somehow a hit to the team; one of the starters has been traded? In what way is my life now as a father, a musician and a professor any less useful in real and observable ways to the lives I come in contact with?\n\nLet’s look at it another way. What does it really mean to not be “part of the team” anyway? What team am I no longer part of that requires sadness? If it means I no longer share the same beliefs and the worldview that comes with them, then you’ve got me there. Is that really a reason to be sad? In what observable way does this have any negative impact at all?\n\nInstead, how about the idea that “the team” consists of all human beings and that our highest mission and calling is to learn and practice love and kindness to all? What if that was the over-arching taxonomy by which we classify people and the measure of their lives rather than by their profession of faith? Wouldn’t sadness vanish instantly? Does faith prevent this worldview?\n\nAre love and kindness exclusively realized or perhaps fully realized only by believers exclusively through their faith and creed? Are you able to entertain the idea that there are people who hold wildly different views than yours or no supernatural views at all and still enjoy the exact same status before your God as you, perhaps even a higher status? If not, please ponder what that means for a moment, especially regarding the way you esteem others and ultimately treat them.\n\nSo you see, I have asked myself many questions trying to understand the idea that somehow because I am no longer a Christian that there is a reasonable basis for sadness that is rooted in some kind of virtuous fortitude. This is not about me. Most of these people do not know me or the intimate circumstances of my life. It is about their own worldviews and outlooks on humanity and the way their own faiths respond, and that is what my questions here are meant to explore. The answers have more to say about the mourners and their beliefs than it does the disposition of my life and soul.\n\nIt is not easy taking a hard look at our own beliefs. Changing them is even harder. It’s like losing a best friend. There is no need to be sad. Rejoice! For behold I bring you good tidings of great joy! We can grow past the obstacles that religion so often throws in our paths. We can know some things about the world and not worry about what it does to our doctrine. We can transcend ideological positions and the requirement for correct beliefs and thought policing, becoming better human beings, more loving and less divisive. We can learn to see the connectedness of all peoples of any creed or station. We can know the fullness of the human experience and realize our full potential, unfettered and unencumbered with having to run things through a religious filter!\n\nOur identity depends on our beliefs. We struggle for context when we consider our own doubts and what it might mean if our doubts have teeth. Coming to terms with that would indeed be much harder than redefining a life without cigarettes. Smokers, former smokers and former believers know what I mean. I wrote this a while ago, certainly nothing to be sad about at all:\n\nI also want to show people, especially people who believe there is no alternative, that there is in fact a very robust, beautiful and whole alternative to faith. For me that alternative has made all the difference in my life. I am happier, things make much more sense, I feel I have a better moral foundation, I feel life is much more meaningful, I love more fully and deeply.\n\nHave I missed other possibilities? If you are one who has the same reaction of sadness to others leaving the faith, what is it exactly that you are sad about?\n\nUPDATE – 9/10/13: I did receive one thoughtful reply that fell outside the possibilities I outlined here, at least in part. I will reproduce and answer it and link to it here when I am finished.\n\n——-\n\nThis post initially appeared on my friend Andrew’s blog, Hackman’s Musings.\n\n——-",

  "latent_16295": "Good question, simple answer! The black watches in this picture are part of an experiment called SLEEP. While I don't readily recall the acronym's description, the experiment requires the astronaut wear a special watch, capable of \"seeing\" light/dark and sensing movement/no movement. Over time, astronauts upload the data from the watch to the ground investigators, using a laptop computer. These onboard/zero-gravity data are compared with data gathered on Earth pre- and post-flight. The scientists can then tell how well/long an astronaut slept during the nights throughout their time in orbit. (I averaged about 7 hrs, 20 minutes over 152 days). This data will lead to possible ways to increase/enhance an astronaut's ability to get meaningful/restful sleep while in space. For many astronauts, sleep does not come easy during a mission, due to many factors like stress, excitement, adaptability, etc. Applications to those of us on the ground are many, including ways to alter circadian rhythms that could help Emergency Room doctors, long haul truck drivers and even Mission Control Center flight controllers, all of whom must sometimes work long shifts.\n\nOther watches are worn by astronauts to simply tell the time; and many wear multiple versions such that they can have onboard time (GMT/Greenwich), their family's local time (e.g., Houston) and perhaps a third time of interest (e.g., Russia).\n\nOops, just checked my watch... time to stop typing!\n\nBut YOU all need to keep lookin' up!",

  "latent_16476": "Bitcoin sounds like something from science fiction: A purely digital currency, created by an anonymous hacker, that operates outside the world's traditional banking systems. The four-year-old currency is very real, though, and it's trading an all-time high, tripling in value in the last two months alone.\n\nOne bitcoin is was worth about $40 U.S. dollars on Tuesday, and surged on Wednesday to nearly $49. That's up from around $13 in January, and 5 cents in 2010, according to Mt. Gox, the bitcoin market's main exchange. On that and other trading sites, buyers can swap their digital coins for cold, hard cash.\n\nWatchers of the alternative currency attribute some of bitcoin's rise to the recent decision by several popular-in-geek-circles vendors to accept the coins -- most notably, blog hosting site Wordpress and the online community Reddit.\n\n\"These guys are killing it on retail,\" Peter Vessenes, chairman of the trade group Bitcoin Foundation, said of bitcoin's growing acceptance with merchants.\n\nThe coins are also much easier to obtain than they used to be. Until recently, a buyer typically needed to navigate an international wire transfer and wait days for the transaction to clear. Sites like like Coinbase and Bitinstant let customers buy bitcoins with U.S. cash or bank transfers. Vessenes' own bitcoin exchange, CoinLab, is set to launch later this month.\n\nSome longtime advocates are leery of the recent run-up.\n\n\"Most people don't think $40 is a valid price right now,\" said Jon Holmquist, head of marketing at two Bitcoin-related startups, Coinabul and Bitcoinstore.\n\nStefan Thomas, founder of community site We Use Coins, thinks the rise is a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n\"When the price starts going up, you get a lot of speculators that want to ride the wave,\" he said.\n\nBecause the number of transactions and overall value of coins in circulation is relatively low, the currency is quite volatile -- it went from under $1 to over $28, then back to $7 in 2011 alone.\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous developer using the pseudonym \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" -- the Japanese equivalent of a bland name like \"John Smith.\" It has no central-bank backing. The idea was to create a currency that's free from government intervention and can be used to conduct transactions without hefty exchange or processing fees.\n\nOne deal chronicled on the bitcoin data site BlockChain involved a transfer worth nearly $80,000. The processing fee was 1.8 cents. Beat that, Western Union.\n\nCoins are \"minted\" by a network of computers running specialized software on powerful (and often pricey) hardware systems. The software is designed to release new coins at a steady -- and finite -- pace. Right now, one new \"block\" of 25 bitcoins is generated roughly every 10 minutes, adding to the pool of around 10.8 million circulating coins.\n\nThe underlying system that generates coins is extremely difficult to attack, but the \"digital wallets\" bitcoin owners use to store their wealth haven't been so lucky. A series of high-profile thefts in 2011 crashed the currency's value, and one exchange operator lost 24,000 bitcoins to a thief in September. Critics also contend that the anonymous nature of the currency could make it the monetary instrument of choice for money launderers. It's already the standard currency for Silk Road, a notorious online drug bazaar.\n\nStill, bitcoin backers think its recent rise is a sign of its growing community and more widespread acceptance. They see it as a valid alternative to traditional cash.\n\n\"The U.S. dollar is an obvious Ponzi scheme,\" said Thomas, who thinks the U.S. government has too much debt to raise interest rates high enough to defend the dollar if there were ever a run on it.

Now, along with dark, milk and white chocolate, please welcome ... ruby chocolate!\n\nIn the pink! Courtesy Barry Callebaut\n\nThe rosy pink-colored chocolate comes from the Ruby cocoa bean, and was launched at a special event in Shanghai on Tuesday. Not only does the chocolate look wildly different, but it also has a unique, fruitier taste.\n\n\"The fourth type [of] chocolate offers a totally new taste experience, which is not bitter, milky or sweet, but a tension between berry fruitiness and luscious smoothness,\" the company said in a news release. \"To create Ruby chocolate, no berries or berry flavor, nor color, is added.\"\n\nSo much pink goodness! Courtesy Barry Callebaut\n\nAs a company spokesperson told TODAY via email, the Ruby bean grows in countries like Ecuador, Brazil and the Ivory Coast, \"but you need the right\" bean for it. Barry Callebaut \"is able to identify the specific Ruby beans. Secondly, we developed a unique processing that makes those special precursors come alive, creating Ruby chocolate.\"\n\nThere are no additives to the chocolate, added the spokesperson.\n\nBelieve it or not, white chocolate was actually the last kind of chocolate to be launched, by Nestle, in the 1930s. That said, white chocolate is actually a chocolate derivative since it contains no cocoa solids, and has specific standards that have to be adhered to in order to be called white. Ruby chocolate is, says the spokesperson, a \"real chocolate\" and not a derivative.\n\nRuby chocolate brightens the room up alongside its fellow chocolate brethren. Courtesy Barry Callebaut\n\nOther companies have created red cocoa powder in recent years, but as Barry Callebaut notes, this is the first time \"natural reddish chocolate\" has been produced.\n\n\"You could try and copy the color and try to copy the flavor, but making a real chocolate, which is just made out of normal chocolate ingredients, with that taste and with that color would be extraordinarily difficult,\" said Barry Callebaut CEO Antoine de Saint-Affrique.\n\nOf course, all we want to know now is when do we get a taste? According to a company spokesperson, it can take up to 18 months to launch products for mass consumption, but, \"Where it appears first will depend on our customers, and who launches first.\"\n\nWe can't wait!\n\nFollow Randee Dawn on Twitter.",

In thinking about this, I brought in my staff and had them research, in-depth, about some really superb blogs. We compiled an overall list of 100 blogs, and narrowed this down to about 20 blogs that were repeatedly mentioned and had high popularity. It didn’t stop here though.. We wanted to now about which blogs were the first to post so that we could twitter about it, without having 100s of other users twitter about it before us. Basically, we wanted to know which blogs would enable us to twitter, the most relevant and up-to-date articles, possible.

A blog is a kind of online diary for a company or a person, where you regularly post about your life, your passions, business, news or other interests. It is a way of having your own space in the virtual world. If your blog becomes popular and you attract a lot of visitors you can earn good money from advertising for other companies or services on your blog. Some blogs are so popular that people pay a subscription fee to get the posts. 99% percent of all blogs let anyone sign up for it and it is absolutely free. As you have probably guessed, you are reading a blog now!\n\nBlog definition, who blogs and why blog?\n\n“A blog is a personal diary of thoughts that are channeled into an organized format and made readable on the internet” When a company has a blog, there is always someone from the company writing the blog posts. The company itself does not blog, a person in the company blogs. Irrespective of whether you read through an amateur blog, a hi-fi movie celebrity blog or even a business news blog, it is clear that to express oneself and to be heard is a cornerstone of human nature. This is the core feature that flavors the different blogs with content and also makes them so interesting to read.\n\nHow do I start a blog – How to have a blog?\n\nBeing inspired by other bloggers could be the right way to start one of your own. You must first decide whether you want to make a general blog for yourself or create it in a specific perspective, targeting topics like politics, sports, travel, business marketing purposes, etc\n\n1. A personal blog is one where you combine your emotions, sentiments with certain facts of life. Facebook would be a good place to host a blog like that.\n\n2. A general blog deals with a topic in particular like, travel, religion or spirituality, etc.\n\n3. A moblog is a blog that can be accessed or updated even from a mobile device. One instance of a moblog is http://chris.pirillo.com/free-credit-report\n\n4. Business blogs are created with a clear intention to make money from them\n\n5. Podcasts are a cluster of digital media in the audio and video form that are frequently updated with latest episodes.\n\n6. Radioblogs are audio streams that can be listened to online and basically function in the same manner as a normal blog. Radioblogs are often not broadcasted such as normal radio and can sometimes only be heard on the internet.\n\nA very successful blog can generate as much as 50000USD per year income from advertising. The trend of blogging is catching up like wild fire but having it as a real job is almost impossible and is restricted to the very few top bloggers.\n\nHere are some links to places that hosts your blog for free:\n\nThe word press home page looks like the screen shot that appears here. You can sign up for free and run your fingers over the keyboard to make an excellent piece of blog that will be displayed on a global front.\n\nThe screenshot above shows clearly an example of a facebook blog which also adopts a free sign up procedure. These blogs are categorized in the chronological order making it convenient to pick and read.\n\nBlogger is a free blog publishing tool from Google for easily sharing your thoughts with the world. Blogger makes it simple to post text, photos and video onto your personal or team blog.\n\nHow to design a blog and a list of well designed blogs?\n\nThis can be done extensively with thousands of options available from websites online that guide you on designing your blog. It is all about how presentable you want your blog, to look and what you need to highlight in order to catch the readers. The choice made from various templates available, forms the base or framework of the blog. These customizable options, add to the uniqueness of your blog depending on the kind of header, footer, content area and of course the hues that you have chosen for the same. http://www.blogdesignblog.com/blog-design/how-to-blog-design-style-guide/ could be an excellent guide in giving your creativity a definite form and design.\n\nList of well designed blogs to look at:\n\nhttp://superfluousbanter.org\n\nhttp://odds-and-ends.net/photolog\n\nhttp://www.joshuaink.com\n\nhttp://thebignoob.com\n\nhttp://avalonstar.com/blog/\n\nSites that sell templates for blogs :\n\nhttp://www.spicynodes.org\n\nhttp://www.templatemonster.com/\n\nhttp://my-web-template.blogspot.com\n\nhttp://blogger-templates.blogspot.com\n\nhttp://www.blogskins.com\n\nhttp://www.eblogtemplates.com\n\nHow to get pictures for your blog ?\n\nOne of the biggest problems of having a blog is how and where to get pictures. A blog with text only is very boring to read. While you may not know this you are actually lucky, because you are reading this post on a site that will start offering a collection of about 40000 images absolutely free for blog usage. Until we have the launch, you are free to use the images in the portfolio section in your blog posts. Make sure to sign up on our blog in the upper right corner so you will be notified when we launch our collection. Just taking images from the internet and using it on your blog can cause massive legal problems even if you are just a student or private person and can be traced by image copyright software that searches the net for images.\n\nOption for commenting and debate:\n\nWhen your blog starts getting comments it means you are doing well. Giving your reader the option to comment gives them a feeling of belonging and you are on your way to creating a small community.\n\nChronological order of contents:\n\nThe latest post on a blog is always on the top and the older posts are either displayed below in categories, archives or other such links. This makes the process of accessing older blogs very organized.\n\nGetting noticed with your blog.\n\nA great way of bringing all keen readers’ attention is to add the link of your blog on facebook or other online forums. Writing in simple terms, easy to understand and good titles is what gets you into the good books of search engines.\n\nRSS AND BLOGGING – ADVANCED READING\n\nRSS is one feature that has made blogging more meticulous, organized and allowed for easier access of information from connected blogs. The full form of RSS being ‘rich site summary’ or ‘really simple syndication’, it allows for contracting information from various sites of your choice and bringing it in a readable format on one RSS reading platform. The RSS feeds are supported by XML which is a preferred way to store data on a file online.\n\nThe XML primarily is a tool that helps to describe information vividly through the use of tags. This gives scope for bulk data formatting online coming from groups of people who want it the similar way.\n\nThe perfect combination of RSS with blogging enables better reading and saves the reader the trouble of accessing various different websites or other blogs to get updated information on the same. The RSS feeds give readers the opportunity to subscribe for information on those specific websites and all of this can be read together at one place on your own blog itself. These tools have made the process of blogging and accessing updated information faster and effortless. This has been useful in the education line, where teachers and educators use the RSS feeds to communicate to pupils at large at a time.\n\nOn the whole, if you don’t blog, you could become obsolete. Some of the very famous blogs can be surveyed online and this could be a great way to take off on your personal or business blogging project. You needn’t be surprised if there comes a time when the world will look into this virtual window practically for all kinds of major connections, information and perfect communication so that all other processes in the world we live in are more orderly, falling perfectly in place.",
  "latent_17118": "IIT Bombay, like most likely most Indian educational instituates, has some rules and regulations about the interaction between boys and girls that, at least to the uninitiated eye of a foreigner who was brought up in a liberal society, seem arbitrary and archaic. At IIT Bombay, for example, there may be no visits in hostels by students of the other gender (yes, there are separate boys’ and girls’ hostels) between 10pm and 7am, and during the day any such visit has to be registered at the reception security guard. And when there was need for more room for girls and they reassigned one wing of a boys’ hostel to the adjacent girls’ hostel, they closed the connection by bricking it and split the lawn by a fence. With barbed wire on top.\n\nI took this as a theme for a satirical inspection of these policies which comes to the conclusion that IIT Bombay is a very progressive institute that puts these rules in place as affirmative action towards same-gender relationships. After some discussion with the editors the text got actually published in the institutes’ bi-monthly newspaper “Raintree”, unfortunately only now, two weeks after I left India. You can read the text on the bottom of page 8 in the 6MB PDF file.\n\nI cannot predict how it will be received, but at least Utkarsh Raut, who illustrated the text, clearly got the message right.

  "latent_17167": "* Says to raise up to $200 mln in IPO\n\n* Says to apply to list on the Nasdaq under symbol “FNDR”\n\n* Says to use part of proceeds to pare down debt\n\nMarch 8 (Reuters) - Fender Musical Instruments Corp, whose guitars have been used by music legends Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler and Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour, filed with U.S. regulators on Thursday to raise up to $200 million in an initial public offering.\n\nFormed in the 1940s by Leo Fender, Fender was the first to mass-produce solid-body Spanish-style electric guitars, including the iconic Stratocaster.\n\nIt was sold to television network CBS in 1965. When CBS started selling off its non-media businesses, then Fender Chief Executive William Schultz teamed up with some of the company’s international distributors and bought out Fender in 1984.\n\nSchultz and his family trust still own about 6 percent of Scottsdale, Arizona-based Fender, according to the company’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nPrivate equity firm Weston Presidio owns a 43 percent stake.\n\n“Fender is using a window of opportunity here to get into portfolios of funds that look for strong brands,” Josef Schuster, founder of Chicago-based IPO investment firm IPOX Schuster, told Reuters.\n\n“It is a leader in its field. I think there will be demand for its stock.”\n\nJ.P. Morgan, Baird, Stifel Nicolaus Weisel and Wells Fargo Securities would be underwriting the offering, Fender said in the filing. The company plans to use about $100 million of the proceeds to pay off debt.\n\nSince part of the debt repayment will be made to some of the banks underwriting the offering, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) regulations require the offering to have a qualified independent underwriter, the filing said.\n\nWilliam Blair & Company would act as the independent underwriter in the offering.\n\nThe number of shares to be offered — a portion of which will be sold by some stockholders — and the price range for the offering have not yet been determined, Fender said.\n\nThe company, which had net sales of $700.6 million in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, said it plans to apply to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol “FNDR.”\n\nThe amount of money a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filings is used to calculate registration fees. The final size of the IPO could be different.",
  "latent_17219": "While standing in the queue for the Post Office counter at the village shop, the corner of my eye lights on what seems like an open faucet showering gaudy colours. Turning, I see it is a display stand of cards for Father’s Day, gushing the usual sticky, showy sentiments. “Best Father Ever”; “Best Dad in the Universe”. Can it be that time of year again already?\n\nWhen the day comes , I shall be unashamedly wallowing in those accolades (fully deserved, of course) from my own loving children; but as always - just as I am in the Post Office – I shall be thinking of men who won’t be so sweetly indulged. Countless fathers who won’t be brought their breakfast in bed; won’t be receiving touching presents; won’t be served a lovely lunch; won’t play the traditional game of croquet in the afternoon in which tradition requires both that he is allowed to cheat and is also ganged up on and forced to lose.\n\nHaving been – decades ago – forcibly estranged with legal authority from my first-born child for several years, I shall always feel the hole in the heart that Father’s Day mercilessly rips. Every Father’s Day, I Tweet a message for men in that position, saying “Courage Brother: a better day will come. Never, never give up.”\n\nBeing a step-father, I shall also be thinking of those men giving love and support to children who are not their own but who can expect nothing on Father’s Day because, as on every other day, they are entitled to no recognition, no place and no standing. No matter how loving and secure their relationship might be, come Father’s Day, step-fathers and step-children are completely clueless as to what they should say to each other or where to put themselves. The same goes, I am sure, for step-mothers – as it presumably does in everything I have to say on this subject.\n\nIf anybody deserves a schmaltzy pat on the back, it’s the Steppos among us\n\nWithout wishing to encourage the greetings card industry to confect yet another anniversary on which to squeeze our hearts and gouge our purses, it would seem they are missing a trick with the lack of a Step-Parents’ Day. If anybody deserves a schmaltzy pat on the back, it’s the Steppos among us.\n\nHow many step-parents have a clue about what they're getting into? (Photo: Alamy)\n\nGod knows they are numerous enough. The ONS reports that “In 2011 there were 544,000 stepfamilies with dependent children in England and Wales.” Any internet search will tell you that one in three adults is now living with children who are not naturally their own. That has certainly been the observable truth at our children’s schools, where approximately half the children who began their school years living with both their natural parents have, at some point, found themselves living with a step-parent.\n\nHow many of those adults – who are guilty of nothing more blameworthy than wanting to live with the person with whom they have fallen in love – have had a clue what they are getting into? Maybe not one in 100.\n\n• Don't kid yourself: men are irrelevant during pregnancy\n\nIt can be a living nightmare. It can come as a shattering surprise to realise that you, of all people, have become the one in a family with responsibility but no power. That’s what you realise the first time you hear those chilling words “I don’t have to take any notice of you: you’re not my father”. It can be similarly troubling to realise that you have become one of those cartoon villains playing the role of leading suspect for cruelty, neglect and sexual abuse in the public subconscious.\n\nIf your own children could try the patience of a saint, somebody else’s might drive you completely crackers\n\nWith no legal rights at all (and none that could be conceived or enforced), step-parents are the ones who are at risk of being expelled from all connection with children they have supported - even after many years of cultivating the demanding relationship - if the set-up with the natural parent goes wrong. Like crawling across a minefield in the dark, they have to feel their way around the jealousies of the estranged parent and the wounded feelings of grandparents, while negotiating a position as both friend and authority figure for children with whom they have no natural kinship and command no automatic respect. If your own children could try the patience of a saint, somebody else’s might drive you completely crackers when you have to live with them every day. Ask any teacher - though they, at least, can retreat with a pay-packet to their own home at the end of the working day.\n\nStep-parents are likely to be faced, every day, with Himalayan predicaments. They may have to integrate their own children – who probably feel betrayed and abandoned - with step-children who welcome their new step-siblings with even less enthusiasm than they feel towards the step-parent. Where should your priorities lie – with the protection and reassurance of your own flesh and blood or with the advancement of the romantic and sexual relationship for which you may have sacrificed the stability of your own family? How do you deal with the tortured minds of children who would rather see you dead than imagine you enjoying sex with their own parent?\n\n• Maternal gatekeeping prevents fathers bonding with their babies\n\nMost people blunder blindly into this Hindu Kush of conflicts without forethought or preparation. Everybody can see the logical case for a pre-nuptial agreement over money, even if they would never demand it themselves; but how many couples work out a detailed understanding over their existing children when they enter into a new relationship involving them all? Most expect simply to muddle through, borne along on a tide of love and goodwill, only to find that they are driven onto the rocks by unremitting, irresistible tempests. The strains of coping with step-children constitute one of the main reasons the divorce rate following re-marriage is even higher than for first marriages.\n\nThe men and women who can manage these trials through a lifelong commitment, contriving to be on good terms for keeps with children who are not their own and also with the natural parent/s, deserves at least a trashy card expressing cheap sentiment on Step-Parents’ Day. They deserve an annual parade with marching bands.\n\nLuckily, such hokum is not for me. Through many tribulations and given a large measure of obdurate tenacity, my step-son and I have kept up a loving relationship for nearly 25 years even though we have not lived together for 18 of them. In the absence of a mass-produced communication which more accurately expresses our position, he has taken in recent years to sending me a card on Father’s Day.\n\nNothing I might receive on that day is more welcome.",

  "latent_17300": "Defense & National Security\n\nTwo years ago, I wrote about a scandalous presidential reality. I’d say I’m shocked to report that the scandal continues, but I’m not. And that’s even more scandalous.\n\nIn October 2012, I commented on the revelation that President Obama had been absent from the vast majority of his daily intelligence briefings. According to a then-study by the Government Accountability Institute, Obama failed to attend a single Presidential Daily Brief (PDB) in the week leading up to the recent anniversary of 9/11 and despite the chaos that erupted in the Arab world, most notably in Libya. The mere fact that we were approaching a 9/11 anniversary was an essential enough reason to attend all the briefings. And yet, President Obama attended none. That’s right, not one.\n\nWorse, this was nothing new. Obama attended only 43.8 percent of his Daily Briefs in the first 1,225 days of his administration. For the year 2012, he attended a little over a third.\n\nThere was no excuse for this. It’s unacceptable for a president, especially one criticized for spending so much time vacationing and campaigning.\n\nBy comparison, President George W. Bush not only didn’t miss the PDB but actually expanded it to six meetings per week. Or consider President Ronald Reagan, who, ironically, liberals portrayed as a detached, lazy, unengaged, uninformed idiot. In my 2012 piece, I quoted two advisers who briefed Reagan. One of them was Bill Clark, Reagan’s right-hand man at the National Security Council. As Clark’s biographer, he told me often how Reagan craved that regular morning update. Reagan ate up these briefings. He devoured the written report and then asked probing questions of his advisers during the live briefing that followed. Reagan used the briefings precisely as presidents should.\n\nThat brings me back to Barack Obama.\n\nWhen this was reported in October 2012, it was embarrassing to President Obama and potentially damaging politically, with the presidential election only a month away and Mitt Romney moving ahead in the polls. One would think that, by now, this would have been corrected by Obama, not only for political reasons but (more important) national-security concerns. This president has an ongoing PR problem with ill-advised statements about not having strategies and dashing for the golf course and fundraisers immediately after beheadings and aircraft downings.\n\nBut alas, we now learn that this problem continues to fester: The Government Accountability Institute is back with a new report revealing that President Obama has missed over half of his briefings in his second term, obviously learning little (literally) since the first term.\n\nThe man has skipped hundreds of daily briefings.\n\nMy colleague Wynton Hall notes that these findings come on the heels of Obama’s 60 Minutes commentson Sunday, where he seemed to blame the surge of ISIS and events in Syria on his intelligence chief James Clapper.\n\n“I think our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper, has acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria,” Obama averred, coolly passing the buck. (For the record, this was something that a Ronald Reagan would never have done to his CIA director, Bill Casey, and nor would George W. Bush.)\n\nThe defense and intelligence community was not pleased with Obama’s statement. Wynton Hall quoted the liberal Daily Beast, which reported that Pentagon officials were “flabbergasted” by Obama’s passing the blame. “Either the president doesn’t read the intelligence he’s getting or he’s bulls—ing,” said one angry official.\n\nHall added: “others in the intelligence community similarly blasted Obama and said he’s shown longstanding disinterest in receiving live, in-person PDBs that allow the Commander-in-Chief the chance for critical follow-up, feedback, questions, and the challenging of flawed intelligence assumptions.”\n\nNo question about that. The facts speak for themselves. And the president’s resultant lack of facts has evidently and obviously hurt our foreign policy.\n\nBut here’s a troubling question: Do President Obama’s supporters even care? They’ll make ludicrous excuses they would never make for a Republican president. “No big deal,” they’ll shrug, “He’s fine.”\n\nIndeed, in 2011, two of Obama’s top spokesmen, Jay Carney and Tommy Vietor, did just that, insisting that “the president gets the information he needs.” Sorry, but there’s no substitute for the give-and-take that comes with daily briefings by advisers and experts. Obama doesn’t have ESP-like, Solomon-esque powers; he cannot place briefing papers aside his extraordinary brain and divine all contents and any questions that might have been hashed out during briefings.\n\nAnd meanwhile, the world burns.\n\nYes, the world is on fire. And as it is, we’re stuck with this dismal White House leadership for another two years. I’m not asking for a perfect president, but I’d at least like a president who attends his security briefings.\n\nDr. Paul Kengor is professor of political science and executive director of The Center for Vision & Values at Grove City College.

  "latent_17335": "Review article\n\nAbstract\n\nWhile the cause of dopaminergic neuronal cell death in Parkinson's disease (PD) is not yet understood, many endogenous molecules have been implicated in its pathogenesis. β-phenethylamine (β-PEA), a component of various food items including chocolate and wine, is an endogenous molecule produced from phenylalanine in the brain. It has been reported recently that long-term administration of β-PEA in rodents causes neurochemical and behavioral alterations similar to that produced by parkinsonian neurotoxins. The toxicity of β-PEA has been linked to the production of hydroxyl radical ((·)OH) and the generation of oxidative stress in dopaminergic areas of the brain, and this may be mediated by inhibition of mitochondrial complex-I. Another significant observation is that administration of β-PEA to rodents reduces striatal dopamine content and induces movement disorders similar to those of parkinsonian rodents. However, no reports are available on the extent of dopaminergic neuronal cell death after administration of β-PEA. Based on the literature, we set out to establish β-PEA as an endogenous molecule that potentially contributes to the progressive development of PD. The sequence of molecular events that could be responsible for dopaminergic neuronal cell death in PD by consumption of β-PEA-containing foods is proposed here. Thus, long-term over-consumption of food items containing β-PEA could be a neurological risk factor having significant pathological consequences.",

  "latent_17380": "The team is led by the University of Virginia and includes Sandia and researchers from the University of Illinois, the University of Colorado, the Colorado School of Mines and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Corporate advisory partners include Dominion Resources, General Electric, Siemens AG and Vestas Wind Systems.\n\n“Exascale turbines take advantage of economies of scale,” said Todd Griffith, lead blade designer on the project and technical lead for Sandia’s Offshore Wind Energy Program.\n\nSandia’s previous work on 13-MW systems uses 100-meter blades (328 feet) on which the initial SUMR designs are based. While a 50-MW horizontal wind turbine is well beyond the size of any current design, studies show that load alignment can reduce peak stresses and fatigue on the rotor blades. This reduces costs and allows construction of blades big enough for a 50-MW system.\n\nMost current U.S. wind turbines produce power in the 1- to 2-MW range, with blades about 165 feet (50 meters) long, while the largest commercially available turbine is rated at 8 MW with blades 262 feet (80 meters) long.\n\n“The U.S. has great offshore wind energy potential, but offshore installations are expensive, so larger turbines are needed to capture that energy at an affordable cost,” Griffith said.\n\nBarriers remain before designers can scale up to a 50-MW turbine — more than six times the power output of the largest current turbines.\n\n“Conventional upwind blades are expensive to manufacture, deploy and maintain beyond 10-15 MW. They must be stiff, to avoid fatigue and eliminate the risk of tower strikes in strong gusts. Those stiff blades are heavy, and their mass, which is directly related to cost, becomes even more problematic at the extreme scale due to gravity loads and other changes,” Griffith said.\n\nHe said the new blades could be more easily and cost-effectively manufactured in segments, avoiding the unprecedented-scale equipment needed for transport and assembly of blades built as single units.\n\nThe exascale turbines would be sited downwind, unlike conventional turbines that are configured with the rotor blades upwind of the tower.\n\nSUMR’s load-alignment is bio-inspired by the way palm trees move in storms. The lightweight, segmented trunk approximates a series of cylindrical shells that bend in the wind while retaining segment stiffness. This alignment reduces the mass required for blade stiffening by reducing the forces on the blades using the palm-tree inspired load-alignment approach.\n\nSegmented turbine blades have a significant advantage in parts of the world at risk for severe storms, such as hurricanes, where offshore turbines must withstand tremendous wind speeds over 200 mph. The blades align themselves to reduce cantilever forces on the blade through a trunnion hinge near the hub that responds to changes in wind speed.\n\n“At dangerous wind speeds, the blades are stowed and aligned with the wind direction, reducing the risk of damage. At lower wind speeds, the blades spread out more to maximize energy production.” Griffith said.\n\nMoving toward exascale turbines could be an important way to meet DOE’s goal of providing 20 percent of the nation’s energy from wind by 2030, as detailed in its recent Wind Vision Report.\n\nMore information: www.sandia.gov",
  "latent_17397": "The article began:\n\nLast November, Citizens for Tax Justice and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy issued a major study of the federal income taxes paid, or not paid, by 280 big, profitable Fortune 500 corporations. That report found, among other things, that 30 of the companies paid no federal income tax from 2008 through 2010. New information for 2011 shows that almost all these 30 companies have maintained their tax dodging ways. In fact, all but four of the 30 companies remained in the no-federal-income-tax category over the 2008-11 period. -- Citizens for Tax Justice and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, November 2011\n\nIt has to make you wonder. Aren't taxes the dues we all pay as privileged members of a forward-looking society? Add up the taxes they avoided or did not have to pay in the last four years and probably they would have financed the wars the Republicans arranged for us to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nNow, you can look at it this way. If the average American pays twice as much in taxes as he would have received in wages at something like the turn of the century, you'd expect he or she would be happy enough. Our guess is in this comparison, most people are happy if they've got a job and are earning money right now.\n\nConsider the enormous difference between what a particular sum of money bought at the turn of the century (1900) and what it buys now; that is to say, the goods and services available now as compared to what could be purchased in 1910 or 20.\n\nWouldn't you expect that major corporations would also be happy with what their profits buy today -- particularly if they are \"people\" as the Supreme Court declared in the Citizens United Decision, since they are getting extraordinarily wealthier by the year?\n\nOf course, part of the problem with taxes in this country is that people have to try to live within their income, so they can afford to pay taxes to a government that can't live within its income. They also pay sales tax when they buy necessities, and taxes are withheld from their paychecks. They pay for their future Social Security and Medicare, and these payments make it possible for the government to offer Medicaid to poor people and people with disabilities.\n\nSo why don't all major corporations pay at the same tax rate, whether they are really \"people\" or not? One answer is obvious. There's plenty of net bankable money (God forbid, investable money) to go around in modern America, and the wealthiest among us have untold power. In fact, it's more than just corporations that don't pay their fair share. The people in these corporations don't pay their fair share of their personal taxes either.\n\nAs Leona Helmsley once said, \"We don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.\"\n\n\"Capitalism,\" said John Maynard Keynes, \"is the astounding belief that the most wickedest of men will do the most wickedest of things for the greatest good of everyone.\"\n\nBut what the heck, insofar as taxes go, government has no money unless it gets it from all of us. And there is an enormous difference between the potential profits made by big business during the turn of two centuries ago and today, and the obvious opportunities they have of serving a valuable purpose in this country and the world-at-large at the same time: by paying their fair share, hiring American workers and teaching developing countries how they might prosper by developing their own businesses.\n\nIn actuality, how much would it take for corporations to do that? There's certainly enough money around. They've got the power to do just that, and that is investing in us. Somehow, the list of those who haven't is extremely long. We ask you to ponder why.\n\nSo as not to digress too far, let's remember that taxes are important. But for whom?\n\nAs Andy Rooney remarked, \"President Bush's tax proposals leave no rich person behind. Voters approve of President Bush helping the kind of people they wish they were one of.\"\n\nTrue or not, all the above appears to be the kind of capitalism we are known for around the world, or at least in the Middle East, and that exacerbates our problems there. Maybe it's because the wealthiest among us are afraid to recognize the difference between money and human wealth or real morality.\n\nMaybe it's the same for a great many politicians who see government as a business -- something it was never intended to be. We know that for more than forty years, the United States Congress has used payroll taxes intended for Social Security to fund spending. We don't know what else they've done in detail because they're too evil to tell us.\n\nIn the long run, we need to compel these folks...\n\nCan money buy happiness and how much is enough? Sadly, we may need to remind them that it won't buy them any kind of freedom from death, and even the longest life is short.\n\nIt may be that taxes are a Democrat vs. Republican issue. If so, in considering taxes, Republicans need to take a very long look at these up-to-date statements:\n\nHuge deficits loom almost everywhere, from California to New York, from New Jersey to Texas. [...] For Texas is where the modern conservative theory of budgeting -- the belief that you should never raise taxes under any circumstances, that you can always balance the budget by cutting wasteful spending -- has been implemented most completely. If the theory can't make it there, it can't make it anywhere. -- Paul Krugman\n\nOur conclusion? If Republicans are really concerned about a balanced budget, and Congress really wants to motivate American citizens, the way to do so is not by more and more taking away the services they've paid for, or the kinds of resources that contribute to their ability to become greater taxpayers in this country.\n\nThe most obvious example? When do we start building some railways and fixing roads and bridges, and hiring American companies to do that?\n\nWhen do all the millionaire Republicans join the rest of us in realizing that the tax burden in this country must be shared equitably? Shared by everyone. And when do they finally realize that if our taxes were to increase because our wages went up, most of us would be happy as newborns, and our country's coffers would be easily helped out of this recession by all of us!",

A little further from the video store was a shop called Pegasus, that was the local comic book store where the proud geeks of the four color grind would hang out and try to impress each other with random knowledge and useless trivia of their favorite characters. I collected comics, but I also found other oddities and bits of random cool. It was there that I found back issues of Cinefantastique and I haven’t stopped collecting them since. They had a remarkable stable of writers and full color pictures on a really slick stock, the magazine looked as good as it read.\n\nCreated by the late Frederick S. Clarke in 1967, originally as a fanzine and then relaunched to the masses in 1970, It carried the tagline ‘the magazine with a sense of wonder’ and it started that philosophy by drawing you into the publication with remarkable covers. They could be haunting, magical, exciting, but they were always compelling. You never judge a book by its cover, but judging a magazine by the cover image is usually a good bet as to the kind of goods you will find inside. Clarke had historians and authors like Tim Lucas, Don Shay, Bill Warren, Mick Garris, Stephen Rebello, Steven Rubin, Dan Scapperotti and more. This helped form the foundation of intelligent film writing that I would later draw upon and try my best (though often fail) to live up to. It was as vital as Famous Monsters of Filmland, Fangoria, and later Video Watchdog (founded by Tim Lucas and still running strong today).

  "latent_17485": "Allison Jones and Keith Leslie, The Canadian Press\n\nTORONTO -- Ontario's doctors will see a cut to fee-for-service payments starting Feb. 1 after they failed to reach an agreement with the province, which is trying to eliminate a $12.5-billion deficit.\n\nYear-long negotiations broke down and the Ontario Medical Association rejected the province's contract offer and the Ministry of Health announced Thursday it was implementing several changes to physician fee payments.\n\nThe ministry will apply a 2.65 per cent \"discount\" to all fee for service physician payments next month and will apply the reduction to non-fee-for-service payment contracts after the respective requirements for providing notice are met, it said.\n\nIf comparable savings can be found through other initiatives, the ministry will be \"prepared to adjust the across-the-board rate reduction,\" it said.\n\nThe OMA warned that the deal they rejected would have a negative impact on patients, but Health Minister Eric Hoskins suggested pay was the real sticking point.\n\n\"The OMA argument is that pay raises should come before patients and we can't agree,\" Hoskins said. \"We are talking only about physician compensation in this agreement, not patient services or quality of care.\"\n\nOMA President Ved Tandan said the government's offer of a 1.25-per-cent increase to the budget for physicians' services would have a \"negative and lasting impact on patients,\" providing less than half the necessary funding to hire new doctors the association says are required to meet the province's growing medical needs. The government's own estimates show the demand for health care will grow by at least 2.7 per cent annually, Tandan said.\n\n\"The fact is Ontario's population is already underserviced for health care and our population is growing and aging,\" Tandan said. \"That increases the need for health service, but the government has decided to fund less than half of the additional care that will be required.\"\n\nDoctors understand the financial challenges the government faces and have proposed a two-year freeze on medical fees, Tandan said.\n\n\"It is not responsible for the government to ignore its obligation to properly fund the health-care system and it is not right that patients will have less access to the health care they need and deserve because of the fiscal challenges resulting to a large degree from what was created by the government's own doing,\" said Tandan.\n\nHoskins said Ontario doctors are among the highest paid in Canada, with average gross payments to physicians at $360,000, and they will eventually have to agree to do the same amount of work as the previous year for the same amount of money.\n\n\"The OMA wants you to believe that doctors in this province can't provide the same level of care as last year unless they receive a pay raise and we simply don't agree,\" he said.\n\nHoskins said 10 cents of every dollar the Ontario government spends -- about $11 billion a year -- goes to compensate doctors, up over 60 per cent in a decade. More than 400 doctors bill more than $1 million annually and 28 bill more than $2 million, Hoskins said.\n\nOntario's health-care system consumes nearly half of every dollar the government spends.\n\nThe government will also remove a premium payment to some specialists, cutting weekend and holiday walk-in clinic premiums and stop funding doctors' continuing education such as courses and events.\n\nThe two parties brought in former Ontario Chief Justice Warren Winkler as a conciliator and he recommended the OMA take the deal, concluding the government's offer is \"good for Ontarians, good for the health-care system and fair to doctors,\" Hoskins said.\n\n\"What's changing and what the OMA is objecting to is that doctors can't just bill more and more and more. At some point they'll have to accept that they can do roughly the same amount of work as last year for roughly the same pay.\"",

  "latent_17546": "This article originally appeared on VICE Canada.\n\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged that if you've ever attended a poetry slam, you probably already hate \"slam voice.\" For the uninitiated, it's a term used to describe the affected vocal delivery that has evolved out of the spoken word scene in recent years, and tends to involve a number of common features: mournful tone, stilted, Shatneresque pacing, and long crescendos deployed to show us just. How. Fucking. Intense. Everything is. As an outsider, it's an easy thing to make fun of, but unfortunately for our cold, dead hearts, it's always been hard to articulate exactly why it annoys us.\n\nUntil now.\n\nLindsay Alley is a regular fixture at the Vancouver Poetry Slam (the longest-running event of its kind in Canada), as both a performer and a volunteer. And while her intention wasn't to rip on slam voice, she did recently undertake a linguistic examination of the phenomenon, and interviewed members of the community to get an understanding of it from the perspective of the poets themselves.\n\nShe talked to VICE by phone about her findings; what slam voice is, where it came from, and why, apparently, most poets hate it too.\n\nVICE: So, what is \"slam voice\"?\n\nLindsay Alley: It's a label that gets thrown around—mostly derisively—for performers and poets who have a similar sound. It's usually something people say about performers or performances that annoy them. Or that they don't connect with. In every art form there's a style—in this case, a sound—that's uniform. There are always conventions. It's often about people signifying that they're part of a group—usually people they like or admire. That's a very human thing. And it's this kind of subconscious identification. In language, it often happens with slang. You can use slang as a way of determining which social groups or generations people identify with. And with an art form that's primarily spoken, it inevitably creeps into the art.\n\nWhat are some of the common linguistic factors?\n\nThe two main things are pitch and intonation. First of all, it's pitched higher than regular speech. There's also a repetition of pitch patterns and rhythms. It's an unnatural-sounding pattern, and it tends to recur throughout the performance without necessarily being informed by the content.\n\nI noticed some warping of vowel sounds, similar to what's been explored recently in all those posts about Indie Girl Singer Voice [that vocal trend that makes \"me\" sound like \"maay\" and \"you\" sound like \"yee-oo\"]. There's a ton of vowel warping in that sound, and I definitely noticed some of that in the poets I examined. There's a tendency to take shorter vowels on some words, and draw them out by turning them into diphthongs—which is one way we place emphasis.\n\nRead More: This Is Why You Hate the Sound of Your Own Voice on Recordings\n\nAnd particularly with emotional poetry, there's a warble. It's this vibrato sound that comes through, which is an attempt—maybe subconscious, I don't know—to convey strong emotion. It's interesting with spoken word poetry, because things often do get emotional. You get a score in slam poetry, and often poems with intense emotional content have that reflected in their scores. So it makes it seem like that's something to strive for. But it's not meant to be acting. Some people have this idea that if they can imbue their piece with stronger emotions, they'll score higher. And that isn't always the case. If it's planned or obvious, it doesn't feel the same way.\n\nAny idea why it happens?\n\nIt's certainly more common in newer performers. There's a tendency toward uniformity that's more prominent than in other art forms, and it's interesting to think about why that is. The circumstances of a slam are unique in a lot of ways. Most new people in other art forms aren't getting their start by doing competition in front of an audience. And having that pressure can lead people to imitate things that score well. It's totally understandable. It's terrifying getting up there. And if the only feedback you get is a number, and you don't get any specific or useful criticism from those numbers, it makes sense that you might reach for what other people are doing that works.\n\nIn any art form, when you're starting out, you don't always have an ear for how things should be applied. And spoken word is no different. It's easier to be more imitative. A newer performer doesn't necessarily have the same nuance or understanding, but more mature performers are familiar with the tools, and are able to use them for specific effect.\n\nHow ubiquitous is this? When you see poets from the US or Europe, do they sound like that too? Or is this just a North American phenomenon?\n\nOh, it's everywhere. The specifics of the sound are different—I'd say that poets from further east, and urban centres in the states tend to have a more hip hop-influenced sound, but definitely it's happening everywhere. It's not just here.\n\nNot just us, then. And how do people in the community feel about it?\n\nThe people I spoke to all said they found it annoying. They see it as very imitative, and that's part of what's annoying about it. People who work in this art form tend to place a lot of importance on honesty. It's very autobiographical. And people in that community work to find their own voice, and prioritize honesty—in your words and your representation. So to see performers who sound like they're speaking with someone else's voice, and think that's what they need to do to be successful—consciously or subconsciously—it doesn't have the effect they want it to.\n\nSo, if everyone thinks it's annoying, does that mean it's going to change? How do you push a performance style into evolving?\n\nFor individual performers, the biggest thing to be doing is work specifically on your performance. There's a focus on the words and the poetry, but the whole thing is the art form—the words you write, and the performance you give. Both steps are difficult and both need attention. Just having reasons for the choices you make, and why you do what you do. I think that would go a long way.\n\nIt would also be good for the community to have more resources and exchanges and feedback. And workshops. Which is something we're working on. To have more specific, helpful, critical feedback. Because there are elements of the sound that can be used effectively, and when they are, it doesn't get referred to as \"slam Voice.\" Sometimes the tools I've mentioned—like drawing out a vowel for emphasis—can get employed without as much thought, and you find words being emphasized for reasons that don't make sense. It could be out of habit, it could be because they've done the piece a million times, and you want to say \"why are you emphasizing the word the? It doesn't make any sense!\" But if those tools are used by a performer who's thinking about which words they want to emphasize and why, then it doesn't come across as slam voice. It's the same ideas and some of the same sounds, but they're being used to convey something.\n\nBut for the moment, it's safe to say slam voice isn't going anywhere?\n\nIt's not going to just vanish. There are always going to be people who are new, who are trying things out. It's not going to disappear, but it will definitely change as time goes on. Language is ever-evolving. The way we speak day-to-day is changing constantly. And so language-based performance art forms will continue to do the same.\n\nInterview was edited for length and clarity.",

Owner John Rhee told us that Nintendo of America’s Dan Adelman guided him through the application process, and he’s hoping to hear back from the Big N soon.\n\nSome of you may be aware that Coda Games created a Kickstarter for Liege, “a party-based, tactical role-playing game”. PS4 and PS Vita versions were just added in as stretch goals yesterday, and the Wii U could soon head down the same path.\n\nAccording to Rhee, he’d “love” to release Liege on Wii U, mainly due to the fact that SNES titles such as Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger sparked his interest in RPGs. If he becomes a Wii U dev before the Kickstarter ends, the console will “absolutely” become a part of the campaign as a stretch goal.\n\nAnd just in case you were wondering: Rhee also said that there aren’t any plans for a 3DS version “at this stage”.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\nTumblr\n\nGoogle\n\nMore\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket",
  "latent_17848": "Biophysicists theorize that plants tap into the eerie world of quantum entanglement during photosynthesis. But the evidence to date has been purely circumstantial. Now, scientists have discovered a feature of plants that cannot be explained by classical physics alone — but which quantum mechanics answers quite nicely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that biological systems can exploit quantum effects is quite astounding. In a way, they're like mini-quantum computers capable of scanning all possible options in order to choose the most efficient paths or solutions. For plants, this means the ability to make the most of the energy they receive and then deliver that energy from leaves with near perfect efficiency.\n\nGood Vibrations\n\nBut for this to work, plants require the capacity to work in harmony with the wild, wacky, and extremely small world of quantum phenomena. The going theory is that plants have light-gathering macromolecules in their cells that can transfer energy via molecular vibrations — vibrations that have no equivalents in classical physics. Most of these light-gathering macromolecules are comprised of chromophores attached to proteins. These macromolecules carry out the first step of photosynthesis by capturing sunlight and efficiently transferring the energy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious inquiries suggested that this energy is transferred in a wave-like manner, but it was a process that could still be explained by classical physics.\n\nIn Perfect Quantum Harmony\n\nIn the new study, however, UCL researchers identified a specific feature in biological systems that can only be predicted by quantum physics. The team learned that the energy transfer in the light-harvesting macromolecules is facilitated by specific vibrational motions of the chromophores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We found that the properties of some of the chromophore vibrations that assist energy transfer during photosynthesis can never be described with classical laws, and moreover, this non-classical behaviour enhances the efficiency of the energy transfer,\" noted supervisor and co-author Alexandra Olaya-Castro in a statement.\n\nThe vibrations in question are periodic motions of the atoms within a molecule. It's similar to how an object moves when it's attached to a spring. Sometimes, the energy of two vibrating chromophores match the energy difference between the electronic transitions of chromophores. The result is a coherent exchange of a single quantum of energy.\n\n\"When this happens electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom are jointly and transiently in a superposition of quantum states, a feature that can never be predicted with classical physics,\" explained study co-author Edward O'Reilly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, quantum effects improve the efficiency of plant photosynthesis in a way that classical physics cannot allow. Which is pretty wild if you ask me.\n\nRead the entire study at Nature Communications: \"Non-classicality of the molecular vibrations assisting exciton energy transfer at room temperature.\"\n\nImage: Krivosheev Vitaly/Shutterstock.",

  "latent_18210": "Even Without Unions, Wal-Mart Warehouse Employees Win Change\n\nMira Loma warehouse workers prepare to return to the job after striking at Olvidet International, a Wal-Mart supplier, in July 2013. (Photo from WWU)\n\nIn an era in which anti-union laws and a hamstrung National Labor Relations Board make forming a union difficult, some organizers have advanced the theory that workers without a union can still act like a union—collectively protesting conditions, seeking government intervention or even striking. When they do, the theory goes, they will often win. And if workers realize they have such power, they are more likely to have the stamina to persevere in formally establishing a union. Then they can infuse the larger labor movement with their new energy.\n\nThat theory is now looking more and more practicable as workers at businesses from car washes to Wal-Mart win improvements, and sometimes unions, by taking action even when the path to a union is not clear. For example, fast food workers from more than a half-dozen cities who went out on strike this year are calling for a national walkout on August 29 to demand $15 an hour and the right to form a union, even though organizers do not know—or are not spelling out—how union recognition and collective bargaining might occur.\n\nWorkers at Wal-Mart-controlled warehouses in southern California and Illinois have also played a leading role in this latest mini-upsurge, using a mix of strikes, protests and lawsuits to demand improvements. Over the past few weeks, they saw another of the incremental victories that may add up to a sea change. Seventy-five non-union workers at a giant warehouse in Mira Loma, Calif. serving Wal-Mart won big pay and benefit increases, as well as potentially more stable employment.\n\nBefore they began protesting conditions and pay at the California distribution center, most of the workers at earned only about $8.50 an hour (just above California’s $8 minimum wage), with no benefits. Like many in the warehouse sector, they were employed by subcontractors—in this case, Rogers-Premier Unloading Services and Impact Logistics, two companies that were retained by Schneider Logistics, which was in turn hired by Wal-Mart.\n\nInterestingly, the road to winning the raises began with a lawsuit that focused on winning unpaid back wages, not higher pay. Two years ago, the workers—supported by Warehouse Workers United (WWU), a worker center backed by the Change To Win union federation—filed suit charging Schneider and the sub-contractors with failing to pay millions of dollars that the companies owed by law (for example, not paying for overtime or “off-the-clock” work) and with forcing their employees to work in abusively hot conditions. Later, the federal judge hearing the case added Wal-Mart as a defendant, striking a blow at the common legal subterfuge that big companies like Wal-Mart use: hiring layers of contractors to avoid legal responsibility for workers who ultimately work for them and under conditions set by them.\n\nOver the past two years, workers at the Mira Loma warehouse have also participated in protests and pilgrimages, strikes and shareholder actions. These actions both built solidarity and nurtured the workers’ will to act. And they delivered a message to managers about the workers’ determination to gain better treatment that reinforced the demand for legal relief.\n\nIn February of 2012, Schneider brought the roughly 70 workers for Rogers-Premier under its control as their direct employer and gave them raises and benefits. Though WWU does not know Schneider’s motives in making the change, spokesperson Elizabeth Brennan speculated that it was a result of the ongoing lawsuit. Schneider may have found the subcontracting deal less financially attractive if the contractor could be held financially responsible for labor abuses by its subcontractors. Schneider may also hope that the pay increase and new benefits will mollify workers and defuse their protests.\n\nNow, according to WWU, Schneider has become the direct employer of about 75 Impact workers, which the workers center believes to be all or nearly all of the subcontractor’s employees. For the workers, the change brought an increase in pay to around $13.50 an hour, health insurance, and paid days off for sickness and vacation. “It means it will be easier to take care of my family,” Mira Loma warehouse worker Reynaldo Ríos Ibañez told Warehouse Workers United.\n\nFor the broader movement, Brennan argues, Schneider’s shift proves that Wal-Mart and the warehouses can pay close to a living wage without hardship. “Improving the quality of warehouse jobs and paying a living wage are possible,” she says. It also makes it clearer that warehouse workers are not seasonal temps but year-round employees.\n\nMoreover, thanks to the federal court ruling, the lines of employer responsibility are now more “definitive,” Brennan says. Schneider may be the direct employer, but Walmart is legally implicated as an employer as well.\n\nDespite these advances, Brennan says that “union recognition is a long way off” for Wal-Mart warehouse workers. But in theory, that will come more easily now as the larger wave of strikes and protests by low-wage workers helps the warehouse workers understand that the economic problems they face are not their fault but due to a more basic problem: Their employers do not pay them enough, Brennan says.\n\nWarehouse workers also are learning that they can bring change when they act together, including fighting back against employer retaliation. That lesson holds true of both the Mira Loma actions and the broader warehouse movement: “Every time warehouse workers have spoken up, filed complaints, or gone on strike,” Brennan says, “they’ve won improvements.”",

  "latent_18231": "Ask people to name Pfizer’s best-selling product and many would opt for one of its most famous drugs: Viagra, for erectile dysfunction, or Lipitor, to reduce high cholesterol. People more familiar with the US pharma group might suggest a more recent blockbuster such as Lyrica, for pain.\n\nBut they would all be wrong. The top-seller is not a drug but a vaccine: Prevnar, which prevents pneumonia, meningitis and other infections caused by pneumococcus bacteria.\n\nPrevnar generated revenues of $6.25bn last year — almost three times as much as Viagra. This was up 40 per cent from the year before, after the expert panel that advises on US vaccine policy recommended its use in over-65s as well as in children.\n\nWhile vaccines play a big role in frontline healthcare, they are often an afterthought for a pharmaceuticals industry more focused on treating diseases than preventing them. But the success of Prevnar shows they can be as lucrative as any drug.\n\nPfizer is one of just four pharma groups with large vaccines operations. The others are GlaxoSmithKline of the UK, Sanofi of France and Merck of the US. All four reported stronger sales growth in vaccines than in pharmaceuticals last year and operating margins were comparable with pharma at around 25-30 per cent.\n\nThere are several factors driving this growth. One is the expansion of immunisation programmes in newly industrialised countries such as China. Sanofi’s sales for polio and whooping cough vaccines in emerging markets grew 33 per cent last year.\n\n“In middle-income countries we see great potential,” says Olivier Charmeil, head of Sanofi Pasteur, the group’s vaccines unit. “Many of these countries do not yet have immunisation programmes of the kind we have in the western world.”\n\nIn middle-income countries we see great potential. Many do not yet have immunisation programmes of the kind we have in the western world\n\nIn rich countries, growth relies on either finding more diseases to immunise against — meningitis B, for example, is the target of new vaccines from GSK and Pfizer — or widening the reach of existing products, as Pfizer has done with Prevnar.\n\nWith children already extensively vaccinated in the developed world, much of the industry’s focus has turned to older age groups. GSK last year reported positive clinical trial data on a vaccine for shingles— a condition caused by the same varicella-zoster virus as chicken pox, but which is most common in over-70s.\n\n“If governments want to embrace disease prevention, they should do it for adults as well as for children,” says Susan Silbermann, president of Pfizer’s vaccines business. “It is much easier to get one or two shots of a vaccine to prevent shingles or pneumonia than to end up getting one of [those diseases] and being incapacitated for weeks.”\n\nPolicymakers will be wary of attempts by the pharma industry to pile new costs on to budget-constrained health systems. But Ms Silbermann says the economic benefits of vaccines easily outweigh their price. “The cost of diseases can be as high as 30-fold more than the cost of vaccination.”\n\nVaccine manufacturers hope these arguments will prevail at a time when governments and insurers are becoming more rigorous in judging the costs and benefits of health interventions.\n\nBig Read Drug prices: Tweaking the formula UK regulators are under pressure from Big Pharma as well as patientsRead more\n\nPricing remains a sensitive topic, however, especially in the developing world. Médecins Sans Frontières, the health charity, last month launched a challenge against Pfizer’s patent on Prevnar in a bid to allow Indian companies to produce the vaccine cheaper.\n\nMs Silbermann says Pfizer already provides Prevnar at a substantial discount through Gavi, the global alliance that supplies vaccines to low-income countries. But Manica Balasegaram, executive director of the MSF Access Campaign, says it could be produced in India for $6 per child, compared with Pfizer’s reduced $10 price. “To make sure children everywhere can be protected from deadly pneumonia, other companies need to enter the market,” he says.\n\nCritics argue that consolidation in the industry has left too few companies, developing too few vaccines — and that those that do exist tend to be aimed at rich countries. GSK’s recent acquisition of Novartis’s vaccines business further narrowed the range of competitors.\n\nBut Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer at GSK Vaccines, says consolidation was necessary to produce a more efficient industry. He cites GSK’s newly approved malaria vaccine— the first against the disease — as proof that the remaining companies bring innovation to developing, as well as developed, countries.\n\nSpecial Report Combating Malaria Malaria still kills more than 400,000 people a year, most of them children in Africa. But new weapons are arriving to aid the fight against itRead more\n\nAnother example is Sanofi’s new vaccine for dengue fever, recently launched in the Philippines, for €20 a shot, in a public immunisation programme aimed at 1m children. “Sanofi has done well with dengue,” says Jayasree Iyer, executive director of Access to Medicines. “We’ve been telling them, ‘It is no good having a vaccine for dengue if you don’t have a plan to provide wide access’.”\n\nMr Charmeil says Sanofi must be allowed to make a return on the €1.5bn it invested in its dengue vaccine during 20 years of development, otherwise there would be no incentive for others to pursue similar breakthroughs. Pfizer makes the same argument about Prevnar, the latest iteration of which combines 13 separate vaccines and a batch of which takes two and a half years to produce.\n\nMr Charmeil says the complexity of vaccines, and the fact they are given to healthy individuals rather than to treat the sick, makes quality and reliability especially challenging. “The hurdles are a bit higher than in other parts of the pharma industry.”",

KLSP, \"the incarceration station, the station that kicks behind the bricks,\" as Sirvoris Sutton, a D.J. and program manager, puts it, broadcasts from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. daily.\n\nA Harris AirWave mixing board, two CD players, an aging Gem Sound turntable and a digital playlist pump out a steady variety of gospel -- praise and worship, uptempo, quartet and choir -- during work hours. After 6 p.m., the prison's six D.J.'s, who earn 20 cents an hour, spin an eclectic mix of bluegrass, hip-hop and golden oldies. Friday nights, after a talk show for 170 Muslim inmates, KLSP reveals its regional bias, playing hours of swamp pop, a Cajun brand of rock 'n' roll.\n\nStill, prison officials screen all music for sexual, violent or negative lyrics; gangsta rap and heavy metal are not played. The station has no telephone, so song requests arrive by prison mail. D.J.'s, all of them inmate trustees allowed to move without guards, can be fired for breaking the smallest rule, including using KLSP stationery, as one former D.J. did, to write letters to a girlfriend.\n\nKLSP also dives into old-fashioned radio journalism. A five-minute satellite news feed from the Moody Bible Institute's broadcasting arm in Chicago arrives at 55 minutes past each hour. Celebrity visitors, mainly well-known Christians, including the former heavyweight boxing champion George Foreman and the televangelist Kenneth Copeland, sit for live interviews. A 12-inch color television in the studio carries news from outside.\n\n\"It's one of the better jobs you can have here,\" said Mr. Sutton, 35. (His on-air name, DJ Shaq, was given to him by inmates who saw him dunk a basketball.) The station's purpose is \"to begin to understand the men here,\" he said. A prison radio station has to connect differently with its listeners: \"It's a different language.\"\n\nAngola, known as the Farm, is at the end of a 19-mile rural highway, spreading over 18,000 fertile acres on which inmates farm corn, soybeans, wheat and raise cattle. Serene as the prison appears now, its legacy is soaked in the blood of its inmates. In 1951, 31 prisoners slashed their Achilles tendons to protest Angola's violence and living conditions.\n\nThe prison has been home to a few well-known artists, including the bluesman Leadbelly in the 1930's and Wilbert Rideau, a former death row inmate who used Angola's court-ordered reforms in the 1970's to establish an award-winning prison magazine, The Angolite.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKLSP is the spawn of that artistic legacy, and, Warden Cain said, is central to what he calls the prison's \"Bapticostal\" underpinnings, which foster a mutual respect between his administration and the inmates.\n\nThe prison's Christian-based message has been so successful at keeping the peace that other states have referred to it as a model, though not without legal challenges. In August, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit accusing Warden Cain and the Louisiana state prison system of hindering a Mormon inmate's access to religious texts.\n\nDoes the prison in essence sanction one religion above others?

Colson, the Watergate felon who founded Prison Fellowship Ministries. Broadcasting remotely from the prison, they raised $120,000 to buy modern radio equipment that allowed KLSP to upgrade its programming and expand its daily airtime to 20 hours. All the music it plays is donated.\n\nStill, 100 watts does not push the station's signal far beyond the prison gate, where an etched monument gives tribute to Philippians 3:15: \"Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.\"\n\nSeven miles down Highway 61, KLSP's signal begins to fade. Ten miles out, there is only white noise.\n\nAt a prison like Angola, where most inmates will die of old age, days are measured not by a clock but, in the words of Kerry Myers, The Angolite's current editor, a \"time that slows down, down and down until it seems to stop.\"\n\nThe radio station exists partly to keep that time from stopping for too long. That, inmates say, is when bad things happen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\"When you hear a song from your childhood, it kind of frees you from the atmosphere that you're in,\" said Rockin' Robin Polk, a KLSP D.J. and technician who has spent more than half of his 46 years at Angola for a crime he said he preferred not to have printed.\n\nMr. Sutton, a k a DJ Shaq, said the station maintained a steady, calming influence in inmates' lives. \"It's a familiar voice, a voice they trust,\" he said. \"Every morning, you get up and think, 'Hey, there's a purpose.' \"\n\nMany inmates said that KLSP provided a sense of community, even pride, because it was a positive daily influence created by guys they knew. And, they said, the station is commercial-free.\n\nWillie Humphrey, serving the 31st year of a life sentence for armed robbery, said he was not religious but regularly listened to KLSP for the bouncy gospel music. But sometimes, said Mr. Humphrey, 53, a D.J. breaks the spell. \"Some guys will try and use big words,\" he said, smiling, \"and it don't really come out right.\"\n\nPhil Shappard, a technical manager for Moody Broadcasting Network, said KLSP's influence on its listeners belies its limited resources.\n\nMr. Shappard, who plans to make his fourth visit to Angola in August to deliver training tools like pronunciation guides and vocabulary software, said: \"The radio station is all about moral rehabilitation. The root of it is ministry, personal ministry to the men there.\"\n\nAfter 19 years of prison radio, KLSP's success has led to even bigger ideas at Angola. Later this year, Warden Cain said, the prison plans to begin building a small television studio, with equipment donated from a station in Lafayette, La.\n\n\"I wouldn't do it,\" Warden Cain said, \"without the radio station first.\"",

  "latent_18258": "Featured image: A bull buffalo lies dead, just outside Yellowstone’s north boundary. Photo by Stephany Seay, Buffalo Field Campaign\n\nOn January 12, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) denied Endangered Species Act protection for the iconic Yellowstone Bison. The agency’s decision comes 14 months after Western Watersheds Project and Buffalo Field Campaign petitioned to list these bison as an endangered or threatened species. The groups sought federal protection for the Yellowstone bison because these unique bison herds are harmed by inadequate federal and state management and other threats. In the finding, the USFWS now agrees that the Yellowstone bison are a distinct population of bison, reversing its 2011 position.\n\n“If buffalo are to recover as a wild species in their native ecosystem, science must prevail over politics,” said BFC Executive Director Dan Brister. “The best available science indicates a listing under the Endangered Species Act is necessary to ensure the survival of this iconic species.”\n\n“Friends of Animals is committed to protecting the last wild bison in America. We are disappointed in USFWS’s finding and suspect that the decision was improperly influenced by the interests of private ranchers in the area. We are reviewing the agency’s decision and plan to take further legal action if necessary,” stated attorney Michael Harris of Friends of Animals Wildlife Law Program.\n\n“We petitioned the USFWS to list the Yellowstone bison because of clear management inadequacies and growing threats to this key population of wild bison. The USFWS decision is disappointing because protection under the Endangered Species Act is the only way to counter the management inadequacies and growing threats,” stated Michael Connor of Western Watersheds Project.\n\nThe groups’ petition catalogues the many threats that Yellowstone bison face. Specific threats include: extirpation from their range to facilitate livestock grazing, livestock diseases and disease management practices by the government, overutilization, trapping for slaughter, hunting, ecological and genomic extinction due to inadequate management, and climate change.\n\nFederal and state policies and management practices threaten rather than protect the Yellowstone bison and their habitat. Since 2000, more than 4,000 bison have been captured from their native habitat in Yellowstone National Park and slaughtered. The Forest Service issues livestock grazing permits in bison habitat. The states of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming forcefully remove or kill bison migrating beyond the National Park borders.\n\nOnce numbering tens of millions, there were fewer than 25 wild bison remaining in the remote interior of Pelican Valley in Yellowstone National Park at the turn of the 20th Century. The 1894 Lacey Act, the first federal law specifically safeguarding bison, prevented the extinction of these few survivors.\n\nThe agency’s justification can be found online at:\n\nhttp://buffalofieldcampaign.org/ESA_90_Day_Finding.pdf\n\nThe petition to list Yellowstone bison is available online at http://www.buffalofieldcampaign.org/ESAPetition20141113.pdf\n\nVisit Buffalo Field Campaign for field updates",
  "latent_18292": "[This talk was given at the 2009 Jeremy Davis Mises Circle in Houston. An MP3 audio file of this talk is available for download.]\n\nWe are fortunate to be living in these times, for we are seeing the unfolding of events long explained and predicted by the Austrian tradition.\n\nMaybe that sounds implausible. What is fortunate about our times? The economy is tanking, stocks have been pummeled, unemployment is rising, and Washington is pursuing the worst combination of economic policies since Hoover and FDR. Nor does the new guy in charge seem to have a clue about the limits of what government can do.\n\nConsider what it means to live through our times in the light of economic understanding. Even in the face of calamity, there is no mystery, and hence fear is reduced.\n\nYou look at department stores going belly-up, and you know why. You see parking lots empty, and you know the reason. You have friends losing their jobs, and there is clarity concerning the cause. You see depositors in failing banks lose their money, and you are not surprised. Prices behave in ways that shock and surprise everyone else, but you know what's what.\n\nIn many ways, it is like watching the movement of stars and planets with the scientific knowledge provided by astronomy — or observing the effects of a plague with medical knowledge.\n\nWithout the understanding, the events look mysterious, like a curse from the gods, and their patterns appear random. With the knowledge, with the understanding, we can make sense of the events. Patterns of cause and effect emerge. You see events before they happen, like turning the page of a script before the movie catches up to you. This gives you a sense of intellectual coherence and inner peace — even in the midst of calamity.\n\nIf you read what Mises wrote during the Great Depression and World War Two, you can see firmness of conviction and steadfast calm, even as the whole world was going nuts. Intellectual clarity is the key to seeing the right things and doing the right things. It is a matter of knowing the shape of things even before the things take shape.\n\nKnowledge provides a means of curing the ill. It provides a way out, an answer that gives hope. This is a major reason why people with an Austrian understanding in the midst of financial meltdown keep their wits about them.\n\nYes, it is more than frustrating to see people in Washington spending trillions in a futile effort to repeal economic law. It is sheer madness that they are creating vast quantities of new dollars by means of the Fed's power, even with evidence from the whole of human history that new money only waters down the value of the old, and does nothing to provide a long-term boost to the economy, and much to further distort economic structures.\n\nIt's like watching as barbers bleed patients in the name of curing them, or bringing in the witch doctors to cast out demons from people with the flu. But even if our knowledge of events cannot stop what these people are doing for now, it provides us with a sense of solace in the face of disaster. We can keep our heads, even as others run around as if theirs had been cut off.\n\nIn order to understand events, there is no substitute for doing what the media and most economists refuse to do, which is to look at the big picture and the long view, over decades. It is a matter of applying the rule that Henry Hazlitt brings home so clearly in Economics in One Lesson: economics consists in looking at the effects of policies not on one group but on all groups, not only in the short run but also in the long run.\n\nFrom the long-run point of view, we observe an intriguing illustration of the Austrian warning against ever attempting to bail out an economy that is pushing toward recession. In 2001, the economy wanted to go into recession but the government wouldn't let it happen. It was the first stimulus package in the new millennium, consisting of vast new funding and vast money creation, with the Fed driving down rates and keeping them rock bottom.\n\nIf you look at the short run, it seems that it worked. But looking at the long run, we can see that the attempt to forestall recession only ended up creating a bigger disaster down the line.\n\nSomething very similar happened in the short recession of 1991. Clinton came to power and shortened the recession, which only created another bubble in financials that broke and so on, until we are where we are today.\n\nArguably the last time that a recession was permitted to run its course was following the crack-up boom in the end of the Carter years, as a result of Nixon's inflation. Reagan came to power, with Carter's choice of Volcker at the Fed. Reagan ignored the crying from Congress and the press. He let interest rates rise; the federal-funds rate was 20% and prime was at 21.5% in 1982. Unemployment reached nearly 11%. Inflation fell from 13.5% in 1980 to 3.2% in 1983.\n\nIf we include the S&L debacle in this, it was a nearly total blowout, and if Reagan had left it at that, it would have been a model for how to deal with recessions. There is pain and suffering. But wait it out and you have a fertile ground on which to build a solid prosperity. Sadly, you also produce a solid financial footing that invites the government to abuse the system, as Reagan did with record spending and deficits.\n\nIf we want to look back even further to find better examples of how to handle recession, we can look at 1920 and 1921. The less the government did, the better the results long term. Murray Rothbard's own dissertation on the Panic of 1819 is an interesting case. He took a look at a pure case in which nothing was done to fix a problem. The problem went away. What was notable about this panic is precisely that it never made the history books. It didn't because the government didn't make it worse.\n\nIn the months ahead, we are going to witness more of these ridiculously futile attempts to patch up a failing economy, and we are going to pay a big price this time. It won't be like 2001 or 1992. We will be lucky if it ends up like 1978–1982. More likely, it is going to be worse — and how much worse depends on just how stupid the Obama administration is going to be. It is hard to imagine that these people will be worse than Bush, but it could happen.\n\nWe all must deal with the possible death of the dollar. Many plans have been proposed through the years that would restore the gold dollar, and many have merit. They all provide a means to go back to gold. While they are not lacking in technical detail, they are lacking in something that they can't provide: the political will to do the right thing. They are all premised on the idea that our leaders might be interested in doing the right thing. But the same people that would be in charge of implementing the reform are the very ones who got us into this mess.\n\nIt is hard enough in the course of regular life to get anyone to admit an error and reverse course. In politics, it virtually never happens. Even in the case of egregiously immoral effects, the political class persists in error, mainly because it is more interested in saving itself than saving society. Guido Hülsmann points out in his new book, The Ethics of Money Production, that \"governments inflate the money supply because they gain revenue from inflation.\"\n\nThis is hardly a new insight. Hülsmann quotes the 14th-century Bishop Nicholas Oresme as follows:\n\nI am of the opinion that the main and final cause of why the prince pretends the power of altering the coinage is that profit or gain which he can get from it; it would otherwise be vain to make so many and so great changes…. Besides, the amount of the prince's profit is necessarily that of the community's loss.\n\nThe techniques are different today, but the incentive and moral result are the same. Hülsmann points to another change: today's princes have \"received absolution from the scientific authorities of our day.\" Princes used to work in secret to do these things, and be disgraced when caught. Now they announce the policy as responsible statecraft that is consistent with the teaching of modern economics — and the economists stand ready to nod their heads in agreement.\n\n\"The political class persists in error, mainly because it is more interested in saving itself than saving society.\"\n\nIn the face of this, it is time to deal with political reality that no one in Washington (except Ron Paul) is even slightly interested in: an orderly plan to restore sound money. And yet the problems of fiat money and financial collapse cannot go unaddressed. What's more, the institutions of fiat money are failing, and this fact will be undeniably obvious to everyone in a matter of years.\n\nWe will look back on the end of the Bush administration as an economic disaster, a capstone of many years of horrible foreign policy moved to domestic policy. They will be disgraced, as will the new administration that pursued all the wrong policy measures as a response. The new messiah will face the same reality that the old one did. No amount of bluster, political will, determined speeches, and money flowing from the printing press can get around the problem of economic reality.\n\nIn an essay written at the end of his career, and recently brought back to life by the Mises Institute, F.A. Hayek discusses the only serious means of reform that is open to us. We must completely abolish the central bank. Money itself must be wholly untied from the state. It must be restored as a private good, privately produced for private markets. Government must have no role at all in monetary affairs. Money should be produced by private enterprise alone. Banks must exist only as free-enterprise institutions, with no privileges from the state. This plan has also been advanced by Ron Paul.\n\nWhat strikes me is how this accords precisely with what Hülsmann writes. His book on the Ethics of Money Production ends with a call for an end to all intervention in monetary affairs. Coinage must be private. Banking must receive no privileges. There should be no legal-tender laws, no guarantees, no restrictions on currency use — a fully laissez-faire system.\n\nWhat is further striking about the Hayek, Hülsmann, and Paul idea here is that they offer no plan for restoring a gold dollar. It's not that they would disagree with the idea, but they have fully confronted the reality that the idea of converting the existing currency from fiat money to sound money is essentially a 19th-century ideal that presupposes an enlightened class of political managers. This condition is not met today.\n\nBut what is the means? It is the same as we propose in every other area of national life: get the government out. Let the people be free to manage their own affairs. Stop interfering with commercial acts between consenting adults. Stop using violence to interfere with economic affairs. Let the people pursue mutually beneficial exchange based on their own self-assessment of the advantages. Let property owners accept the risk and reward for their own decisions.\n\nIt is the same with monetary policy and banking policy too. Let failing banks die. Let profitable banks live. Let the people choose to use any form of money. Let the people choose any means of payment. Let entrepreneurs create any form of financial instrument. Law applies only the way it applies to all other human affairs: punishing force and fraud. Otherwise, the law should have nothing to do with it.\n\nWhat would be the results? We cannot know for sure. But history can be a guide in our speculations. Throughout all time and in all places, precious metals have emerged as the foundation of the monetary system. I think we can have every expectation that the same would be true today. Evidence comes from how people turn to gold in difficult times as a store of value, a safehouse from the machinations of government. Gold, in my view, is destined to be the foundation of a new free-market monetary system.\n\n\"The idea of converting the existing currency from fiat money to sound money is essentially a 19th-century ideal that presupposes an enlightened class of political managers.\"\n\nTo this extent, and with this expectation, all believers in liberty can consider themselves advocates of the gold standard. But we must also be careful with this phrase. It is identified with a particular set of policies associated with 19th-century practice. It was a policy choice among many that some favored and some opposed.\n\nA free-market monetary system of the future will not be a policy option in this sense. It is not something we want the government to adopt as its own. In fact, we don't want the government to adopt any particular policy but rather abandon the policy option altogether. There should be no policy at all in the sense that this word is routinely used today.\n\nIn this way, a path forward in money and banking is no different from the path forward in agriculture, labor, health care, education, or any other sector. The right policy is no policy. The job of the government is to stop interfering altogether.\n\nNow, I'm aware that this is a big intellectual leap these days. But you only need to consider the myriad ways in which government fails at everything it attempts, whereas the market succeeds. There is nothing about the structure of the universe that confers upon money and banking any special status that requires the government to regulate it, to serve as a lender of last resort, the marker of money, the guarantor of stability, or anything else. A free market in money would work the same as a free market in everything else.\n\nAnd consider: We are not asking Congress to intervene with a plan. No one is demanding that the Fed adopt this policy as versus that policy. All we are asking is that it not intervene in the attempts by the market to fix the problems that have been created by the central bank and the executive department.\n\nJust imagine what would happen if legal-tender laws were repealed and the government stopped intervention in the market for money. Virtually overnight, we would see the appearance of hundreds if not thousands of new payment systems and alternative monies online. Merchants would be free to accept any means of payment. There would be intense competition among them. Some would be foreign currencies like the Euro. Some would be new currencies based on existing commodities such as gold and silver. I'm certain that we would see a period of wild experimentation take place before the market settled back down again into a standard system that was famed for its reliability and stability and honesty.\n\nWould we be able to endure the process of discovery? Certainly. We do this every day with our shopping online, or searches for good providers of services and products in the physical world, and our habits on how to invest our money. The market is a process of trial and error, one that never stops innovating and changing. We see everyday on the World Wide Web how this process of creation and change create the right balance between chaos and order, experimentation and standardization. This would happen in the field of money too.\n\n\"Economic forces pay no attention to the wishes of charismatic leaders and their throngs of adoring followers.\"\n\nIn fact, it might have happened already had the feds not intervened to stop the rise of alternative payment systems online. Walmart might have already entered the banking sector. We might have a wide variety of currencies available to us. Google might already have created its own currency based on any number of goods. We might see a more elaborate use of barter in the online world taking shape, and that barter slowly converting itself into currency. This might be based on Google ad points, on PayPal dollars, or some other currency.\n\nHad a free market been permitted to develop over the last ten years, we might have an option today. As it is, we are being forced to stay with a failing dollar system.\n\nWhat we've been hearing from Washington is that the economy and this country will be patched up by sheer force of will. If we have hope and work together, anything is possible. There is only one thing standing in the way of this wish. It is called economics. Economic reality is more than a brick wall. It is like the sea or the world's tallest mountain, or like the force of gravity itself. Economic forces pay no attention to the wishes of charismatic leaders and their throngs of adoring followers.\n\nHowever, there is a kernel of truth in the idea that the force of will can make a difference. Transfer this hope and will outside the institutions of government and into the free market — let experimentation and innovation take place under conditions of freedom — and we will begin to see the emergence of an answer. We need the government merely to let the market be free of political violence, and we will begin to see our way out of this mess.\n\nThe government today is marshalling every resource and every means at its disposal to prop up a failing system of the past. Meanwhile, we live in completely new times. These new times are characterized by an international division of labor, global capital flows, digital information delivery, and the slow but systematic destruction of the establishment in media, banking, and finances. What is emerging to replace them is something that no government on the planet can stop. Markets will not be crushed and they resist control as never before.\n\nThese new times are not the 1930s when a few eggheads in Washington could set most prices and wages and gather the captains of industry to cobble together business cartels. The economic and financial world moves at the speed of light and is so diffuse that no political authority can act quickly enough to control it. The establishment is going down. This is another reason that all believers in freedom have reason to rejoice today.\n\nTwelve to 18 months from now, it will be obvious that there is nothing the new administration can do to patch things up. Obama will be humbled by the market just as Bush and Clinton were before him, but this time the humbling will overwhelm any attempts to patch things up or put a spin on the much-needed upheaval.\n\nYes, there is suffering, and there will be more to come. But as a student of the Austrian School and a student of the history of liberty, you have the confidence and clarity to see that freedom alone provides the answers.\n\nIt is the time for calm in the face of a storm that few fully understand. Let us, as advocates of freedom, be steadfast, rational, clear, and focused on the long term. Be of good cheer and never stop pointing to the truth about freedom. The answer is not the Left nor the Right nor the state. The way out of this mess is freedom. It is time we defer to it, and to the revolution in the status quo that freedom implies, and give up pretending as if any politician can finally stop it.",

  "latent_18676": "The evolution of human speech was far more complex than is implied by some recent attempts to link it to a specific gene, says Robert Berwick, professor of computational linguistics at MIT.\n\nBerwick will describe his ideas about language in a session at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science on Sunday, Feb. 17. The session is called \"Mind of a Toolmaker,\" and explores the use of evolutionary research in understanding human abilities.\n\nSome researchers in recent years have speculated that mutations in a gene called Foxp2 might have played a fundamental role in the evolution of human language. That was based on research showing that the gene seems to be connected to language ability because some mutations to that gene produce specific impairments to language use, and because our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees, lack both these gene mutations and the capacity for language. But the claim that the gene mutation is directly connected to the development of language is very unlikely to be right, says Berwick, who holds appointments in MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences.\n\n\"This kind of straightforward connection is just not the way organisms are put together,\" he says. When it comes to something as complex as language, \"one would be hard-pressed to come up with an example less amenable to evolutionary study.\" And the specific Foxp2 connection is based on a whole chain of events, each of which is speculative, so there's little chance of the whole story being right.\n\n\"It's so chaotic, it's like weather forecasting,\" he says. \"The noise overwhelms the signal.\"\n\nRather, language is almost certainly the result of a far more complex and subtle interplay among a variety of factors, Berwick says, and it may never be possible to connect it to specific genetic changes. \"There are some things in science that are very interesting, but that we're never going to be able to find out about,\" he says. \"It's a sort of romantic view some people have, that anything interesting can be understood.\"\n\nEven defining something as complicated as language in a precise way is daunting, as ongoing disputes over the significance of language experiments with apes, parrots and dolphins have made clear. Berwick says, \"If you can't define what it is, why study it from an evolutionary point of view?\"\n\nIt's more likely, Berwick says, that the role of the Foxp2 gene in language is somehow peripheral to the capacity for language itself. He compares it to a printer in a computer system--it's part of the overall system, but it's not fundamental. Berwick thinks a more productive approach to studying the evolution of language is to examine it in terms of deeper, internal mechanisms.\n\nIn his own research, Berwick has compared the structure of languages with the structure of bird songs, and has found interesting connections that may lead to a better understanding of some aspects of language.\n\nBoth bird songs and all human languages seem to share some underlying characteristics related to their metrical structure, Berwick says. There's an underlying sing-song beat that is pronounced in poetry, music and in the songs of birds that may reveal a fundamental aspect of how our brains process language. Future research could probe this link further, even looking at possible connections between other specific genes, in both birds and humans, that might be connected to this sense of metrical structure.\n\nUltimately, the important thing is to understand that language is, at bottom, something that takes place inside the human mind and is independent of any particular sound, sight or motion. The same internal mental construction could be expressed through verbal speech, through writing or through sign language without changing its basic nature, Berwick says. \"It's not about this external thing you hear,\" he says. \"It's about the representation inside your head.\"",
  "latent_18694": "In the last blog post, we learnt “How to Share a Media File from WP8 using the ShareMediaTask?” which was a launcher available in Windows Phone 8 SDK. Similarly there are few more launchers available in the SDK by which you can launch WP8 specific applications programmatically.\n\nToday in this blog post we will learn how to create an appointment in Windows Phone 8 using the API named “SaveAppointmentTask”. Continue reading for details.\n\nImplementation Steps\n\nWindows Phone 8 SDK provides you an API named SaveAppointmentTask, which helps you to create an appointment programmatically from your Windows Phone 8 application. The said class is present in the “Microsoft.Phone.Tasks” namespace. SaveAppointmentTask is actually a launcher which launches a dialog that allows a user to create and save appointment with predefined values.\n\nTo begin with the implementation steps, first create an instance of the SaveAppointmentTask present under the namespace named “Microsoft.Phone.Tasks” and then fill up the fields those you want to populate from your application itself. After that, call the Show() method of the SaveAppointmentTask to launch the phone application. Here is the sample code for your reference:\n\nvar saveAppointmentTask = new SaveAppointmentTask(); saveAppointmentTask.StartTime = DateTime.Now.AddHours(1); saveAppointmentTask.EndTime = DateTime.Now.AddHours(2); saveAppointmentTask.Subject = \"Save Appointment Task Demo\" ; saveAppointmentTask.Location = \"www.kunal-chowdhury.com\" ; saveAppointmentTask.Details = \"Demo uses of SaveAppointmentTask to the WP8Devs\" ; saveAppointmentTask.IsAllDayEvent = false ; saveAppointmentTask.Reminder = Reminder.FifteenMinutes; saveAppointmentTask.AppointmentStatus = Microsoft.Phone.UserData.AppointmentStatus.Busy; saveAppointmentTask.Show();\n\nOnce you call the Show() method, it will open the Appointment client in the screen with the predefined values and ask the user to verify/modify them. Clicking the save button will then actually save the appointment to the user’s phone calendar.\n\nHere is the meta data of the “SaveAppointmentTask” class:\n\nnamespace Microsoft.Phone.Tasks { public sealed class SaveAppointmentTask { public DateTime? StartTime { get; set; } public DateTime? EndTime { get; set; } public bool IsAllDayEvent { get; set; } public string Subject { get; set; } public string Location { get; set; } public string Details { get; set; } public Reminder Reminder { get; set; } public AppointmentStatus AppointmentStatus { get; set; } public void Show(); } }\n\nKeep in mind that, you can not silently create an appointment as the user interaction is needed for security reason and that is defined by the Microsoft Windows Phone 8 SDK.\n\nI hope that the post was helpful and helped you to integrate the appointment creation task in your phone programmatically from your application. Let me know, if you have further queries on this. I will try to answer you as soon as I can.\n\nAre you on Twitter? Don’t forget to connect with me. I am also available in Facebook and Google+.

This means Singaporeans will have their first Malay President since Mr Yusof Ishak died in office nearly 50 years ago.\n\nAfter the amendments were passed, names of several potential frontrunners have surfaced. These are prominent figures in the Malay community, and are from both the public and private sectors.\n\nLeading the list is current Speaker of Parliament Halimah Yaacob, a former unionist and an MP for Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC.\n\nFormer Minister and Speaker of Parliament Abdullah Tarmugi has also been tipped to be a potential candidate. Mr Abdullah – who was part of the nine-man Constitutional Commission that reviewed the elected presidency – reportedly said he has not given the idea of running much thought, and that friends have encouraged him to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrent Ministers Yaacob Ibrahim and Masagos Zulkifli, and former MP Zainul Abidin Rasheed have also been identified as possible candidates.\n\nPotential candidates from the private sector include Bank of Singapore CEO Bahren Shaari and Public Service Commission member Po'ad Mattar. So far, none of them have indicated any interest in contesting.\n\nCANDIDATES FACE \"UNIQUE CHALLENGE\"\n\nPolitical observers told Channel NewsAsia that candidates in this first ever reserved election face a very unique challenge.\n\n\"This person has to tread a very fine line between being the best of breed that that ethnic community can offer and yet also be that quintessential Singaporean that all voters feel they have an affinity for,\" said Dr Gillian Koh, Deputy Director (Research), Institute of Policy Studies.\n\nThis means candidates cannot limit themselves to speaking about issues concerning their own community, and must represent the values and ideals of a multicultural Singapore.\n\n“We look at the example of Mr Yusof Ishak, when he was President. He was the managing editor of Utusan Melayu, a very Malay-rights newspaper. But when he became Yang-di-Pertuan Negara in 1959 and later as President in 1965, he represented Singapore. He spoke about multi-culturalism, equality of rights,” said Dr Norshahril Saat, Fellow, ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute.\n\nSingapore Management University Associate Professor Eugene Tan noted: “Candidates can set the tone as well by putting forth their vision or how they are going to promote and practise multiracialism through the office of the elected president.\"\n\nPolitical observers also stressed that candidates must be aware of what their role as President constitutes, reinforcing what Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had said in Parliament.\n\nMr Lee recounted that in the 2011 Presidential Election, a candidate championed a S$60 billion economic plan to create jobs and enterprise, while another proposed better recognition for national servicemen, and more help for the poor and unemployed.\n\nThese issues, according to Mr Lee, are the Government's responsibility.\n\n\"The purpose of having a President is not as a check and balance to Parliament. So I think one issue that the candidates should avoid is to act as if they can check the Government. They can’t because they’re largely symbolic even though they have custodial powers,\" said Dr Norshahril.\n\nInstead, candidates should put forth issues of national unity, said Dr Koh.\n\n\"There's always a lot of goodwill that's conferred onto the person who occupies the office of President. So I think the candidates can talk a little bit about their lifetime interests, or things that they can use the office to develop so that it contributes to community building for Singaporeans at large,\" she added.\n\nObservers said candidates should also highlight their track record, to show voters why he or she is the most qualified for the office.\n\nWhile the role is largely ceremonial, the President still holds other important responsibilities, such as acting as the custodian of the nation's reserves, and representing Singapore internationally.\n\n\"ENSURE THAT EVERY VOTE COUNTS\"\n\nCritics have warned that a reserved election could lead voters to think that there is no need to be engaged and vote for the best minority candidate. This is why, according to observers like Associate Professor Tan and Dr Norshahril, there is a need for candidates to engage all Singaporeans in their campaign.\n\n\"It is important for them to have their say. Not just having their say, but also having an informed say. So it’s not only being engaged so that they can determine who is better suited for the job, who would engender greater confidence and trust amongst the voters,\" said Associate Professor Tan.\n\nDr Norshahril noted: \"You must ensure that every vote counts. You must ensure that citizens feel that their vote counts. Candidates must come out very strongly and tell voters that they're voting for the future of Singapore.”",

  "latent_19445": "Since 2009, Republicans have been waging holy war to destroy health-care reform and have taken special delight in the prospect that Donald Trump’s election might erase the most famous legacy of their hated adversary. It could well still happen. But as a party that did not expect to win finds itself suddenly charged with responsibility, true repeal of the law now looks much less probable than it has before.\n\n1. Every Republican plan is painful. Politico has a report filled with Republican bravado about the ease with which they will sweep away Obamacare. Various party honchos insist that taking health insurance away from 20 million Americans will be like taking candy from a baby, because the babies don’t like the candy. “People have crappy insurance now,” says Rep. John Shimkus tells Jennifer Haberkorn. “They have high costs, they have high deductibles, it’s like they don’t have insurance. So this fear that they’re going to lose something that they don’t think they have anyway is crazy.” Sen. Johnny Isakson adds, “Most of those 20 million got bronze policies with a great big deductible and not much insurance, so I don’t know that there’s going to be a big backlash.”\n\nAs Haberkorn points out, Isakson’s facts are wrong — most customers in the exchanges have silver policies. But there is an even larger mistake here that reveals why Republicans plans will encounter so much political resistance.\n\nThe Republicans are not wrong to say that Obamacare gives people fairly crappy insurance. That is because what we mean by “good insurance” is something like Medicare or employer-sponsored insurance. It’s a plan that does not charge you higher rates if you’re old or have a medical condition in your family, and covers the vast majority of your medical expenses, with low deductibles. The downside to good insurance is that it’s extremely expensive. People who enjoy good insurance pay for it in ways that obscure its high costs — workplace insurance is covered by employers (who pay for it by giving their employees lower wages, a reduction that’s largely invisible to the employee), and Medicare is financed by taxes.\n\nObamacare is more market-based than traditional employer insurance. Unlike insurance provided by most employers, which charges every employee the same rate, the exchanges are allowed to charge old people up to three times as much as young people. The premiums are paid up front, and since people tend to shop for the cheapest premiums, they often get insurance with high deductibles.\n\nIt’s not unreasonable to call this insurance “crappy.” But not only is crappy insurance better than no insurance, all the Republican plans to replace Obamacare share the common trait that they will give people crappier insurance. Republicans plans all involve higher deductibles and greater discrimination against the old and sick than exchange plans allow. They would make the exchanges even less like the employer-based insurance that people like.\n\nWhat’s more, their favorite financing mechanism for these plans is to end or limit the tax deduction for employer-based insurance. That would hit many, many more Americans in the pocketbook and disrupt their insurance, and push them out into the marketplace to buy crappy insurance they don’t like. There are substantive policy reasons why conservatives support these ideas. But the notion that they’ll be more widely liked is a fantasy.\n\n2. Repeal and delay is hard. I’ve argued before that the Republican solution to this quandary is most likely to be repeal and delay. That means that Republicans would use a budget-reconciliation bill, which is a special bill that can only apply to tax and spending changes, and is immune from a filibuster. A reconciliation bill could be used to wreck Obamacare but not to build a replacement. (The reason is that you can use tax and spending changes to zero out the subsidies that make its insurance affordable, but not to eliminate the insurance protections, like the guarantee of coverage for people with preexisting conditions, or the requirement that insurance covers essential benefits.) Repeal and delay would mean quickly passing a repeal that wrecks the exchanges, but only starting in two years, and then Republicans could spend that time promising a terrific new plan that will be wonderful for everybody, and figure it out later.\n\nAs Sarah Kliff points out, it’s incredibly hard to announce a plan to blow up the health exchanges in two years without doing immediate damage. Impending destruction will encourage most or even all insurers to pull out immediately. Republicans will own the havoc. My response to Kliff is that they could fix this by throwing money at the insurers. Republicans have been unwilling to spend money, or do anything at all, to make the law work better. But that’s because Barack Obama has been president. Cutting checks that you don’t pay for is a hallowed tradition of Republican governance. So they might do that. On the other hand, maybe Kliff is right that the mess will be too much for them.\n\n3. The filibuster. Remember, Republicans can destroy Obamacare with a majority, but they can’t write a new law with one as long as the filibuster exists. The repeal-and-delay plan assumes that at some point, Republicans will just kill the filibuster, which they can do with a simple majority vote. But already, two Republican senators have publicly attacked the idea of eliminating the legislative filibuster. That will bring the party perilously close to losing the 50 votes they need to eliminate it already.\n\nCould it change over the Trump administration? Sure. I expect it to. But it might not. And if it doesn’t, then Democrats will be needed to join in the rewrite of the law. Which would mean that nothing like the right-wing fever fantasies could stand a chance of passage.\n\n4. Some Republicans want bipartisanship. The most significant comments about party strategy may have come from Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican and a fierce critic of Obamacare. Alexander warned that Republicans should work together with Democrats rather than pass a bill on a party line: “Before the process is over, we’ll need a consensus to complete it, and I imagine this will take several years to completely make that sort of transition to make sure we do no harm, create a good health care system that everyone has access to and that we repeal the parts of Obamacare that need to be repealed.” And he urged that Republicans “be the rescue party instead of the party that pushes millions of Americans who are hanging by the edge of their fingernails over the cliff.”\n\nIn conjunction with his proposal to work with Democrats, Alexander’s argument would lean in the direction of marginal changes in the law rather than fundamental ones. It might be a plan like the one Republican staffers described to reporter Caitlin Owens: allowing insurers to cover fewer medical services, and charge higher rates to older or sicker customers. It would shift costs away from the young and healthy and onto the old and sick, and make insurance generally crappier, but the differences would be marginal rather than fundamental. The outcome would be much closer to what Obamacare created than to what came before it.\n\nIt makes further political sense that Republicans would want to enlist Democratic co-operation. Given that they would be imposing unpopular changes, they would get bipartisan cover rather than having to own a system with features many people don’t like. Democrats, in turn, would get a hedge against the alternative of total destruction and chaos.\n\n5. Trump may want to compromise. Donald Trump has never cared about eliminating universal health insurance. Indeed, he has praised single-payer systems in the past.\n\nIt’s clear that Trump simply knows very little about the issue and probably cares little, too. He vacillates wildly, depending in part on the last person he spoke with. After meeting with Obama, Trump emitted conciliatory rhetoric about preserving Obamcare’s protection for patients — a promise that would be impossible to square with Republican policies. Trump has a political incentive to listen to Obama. The outgoing president is popular, and Trump is the least-popular incoming president in recorded history. He lost the national vote, is seen as racist by a great many people, and has faced unprecedented protests that clearly bother him. Obama has a unique ability to legitimize Trump. It’s hard to imagine Obama would continue to play this role after leaving office unless Trump is willing to protect Obama’s main legacies.\n\nThere is another potential source of advice Trump may heed. Josh Kushner, the brother of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared, founded a health-care startup designed to sell in the exchanges. He recently made the case for saving the law rather than scrapping it. Trump tends to take advice from family members, and it’s possible this connection would influence him.\n\nTo be sure, Trump will probably find it necessary to appease Republicans by following through on his promise to repeal Obamacare. On the other hand, he may also want to follow through on his promise to replace it with a beautiful plan that takes care of everybody, which is a promise that can’t be reconciled with what Paul Ryan wants. Trump has plenty of ways to make Congressional Republicans happy. He can give them regressive tax cuts, which is their favorite thing in the world, and lax regulation of the finance industry, which may be their second-favorite thing in the world. The only way to please everybody — Democrats in Congress, Obama, Republicans — is to sign a bipartisan plan that “replaces” Obamacare, and thus “repeals” it, but which keeps enough of its protections to maintain a bipartisan imprimatur. It seems more probable now than it did a week ago that this is what he’ll try to do.",

In October, a federal judge ordered an independent monitor to oversee Arpaio, after ruling that the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office singled out Latinos for detention. Now Sheriff Arpaio says he wants to help veteran inmates dealing with PTSD.\n\n\"It is my hope that this program will give you the tools and opportunity to address issues that you are facing in your life and will assist you in getting back on your feet and back to the way of life that you served to protect,\" Arpaio wrote in an open letter to the inmates being moved.\n\nPrograms like these have popped up across the country in recent years, with veteran inmate wings opening in Georgia and Los Angeles. Phoenix's program is similar to one implemented more than three years ago in San Francisco County.\n\nAt San Francisco's County Jail Five in the San Bruno Jail Complex, the COVER program (Community of Veterans Engaged in Restoration) has been housing incarcerated veterans together since September 2010.\n\nCounty sheriff's office spokesperson Susan Fahey says the 48 veterans in COVER go through intensive programming every day, and she doesn't hear complaints from inmates saying they don't want to be there.\n\n\"From what I've seen, the inmates seem to be very appreciative to have something tailored to them,\" Fahey said to ABCNews.com. \"It's based on the core roots of their behavior, and finds out what their triggers are.\"\n\nUsing sheriff's department money through a Bureau of Justice Assistance grant, the COVER program utilized a group therapy curriculum named Seeking Safety to address symptoms of PTSD in veteran inmates. That grant expired in September of this year, and they have lost their daily staff member dedicated to the curriculum, although regular psychiatric help is still available.\n\nThe COVER program also focuses on providing veteran inmates with resources to fall back on once they're released. To help provide housing and employment outside of cell walls, San Francisco County works with the area's No Violence Alliance, a group dedicated to decreasing city violence by rehabilitating ex-offenders.\n\nIn San Diego County, a module within one of the jails currently houses 32 veteran inmates, part of a voluntary program aimed at transitioning jailed veterans into the community.\n\nThe San Diego program is just short of six weeks old, and so far has reintegrated one veteran into service at Southern California's Camp Pendleton, something program leaders say can be attributed to the amount of services available to veteran inmates.\n\n\"At other jail facilities, programming is based on a wait list,\" Capt. Erika Frierson, who's with the San Diego County Sheriff's Office, said to ABCNews.com. \"Upon their arrival in the program, veterans undergo a risk and needs assessment to find out what they need to be a successful citizen.\" Frierson says that assessment gets veteran inmates the help they need as soon as possible.\n\nIn addition to the veteran inmate's module being \"the cleanest one in the entire jail,\" San Diego County utilizes a core program called Thinking for a Change, which aims to make sure veteran inmates have an established plan upon release.\n\n\"Having a V.A. specialist day-to-day allows us to work closer with the inmates, with the hope they don't re-offend,\" Capt. Frierson said. \"Veterans are entitled to more services than the typical citizen who is arrested, so now more veterans are identifying as such because they want to be a part of this.\"\n\nBack in Phoenix, Arpaio hopes to use segregated housing as a way to honor veteran inmates' commitment to service.\n\n\"This program is our way of letting you know that we have not forgotten that commitment, despite whatever circumstances in your life have landed you into the custody of the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office,\" Arpaio wrote in his open letter.\n\nThe program will integrate incarcerated veterans who have been jailed for a wide range of crimes, including aggravated DUI, burglary and aggravated assault.",

Each of the defendants is a manufacturer or developer of either wireless handheld devices or software applications used in the delivery of email across wireless communications systems.\n\nDonald E. Stout, NTP's co-founder, said, \"Use of NTP's intellectual property without a license is just plain unfair to NTP and its licensees. Unfortunately, litigation is our only means of ensuring the inventor of the fundamental technology on which wireless email is based, Tom Campana, and NTP shareholders are recognized, and are fairly and reasonably compensated for their innovative work and investment. We took the necessary action to protect our intellectual property.\"\n\nNTP is best known for its long litigation and eventual settlement with Research in Motion (RIM), maker of BlackBerry® wireless devices. In that litigation, all the claims asserted at trial were found to be valid and willfully infringed by RIM, and the verdict was ultimately affirmed on appeal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n\nSpurred by that litigation, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) moved to re-examine NTP's patents. In December 2009, in spite of the massive effort by the USPTO to overturn NTP's patents, the USPTO Board of Patent Appeals (USPTO Board) ruled that 67 of NTP's patent claims in four patents are valid, including three claims that RIM was found to have infringed. Infringement of a single claim is all that is needed for a patent to be deemed violated.\n\nNTP has also filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to overturn the USPTO's remaining rejections of NTP's patent claims.\n\n\"The filing of suit today is necessary to ensure that those companies who are infringing NTP's patents will be required to pay a licensing fee,\" Mr. Stout continued. \"In view of the USPTO Board's ruling, the debate over whether Mr. Campana was an originator in the field of wireless email is over. No patents in U.S. history have received as much scrutiny as NTP's patents. We are delighted that the USPTO Board has recognized the groundbreaking innovation of Mr. Campana by confirming 67 of NTP's patent claims. We are also confident that the USPTO's rejections, which are on appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, will be overturned.\"\n\nAbout NTP Incorporated\n\nNTP Incorporated is a privately-held intellectual property firm based in Richmond, Virginia that was founded in 1992 by the late inventor Thomas Campana, Jr. and his partners.

Easter, the campus's interim provost and interim chancellor, said, \"We value the contributions our graduate assistants make to the campus, and we feel this tentative agreement represents the best possible contract given the financial constraints we face.\"\n\nOver the weekend, when the strike was announced, administrators of the campus had said they had no intention of denying tuition waivers to graduate employees, but were worried that the guarantee sought by the union was so broad it would limit their ability to deny waivers to students who failed to fulfill their end of the bargain.\n\nThe tentative agreement reached Tuesday said graduate and teaching assistants will not have their tuition waivers reduced so long as they hold qualifying assistantships, are in good academic standing, and are making adequate progress toward graduation in the academic field in which they began their studies.\n\nCary Nelson, who is president of the American Association of University Professors and a professor of English at the campus, praised the graduate students' handling of the strike, which was heavily planned in advance. \"It was well-run,\" he said. \"It was well-organized. They did not do it until they knew they had their ducks in a row, they knew they had their people committed.\"\n\nOther provisions of the proposed contract, which both sides had already agreed to as of last weekend, call for the university to increase the graduate students' minimum stipends and subsidies for health insurance and require it to take steps to accommodate them for some period following the birth or adoption of a child.",
  "latent_19681": "This article is about the firearm. For other uses, see Revolver (disambiguation)\n\nA revolver (also called a wheel gun[1][2]) is a repeating handgun that has a revolving cylinder containing multiple chambers and at least one barrel for firing. Revolvers are a subset of handguns, distinct from pistols, which are defined as handguns with an integral chamber-barrel assembly. The revolver allows the user to fire multiple rounds without reloading after every shot, unlike older single shot firearms. After a round is fired the hammer is cocked and the next chamber in the cylinder is aligned with the barrel by the shooter either manually pulling the hammer back (single action operation) or by rearward movement of the trigger (double action operation).\n\nRevolvers still remain popular as back-up and off-duty handguns among American law enforcement officers and security guards and are still common in the American private sector as defensive and sporting/hunting firearms. Famous and iconic revolvers models include the Colt 1851 Navy Revolver, the Webley, the Colt Single Action Army, the Colt Official Police, Smith & Wesson Model 10, the Smith and Wesson Model 29 of Dirty Harry fame, and the Nagant M1895.\n\nThough revolvers are usually referred to as and often are handguns, other firearms may also have a revolver action. These include some models of grenade launchers, shotguns, rifles and cannons, such as revolver cannon. These are different from other firearms with revolving chambers, such as Gatling-style rotary cannons in that revolvers typically require the hammer to be re-cocked with each shot and require manual reloading, while guns like the minigun are motor driven and have a barrel for each chamber.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nDetail of an 8-chambered matchlock revolver (Germany c. 1580)\n\nIn the development of firearms, an important limiting factor was the time it took to reload the weapon after it was fired. While the user was reloading, the weapon was useless, and an adversary might be able to take advantage of the situation and kill or wound the user. Several approaches to the problem of increasing the rate of fire were developed, the earliest simply being multi-barrelled weapons which allowed two or more shots without reloading.[3] Later weapons featured multiple barrels revolving along a single axis.\n\nDuring the late 16th century in China, Zhao Shi-zhen invented the Xun Lei Chong, a five-barreled musket revolver spear. Around the same time, the earliest examples of what today is called a revolver were made in Germany. These weapons featured a single barrel with a revolving cylinder holding the powder and ball. They would soon be made by many European gun-makers, in numerous designs and configurations.[4] However, these weapons were difficult to use, complicated and prohibitively expensive to make, and as such they were not widely distributed.\n\nColt Paterson 2nd Belt Model\n\nIn 1836, an American, Samuel Colt, patented the mechanism which led to the widespread use of the revolver,[5] the mechanically indexing cylinder. According to Samuel Colt, he came up with the idea for the revolver while at sea, inspired by the capstan, which had a ratchet and pawl mechanism on it, a version of which was used in his guns to rotate the cylinder by cocking the hammer. This provided a reliable and repeatable way to index each round and did away with the need to manually rotate the cylinder. Revolvers proliferated largely due to Colt's ability as a salesman[citation needed]. But his influence spread in other ways as well; the build quality of his company's guns became famous, and its armories in America and England trained several seminal generations of toolmakers and other machinists, who had great influence in other manufacturing efforts of the next half century.[6]\n\nEarly revolvers were caplocks and loaded as a muzzle-loader: the user poured black powder into each chamber, rammed down a bullet on top of it, then placed percussion caps on the nipple at the rear of each chamber, where the hammer would fall on it. This was similar to loading a traditional single-shot muzzle-loading pistol, except that the powder and shot could be loaded directly into the front of the cylinder rather than having to be loaded down the whole length of the barrel. Importantly, this allowed the barrel itself to be rifled, since the user wasn't required to force the tight fitting bullet down the barrel in order to load it (a traditional muzzle-loading pistol had a smoothbore and relatively loose fitting shot, which allowed easy loading, but gave much less accuracy). When firing the next shot, the user would raise his pistol vertically as he cocked the hammer back so as to let the fragments of the burst percussion cap fall out so as to not jam the mechanism. Some of the most popular cap-and-ball revolvers were the Colt Model 1851 \"Navy\" Model, 1860 \"Army\" Model, and Colt Pocket Percussion revolvers, all of which saw extensive use in the American Civil War. Although American revolvers were the most common, European arms makers were making numerous revolvers by that time as well, many of which found their way into the hands of the American forces, including the single action Lefaucheux and LeMat revolver and the Beaumont–Adams and Tranter revolvers, which were early double-action weapons, in spite of being muzzle-loaders.[7]\n\nA Smith & Wesson Model 1, 2nd Issue. This is a two patent date variety shown next to a period box of .22 short black powder cartridges.\n\nIn 1854, Eugene Lefaucheux introduced the Lefaucheux Model 1854, the first revolver to use self-contained metallic cartridges rather than loose powder, pistol ball, and percussion caps. It is a single-action, pinfire revolver holding six rounds.[8]\n\nOn November 17, 1856, Daniel B. Wesson and Horace Smith signed an agreement for the exclusive use of the Rollin White Patent at a rate of 25 cents for every revolver. Smith & Wesson began production late in 1857 and enjoyed years of exclusive production of rear-loading cartridge revolvers in America, due to their association with Rollin White, who held the patent[9] and vigorously defended it against any perceived infringement by other manufacturers (much as Colt had done with his original patent on the revolver). Although White held the patent, other manufacturers were able to sell firearms using the design, provided they were willing to pay royalties.[10][11]\n\nAfter White's patent expired in April 1869, a 3rd extension was refused. Other gun-makers were then allowed to produce their own weapons using the rear-loading method, without having to pay a royalty on each gun sold. Early guns were often conversions of earlier cap-and-ball revolvers, modified to accept metallic cartridges loaded from the rear, but later models, such as the Colt Model 1872 \"Open Top\" and the Smith & Wesson Model 3, were designed from the start as cartridge revolvers.[10]\n\nColt Single Action Army, serial No 5773 issued 7th Cavalry during the Indian War period.\n\nIn 1873, Colt introduced the famous Model 1873, also known as the Single Action Army, the \"Colt .45\" (not to be confused with Colt made models of the M1911 semi-automatic) or simply, \"the Peacemaker\", one of the most famous handguns ever made.[12] This popular design, which was a culmination of many of the advances introduced in earlier weapons, fired 6 metallic cartridges and was offered in over 30 different calibers and various barrel lengths. It is still in production, along with numerous clones and lookalikes, and its overall appearance has remained the same since 1873. Although originally made for the United States Army, the Model 1873 was widely distributed and popular with civilians, ranchers, lawmen, and outlaws alike. Its design has influenced countless other revolvers. Colt has discontinued its production twice, but brought it back due to popular demand and continues to make it to this day.\n\nIn the U.S. the traditional single-action revolver still reigned supreme until the late 19th century. In Europe, however, arms makers were quick to adopt the double-action trigger. While the US was producing weapons like the Model 1873, the Europeans were building double-action models like the French MAS Modèle 1873 and the somewhat later British Enfield Mk I and II revolvers (Britain relied on cartridge conversions of the earlier Beaumont–Adams double-action prior to this). Colt's first attempt at a double action revolver to compete with the European manufacturers was the Colt Model 1877, which earned lasting notoriety for its overly complex, expensive and fragile trigger mechanism, which in addition to failing frequently, also had a terrible trigger pull unless given the attentions of a competent gunsmith.\n\nIconic Smith & Wesson M&P revolver\n\nIn 1889, Colt introduced the Model 1889, the first truly modern double action revolver, which differed from earlier double action revolvers by having a \"swing-out\" cylinder, as opposed to a \"top-break\" or \"side-loading\" cylinder. Swing out cylinders quickly caught on, because they combined the best features of earlier designs. Top-break actions gave the ability to eject all empty shells simultaneously, and exposed all chambers for easy reloading, but having the frame hinged into two halves weakened the gun and negatively affected accuracy, due to lack of rigidity. \"Side-loaders\", like the earlier Colt Model 1871 and 1873, gave a rigid frame, but required the user to eject and load one chamber at a time, as they rotated the cylinder to line each chamber up with the side-mounted loading gate.[13] Smith & Wesson followed 7 years later with the ''Hand Ejector, Model 1896'' in .32 S&W Long caliber, followed by the very similar, yet improved, Model 1899 (later known as the Model 10), which introduced the new .38 Special cartridge. The Model 10 went on to become the best selling handgun of the 20th century, at 6,000,000 units, and the .38 Special is still the most popular chambering for revolvers in the world. These new guns were an improvement over the Colt 1889 design since they incorporated a combined center-pin and ejector rod to lock the cylinder in position. The 1889 did not use a center pin and the cylinder was prone to move out of alignment.[13]\n\nRevolvers have remained popular to the present day in many areas, although in the military and law enforcement, they have largely been supplanted by magazine-fed semi-automatic pistols such as the Beretta M9, especially in circumstances where reload time and higher cartridge capacity are deemed important.[14]\n\nPatents [ edit ]\n\nElisha Collier of Boston, Massachusetts patented a flintlock revolver in Britain in 1818, and significant numbers were being produced in London by 1822.[15] The origination of this invention is in doubt, as similar designs were patented in the same year by Artemus Wheeler in the United States and by Cornelius Coolidge in France.[16] Samuel Colt submitted a British patent for his revolver in 1835 and an American patent (number 138) on February 25, 1836 for a Revolving gun, and made the first production model on March 5 of that year.[17]\n\nAnother revolver patent was issued to Samuel Colt on August 29, 1839. The February 25, 1836 patent was then reissued as U.S. Patent RE00,124 entitled Revolving gun on October 24, 1848. This was followed by U.S. Patent 0,007,613 on September 3, 1850 for a Revolver, and by U.S. Patent 0,007,629 on September 10, 1850 for a Revolver. U.S. Patent 5,333,531 was issued to Roger C. Field for an economical device for minimizing the flash gap of a revolver between the barrel and the cylinder. In 1855, Rollin White patented the bored-through cylinder entitled Improvement in revolving fire-arms U.S. Patent 00,093,653. In 1856 Horace Smith & Daniel Wesson formed a partnership (S&W), developed and manufactured a revolver chambered for a self-contained metallic cartridge.[18]\n\nDesign [ edit ]\n\nDetails of a Schmidt M1882 , showing the hammer, chambers for the ammunition in the cylinder, and the mechanism to rotate the cylinder. Revolver of the Gendarmerie of Vaud , on display at Morges castle museum.\n\nA revolver works by having several firing chambers arranged in a circle in a cylindrical block that are brought into alignment with the firing mechanism and barrel one at a time. In contrast, other repeating firearms, such as bolt-action, lever-action, pump-action, and semi-automatic, have a single firing chamber and a mechanism to load and extract cartridges into it.[19]\n\nA single-action revolver requires the hammer to be pulled back by hand before each shot, which also revolves the cylinder. This leaves the trigger with just one \"single action\" left to perform - releasing the hammer to fire the shot - so the force and distance required to pull the trigger can be minimal. In contrast, with a self-cocking revolver, one long squeeze of the trigger pulls back the hammer and revolves the cylinder, then finally fires the shot. They can generally be fired faster than a single-action, but with reduced accuracy in the hands of most shooters.[19]\n\nMost modern revolvers are \"traditional double-action\", which means they may operate either in single-action or self-cocking mode. The accepted meaning of \"double-action\" has, confusingly, come to be the same as \"self-cocking\", so modern revolvers that cannot be pre-cocked are called \"double-action-only\".[19] These are intended for concealed carry, because the hammer of a traditional design is prone to snagging on clothes when drawn. Most revolvers do not come with accessory rails, which are used for mounting lights and lasers, except for the Smith & Wesson M&P R8 (.357 Magnum),[20] Smith & Wesson Model 325 Thunder Ranch (.45 ACP),[21] and all versions of the Chiappa Rhino (.357 Magnum, 9×19mm, .40 S&W, or 9×21mm) except for the 2\" model, respectively.[22] However, certain revolvers, such as the Taurus Judge and Charter Arms revolvers, can be fitted with accessory rails.[23]\n\nAdvertisement for Iver Johnson revolver claimed to be safe enough for babies to handle\n\nMost commonly, such revolvers have 5 or 6 chambers, hence the common names of \"six-gun\" or \"six-shooter\".[24] However, some revolvers have 7, 8, 9, or 10 chambers,[24] often depending on the caliber, and at least one revolver has 12 chambers (the US Fire Arms Model 12/22).[25] Each chamber has to be reloaded manually, which makes reloading a revolver a much slower procedure than reloading a semi-automatic pistol.[24]\n\nCompared to autoloading handguns, a revolver is often much simpler to operate and may have greater reliability.[24] For example, should a semiautomatic pistol fail to fire, clearing the chamber requires manually cycling the action to remove the errant round, as cycling the action normally depends on the energy of a cartridge firing.[24] With a revolver, this is not necessary as none of the energy for cycling the revolver comes from the firing of the cartridge, but is supplied by the user either through cocking the hammer or, in a double-action design, by just squeezing the trigger.[24] Another significant advantage of revolvers is superior ergonomics, particularly for users with small hands.[24] A revolver's grip does not hold a magazine, and it can be designed or customized much more than the grip of a typical semi-automatic.[24] Partially because of these reasons, revolvers still hold significant market share as concealed carry and home-defense weapons.[24]\n\nA revolver can be kept loaded and ready to fire without fatiguing any springs and is not very dependent on lubrication for proper firing.[24] Additionally, in the case of double-action-only revolvers there is no risk of accidental discharge from dropping alone, as the hammer is cocked by the trigger pull.[24] However, the revolver's clockwork-like internal parts are relatively delicate and can become misaligned after a severe impact, and its revolving cylinder can become jammed by excessive dirt or debris.[24]\n\nOver the long period of development of the revolver, many calibers have been used.[26] Some of these have proved more durable during periods of standardization and some have entered general public awareness. Among these are the .22 rimfire, a caliber popular for target shooting and teaching novice shooters; .38 Special and .357 Magnum, known for police use; the .44 Magnum, famous from Clint Eastwood's \"Dirty Harry\" films; and the .45 Colt, used in the Colt revolver of the Wild West. Introduced in 2003, the Smith & Wesson Model 500 is one of the most powerful revolvers, utilizing the .500 S&W Magnum cartridge.[27]\n\nBecause the rounds in a revolver are headspaced on the rim, some revolvers are capable of chambering more than one type of ammunition. The .44 Magnum round will chamber the shorter .44 Special and shorter .44 Colt, likewise the .357 Magnum will safely chamber .38 Special and .38 Short Colt. In 1996 a revolver known as the Medusa M47 was made that could chamber 25 different cartridges with bullet diameters between .355\" and .357\".[28]\n\nLeMat Revolver, an unusual pinfire cartridge model\n\nRevolver technology lives on in other weapons used by the military. Some autocannons and grenade launchers use mechanisms similar to revolvers, and some riot shotguns use spring-loaded cylinders holding up to 12 rounds.[29] In addition to serving as backup guns, revolvers still fill the specialized niche role as a shield gun; law enforcement personnel using a \"bulletproof\" gun shield sometimes opt for a revolver instead of a self-loading pistol, because the slide of a pistol may strike the front of the shield when fired. Revolvers do not suffer from this disadvantage. A second revolver may be secured behind the shield to provide a quick means of continuity of fire. Many police also still use revolvers as their duty weapon due to their relative mechanical simplicity and user friendliness.[30]\n\nWith the advancement of technology and design in 2010 major revolver manufacturers are coming out with polymer frame revolvers like the Ruger LCR, Smith & Wesson Bodyguard 38, and Taurus Protector Polymer. The new innovative design incorporates advanced polymer technology that lowers weight significantly, helps absorbs recoil, and strong enough to handle +P and .357 Magnum loads. The polymer is only used on the lower frame and joined to a metal alloy upper frame, barrel, and cylinder. Polymer technology is considered one of the major advancements in revolver history because the frame has always been metal alloy and mostly one piece frame design.[31]\n\nAnother recent development in revolver technology is the Rhino, a revolver introduced by Italian manufacturer Chiappa in 2009 and first sold in the U.S. in 2010. The Rhino, built with the U.S. concealed carry market in mind, is designed so that the bullet fires from the bottom chamber of the cylinder instead of the top chamber as in standard revolvers. This is intended to reduce muzzle flip, allowing for faster and more accurate repeat shots. In addition, the cylinder cross-section is hexagonal instead of circular, further reducing the weapon's profile.[22]\n\nLoading and unloading [ edit ]\n\nFront loading [ edit ]\n\nThe first revolvers were front loading (also referred to as muzzleloading), and were a bit like muskets in that the powder and bullet were loaded separately. These were caplocks or \"cap and ball\" revolvers, because the caplock method of priming was the first to be compact enough to make a practical revolver feasible. When loading, each chamber in the cylinder was rotated out of line with the barrel, and charged from the front with loose powder and an oversized bullet. Next, the chamber was aligned with the ramming lever underneath the barrel. Pulling the lever would drive a rammer into the chamber, pushing the ball securely in place. Finally, the user would place percussion caps on the nipples on the rear face of the cylinder.[7]\n\nAfter each shot, a user was advised to raise his revolver vertically while cocking back the hammer so as to allow the fragments of the spent percussion cap to fall out safely. Otherwise, the fragments could fall into the revolver's mechanism and jam it. Caplock revolvers were vulnerable to \"chain fires\", wherein hot gas from a shot ignited the powder in the other chambers. This could be prevented by sealing the chambers with cotton, wax, or grease.[32]\n\nLoading a cylinder in this manner was a slow and awkward process and generally could not be done in the midst of battle.[33] Some soldiers solved this by carrying multiple revolvers in the field. Another solution was to use a revolver with a detachable cylinder design. These revolvers allowed the shooter to quickly remove a cylinder and replace it with a full one.[19]\n\nFixed cylinder designs [ edit ]\n\nIn many of the first generation of cartridge revolvers (especially those that were converted after manufacture), the base pin on which the cylinder revolved was removed, and the cylinder taken from the revolver for loading. Most revolvers using this method of loading are single-action revolvers, although Iver Johnson produced double-action models with removable cylinders. The removable-cylinder design is employed in some modern \"micro-revolvers\" (usually in .22 caliber), in order to simplify their design. These weapons are small enough to fit in the palm of the hand.[31]\n\nLater single-action revolver models with a fixed cylinder used a loading gate at the rear of the cylinder that allowed insertion of one cartridge at a time for loading, while a rod under the barrel could be pressed rearward to eject the fired case.[34]\n\nThe loading gate on the original Colt designs (and on nearly all single-action revolvers since, such as the famous Colt Single Action Army) is on the right side, which was done to facilitate loading while on horseback; with the revolver held in the left hand with the reins of the horse, the cartridges can be ejected and loaded with the right hand.[35]\n\nBecause the cylinders in these types of revolvers are firmly attached at the front and rear of the frame, and the frame is typically full thickness all the way around, fixed cylinder revolvers are inherently strong designs. Accordingly, many modern large caliber hunting revolvers tend to be based on the fixed cylinder design. Fixed cylinder revolvers can fire the strongest and most powerful cartridges, but at the price of being the slowest to load and reload and they cannot use speedloaders or moon clips for loading, as only one chamber is exposed at a time to the loading gate.[36]\n\nTop break [ edit ]\n\nIn a top-break revolver, the frame is hinged at the bottom front of the cylinder. Releasing the lock and pushing the barrel down exposes the rear face of the cylinder. In most top-break revolvers, this act also operates an extractor that pushes the cartridges in the chambers back far enough that they will fall free, or can be removed easily. Fresh rounds are then inserted into the cylinder. The barrel and cylinder are then rotated back and locked in place, and the revolver is ready to fire.[19]\n\nTop break revolvers can be loaded more rapidly than fixed-frame revolvers, especially with the aid of a speedloader or moon clip. However, this design is much weaker and cannot handle high pressure rounds. While this design is mostly obsolete today, supplanted by the stronger yet equally convenient swing-out design, manufacturers have begun making reproductions of late 19th century designs for use in cowboy action shooting.[19]\n\nThe most commonly found top-break revolvers were manufactured by Smith & Wesson, Webley & Scott, Iver Johnson, Harrington & Richardson, Manhattan Fire Arms, Meriden Arms and Forehand & Wadsworth.[37]\n\nTip up [ edit ]\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 1 Third Issue open\n\nThe tip-up was the first revolver design for use with metallic cartridges in the Smith & Wesson Model 1, on which the barrel pivoted upwards, hinged on the forward end of the topstrap. On the S & W tip-up revolvers, the barrel release catch is located on both sides of the frame in front of the trigger. Smith & Wesson discontinued it in the third series of the Smith & Wesson Model 1 1/2 but it was fairly widely used in Europe in the 19th century, after a patent by Spirlet in 1870, which also included an ejector.[38]\n\nSwing out cylinder [ edit ]\n\nA swing-out cylinder revolver.\n\nThe most modern method of loading and unloading a revolver is by means of the swing out cylinder.[39] The cylinder is mounted on a pivot that is parallel to the chambers, and the cylinder swings out and down (to the left in most cases). An extractor is fitted, operated by a rod projecting from the front of the cylinder assembly. When pressed, it will push all fired rounds free simultaneously (as in top break models, the travel is designed to not completely extract longer, unfired rounds). The cylinder may then be loaded, singly or again with a speedloader, closed, and latched in place.[19]\n\nThe pivoting part that supports the cylinder is called the crane; it is the weak point of swing-out cylinder designs. Using the method often portrayed in movies and television of flipping the cylinder open and closed with a flick of the wrist can in fact cause the crane to bend over time, throwing the cylinder out of alignment with the barrel. Lack of alignment between chamber and barrel is a dangerous condition, as it can impede the bullet's transition from chamber to barrel. This gives rise to higher pressures in the chamber, bullet damage, and the potential for an explosion if the bullet becomes stuck.[40]\n\nThe shock of firing can exert a great deal of stress on the crane, as in most designs the cylinder is only held closed at one point, the rear of the cylinder. Stronger designs, such as the Ruger Super Redhawk, use a lock in the crane as well as the lock at the rear of the cylinder. This latch provides a more secure bond between cylinder and frame, and allows the use of larger, more powerful cartridges. Swing out cylinders are rather strong, but not as strong as fixed cylinders, and great care must be taken with the cylinder when loading, so as not to damage the crane.[40]\n\nOther designs [ edit ]\n\nOne unique design was designed by Merwin Hulbert in which the barrel and cylinder assembly were rotated 90° and pulled forward to eject shells from the cylinder.\n\nAction [ edit ]\n\nFrom Top: Replica of 1849 vintage. .44 Colt Revolving Holster Pistol (Dragoon); Colt Single Action Army Model 1873; Ruger (New Model) Super Blackhawk- Mid and late 20th Century.\n\nIn a single-action revolver, the hammer is manually cocked, usually with the thumb of the firing or supporting hand. This action advances the cylinder to the next round and locks the cylinder in place with the chamber aligned with the barrel. The trigger, when pulled, releases the hammer, which fires the round in the chamber. To fire again, the hammer must be manually cocked again. This is called \"single-action\" because the trigger only performs a single action, of releasing the hammer. Because only a single action is performed and trigger pull is lightened, firing a revolver in this way allows most shooters to achieve greater accuracy. Additionally, the need to cock the hammer manually acts as a safety. The Colt Paterson Revolver, the Walker Colt, the Colt's Dragoon and the Colt Single Action Army pistol of the American Frontier era are all good examples of this system.[19]\n\nIn double-action (DA), the stroke of the trigger pull generates two actions:\n\nThe hammer is pulled back to the cocked position which also indexes the cylinder to the next round. The hammer is released to strike the firing pin.\n\nThus, DA means that a cocking action separate from the trigger pull is unnecessary; every trigger pull will result in a complete cycle. This allows uncocked carry, while also allowing draw-and-fire using only the trigger. A longer and harder trigger stroke is the trade-off. However, this drawback can also be viewed as a safety feature, as the gun is safer against accidental discharges from being dropped.[19]\n\nMost double-action revolvers may be fired in two ways.[19]\n\nThe first way is single-action; that is, exactly the same as a single-action revolver; the hammer is cocked with the thumb, which indexes the cylinder, and when the trigger is pulled, the hammer is tripped. The second way is double-action, or from a hammer-down position. In this case, the trigger first cocks the hammer and revolves the cylinder, then trips the hammer at the rear of the trigger stroke, firing the round in the chamber.\n\nEnfield No. 2 Mk I* double-action-only revolver. Note the spurless hammer.\n\nCertain revolvers, called double-action-only (DAO) or, more correctly but less commonly, self-cocking, lack the latch that enables the hammer to be locked to the rear, and thus can only be fired in the double-action mode. With no way to lock the hammer back, DAO designs tend to have bobbed or spurless hammers, and may even have the hammer completely covered by the revolver's frame (i.e., shrouded or hooded). These are generally intended for concealed carrying, where a hammer spur could snag when the revolver is drawn. The potential reduction in accuracy in aimed fire is offset by the increased capability for concealment.[41]\n\nDA and DAO revolvers were the standard-issue sidearm of countless police departments for many decades. Only in the 1990s did the semiautomatic pistol begin to make serious inroads after the advent of safe actions. The reasons for these choices are the modes of carry and use. Double action is good for high-stress situations because it allows a mode of carry in which \"draw and pull the trigger\" is the only requirement—no safety catch release nor separate cocking stroke is required.[41]\n\nOther [ edit ]\n\nIn the cap-and-ball days of the mid 19th century, two revolver models, the English Tranter and the American Savage \"Figure Eight\", used a method whereby the hammer was cocked by the shooter’s middle finger pulling on a second trigger below the main trigger.\n\nIver Johnson made an unusual model from 1940 to 1947, called the Trigger Cocking Double Action. If the hammer was down, pulling the trigger would cock the hammer. If the trigger was pulled with the hammer cocked, it would then fire. This meant that to fire the revolver from a hammer down state, the trigger must be pulled twice.[42]\n\n3D printed revolver [ edit ]\n\nThe Zig zag revolver is a 3D printed .38 Revolver made public in May 2014.[43][44][44] It was created by a $500 3D-printer using plastic filament, but the name of the printer was not revealed by the creator.[44] It was created by a Japanese citizen from Kawasaki named Yoshitomo Imura[44] He was arrested in May 2014 after he had posted a video online of himself firing a 3D printed Zig Zag revolver.[43] It is the first 3D printed Japanese gun in the world which can discharge live cartridges.[44]\n\nUse with suppressors [ edit ]\n\nAs a general rule, revolvers cannot be effective with a sound suppressor (\"silencer\"), as there is usually a small gap between the revolving cylinder and the barrel which a bullet must traverse or jump when fired. From this opening, a rather loud report is produced. A suppressor can only suppress noise coming from the muzzle.[45]\n\nA suppressible revolver design does exist in the Nagant M1895, a Belgian designed revolver used by Imperial Russia and later the Soviet Union from 1895 through World War II. This revolver uses a unique cartridge whose case extends beyond the tip of the bullet, and a cylinder that moves forward to place the end of the cartridge inside the barrel when ready to fire. This bridges the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, and expands to seal the gap when fired. While the tiny gap between cylinder and barrel on most revolvers is insignificant to the internal ballistics, the seal is especially effective when used with a suppressor, and a number of suppressed Nagant revolvers have been used since its invention.[46]\n\nThere is a modern revolver of Russian design, the OTs-38,[47] which uses ammunition that incorporates the silencing mechanism into the cartridge case, making the gap between cylinder and barrel irrelevant as far as the suppression issue is concerned. The OTs-38 does need an unusually close and precise fit between the cylinder and barrel due to the shape of bullet in the special ammunition (Soviet SP-4), which was originally designed for use in a semi-automatic.\n\nAdditionally, the US Military experimented with designing a special version of the Smith & Wesson Model 29 for Tunnel Rats, called the Quiet Special Purpose Revolver or QSPR. Using special .40 caliber ammunition, it never entered official service.[48]\n\nAutomatic revolvers [ edit ]\n\nThe term \"automatic revolver\" has two different meanings, the first being used in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when \"automatic\" referred not to the operational mechanism of firing, but of extraction and ejection of spent casings. An \"automatic revolver\" in this context is one which extracts empty fired cases \"automatically,\" i.e., upon breaking open the action, rather than requiring manual extraction of each case individually with a sliding rod or pin (as in the Colt Single Action Army design). This term was widely used in the advertising of the period as a way to distinguish such revolvers from the far more common rod-extraction types.[49]\n\nIn the second sense, \"automatic revolver\" refers to the mechanism of firing rather than extraction. Double-action revolvers use a long trigger pull to cock the hammer, thus negating the need to manually cock the hammer between shots. The disadvantage of this is that the long, heavy pull cocking the hammer makes the double-action revolver much harder to shoot accurately than a single-action revolver (although cocking the hammer of a double-action reduces the length and weight of the trigger pull). A rare class of revolvers, called automatic for its firing design, attempts to overcome this restriction, giving the high speed of a double-action with the trigger effort of a single-action. The Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver is the most famous commercial example. It was recoil-operated, and the cylinder and barrel recoiled backwards to cock the hammer and revolve the cylinder. Cam grooves were milled on the outside of the cylinder to provide a means of advancing to the next chamber—half a turn as the cylinder moved back, and half a turn as it moved forward. .38 caliber versions held eight shots, .455 caliber versions six. At the time, the few available automatic pistols were larger, less reliable, and more expensive. The automatic revolver was popular when it first came out, but was quickly superseded by the creation of reliable, inexpensive semi-automatic pistols.[50]\n\nIn 1997, the Mateba company developed a type of recoil-operated automatic revolver, commercially named the Mateba Autorevolver, which uses the recoil energy to auto-rotate a normal revolver cylinder holding six or seven cartridges, depending on the model. The company has made several versions of its Autorevolver, including longer-barrelled and carbine variations, chambered for .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum and .454 Casull.[51]\n\nThe Pancor Jackhammer is a combat shotgun based on a similar mechanism to an automatic revolver. It uses a blow-forward action to move the barrel forward (which unlocks it from the cylinder) and then rotate the cylinder and cock the hammer.[52]\n\nRevolving long guns [ edit ]\n\nCircuit Judge carbine.\n\nRevolvers were not limited to handguns and as a longer barrelled arm is more useful in military applications than a sidearm, the idea was applied to both rifles and shotguns throughout the history of the revolver mechanism with mixed degrees of success.[53]\n\nRifles [ edit ]\n\nRevolving rifles were an attempt to increase the rate of fire of rifles by combining them with the revolving firing mechanism that had been developed earlier for revolving pistols. Colt began experimenting with revolving rifles in the early 19th century, making them in a variety of calibers and barrel lengths. Colt revolving rifles were the first repeating rifles adopted by the U.S. Government, but they had their problems. They were officially given to soldiers because of their rate of fire. But after firing six shots, the shooter had to take an excessive amount of time to reload. Also, on occasion Colt rifles discharged all their rounds at once, endangering the shooter. Even so, an early model was used in the Seminole Wars in 1838.[54][55] During the Civil War a LeMat Carbine was made based on the LeMat revolver.[56]\n\nShotguns [ edit ]\n\nColt briefly manufactured several revolving shotguns that were met with mixed success. The Colt Model 1839 Shotgun was manufactured between 1839 and 1841. Later, the Colt Model 1855 Shotgun, based on the Model 1855 revolving rifle, was manufactured between 1860 and 1863. Because of their low production numbers and age they are among the rarest of all Colt firearms.[57]\n\nThe Armsel Striker was a modern take on the revolving shotgun that held 10 rounds of 12 Gauge ammunition in its cylinder. It was copied by Cobray as the Streetsweeper.[14][58]\n\nTaurus manufactures a carbine variant of the Taurus Judge revolver along with its Australian partner company, Rossi known as the Taurus/Rossi Circuit Judge. It comes in the original combination chambering of .410 bore and .45 Long Colt, as well as the .44 Remington Magnum chambering. The rifle has small blast shields attached to the cylinder to protect the shooter from hot gases escaping between the cylinder and barrel.[59]\n\nCloseup of MTs255.\n\nThe MTs255 (Russian: МЦ255) is a shotgun fed by a 5-round internal revolving cylinder. It is produced by the TsKIB SOO, Central Design and Research Bureau of Sporting and Hunting Arms. They are available in 12, 20, 28 and 32 gauges, and .410 bore.\n\nLarger weapons [ edit ]\n\nThe Hawk MM-1, Milkor MGL, RG-6, and RGP-40 are grenade launchers that use a revolver action. Because the cylinders are much more massive, they use a spring-wound mechanism to index the cylinder.\n\nRevolver cannons use a motor-driven revolver-like mechanism to fire.\n\nSix gun [ edit ]\n\nA Six Gun is a revolver that holds six cartridges. The cylinder in a six gun is often called a 'wheel', and the six gun is itself often called a 'wheel gun'.[60][61] Although a \"Six Gun\" can refer to any six-chambered revolver, it is typically a reference to the Colt Single Action Army, or its modern look-alikes such as the Ruger Vaquero and Beretta Stampede.\n\nUntil the 1970s, when older-design revolvers such as Colt Single Action Armys and Ruger Blackhawks were re-engineered with drop safeties (such as firing pin blocks, hammer blocks, or transfer bars) that prevent the firing pin from contacting the cartridge's primer unless the trigger is pulled, safe carry required the hammer being positioned over an empty chamber, reducing the available cartridges from six to five, or, on some models, in between chambers on either a pin or in a groove for that purpose, thus keeping the full six rounds available. This kept the uncocked hammer from resting directly on the primer of a cartridge. If not used in this manner, the hammer rests directly on a primer and unintentional firing may occur if the gun is dropped or the hammer is struck. Some holster makers provided a thick leather thong to place underneath the hammer that both allowed the carry of a gun fully loaded with all six rounds and secured the gun in the holster to help prevent its accidental loss.\n\nSix guns are used commonly by Single-Action Shooting enthusiasts in shooting competitions, designed to mimic the gunfights of the Old West, and for general target shooting, hunting and personal defense.[62]\n\nNotable brands and manufacturers [ edit ]\n\nGallery [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

Wilson Defender Project at the University of Kansas where Craig works.\n\nTheir ensuing investigation turned up evidence that the other man lived in Kansas City, Kan., near where the suspect in the robbery was picked up at a drug house and taken to the Walmart in Roeland Park where the robbery was committed.\n\nThere was no DNA, fingerprint or any other kind of physical evidence that linked Jones to the crime.\n\nIt was only the testimony of eyewitnesses that prosecutors used to get the conviction against Jones.\n\nAnd eyewitness identification is widely recognized in legal circles as being unreliable.\n\nJones became the focus of the investigation after his picture was picked out of a police database three months after the crime by a man who was admittedly on drugs during his only encounter with Jones, according to court documents filed by the defense.\n\nThe lineup of photos subsequently shown to the victim and other witnesses was “highly suggestive,” his lawyers argued. The picture of Jones was the only one of the six photographs in the lineup that resembled the description of the robbery suspect, they maintained.\n\nAt trial, Jones presented an alibi defense that he was with his girlfriend and other family members in Kansas City on the day of the robbery.\n\nBut the victim and another witness identified him as the robber and the jury found him guilty of aggravated robbery.\n\nHe was sentenced to more than 19 years in prison.\n\nHe unsuccessfully appealed the conviction and sentence.\n\nBut after the innocence project attorneys showed the the pictures of the two men to the victim, two witnesses and the prosecutor in Jones’ case, all four said they could not tell the two men apart.\n\nLast December, Craig filed the legal action that led to his release Thursday.\n\n“Richard Jones has presented sufficient evidence to meet the under of manifest injustice (under Kansas law),” his attorneys said in their motion seeking his release. “Mr. Jones was convicted solely on eyewitness testimony that has been proven to be inherently flawed and unreliable.”\n\nCraig said that during his incarceration, Jones was understandably bitter and angry about being in prison for a crime he didn’t commit, but when he saw the picture of the other man, he understood how easily the witnesses could have been mistaken.\n\n“Everybody has a doppelganger,” Craig said. “Luckily we found his.”\n\nA GoFundMe page has been set up to help Jones as he adjusts to freedom.",

We played with good swagger and intensity.\"\n\nThis installment of the Garden State Hardwood Classic was a emotional classic indeed, as Rutgers captured the boardwalk plank trophy for the first time in its four-year history.\n\n\"The last three years, it's eluded me,\" Rutgers senior Mike Williams said, \"so it's the best feeling in the world.\"\n\nSanders (22 points and terrific defense) and Geo Baker (17 points, four rebounds and four assists) played to the equal of Seton Hall's star-studded foursome.\n\n\"I loved his defense,\" Pikiell said. \"We talked about taking his matchups personal. I thought he really had great poise down the stretch.\"\n\nSanders, who earned Joe Calabrese MVP honors for the rivalry game, gave Rutgers (10-3) its first lead, 65-63, with two free throws at the 2:22 mark and drained a jump shot to push the lead to four.\n\nThe freshly minted 1,000-point scorer let out a guttural scream at midcourt that couldn't be heard by anyone not within inches of him because the crowd noise drowned it out.\n\n\"When the place is rocking like this,\" Pikiell said, \"it's a tough place to play.\"\n\nTensions flared in the first half, but gave way to tense moments in the second.\n\nNone more so than when Seton Hall's Myles Powell's potential game-tying 3 from the wing with less than 10 seconds remaining rimmed in and out and Mike Williams skied for the rebound. He made 1-of-2 free throws to seal the upset.\n\n\"We're not out there to be friends, we're not out there to be buddy-buddy,\" Seton Hall's Ish Sanogo said of the trash talking. \"I don't like anybody on their team. That's how it's supposed to be.\"\n\nRutgers outscored Seton Hall, 22-7, at the free-throw line, with three times as many attempts (34-11). The home team was bailed out of bad spots by the whistle on a few occasions.\n\n\"I didn't have the whistle,\" Seton Hall coach Kevin Willard said when asked to explain the disparity.\n\nSeton Hall (9-2) was led by 18 points from Powell, 15 from Desi Rodriguez and 21 rebounds from Angel Delgado, who didn't get a double-double because he managed just seven points.\n\n\"We couldn't handle the pressure,\" Powell said.\n\nTrailing 51-41 with about 15 minutes to go, Rutgers missed four shots on one possession, including three from point-blank range by two different players and an air-balled jumper by a third.\n\nThose kind of missed opportunities could have haunted the Scarlet Knights, but the Pirates let up.\n\n\"When you have the enemy down and you have the foot on their neck,\" Seton Hall's Ish Sanogo said, \"keep your foot on their neck and crush their throats.\"\n\nFive minutes later, Rutgers tied the score at 52-52 on a one-handed dunk offensive rebound by Eugene Omoruyi as he ran through the lane un-boxed out from the top of the circle and a pull-up jumper from Baker.\n\nThen Rutgers slipped into a four-plus minute drought.\n\nBut Seton Hall responded with a 7-0 lead, starting with Powell's 3 to break a 54-54 tie. When Sanogo hit a baseline jump shot and blocked a shot at the other end, it felt like the game effectively was over.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nRutgers scored nine of the next 11 points to tie the score at 63-63 with 2:30 to play and the home team's fight song echoing.\n\nSanogo, a defensive wiz, was responsible for the nightmare shooting performance by Deshawn Freeman, who went 3-of-14 mostly around the cylinder. He had 16 rebounds.\n\nSeton Hall jumped out to a 13-6 by sinking five of its first nine shots and doubled up Rutgers, 26-13, midway through the first half.\n\nBaker drilled an off-balance shot clock-beating 3 but Rodriguez quickly answered with his own 3 as the seconds ticked away. He turned and put his finger to his lips to \"Shhh\" the student section.\n\nMoments later, Khadeen Carrington drove the lane for a basket and a foul, flexing his muscles toward a cluster of Seton Hall fans.\n\nCast as an antagonist, Rodriguez played the role perfectly. He chirped at players during dead balls and picked up a double technical with Omoruyi in the first half, getting under the skin of opponents and fans alike.\n\nWhen Rutgers made a run to close to 31-25, Seton Hall called a timeout and the RAC exploded as Oasis' 90s hit \"Wonderwall\" had bouncing students shaking their seats.\n\nThey still were until the final minute of the half, when Seton Hall closed with back-to-back baskets, including a reverse jam in the open-court by Myles Cale to suck out the energy and open up a 42-32 lead.\n\nIt was a fitting end to a half played at the kind of frenzied pace that greatly favors Seton Hall. The Pirates shot 47.2 percent and held Rutgers to 36.4 percent.\n\nFastbreaks still were aplenty in the second half, but points were harder to come by, which is the ugly style that often suits the underdog in rivalries.\n\nThe glass is supposed to be a strength of poor-shooting Rutgers, which came into the game leading the nation in rebounds and offensive rebounds.\n\nBut, just like last year, Seton Hall offset Rutgers' strength because of Delgado's rebounding prowess.\n\nThere were signs of the game's importance before tip-off: Rutgers athletics director Pat Hobbs was at the end of the layup line shaking hands, Delgado gave a firm forearm to the armored Scarlet Knight when he got in the way of Seton Hall's layup line, and Rutgers played intentionally loud and disruptive opera music over the PA system when Seton Hall was on the court alone.\n\nCalabrese, the MVP trophy's namesake, was a longtime New Jersey sportswriter, including for The Star-Ledger, who covered Rutgers athletics for more than 40 years until his death in 1999.\n\nRyan Dunleavy may be reached at rdunleavy@njadvancemedia.com.

  "latent_20000": "Image copyright Michael Osadciw/University of Rochester Image caption Scholz's star - shown in this artist's impression - is currently 20 light-years away. But it once came much closer\n\nAn alien star passed through our Solar System just 70,000 years ago, astronomers have discovered.\n\nNo other star is known to have approached this close to us.\n\nAn international team of researchers says it came five times closer than our current nearest neighbour - Proxima Centauri.\n\nThe object, a red dwarf known as Scholz's star, cruised through the outer reaches of the Solar System - a region known as the Oort Cloud.\n\nScholz's star was not alone; it was accompanied on its travels by an object known as a brown dwarf. These are essentially failed stars that lacked the necessary mass to get fusion going in their cores.\n\nThe findings are published in Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nObservations of the dim star's trajectory suggest that 70,000 years ago this cosmic infiltrator passed within 0.8 light years of the Sun. By comparison, Proxima Centauri is 4.2 light years away.\n\nClose encounter\n\nIn the paper, astronomers led by Eric Mamajek at the University of Rochester, New York, say they are 98% certain that Scholz's star travelled through what is known as the \"outer Oort Cloud\" - a region at the edge of the Solar System filled with trillions of comets a mile or more across.\n\nThis region is like a spherical shell around the Solar System and may extend out to as much as 100,000 Astronomical Units, or AU (one AU is the distance between the Earth and the Sun).\n\nThe Oort Cloud is thought to give rise to long-period comets that can swing past the Sun when their orbits are disturbed.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The Oort Cloud in perspective: 1 Astronomical Unit (AU) represents the distance from the Earth to the Sun\n\nTo determine the trajectory of the star, the researchers needed two pieces of information: the change in distance from the Sun to the star (its radial velocity) and the star's motion across the sky (its tangential velocity).\n\nScholz's star currently lies 20 light years away - making it a fairly nearby system. But it showed very slow tangential motion for a star this close. This indicated that it was either moving away from us or towards a future close encounter with the Solar System.\n\nThe radial velocity measurements confirmed that the binary star system was actually speeding away from us. By tracing its movements back in time, they found its close shave with the Sun occurred some 70,000 years ago.\n\nGrand theft Oort-o?\n\nA star passing through the Oort Cloud could potentially play gravitational havoc with the orbits of comets there, sending them on trajectories into the inner Solar System. But Dr Mamajek believes the effects of Scholz's star on our cosmic neighbourhood were \"negligible\".\n\n\"There are trillions of comets in the Oort cloud and likely some of them were perturbed by this object,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"But so far it seems unlikely that this star actually triggered a significant 'comet shower'.\"\n\nThe effect of a passing star on the Oort Cloud is a function of the star's mass, speed and proximity. The worst case scenario for stirring up comets would be a slow-moving, massive star that came close to the Sun.\n\nScholz's star came relatively close, but the binary system (the red dwarf and its brown dwarf companion) has a low mass and it was speeding by. These factors conspired to make its effect on the Oort Cloud very small.\n\nWhile this is the closest flyby detected so far, Dr Mamajek thinks it's not uncommon for alien stars to buzz the Sun. He says a star probably passes through the Oort Cloud every 100,000 years, or so.\n\nBut he suggests an approach as close - or closer - than that made by Scholz's star is somewhat rarer. Dr Mamajek said mathematical simulations show such an event occurs on average about once every nine million years.\n\n\"So it is a bit of a strange coincidence that we happen to have caught one that passed so close within the past 100,000 years or so,\" he said.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter.",

  "latent_20202": "We are at the most significant reality-altering crossroads we have ever been at in recorded history. Never has the future been such an uncertainty as it is in this time of great transition. While there are some incredibly pessimistic, yet possible scenarios that are being predicted based on current trends, there are also many astonishingly inspiring ones that, if accelerated, would lead to a thriving bright future that we would all like to be a part of.\n\nInfinite Growth on a Finite Planet\n\nDoing the same things we have been doing since the emergence of the Industrial Revolution will not get us to this bright future. Yes, it has gotten us this far (albeit with a tremendous deal of suffering for many peoples), but to get to a sustainable and peaceful future, a new worldview needs to guide us there. A more conscious paradigm that takes into account the effects of our causes is critical.\n\nWe may never have another opportunity like this again. Let’s say there was a total collapse of everything…a second Industrial Revolution will not be possible as it was before considering a majority of fossil fuels that were easily accessible are long gone. Humans have been going deeper and deeper into the earth and farther into regions of the planet that were not previously exploited in order to obtain energy and material to continue feeding a consumption-focused vision of infinite growth on a finite planet.\n\nIt may be difficult or impossible to see a fundamental shift into a global transpersonal consciousness 100 years from now given how powerful and strong the unsustainable and destructive systems in our society are.\n\nTo hesitate now by putting Band-Aids on old systems that don’t work could be fatal for our entire species. Why take that risk when we have alternatives?\n\nThe Courage to Shine\n\nWe have difficulty dwelling outside of our comfort zones, and so we put off making major changes in our lives and in society as a whole. However, to be courageous is to be a luminary. Courage allows us to be leaders in our personal lives, and in doing so we all lead ourselves collectively toward a more enlightened future where we do away with systems and actions that are destroying our connection to each other and to the only place in the universe we can call home, our planet Earth.\n\nOur daily choices are deciding what the fate of humanity and the fate of a habitable Earth will be. Our personal choices in what we choose to focus on and give our energy to, as well as what we decide to support with our dollar, are in our power to control and change.\n\nThe Internet allows us to look up and research anything and everything, making it incredibly easy to become conscious of what we are supporting by our actions. That shirt we got on sale that we liked? With a little digging it turns out it was made by child slaves in Malaysia. Now knowing this, we avoid indirectly supporting that system of suffering by choosing a cruelty-free alternative.\n\nTools for the Journey\n\nWe can stop much of the injustice in the world whose trends are leading to a very grim and dystopian future. We have incredible tools today to do so, and if we combine them with the courage to be bold and stand up for the vision of a better world then we will transition into a world that is not in constant crisis mode. We will have helped usher in the dawn of a day where we are living in balance, harmony, and coherence with ourselves, each other, and the Earth.\n\nWhy not give peace a chance when peace is the only chance we have for a bright future? Are we unconsciously keeping the shackles on ourselves? Maybe we are.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, we construct filters to block out anything that doesn’t match our own worldview so that our brains don’t hurt from cognitive dissonance.\n\nWe see what we want to see, hear what we want to hear, and believe what we want to believe. This is not a recipe for an enlightened humanity.\n\nTo paraphrase what Jean Jacques Rousseau famously once said, we are all born free yet everywhere we are enslaved by our own choosing. Being aware of this unconscious process is the first step towards changing it, and with changing ourselves comes global change. Individual mindfulness leads to global awakening. The epigenetic imprint will pass on to future generations and potentially lead to a time when mindfulness becomes part of our inherent nature.\n\nFacing Our Shadows\n\nBefore a global awakening can fully occur, we must be aware of and address the shadows. If we do not face our shadows – those traits and aspects of ourselves we suppress and deny – we will remain imprisoned as a result of our own self-deceptions. Facing the shadows isn’t easy by any means, and this is the primary demotivator to do so.\n\nHowever, by building up the courage, will, and determination – when we understand what’s at stake – we can begin, little by little, confronting those aspects we wish would go away and resolve them properly so they do not plague us anymore. It takes a great deal of courage, but if we don’t face the shadows they will follow us until the day we die.\n\nYou cannot run away from your shadow, but you can shine a light on it and make it disappear.\n\nThe shadow aspects of ourselves will continue to keep us at war with ourselves, each other, and our planet if we do not face them and deal with them. If we liberate ourselves, we liberate the world. There is nobody on Earth who can do your growth work for you. However, many can help guide you and show you how you can experience a personal transformation. With humans being a social species, we actually cannot do it all alone. We can always find help in the support of others. We are interdependent. We can accomplish a good deal alone, but we can accomplish far more together. Building a better world starts with understanding that we are all in this together.\n\nBalancing Masculine & Feminine\n\nIn order to see this better world become a reality, there is a very important balance that needs to arise and become engrained in the social consciousness first: the balance between the masculine and the feminine.\n\nFor far too long the balance of power and energy in human society and culture has been strongly tipped towards competitive alpha male rule.\n\nWhat we see is the dark side of masculine energy controlling the nature of things. However, a recent recalibration of masculine and feminine energies has been arising into view. The old models of male dominance and female subservience are starting to no longer apply.\n\nAuthor Herb Goldberg, PhD has been studying the male-dominating paradigm and has found that women are more open to personal growth than men. My own observations, when I look at who is following my social media pages and buying my book, have seen the same thing.\n\nWhile it sounds great that women are so interested in bettering themselves and transforming their lives, there’s a catch: Women cannot be truly free from gender traps until men are free from gender traps. Seeing women as objects of desire is one of the most common traps men fall into, which continues the old paradigm and bars us from living in an enlightened society.\n\nFor women, seeing men as objects of success is a common trap that has to stop if we would like to live in a more egalitarian, equal, and balanced world. Thankfully, both men and women are becoming more frequently aware and mindful of these traps, and we can see some incredible cultural and societal shifts in recent years. The balance is coming back in certain areas, but there is still plenty of work to be done in others.\n\nChange Yourself to Change the World\n\nYet even so, we are increasingly claiming our inherent power to change the world by changing ourselves first. At the crossroads that we as a human family are at right now, we cannot afford to be lackadaisical. Why postpone an ascension into an enlightened society? Why keep looking beyond ourselves for saviors? Doing so only reinforces the authority addiction that has caused so much suffering in our past and is still causing in our present. Our interdependence and interconnected unity empowers us more than we could imagine. We have the total freedom to mold our world however we wish if we do so cooperatively…and this cooperation comes when we understand fundamental truths about what life is.\n\nWe can look to the 2,500 year-old wisdom of Confucius when he said:\n\nTo put the world in order, we must first put the nation in order; to put the nation in order, we must put the family in order; to put the family in order, we must cultivate our personal life; and to cultivate our personal life, we must first set our hearts right.\n\nThe inner world must be well adjusted if we wish to see the outer world well adjusted. Everything that we say, think, and do collectively creates the world in which we find ourselves existing. If everyone became mindful and stopped themselves before they acted or reacted in a way that causes suffering to someone else, we would see the transformation into a conscious global society immediately. Of course, this will likely not happen as we idealistically envision it, but if there is a growing number of us practicing mindfulness every day throughout the day, then we will see an acceleration into a world that resembles a consciously evolved global family. We will have finally grown up.\n\nIt may seem daunting and unattainable for humanity to restore and shift into balance with itself and its environment given the state of things in the world today. We may feel as if we are just one person out of billions with very little power to change the deeply-embedded issues within our collective consciousness. Yes you are one person, but you are an agent of change nonetheless.\n\nAn inspiring excerpt from Lama Zopa Rinpoche’s practices for children shows us how we can do our part, no matter how small it may seem to be, in order to bring about the change we wish to see in the world.\n\nMay we practice kindness day and night, forever, not only towards friends, but also to strangers, and especially to perceived enemies; not only towards human beings, but also to animals and other beings who want happiness and don´t want to suffer. May we constantly enjoy our lives by rejoicing. May we constantly enjoy happiness by rejoicing in all the positive things that bring benefit to others and to ourselves. And may we especially rejoice when we see all the good things that happen to others.\n\nA Collective Process\n\nEven though you are one person, you can make a difference. A global awakening into an evolved humanity is a collective process. There is no one person or group that will take us there. Each one of us is responsible to do our part, in consciously evolving ourselves, in order to transition our collective transpersonal consciousness into the dreams of our future, away from the history of our past.\n\nCooperation will be the key to our success as a species on this planet, if we wish to not only have a future at all, but to have one where we thrive and develop an enlightened way of life that seems light years ahead of where we are now. If we help each other awaken to see, feel, and understand the intricate and intimate interconnected wholeness of all things, of all systems, then we will reach the shores of our enlightenment. Can we do it? Of course we can. Will we do it? That’s up to us. Let’s make it happen. Our planet is still habitable, but let’s not take it for granted…let’s ensure it stays that way so we have a place to see our collective evolution into a humanity in harmony with itself and its home planet.",

REUTERS/Mike Theiler\n\n(Reuters) - The race for Virginia attorney general could be headed for a recount as the preliminary vote tally on Wednesday showed the Democratic candidate with a razor-thin lead that could allow his Republican rival to call for an appeal.\n\nRepublican state Senator Mark Obenshain of Harrisonburg finished 541 votes behind Democratic state Senator Mark Herring of Leesburg out of 2.17 million cast in the Tuesday polls, according to unofficial state election board figures.\n\nState law provides for an appeal of election results if the margin of victory is no more than 1 percent. Obenshain’s margin is less than one-tenth that.\n\nObenshain said he would wait until the state election board completes its tabulations before deciding whether to seek a recount, a step he would be allowed by law to take after the election board meets on November 25 to formally tally and announce the results.\n\n“We’re going to wait until the State Board of Elections finishes its tabulations and make any further decisions at that time,” Obenshain said of a possible recount in a statement.\n\nA win by Obenshain would give the Republican party its only statewide victory in the 2013 election.

  "latent_20428": "Composite drawings of the Golden State Killer, otherwise known as the East Area Rapist/Original Night Stalker.\n\nCourtesy Los Angeles magazine\n\nCrime is Slate’s crime blog. Like us on Facebook, and follow us on Twitter @slatecrime.\n\nIf you’re diligent enough, you can use the Internet to find just about anything: a good job, a bug-free used mattress, a roommate who will let you drink all his beer. But how about a long-dormant serial killer? Los Angeles magazine just published a good story about a group of amateur online detectives who have become obsessed with identifying a man suspected of committing 50 sexual assaults and 10 murders across California in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The police call him EAR/ONS—a clumsy combination of “East Area Rapist” and “Original Night Stalker” that sounds less like the name of a fearsome killer than of a jewelry manufacturer. The article’s author, Michelle McNamara, proposes a better monicker: the Golden State Killer.\n\nMcNamara, a blogger and freelance writer, is one of the many homemade criminologists who spend their free time scouring the Internet, trying to solve cold cases. “By day I’m a 42-year-old stay-at-home mom with a sensible haircut and Goldfish crackers lining my purse,” she writes. “In the evening, however, I’m something of a DIY detective.” Many of these DIY detectives congregate at the online message boards for a television show called Cold Case Files, an A+E program that was cancelled in 2006. Others flock to The Doe Network (“There is no time limit to solving a mystery”), a website devoted to identifying missing persons and investigating cold cases, or another site called websleuths.com. While their methods may be unorthodox, they occasionally get results—the Doe Network claims that its members have solved or helped solve more than 66 cases, most recently helping to identify the remains of Peggy Sue Houser, who went missing in 1981.\n\nThere’s nothing new about amateur detectives. They’re everywhere in fiction: Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple, the kid from Cop and a Half. The real-life Vidocq Society is a mystery-solving club comprised of prosecutors, coroners, criminal profilers, and other subject-matter experts; they’ve helped solve numerous cold cases over the club’s 23-year history. The common thread here is that the amateurs are somehow smarter or more perceptive than their professional counterparts. That’s the value-add.\n\nFrom what I can tell, most Internet sleuths aren’t trained investigators or preternaturally perceptive polymaths; they’re just homebodies with a lot of time on their hands. There are “a spectrum of personality types on the message board,” writes McNamara, “from paranoid cranks to the raw, curious insomniacs driven by the same compulsion to piece together the puzzle as I am.” Their value-add, in other words, is diligence, the patience and commitment needed to investigate every potential lead, no matter how seemingly irrelevant. They do the tasks that actual investigators could never do, either because they lack the time or because the tasks make no sense.\n\nMcNamara writes about “tracking down every detail I could about a member of the 1972 Rio Americano High School water polo team, because in the yearbook photo he appeared lean and to have big calves, maybe the same big calves that the Golden State Killer’s earlier victims had identified.” She mentions a message-board member she calls “The Kid,” who has “spent 4,000 hours scouring everything from old directories to yearbooks to online data aggregators” in order to assemble a 118-page, 2,000-name-strong “master list” of possible suspects. Another woman, dubbed “the Social Worker,” once invited a potential suspect out to dinner, and then swiped his water bottle for DNA testing. Eat your heart out, kid from Cop and a Half.\n\nYou can see how all this effort might have some value. You can also see how it might be incredibly annoying to legitimate investigators. McNamara mentions one “agitator” who recently visited the message board and compared its members to Walter Mitty, the James Thurber character who compensates for his humdrum life by inventing an elaborate fantasy world. McNamara doesn’t take any offense. “By then I was convinced one of the Mittys was probably going to solve this thing,” she writes.\n\nHer article, however, isn’t very convincing on that point. The amateur sleuths on the Golden State Killer’s trail come across as harmless at best and frustratingly incompetent at worst. Their leads never seem to pan out. The story opens with McNamara online late one night, elated to have located a pair of cufflinks she believes the killer may have taken from one of his victims in 1977. “I bought them immediately, paying $40 for overnight delivery, and went to wake my husband. ‘I think I found him,’ I said.” She was wrong.\n\n“What drew us to this mystery,” writes McNamara, “was that it can be solved.” But the best new evidence mentioned in the story—a hand-drawn map the Golden State Killer may have left at a crime scene in 1978—has nothing whatsoever to do with the message board community. Instead, investigators found it stored away in a police property room. That map is now up on the Los Angeles website, alongside a bunch of other data pertaining to the case—a timeline of the killer’s crimes, a sample of his handwriting, an ostensible voice recording—in hopes of maybe crowdsourcing a solution.\n\nIt might work. While I doubt that any of these online detectives will solve the case on their own, it’s possible that something good may come from presenting this material to a broader audience. Call it the America’s Most Wanted strategy. Cold cases go cold for lack of resources, evidence, and interest. Online detectives can help somewhat with the first two. But perhaps they do the most good by stoking public and professional interest in cases that might otherwise go forgotten.",

  "latent_20557": "Under Armor’s Kevin Plank, second from right, attended a meeting with President Trump, other business leaders and White House officials in January. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nUnder Armour CEO Kevin Plank became the second business leader Monday to step down from President Trump’s American Manufacturing Council, following Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier. Whereas Frazier strongly signaled that his resignation came in reaction to the weekend events in Charlottesville and the president’s response, Plank issued a more vague statement about his decision.\n\n“I am appreciative of the opportunity to have served, but have decided to step down from the council,” Plank said. “I love our country and our company and will continue to focus my efforts on inspiring every person that they can do anything through the power of sport which promotes unity, diversity and inclusion.”\n\nI love our country & company. I am stepping down from the council to focus on inspiring & uniting through power of sport. – CEO Kevin Plank pic.twitter.com/8YvndJMjj1 — Under Armour (@UnderArmour) August 15, 2017\n\nAfter meeting with the president on the latter’s first full day in office in January, Plank received some criticism in February, when he described Trump as “an asset.” Warriors guard Steph Curry, one of Under Armour’s most high-profile endorsers, said, “I agree with that description, if you remove the ‘et.’ ”\n\nThe company subsequently issued a statement in which it said, “We engage in policy, not politics.” Under Armour added, “We have teammates from different religions, races, nationalities, genders and sexual orientations; different ages, life experiences and opinions.\n\n“This is the core of our company. At Under Armour, our diversity is our strength, and we will continue to advocate for policies that Protect Our House, our business, our team, and our community.”\n\nTrump received widespread criticism for failing to specifically rebuke white nationalists while a rally in Charlottesville, was underway. After a driver who reportedly espoused racist and pro-Nazi views killed a woman and injured 19 others, Trump condemned “the egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,” repeating, “On many sides.”\n\nOn Monday, Trump denounced “the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups,” saying “Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs.”\n\n“America’s leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy,” Frazier said. “As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.”\n\nTrump was quick to attack Frazier on Twitter, saying, “Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President’s Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!” At a meeting with pharmaceutical executives in July, Trump had described Frazier as one of “the great, great leaders of business in this country.”\n\nUnlike his response to the resignation of Frazier, who is among the few African American chief executives of Fortune 500 companies, Trump had nothing to say publicly about Plank’s decision. “Under Armour engages in innovation and sports, not politics,” Plank said in his statement.\n\nPlank and Frazier were followed by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, who also announced he would leave the group, saying he “resigned because I want to make progress, while many in Washington seem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them.” Meanwhile, Curry seemed pretty happy about something.\n\n✌ — Stephen Curry (@StephenCurry30) August 15, 2017\n\nRead more:\n\n‘This is bigger than me’: Seahawks’ Michael Bennett sits for national anthem before preseason game\n\nTiger Woods reportedly had THC, four other drugs in system at time of arrest\n\nEzekiel Elliott’s appeal will argue ex-girlfriend threatened to ruin his career",

  "latent_20590": "In honor of the 20th anniversary of the now-classic gender-equality document, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action [pdf], and of the current meeting of the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women, UN Women has released a summary review [pdf] of the status of women since Beijing hosted the Fourth World Conference on Women. One of the areas it covers is female genital mutilation (FGM), which, the report explains, occurs as a result of “gender inequality and discriminatory, social, cultural and religious norms.”\n\nAlthough FGM has declined proportionally in the 29 African countries where it is most frequently practiced, the total number of cases may still be increasing due to population growth. And in the United States, too, FGM is on the rise. A Population Reference Bureau report released in February attributes the rise in U.S. risk to the increase in immigrants from countries where the practice remains prevalent.\n\nLast month, the Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) Act of 2015 was introduced by U.S. Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) and Joseph Crowley (D-NY). The new legislation calls for a multi-agency plan to prevent FGM. While many in the United States may think this is something happening in the far reaches of the world, it is a real and present danger for nearly half a million girls and women in the United States. Unless we move now to stop it in our own backyard, we are inadvertently supporting a form of culture-sanctioned child abuse.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is the partial or total removal of the external genitals of girls and women for cultural or other nonmedical reasons. The procedure is widely recognized as a violation of human rights and is almost always carried out on minors between infancy and age 15. The U.N. recognizes that FGM represents “persistent discrimination against and a violation of the rights of the girl child.”\n\nFGM has been illegal in the U.S. since 1996. In 2013, President Obama signed a travel provision into law, making it illegal to “knowingly transport a girl out of the U.S. for the purpose of inflicting FGM.” Twenty-three states [pdf] have laws against the practice. Twenty-seven still don’t. Many of us know what FGM is, but most of us lack an awareness of what our country or state is or isn’t doing to protect girls who live here.\n\nIt’s time we find out. My home state, Massachusetts, is where girls are at the 12th highest risk for FGM, based on calculations made by the Population Reference Bureau [pdf]. Boston has the 10th highest risk for metropolitan areas [pdf] in the United States. The Population Reference Bureau report released this month attributes a rise in U.S. risk to the increase in the number of immigrants from countries where the practice is prevalent. Massachusetts lawmakers have recently joined the crusade to end this violence against girls by introducing a bill to criminalize FGM within the state and to ban out-of-state travel to have the ritual done. This out-of-state travel is why girls in MA are at risk—because their families have them leave the U.S. for “vacation cutting.” As Massachusetts state Rep. Sarah Peake told the State House News Service,\n\nThey’re sending their daughters back to their home countries, and it’s not just for a visit with grandma and grandpa, but to have this disfiguring and brutal procedure done.\n\nTo be sure, there are those who support FGM, touting religious beliefs or cultural norms and health benefits, but according to the World Health Organization, “no religious scripts prescribe the practice” and there are no health benefits. There are myths that a woman will be healthier, cleaner or more attractive to her spouse after mutilation. Some cultures believe it preserves a girl’s virginity and prevents promiscuity after marriage. In many communities, a girl is deemed unfit for marriage unless she has been cut. According to the World Health Organization, FGM “can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, cysts, infections, infertility as well as complication in childbirth and increased risk of newborn deaths,” not to mention lifelong trauma. It is generally performed without anesthetic. In extreme cases, called, “infibulations,” the clitoris is removed and the vagina is sewn up leaving a small opening for urination and menstruation. Some girls even die.\n\nIf this isn’t child abuse, then I’m not sure what is.\n\nThough most African countries have banned the practice, it is ingrained in some cultures, and is often carried out by women. By supporting female genital mutilation, family harbors the big, bad wolf. FGM is a misunderstood part of a patriarchal structure that undermines children’s rights.\n\nEnforcing the law is critical, but education for communities and families is just as important. In Massachusetts, February 1 through February 7 is now FGM Awareness Week. The new Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation Act and the Massachusetts bill both call for public awareness campaigns. The Massachusetts bill includes law enforcement trainings, education to communities and support for victims. Families need to understand that FGM serves no medical purpose; the true aim is to control a girl’s sexuality, make her “marriage material,” and keep her “honorable.” U.N. Women reports that in order to stop FGM we must “confront and address the social norms and stereotypes that perpetuate gender inequality, discrimination, and violence against women and girls.”\n\nContact your U.S. legislators and encourage them to support H.R. 783, The Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation Act. If you are a Massachusetts resident, you can contact your local legislators and ask them to support H.D. 1765 to criminalize FGM and increase awareness of the health risks, emotional trauma and criminal penalties. To learn more about the fight to end Female Genital Mutilation, check out the United Nations Population Fund, SafeHands for Mothers, Equality Now and Massachusetts Citizens for Children (MassKids).\n\nFive hundred thousand girls and women should not be forced to be cut, regardless of tradition.\n\n“No FGM” symbol from Flickr user Blatant World under license from Creative Commons 2.0\n\nMadeline Smola is a writer, award-winning abuse-prevention advocate, playwright, a Heroine of the Massachusetts Commission on the Status of Women and a child-abuse survivor.

  "latent_20622": "Many women engineers1 earn less than their male counterparts and the pay gap widens as years of experience increases, according to a recent analysis of more than 4,700 salary reports submitted anonymously on Glassdoor.com by people in the engineering field, of which 70% are male and 30% are female. The analysis revealed that women engineers earn 96.7% of what men earn early in their careers (0-3 years experience), and earn 89.1% of what their male counterparts earn when both genders have more than 10 years experience. This means that the average compensation for a male engineer with less than three years of experience is $70,533 while women with the same experience earn less ($68,237). For those with 10 or more years, men make an average of $111,877 while women typically make $99,733. That can easily equate to hundreds of thousands of dollars throughout a career.\n\nBonus Gap is Bigger\n\nThe analysis also broke out bonuses from total pay and discovered that the gap is wider for bonus pay outs. The most significant gap is seen for those with between four to six years of experience when women’s bonuses are almost half (51.41%) of their male counterparts and for those with more than 10 years of experience when women typically make 57.62% of the bonuses paid to men.\n\nThe Glassdoor results seem to confirm the 2007 Behind the Pay Gap study by the AAUW that also found a pay gap that starts at the entry level and expands as the careers progress. As the AAUW reports women, one year after having graduated college, earn 80 percent as much as their male counterparts but after 10 years of experience, women earn 69 percent when compared to males with the same amount of experience. The AAUW figures looks at a cross section of industries where career choice may influence pay whereas Glassdoor has isolated engineering jobs specifically.\n\nLocation plays a part in engineering pay inequities\n\nThe AAUW also reported variances in gender pay when looked at by location. Based on Glassdoor data, the average pay gap for women engineers also varies by metropolitan area:\n\nGlassdoor Report: Gender pay gap in top 5 cities with the most female engineers City Male Engineer Annual Pay Female Engineer Annual Pay Female Pay as % of Male 1 New York $103,398 $95,881 92.7% 2 San Diego $96,569 $85,030 88.1% 3 San Jose $118,040 $102,799 86.9% 4 Austin $95,287 $82,800 86.9% 5 Seattle $102,566 $79,596 77.6%\n\nWhen looking at the top 5 cities with the most female engineers, we found that female engineers fared best in New York, where they earned on average 92.7% of their male counterparts. The largest pay gap was seen in Seattle where female engineers typically earn just 77.6% of their male counterparts.\n\nEmployers with high percentage of female engineers\n\nThe analysis also looked at which companies represented on Glassdoor.com employ the highest percentage of female engineers, which is not a number typically reported on company career websites. We found familiar names such as Northrop Grumman , Dell, GE Healthcare, Apple had the highest reported % of female engineer salaries on Glassdoor.\n\nClosing the Gap – Everyone can Help\n\nWhile this analysis doesn’t give us insight into other factors that could be at play within companies and markets that might account for the gap, it does raise important issues and questions that women engineers can use to have conversations with their supervisors and human resource representatives. This type of disparity is why transparency around compensation is so vital, especially in light of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, signed by President Obama on January 29, 2009. The Ledbetter Act only gives remedy to discovered acts of inequity. The challenge, of course, is first being able to determine whether or not inequity exists. This is extremely difficult today and why contributing anonymously on Glassdoor can help bring gaps to light and ensure pay – if all things (education, experience, performance) are equal — is more equitable around the globe. Stay tuned for tips from Glassdoor.com career expert and former HR executive on how to raise inequity concerns.\n\nIn the meantime, we’d love to hear from male and female engineers and managers –or any professional — about whether you think gender pay gaps exist in your organization.\n\n1Engineers include a variety of different jobs working in the field of engineering, including software engineers, hardware engineers, engineering managers, etc.",

  "latent_21252": "The Trump Administration Can’t Give Turkey a Hall Pass on Rule of Law\n\nAmid a low point in U.S.-Turkey relations, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim will visit Washington this week for a meeting with Vice President Mike Pence. Visas, terrorists, and court cases will be on the agenda. Less clear is whether rule of law will make the cut.\n\nThis long-planned meeting, which follows their first encounter last February in Munich, usefully broadens engagement beyond both countries’ brash leaders. The May visit of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to see President Donald Trump was marred by scenes of Turkish bodyguards beating up protestors. Yildirim, an ally of Erdogan for over two decades and fellow founder of the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP), took office in May 2016; after a referendum this spring endorsed constitutional changes, he resigned as AKP leader and Erdogan was elected as his successor. Yildirim and Pence, low-key personalities who have their bosses’ ears, should have a substantive policy discussion.\n\nThe highest-profile agenda item is the mutual suspension of visas for each other’s citizens. American action followed arrests of two Turkish employees of U.S. consulates: one in Adana accused of links to Kurdish terrorists and one in Istanbul accused of ties to Fetullah Gulen, the U.S.-based cleric accused of directing the coup attempt in July 2016. The Turkish government took reciprocal measures in response. It views this situation as a visa dispute, while Washington has characterized it as a question of “the commitment of the Government of Turkey to the security of U.S. Mission facilities and personnel.” While both governments are keen to return to a normal state of travel affairs, the United States is seeking evidence for the detentions and assurances about mission safety. (After two calls last weekend between Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, the United States announced on Monday the re-opening of limited visa services. The U.S. embassy’s statement said this decision came after receiving initial assurances no additional staff are under investigation; however, it expressed continued concern about existing cases against local employees and American citizens.)\n\nThe purported justification for these arrests stems from threats to Turkish national security: namely, Gulen and the Kurds. On the former, Turkey imposed a state of emergency after the failed July 2016 putsch and began arresting suspected coup plotters and affiliated Gulenists. Ankara has called for Gulen’s extradition from the United States, though it has failed to provide sufficient evidence of his culpability to persuade a federal judge of probable cause. On the latter, the Turkish government has fought for decades against a domestic Kurdish terrorist organization (PKK). The Kurdish question has grown more complicated in recent years, with the United States providing military support in the fight against the Islamic State to a faction of Syrian Kurds (YPG) affiliated with the PKK. Turkey has some legitimate concerns on both issues that should continue to be discussed at senior levels.\n\nHowever, these arrests stem from a broader problem: rule of law. Efforts to bring coup plotters to justice have morphed into an apparent witch-hunt against all political opponents. The Turkish government has aggressively pursued an ever-expanding number of people accused of engaging in ill-defined acts of terrorism. At least 150,000 people have been sacked from government and academia; more than 50,000 are jailed for alleged collusion; and over 150 journalists are behind bars. Now foreigners are getting caught in the net. In addition to these U.S. consulate employees, 12 Americans are in Turkish prisons on spurious terrorism charges. The highest profile case is Andrew Brunson, a pastor who was jailed a year ago on accusations of supporting Gulen. Pence, who shares Brunson’s Christian faith, has already engaged the Turkish government on his behalf.\n\nErdogan appears to be engaging in “hostage diplomacy.” He likely sees American prisoners as useful bargaining chips, as both countries question the independence and flexibility of the other’s legal system. After Trump requested Brunson’s release in a September phone call, the Turkish president stated publicly that he had informed his American counterpart he would hand over one cleric if he got the other cleric in return. In other words, Turkey would release Brunson if the United States provided Gulen.\n\nArguably of even greater interest to Erdogan is Reza Zerrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader arrested in March 2016 on charges of violating American sanctions by using gold to purchase Iranian gas. Erdogan, who seemingly fears he or his family could be implicated in the scheme, has raised Zerrab’s case with Trump.\n\nAddressing all of these cases requires a conversation about rule of law, as the American-related arrests did not occur in a vacuum. Unfortunately, the Trump administration has given the impression it is does not care about the quality of Turkish democracy. Concerns that President Trump neglected to raise human rights issues during his May meeting with Erdogan were compounded by the bodyguards’ violent behavior — just hours after the Turkish president’s motorcade left the White House. Although the State Department has made strong statements in recent months about the troubling arrests of human-rights activists, the silence from the White House has been deafening.\n\nThis has been exacerbated by perceptions the White House is willing to explore extra-judicial means of resolving Ankara’s problems. For example, Michael Flynn — who served as Trump’s first national security advisor — reportedly talked to Turkish officials during the campaign about transferring Gulen from the United States to Turkey, outside the legal process. Developments in the Zerrab case have also raised eyebrows. Trump fired Preet Bharara, the U.S. district attorney who indicted Zerrab. Then Zerrab hired Rudy Guiliani, an informal Trump advisor, as part of his defense team. And Zerrab’s lawyers said they were seeking a “diplomatic solution” to his case, with Guiliani holding meetings with Erdogan and senior U.S. administration officials to discuss options. (Reports that Zerrab may be seeking a plea deal suggest this effort failed.)\n\nAn increasing number of analysts in the United States and Europe are calling for a transactional relationship with Turkey. Recent events highlight the limits of this approach. That game is hard to play cleanly, not least because of legal constraints. Instead, there should be a broad-based dialogue that covers a range of issues, including rule of law as a core component. During his meeting with Prime Minister Yilidrim, Vice President Pence must place this issue firmly on the bilateral agenda.\n\nThe Turkish government pays careful attention to messaging from Washington and has undoubtedly noted the disparity in commentary within the Trump administration. Turkish political leaders should understand their undemocratic behavior is problematic for a NATO ally, and Turkish civil society needs to know the U.S. supports their efforts to keep the country on a democratic trajectory. Unless and until the White House raises governance concerns, Turkey’s leadership will assume the United States is giving them a pass.\n\nCorrection, Nov. 7, 2017: A previous version of this article misspelled Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim’s last name.",
  "latent_21376": "White House and NASA Defend Asteroid Redirect Mission, Senate Skeptical in New Bill\n\nStatus Report From: American Institute of Physics\n\nPosted: Friday, September 16, 2016\n\nThe White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and NASA held an event this week to explain the rationale for the administration’s proposed Asteroid Redirect Mission. Congress has been skeptical about the mission's value, and this skepticism was further confirmed in a new Senate NASA reauthorization bill released yesterday.\n\nOn Sept. 14, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and NASA held an event to explain the purpose and value of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM), the administration’s proposal to capture a boulder from an asteroid and bring it into orbit around the Moon for study. Speaking at the event were OSTP Director John Holdren, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, and ARM Program Director Michele Gates.\n\nIn his remarks, Holdren first outlined four components of the administration’s vision for human space exploration: working with the private sector to develop cost-effective means of expanding human presence in space, developing new technologies for space exploration, extending use of the International Space Station into the mid-2020s so that it can serve as a test-bed for these new technologies, and executing a series of increasingly ambitious missions to take humans beyond low Earth orbit. Holdren then explained that the ARM is a key part of this vision as it provides a destination for humans to conduct operations near the Moon and demonstrates advanced electric propulsion capabilities key to the ultimate goal of sending humans to Mars.\n\nHoldren also stated that ARM serves as an important demonstration of asteroid deflection techniques that could one day help prevent an asteroid from striking the Earth. He noted that the meteor that exploded above Chelyabinsk, Russia in 2013 had the power of 400-500 kilotons of TNT (about 30 times the power of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima), and that a 1908 meteor impact, dubbed the “Tunguska event,” was equivalent to a multiple megaton explosion.\n\nGiven that the Chelyabinsk impact is estimated to be a 1 in 100 year event and the Tunguska impact is estimated to be a 1 in 1,000 year event, Holdren asserted that asteroid deflection is a capability worth developing. “We have to be smarter than the dinosaurs,” Holdren said, a reference to the theory that a large meteor strike near the Yucatán peninsula led to the extinction of dinosaurs.\n\nA depiction of how the ARM vehicle could perform an asteroid deflection. (Image credit – NASA)\n\nHoldren then summarized the ARM’s rationale by pointing to five distinct benefits of the mission:\n\n\"The Asteroid Retrieval Mission makes sense in about five ways: it makes sense for science, for better understanding of the composition of asteroids and what they can tell us about the origins of the solar system. It makes sense from the standpoint of technology demonstration, demonstrating technologies we’re going to need for the mission to Mars. It makes sense in terms of human operations in cis-lunar space, again the most appropriate stepping-off point for Mars. And it makes sense for the possibilities for using asteroids for sources of materials, potentially sources of fuel, sources of water, to resupply space missions, and ultimately, to meet needs on Earth. So this is a multi-purpose mission, but the planetary defense aspect is one important part of it.\"\n\nHoldren concluded his remarks by pointing to President Obama’s support of the mission: “The president is excited about this mission as well. He spoke about an asteroid mission in 2010 when he talked about the way we were building a systematic, coherent, visionary approach to moving deeper into space and conducting ever more elaborate operations in space.”\n\nSenate skeptical in new NASA authorization bill\n\nYesterday, the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee announced that it will mark up six bills next week including the “NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2016.” This is the Senate’s first move toward reauthorizing policies and programs at NASA in the current Congress. The House passed a NASA reauthorization bill in February 2015 that the Senate has not considered.\n\nSection 435 of the Senate’s new authorization bill is specific to the ARM. It begins by noting that the projected cost of the mission has grown from $1.25 billion to $1.4 billion and that the estimated launch date has slipped from December 2020 to December 2021. It then points out that the NASA Advisory Council concluded that “maneuvering a large test mass is not necessary to provide a valid in-space test of a new solar electric propulsion stage” and that “other possible motivations for acquiring and maneuvering a boulder, such as asteroid science and planetary defense, do not have value commensurate with their probable cost.”\n\nThe bill then expresses the Senate’s overall skepticism about the mission:\n\n\"It is the sense of Congress that the technological and scientific goals of the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission may not be commensurate with the cost; and alternative missions may provide a more cost effective and scientifically beneficial means to demonstration the technologies needed for a human mission to Mars…\"\n\nThe bill would require NASA to submit a report to Congress within 180 days of the bill’s enactment which (1) evaluates options other than the ARM for demonstrating technologies needed for a human mission to Mars; (2) assesses the scientific, technical, and commercial benefits of these alternate approaches; and (3) compares the costs of these alternatives.\n\nContact\n\nMitch Ambrose\n\nGovernment Relations Division\n\nAmerican Institute of Physics\n\nmambrose@aip.org\n\n301-209-3095\n\n// end //\n\nMore status reports and news releases or top stories.\n\nPlease follow SpaceRef on Twitter and Like us on Facebook.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",

If you still experience this, run WinMTR as administrator.\n\nNo response from a single host.\n\nHaving no response from a single host in the middle of your route (100% packet loss) is often normal. Some routers do not respond to the ICMP protocol that WinMTR uses.\n\nOne or more hops show packet loss. Is this real packet loss?\n\nIt can be often hard to tell if the packet loss you see in a WinMTR trace is real.\n\nMany routers on the internet employ ICMP deprioritization; dropping ICMP packets in order to guarantee resources to more important traffic. If the packet loss does not continue through to the remaining hops in your route, the loss can most likely be attributed to deprioritization.\n\nIf the packet loss continues through to the end of your trace, the packet loss has a good chance of being genuine, and may be contributing to poor game performance.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nCommon causes of network connectivity issues\n\nWireless networks:\n\nCharacterised by-\n\nPacket loss before/at your home router\n\nHigh latency before/at your home router\n\nNetwork drops (drops in internet connectivity)\n\nJitter\n\nOne of the most common causes of connection issues is wireless networking.

Not much can be done in this situation, but usually the normal routing is restored relatively quickly.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWhy am I experiencing lag, only now that Path of Exile 2.0 has been released?\n\nIf you are using Lockstep Mode-\n\nDue to its nature, Lockstep Mode is more sensitive to the quality of your connection to our servers. Because of this, we only recommend its use if you have stable connectivity and low latency to your realm's servers. If your connection is having issues, it will be a lot easier to notice when you are running Lockstep. If you are experiencing issues, it might be a good idea to change to Predictive Mode to see if they are lessened. With the implementation of Lockstep Mode, there have been a great number of improvement to Predictive that should make the experience superior to Predictive pre-2.0.\n\nThere have been some issues with the release of 2.0 (The Awakening) that have since been resolved. We have been reducing the amount of data required to be sent by the client, and have solved some databases issues that had been causing disconnects from the game servers. There are no outstanding general connectivity issues from the launch that we are aware of at this time.\n\nEveryone seems to be having the same issue as me. Is there a greater problem going on?\n\nMaybe, but maybe not. Internet issues tend to cause very similar symptoms, but have a wide range of varying root causes.Players reporting similar problems can often be from different regions, different providers or not be connecting to the same servers as you are.\n\nI seem to be experiencing lag since the latest patch. Is it the patch causing my problem?\n\nProbably not. It is very rare that we make changes to the game that affect the network stack. It's more likely that something else has changed, coinciding with timing of the patch.\n\nI have a fast connection, with great upstream and downstream bandwidth. Shouldn't I be free from lag?\n\nNot necessarily. The amount of bandwidth utilised by Path of Exile is relatively small. Other characteristics such as latency and jitter are going to be more important to your overall experience. This is especially true when utilising Lockstep mode.\n\nI don't experience any lag in other games, only Path of Exile. Why is this?\n\nThere are a variety of factors that can cause this. The route that your connection takes to reach our servers may be significantly different than that to the servers for other online games. Internet issues that affect us, may not affect them and vice-a-versa.\n\nSpeedtest.net shows no packet loss. Shouldn't this indicate I am problem free?\n\nSpeedtest.net is not a good indicator as to the quality of your internet connection. While it is good for gauging general download speeds, it is not good for testing packet loss and latency to ranges of remote servers. The default behaviour is to select a server as geographically close to you as possible.\n\nAre my region's servers slower than others?\n\nNo. Our instance servers utilise identical hardware specifications in all regions. We prefer to use WinMTR to troubleshoot general network connectivity when using Windows platforms.

It will be handy for our personnel as often we find some of these suspects to be highly abrasive leading to unwarranted tension. But we will not be using it indiscriminately,” said S, additional commissioner of police (Crime),According to CCB officials, the toughest part of any narcotic operation involving foreign nationals – specifically Nigerian nationals – is that they vehemently resist arrest, refusing to co-operate with the officials during interrogation.They also claimed that these suspects refuse to share information and point blank refuse to assist the cops to take the investigation ahead. The officials also added that most of these alleged drug peddlers claim that they do not understand English and refuse to divulge any information.“We find it very difficult to pacify and bring them – both male and female suspects -- under control. Apart from physical resistance, sometimes they are also under the influence of alcohol or narcotics making it even more difficult to make a peaceful arrest,” said a senior CCB official.A taser gun is an electrical weapon which is used to stun and immobilise the target person after shooting two electrodes that are connected to the hand-held weapon unit. The electrical conductors inside the main unit send a strong (though not fatal) electric charge into the target’s body leading to temporary partial paralysis. Though it is considered as a non-lethal weapon, the target individual experiences extreme pain and intense muscular spasms before the effect wears off.“We do not have taser guns as of now, but other enforcement agencies in the country have been equipping themselves,” said sources in the CCB.The Delhi police have been the first police force in India to equip themselves with taser guns at an estimated cost of Rs 1 lakh per unit; and their counterparts in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Goa are also following suit.The sources added that a majority of the foreign nationals, indulging in drug peddling in the city, were part of drug cartels based out of Goa and Maharashtra. The officials also added that most of the foreign nationals, especially Nigerians, involved in drug peddling, dealt in smuggling and peddling high-end narcotics, including cocaine.Recently, the narcotics and woman squad of the CCB came under fire after a Nigerian national suffered a fatal fall from his two-wheeler during a drug raid nearin the wee hours of March 13.The issue snowballed into a major controversy after the African community in the city accused the police of murdering the victim.However, the police claimed it was a road mishap and later said the deceased did not have valid documents to stay in the country.In June 2016, a team of city police literally had to run for cover when things went awry while they were trying to subdue an inebriated Nigerian woman nearatThe woman, according to news reports, eventually had to be sedated and subdued before being referred to Nimhans for counselling.The Central Crime Branch has booked 17 cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances () Act against foreign nationals and arrested 24 African nationals, including 19 Nigerian nationals, since January 2017.The total number of foreigners arrested by the CCB unit during the last three months stands at 32, which also includes Bangladeshi nationals.In 2016, the CCB had booked 26 cases under NDPS act and arrested nine foreign nationals.A huge controversy is brewing in Noida near the national capital after an irate mob rounded up four Nigerian nationals and assaulted them inon Monday.The mob was protesting the death of a teenager reportedly of narcotic overdose in the company of some Nigerian nationals. The issue has also snowballed into a diplomatic row as the Indian ambassador tohas been summoned by their government and have strongly sought the arrest of those involved in the racial attack on their citizens in the country. The incident has also triggered massive outrage on social media platforms across the country.It’s a non-lethal weapon; has two electrodes, which, when fired, temporarily paralyses the target.

  "latent_21859": "A new report released last week asserts that utility-scale solar is much more economical than small-scale solar. The clear implication is that we should let incumbent utilities build or buy solar from large-scale arrays instead of allowing customers to generate their own power.\n\nThere are several reasons to seriously question the mistaken assertion that big solar is better.\n\nFollow the money\n\nFirst, this study is funded, in part, by the Edison Electric Institute. The Institute is the for-profit utility trade group whose 2013 report on “disruptive challenges” suggests, among other things, that utilities have to fight back against distributed solar energy as a revenue threat. Their members include many utilities proposing or implementing higher charges on their customers to make small solar less economical. In other words, the sponsors of this study have a financial interest in slowing the growth of small-scale solar.\n\nSecond, the report is prepared for First Solar, a Wal-Mart-family-supported solar developer that views rooftop solar as a competitive threat to its utility-scale solar business. In other words, the study was commissioned by a company whose financial interest is in reducing competition from small-scale solar.\n\nQuestion the assumptions\n\nIn theory, we could find objective study results despite biased funders, but you won’t find them here. Let’s talk about a few of the titanic omissions in the study's comparison of large- and small-scale solar.\n\nUtility-scale solar and residential solar aren’t comparable on a levelized-cost basis, because only one delivers power at the point of use (residential solar). Utility-scale solar has to get to customers, and that requires access to (and often construction of) high-voltage transmission infrastructure that is not only controversial, but expensive.\n\nThe following chart, based on a Clean Coalition analysis from 2011, shows that transmission costs for large-scale solar projects can outweigh the economies of scale that come from their large size.\n\nCost can be higher, but value is lower for solar energy from centralized solar arrays. For example, numerous studies on the value of solar energy (and one state law) illustrate the particular grid benefits of distributed solar that utility-scale doesn’t provide, including reduced line losses, deferred distribution system maintenance, avoided transmission capital expense, and increased resiliency.\n\nIt’s not just a theory; it’s an industry practice. When Geronimo Energy pitched Xcel Energy on 100 megawatts of new solar capacity in Minnesota, the company promised to build it in chunks of 2 megawatts to 10 megawatts each that it asserts “will deliver many benefits, including a reduction in line loss, elimination of transmission costs, and geographic diversification of generation assets.”\n\nThe following chart, illustrating Minnesota’s value-of-solar formula, shows particular values that only apply to distributed solar like that on residential rooftops.\n\nDistributed solar also has substantial economic benefits of interest to electric customers, if not their monopoly utilities. For example, 1 megawatt of solar that is locally owned rather than utility-owned means as much as $5.7 million in lifetime economic benefits for a community. And the dramatic rise in residential and commercial rooftop solar arrays suggests electric customers see a clear economic opportunity in generating their own power.\n\nQuestion the purpose\n\nIt’s tempting to accept the assertion that bigger is better, especially for environmentalists seeking the most rapid transition to clean energy. But the truth is that distributed solar competes on cost and value, and it’s a faster way to a cleaner power sector.\n\nLook no further than world-leader Germany, where more than 25 percent of annual electricity production comes from renewable energy, 7 percent from solar alone. The vast majority of German solar arrays (70 percent) are 500 kilowatts or smaller (less than the size of an Ikea rooftop).\n\nIn contrast, the splashy 550-megawatt Topaz Solar Array took seven years to develop and construct, during which time over 8,000 megawatts of distributed residential and commercial solar were installed in the U.S. Don’t forget that, like Germany, thousands of these distributed solar arrays are locally owned, widely distributing the economic benefits of the clean energy transformation.\n\nThe issue of economic benefits may be the central point. Utility-scale solar safely fits within the antiquated 20th century centralized monopoly model of electricity delivery, insulating utilities from innovative customer-centered distributed power. In fact, a late 2014 study highlighted that net metering of distributed solar is a minor threat to ratepayers, but a much more significant threat to utility shareholders.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with building utility-scale solar. But let’s be clear: it’s neither the most economic nor the fastest way to green the electricity sector, and it cements centralized control of electricity system in an era of widespread decentralized innovation. And that may be too high a price to pay.\n\n***\n\nThis article was originally posted at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and was reprinted with permission.

The remaining teachers they deem the cautious 60%:\n\nThe cautious 60% may play a far more important role in hindering scientific literacy in the United States than the smaller number of explicit creationists. The strategies of emphasizing microevolution, justifying the curriculum on the basis of state-wide tests, or “teaching the controversy” all undermine the legitimacy of findings that are well established by the combination of peer review and replication. These teachers fail to explain the nature of scientific inquiry, undermine the authority of established experts, and legitimize creationist arguments, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe authors note that more high school students take general biology than any other science course, and that biology will be the only high school science class for up to a quarter of all US graduates. Yet 72% will get no schooling in evolutionary biology or a wobbly version of it: “absent, cursory, or fraught with misinformation.”\n\nThe authors suggest that scientists and scientific organizations address the problem:\n\nBy continuing participation in federal law suits, since federal courts effectively limit the ability of state and local governments to endorse nonscientific alternatives to evolution\n\nBy requiring evolution courses be taught to teachers in training, since those who teach evolutionary biology are more likely to have completed a course in evolution (and feel more confident teaching it) than those who don’t teach it at all, or who teach it ambivalently:\n\nThey add:\n\nMore effectively integrating evolution into the education of preservice biology teachers may also have the indirect effect of encouraging students who cannot accept evolution as a matter of faith to pursue other careers.\n\nThe paper:",
  "latent_22156": "Remember the building blocks of the world wide web? HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Does ring a bell, right?\n\nWe know what HTML does. HTML is the foundation, it delivers the content to you. Sure, RSS also does the content talk, most APIs respond with a JSON full of content, but let’s face it, HTML is the big deal. It gets you started.\n\nThen there is CSS. It can make HTML look and sound good, but it’s optional. Since browsers have a default way of styling certain things, you can get all the information you need by staring at the HTML with no CSS in place. If the developer took additional care, you should even be able get a gist of what those referenced images are about. All thanks to HTML. While CSS helps to make sites nice to look at, it is not mandatory. Oh the irony, the author of cssence.com called CSS optional.\n\nLet’s move on to JavaScript. In charge of interactivity and advanced stuff. Granted, it can do amazing things, but it also breaks easily if things go awry, and unlike HTML and CSS it does not come with a fail-safe mechanism. Which is why we need JavaScript even less than CSS. That’s my opinion. An opinion that seems to be challenged more than anything else lately.\n\nThe fuss about JavaScript\n\nWhen I browse my twitter feed these days, it seems JavaScript-wise we have become a bipartisan community. While everyone admits it has become hard to keep up with all the development going on in the JavaScript world, one party seems to be rooting for the good old days where web development was easy and days​since​last​javascript​framework.com didn’t exist. The other party opposes that not using JavaScript holds us back, hence overframeworking doesn’t bother them much. The web is moving fast, deal with it.\n\nAccording to days​since​last​javascript​framework.com, it has been zero days since the last new JavaScript framework came out.\n\nThe whole situation is becoming a joke. You might be interested in the long version “How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016,” a witty article by Jose Aguinaga, but you can take the shortcut with this tweet by @iamdevloper:\n\n- hey how did your hackathon go?\n\n- not too bad, we got Babel set up\n\n- yep…\n\n- yep.\n\nParadigm shift\n\nTo me, commuting to and from work means not having a reliable internet connection. These are the times when I experience first-hand what it feels like when you wait for something to load that has been created without thinking about users and the circumstances they are in while browsing the web. Mobile-first gave us a break, websites had to be rethought to make sense of the smaller form factor. But the bloat and all the crappiness is coming back. Bloat and bad implementation can make any site slow, so you’ll have to wait for the initial rendering to happen. Getting something on the screen is key. I’ve become less patient nowadays and simply give up when it takes too long.\n\nA stable internet connection cannot be taken for granted. Let’s take a look at this article, in which Nolan Lawson concludes that progressive enhancement needs to be redefined, because …\n\n[…] the network is now the bottleneck, [… so] you should be focusing on offline-first, i.e. treating the network as an enhancement.\n\nIn his clear-cut article, Nolan describes how it could be done, and it ain’t going to be easy. We need to put in additional effort to get there. You might think that in this cost-cutting world of ours, companies consider not to bother. But in reality they have an obligation to do things right, and we as developers need to convey the message to them. And companies will like the message, because people will be drawn to well-made websites, higher engagement and all. When creating such sites, we also avoid a future where people have to stare at blank screens.\n\nOvertime\n\nThis article should have ended at the last paragraph, but here we are. There is this one bit where I disagree with Nolan’s message, and that is the part where he argues that we no longer need to consider those who lack JavaScript. Sure, cost-cutting companies might agree, after all, that would be one less thing to think about. But I won’t let them get away with it, similar to the way Jeremy Keith won’t let us get away with it.\n\nThere is another building block for the web, one that is more important than HTML, CSS and JavaScript combined. It all starts with URLs. Those things uniquely identify some piece of information on the web. It should not be that hard or expensive to have a server dump this information into HTML, whatever that information might be; some content, a list of URLs to some more content, you name it. Let’s keep it really simple, just the content, without replicating any of the site’s chrome. (Though one additional link that brings you back to the homepage wouldn’t hurt.)",

It would be thoroughly within his character profile to exult in having winged her with various high-tech affronts to get inside her head as her administration began. Putting him on the Trump campaign staff is a feeble attempt to delegitimize the election result.\n\nLiberals are not the only side adjusting opinions based on election passions. Many conservatives with the proper distaste for the illegal pilferages of Julian Assange suddenly found themselves warming to WikiLeaks when the content of its divulgences revealed levels of Clinton corruption and media collusion that American reporters were never going to explore.\n\nSo if objectivity is even possible, consider the following bottom lines:\n\nThe Russians (and the Chinese and others) are constantly looking for ways to hack into our politics, our military, any secrets they can plunder. We are apparently not skilled at thwarting such malicious incursions, and we need to get better. But the notion that the election result was swung by such an event is a sore-loser fantasy.\n\nAmerica's elections are among the most reliable in the world, but in a human system beset by the occasional sabotage attempt, improved election security is a wise quest, whether focused on international intrusions or fraudulent voting. No one should oppose improved cyber-defenses or sensible safeguards like voter ID.\n\nAnd as for WikiLeaks, it is not morally sensible to condone thievery that advances a political goal. No doubt, the voting public knew facts about the Hillary campaign it would have never learned from her media protectors, but that doesn't make Assange a hero.\n\nThe stages of grief defined by Elizabeth Kubler-Ross in 1969 have a final destination that would be of great value to those still struggling with the election: acceptance.\n\nMark Davis is a radio host and frequent columnist for The Dallas Morning News.

We are taking to the road to build on the strong political support we have already received and to explain to the public and private sector how they can get involved.\"\n\nThe roadshow kicks off today in Romania, where the Vice-President will be joined by Regional Policy Commissioner Corina Crețu.\n\nVice-President Katainen will meet Prime-Minister Victor Ponta, President-elect Klaus Iohannis, Speaker of the Senate Călin Popescu Tăriceanu, as well as ministers and members of the Parliament. He will participate in a conference called “An investment boost to Europe” to promote the opportunity to around 100 potential investors and businesses and with the participation of the Governor of the National Bank of Romania.\n\nHe will also debate the EU’s future with students and academia at Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies.\n\nHe will also open the Structural Funds Gala, an event rewarding EU-funded projects that made a difference in the life of communities they addressed.\n\nHe will conclude his time in Bucharest with a visit to the EU-funded project LuminaLed at Microelectronica, a private enterprise for research and production of LED for car manufacturers.\n\nToday’s visit to Romania will be followed by visits to Italy and Germany in January, to Spain, Croatia, Czech Republic and UK in February and to France in March. The aim is to cover all 28 EU countries by October 2015. The Vice-President will also make visits to non-EU countries to promote the Investment Plan.\n\nThe programme will be tailored to address specific investment needs in specific Member States. As well as national, regional and local authorities, the Vice-President will discuss the Investment Plan with representatives from the business community, trade unions, academia and students as well as potential investors. He will also visit projects benefitting from EU financing and discuss opportunities offered by the Plan.\n\nCountries to be visited\n\nBackground:\n\nThe Roadshow will cover the three angles of the EU Investment Plan:\n\n(1) Mobilising Investment Finance. The aim is to provide potential investors (public and private), as well as those seeking to benefit from funding in the future, with practical information on how the new European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) will work and how to get involved.\n\nWith strong political support from Member States and the European Parliament, the new European Fund for Strategic Investments could be established in June 2015, with financing available for projects in autumn 2015. Funding could be available even earlier for SMEs as the existing European Investment Fund gets reinforced.\n\n(2) The new Project Pipeline. A pipeline of trustworthy, viable projects will be created under the Investment Plan - screened by independent experts - which are attractive to investors. The roadshow will provide information on how interested parties, including Member States, regions or project promoters can submit projects for screening, as well as the service which will be provided by a new technical assistance hub, to ensure that projects are well structured and comply with regulatory requirements;\n\n(3) The Regulatory reforms. The roadshow will gather political support for regulatory reforms, at EU and national level which are critical to removing barriers to investment, opening new investment opportunities (in sectors such as digital, energy and capital markets) and changing permanently the investment environment in Europe.",

  "latent_22541": "Legions of feminists will ferociously type smash the patriarchy! at their Internet rallies, calling out for the end of the male supremacy in all spheres of life. Yet, few of them acknowledge the fact that one of these spheres, the government (the institution granting them rights), is entirely funded by male taxpayers. Economically, women cost more to the state than they benefit. The government is literally paying women to be alive. As such, strong independent women are only that way because the state is transferring money from men to them. Feminists are not seriously against being dependent on men, they are just against men having the full control over their money.\n\nLet’s explore a fiscal research report in New Zealand.\n\nThe real gender gap: the tax gap\n\nWhile the 77¢ for a dollar wage gap has been under the spotlight for the past years, the 200¢ for a dollar tax gap has, to my knowledge never been mentioned, at least not by our supreme feminist leaders Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau. A quick glimpse at the data reveals a massive difference in taxes paid by men and women.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is that half of women might be at home raising kids. However, the workforce participation rate gap between men and women doesn’t seem to exceed 10% in either age group. (see figure 4 in source)\n\nThe second thing that may come to mind as a confounding factor is that women spend more for children in education and health. Nope. No support for that either. Men and women spend approximately the same amount in both education and health (see figure 10 and 11 of the source).\n\nIn nearly all age groups, women receive more tax than they give\n\nWith the exception of the age group between 45-59 (a 15 year span) years old, women cost more to the state than the tax they provide. In contrast, men generate more tax revenue than they cost between 23 and 65 (a 43 year span). In the brief period in which women generate more or as much tax money than they consume, men outscore them by at least 3 times.\n\nBy the end of her life, the average woman will have a negative fiscal impact of $150,000\n\nBy large, the cumulative tax money given to women outweighs the tax money generated by women. The short period of positive impact of women between 45 and 59 is countered by 65 other years in which their allocated tax expenditure is more than what they supply the state.\n\nMen, on the other hand, appear to have a positive cumulative net fiscal impact from approximately 40 until 80 years of age. For these particular taxes and public expenditures, the net fiscal incidence on men is approximately zero when cumulated over all ages. (p. 22)\n\nOverall, the research suggests that male taxpayers are the only ones to ever have a positive contribution in taxes. Based on Figure 17, the closest that the average woman will come to having a positive fiscal incidence is when she is at minus $50,000 around 55 years of age. While feminists are demonizing men for benefiting from all liberties and rights they have constructed, they have oddly remained silent over the fact that anonymous male tax payers are paying women to exist. Read that sentence again.\n\nThe fact that feminists want a stronger government is not a coincidence. While historically, women had to choose a wealthy husband for resources, they can now stay single, be lesbians, marry a poor man, or use the sperm bank, and the state will still transfer male taxes to them. Interestingly, within 10 years of women’s suffrage, the government doubled their tax revenue and expenditure in the USA.\n\nThese findings show just how simplistic the notion of privilege is. While men make more on average, it allows women to have access to education, health, and services. The patriarchy is pretty generous after all :^)\n\nI’m on YouTube\n\nAnd Twitter\n\n[Reblogged with permission from https://nkilsdonkgervais.wordpress.com/2016/08/10/research-finds-that-the-state-is-entirely-funded-by-male-taxpayers/]",

The number of reports is shocking, Frank Huiting, one of the founders and himself a victim of sexual abuse in a closed Jehovah's Witnesses community as a child, said to broadcaster NOS.\n\nThe foundation was launched just over a week ago, based on Huiting's own experiences. He was abused from the time he was seven year's old. When Huiting told his parents, they decided not to report it to the police. An elder in the community advised against it. \"Then there will be headlines in the newspaper and we don't want that.\"\n\nAccording to the Reclaimed Voices initiators, victims within the closed Jehovah's Witnesses community are not heard and perpetrators are left to continue unchecked. Over the past week, foundation employees heard stories from a number of people who were abused by Jehovah's Witnesses. \"The fact that so many reports have come in actually says enough. There are at least hundreds of cases in the Netherlands that should actually come out\", Huiting said, according to NOS. He added that so many victims are too afraid to come forward.\n\nThe main purpose of Reclaimed Voices is to be a listening ear. The employees urge victims to speak out, and hope that they also report the abuse. \"People walked around with this secret for years. And the fact that they are coming out, can be a relief for them. That was also my experience. We also want to advise them to seek professional help. Also outside the religious community, for example with a social worker, psychologist or general practitioner\", Huiting said.\n\nThe foundation aims to collect as man reports of sexual abuse as possible and present them to the board of Jehovah's Witnesses Netherlands and the Dutch government. \"We want to get the government to investigate these abuses. And not to start a fight, but really to focus on the victim.\"\n\nEarlier this year Dutch newspaper Trouw spoke to a number of people who were sexually abused as children in the Jehovah's Witnesses community.

  "latent_22915": "As a girlfriend says to George in a fifth-season episode of Seinfeld, \"I find pastrami to be the most sensual of all the salted cured meats.\" And indeed it is: ruby colored, moist and oily to the touch, rich tasting in a salty and smoky sort of way. Pastrami is also the meat most associated with New York, top of the menu in the city's celebrated Jewish delis. It is made by curing brisket in brine like corned beef, rubbing it with spices, and then smoking it like Texas barbecue. Indeed, pastrami can be seen as a species of barbecue (or maybe barbecue can be seen as a form of pastrami). Recently, Sarge's Deli reopened after a 15-month hiatus. So we decided to do the logical thing, and compare its pastrami with that of two other noble purveyors — one nearby in Murray Hill, the other on the Lower East Side.\n\nSarge's Delicatessen\n\nStats: Weight, 16.6 ounces; Loft, 4\" (including bread); Slicing Method, Machine; Kosher Certification, None; Price, $14.95.\n\nObservations: Sarge's pastrami is mild — not much smoky flavor — and colored a medium pink. The texture is fine-grained, the fat content relatively low for pastrami. The meat is sliced exceedingly thin and piled high on the sandwich, though the slices of rye are notably small in area, and the meat wadded in the middle in the usual deli style. Tasty pastrami, but not going to knock your top off. Very nice price, and served with huge tubs of sour and half-sour pickles and mayo-based coleslaw, a little on the sweet side.\n\nSecond Avenue Deli\n\nStats: Weight, 12.4 ounces; Loft, 3.25\" (including bread); Slicing Method, Machine; Kosher Certification, Yes; Price, $16.95\n\nObservations: Sliced with an equal degree of thinness, the pastrami at Second Avenue Deli — a legendary, former East Village establishment — is slightly darker, slightly more marbled, and slightly more flavorful than that of Sarge's, though wadded a little less opulently on the small slices of rye. The bread at both places, also sliced thin, was nearly identical. You're definitely paying for the kosher certification here, with a slightly smaller and slightly more expensive sandwich. You don't get as many pickles as at Sarge's, but the non-mayo coleslaw was judged better. Actually, kosher certification aside, there were more similarities than differences between Second Avenue and Sarge's; it would be hard to distinguish them in the dark.\n\nKatz's Delicatessen\n\nStats: Weight, 16.2 ounces; Loft, 3\" (including bread); Slicing Method, By Hand; Kosher Certification; None; Price, $16.95\n\nObservations: Katz's pastrami comes on like gangbusters; more coarsely textured than the other two, notably fattier, sliced thick by hand. Thin slicing make a sandwich slipperier, and makes the meat seem more tender. Katz's pastrami sandwich takes a little more work to eat, but the flavor is richer and emphatically smokier. I pondered the spice rub, which is finer-grained and more subtle than the other two. And more blackened. It certainly contains coriander seed, but it's hard to determine what else. Served with half-sour, sour, or green-tomato pickles, thoughtfully sliced.\n\nOverall, Katz's pastrami kicks Sarge's and Second Avenue's ass!\n\n· All Posts by Sietsema [~ENY~]",

But the honesty of one teen helped reunite her with her missing jewelry.\n\nDakota Brown may be 18 years old, but she didn’t hesitate to go trick-or-treating on Halloween with her boyfriend.\n\n“I’m not into parties and the whole drinking or smoking situation,” she said.\n\nSo they went out in their Doctor Who costumes to get some candy, but they got a lot more than that when they stopped at Sharrie Crockell’s home.\n\n“She was wearing face make up, like KISS makeup, and we’re like, oh this lady is really cool,” she said.\n\nCrockell was putting the finishing touches on her costume before heading to a party later with her husband. While she handed out the candy, she accidentally gave away her diamond ring.\n\n“I just panicked. I was like oh my god, because it’s a valuable ring to me,” she said.\n\nBrown found the ring in her bag, and it just so happened that both women had the same idea: putting up fliers to find the missing ring and return it to its owner.\n\nWhile Brown was putting up fliers the next day, she stumbled on Crockell’s and quickly called her to give her the good news. Crockell figured the ring was gone for good and that someone had taken it to a pawn shop for quick cash.\n\n“I’m thankful that that isn’t what happened, that Dakota felt that it was something that needed to be done—giving it back to the rightful owner,” she said.\n\nBrown is glad Crockell’s Halloween scare was temporary and that she could show kids these days still know right from wrong.\n\nCrockell gave Brown a $100 reward for her good deed, which Brown says will be donated to a Roseville animal shelter.",
  "latent_23178": "CLOSE Ex-cop Darrell Beavers now is a prisoner after he pleaded guilty June 30 to attempted tampering with evidence and illegal use of a minor in nudity oriented material. He was sentenced to one year in prison Thursday. The Enquirer/Kimball Perry\n\nDarrell Beavers is handcuffed to go to prison after the former Cincinnati police officer was convicted. (Photo: The Enquirer/Kimball Perry)\n\nDarrell Beavers was many things to those who knew him.\n\nTo his family, he was a loving provider who played college football, tried out for the pros and coached junior and high school sports.\n\nTo his employer, he was a respected Cincinnati police officer, a 12-year veteran who was so well-liked in the department and by those he served that he worked as a community liaison for CPD.\n\nTo landlord Mariann Hock, he was the answer to how she could better keep her tenants and property safe.\n\nBut Beavers was so much more – and so few knew about it.\n\nTo Cincinnati Police Chief Jeffrey Blackwell, Beavers was a \"rogue cop\" who destroyed the trust the public and fellow officers had in him. Sent to prison for a year, Beavers proved to be a secret sinner – hiding behind his badge and the oath to serve and protect while lying as he committed a sexually oriented crime against a 17-year-old girl who had been the victim of sex abuse.\n\nDarrell Beavers (Photo: Provided)\n\nNow, Cincinnati police are reopening their investigation to see if other officers might have been involved in illegal activity at two bogus substations that Beavers created at apartment buildings. The investigation was reopened after The Enquirer asked why DNA from the two locations never was tested.\n\nBeavers' case shows how rare and difficult it is for the police to investigate their own. It also shows how the trust police earn can be abused by crooked cops, ultimately bringing shame on the department and causing feelings of betrayal.\n\n\"This actually turns out to be a sick situation,\" said Ralph Winkler, the judge who sent Beavers to prison in October. \"He actually had a secret life nobody knew about.\"\n\nBeavers was a married father of three when he was accused in September 2013 of exchanging 650 text messages and photos, many of them sexually explicit, with a teen. The girl's stepfather saw the messages and called police.\n\nBecause of that investigation, police learned the stepfather had had a sexual relationship with the girl beginning when she was 14. The man was convicted and placed on probation, which he quickly violated. He's next in court in January, facing a possible three-year prison term.\n\nPolice also learned that Beavers convinced two landlords to let him use their properties for police substations. He never asked for or received department permission, though, to use the apartments for police work. While the fake substations may have been used briefly for official business – how were other cops to know they weren't officially approved substations? – much of the time Beavers used them for a good time, bringing girls and booze into the rooms to party.\n\n'Happy to have some presence'\n\nAs owner of a West Price Hill apartment complex, Hock paid to install at the Rapid Run Terrace & Villa Apartments more exterior lighting and surveillance cameras to try to make her tenants feel safer.\n\n\"I liked Darrell,\" Hock said from her Green Township home. \"I was just happy to have some presence. Prostitution is a big issue in Price Hill, and police have been slow.\"\n\nBeavers told her he had an interest in real estate. She told him she wanted to keep prostitution and drug dealing away from her 4656 Rapid Run Road property. On Oct. 5, 2012, she met with Beavers and another man – \"He told me it was his sergeant, his supervisor\" – to finalize the arrangement. Hock waived the $580 monthly rent and allowed free utilities from October 2012 through April 2013.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the News Alerts newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Be the first to be informed of important news as it happens in Greater Cincinnati.

More newsletters\n\n\"I saw a uniformed police officer come in and out, a couple of other officers, a couple of plainclothes (officers), a couple of females\" but no signs of wrongdoing, Hock said.\n\nBeavers bought a full-sized bed and took it with him when, months later, Hock ended the arrangement, saying the officer's presence no longer was needed.\n\n\"He was a great guy,\" Hock said. \"He was helpful, he was calm. He was a great negotiator. There was value that we got from him being there.\"\n\n'Are all cops like that?'\n\nNeighbors at the second fake substation, French Quarter Apartments, an East Price Hill complex at 2600 Bushnell St., disagreed.\n\nAarik Ford had issues with Beavers from the start. He saw Beavers and another officer looking into windows of the apartments. Ford was offended that Beavers asked him and other residents to provide names of those who visited them, presumably so he could do background checks on them.\n\n\"He was here regularly,\" Ford said. \"I saw him take two girls into the apartment ... I seen him at least twice with (other) officers and at least twice with girls going into the substation.\"\n\nDarlene Etter, another resident of the French QuarterApartments and a city of Cincinnati crossing guard, watched Beavers put up the decal in the complex window indicating it was a City of Cincinnati police substation. Her son saw even more.\n\n\"He said he seen girls down there,\" Etter said. \"He said it looked like they (were) down there drinking.\n\n\"People already don't trust police officers and when you do that, it makes it worse. It makes you wonder, are all the cops like that?\"\n\nCincinnati police wondered if other officers were involved in Beavers' scam. They asked him several times to talk to them about that but he refused.\n\n\"It was their belief that there are other Cincinnati police officers (who) have used, were using the so-called substation for other activity other than police work,\" Carl Lewis, Beavers' attorney said. \"My client was not in a position to give them any information.\"\n\nBeavers pleaded guilty to reduced charges – attempted tampering with records and illegal use of a minor in nudity oriented material. Lewis said had the case gone to trial, he would have argued the substations were \"crash pads\" used by officers who wanted a few hours of sleep before heading back to work, court or an off-duty job.\n\n\"The place was set up for any officer in District 3 when they wanted to recharge their battery,\" Lewis said.\n\nWhen police searched the French Quarter apartment Beavers used, they found pornographic material, personal lubricant, sheets stained with body fluid and a night-vision camera. They \"found several indications that the two beds in the apartment were used frequently for sexual activity,\" Sgt. David Schofield said. \"This camera was set up to surreptitiously record activity that was occurring in the bedrooms.\"\n\nChief: No other officers suspected\n\nAfter Beavers pleaded guilty to reduced charges, police closed the case, never sending the bedding for DNA testing.\n\nIt costs about $300, the Hamilton County Coroner office said, to test for DNA and compare it to a known sample. Because he's in prison, Beavers' DNA now is on file with the Ohio Department of Correction and Rehabilitation and can be compared to the DNA found on the bedding.\n\nAfter questions by The Enquirer about the lack of DNA testing in the Beavers case, Blackwell said he would reopen the case to have the bedding tested.\n\n\"I think we definitely would have a need to go further,\" Blackwell said. \"We would be willing to exhaust any investigatory procedure to get a complete picture.\"\n\nIf the DNA matches only Beavers, the case is over. If there is DNA on the bedding from someone else, it may not matter. That's because police have no other DNA to compare to the bedding results. They can't force officers to provide DNA or be tested.\n\n\"To the average person making a judgment about DNA,\" Blackwell said, \"one could easily think we could test our officers, but we can't.\"\n\nPolice, like other citizens, have constitutional rights not to be searched without cause. Cincinnati police also have a union contract that would prevent such a search.\n\n\"We have no reason to believe any other police officers were involved in criminal activity\" in the Beavers case, Blackwell said, but \"we do believe that there were other people who knew about this.\"\n\nBeavers is scheduled to be released from prison on Oct. 29, 2015.\n\nBeavers not only Cincinnati cop convicted\n\nDarrell Beavers' case wasn't the first of a Cincinnati police officer accused of using an apartment to commit crimes while a cop.\n\nIn 2010, Detective Julian Steele was convicted of arresting and jailing a juvenile he knew committed no crime. Steele was accused of locking the teen up to get access to the boy's mother. She later said she felt intimidated by Steele and performed oral sex on him – in a Winton Terrace apartment Steele kept in addition to his Springfield Township house – to help get her son released.\n\nJulian Steele (Photo: Provided)\n\nSteele, a 14-year officer with Cincinnati police, was sentenced to four years in prison but didn't start serving that time until four months ago because of appeals.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cin.ci/16DSQcg",
  "latent_23219": "With the presidential election set to enter its final two weeks, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump find themselves in a near dead heat at 41% each in a four-way race, the latest IBD/TIPP presidential tracking poll shows.\n\nLibertarian candidate Gary Johnson edged up to 8% from 7%, while the Green Party's Jill Stein rebounded to 4% from 3%.\n\nWithout rounding, Trump stands at 41.1%, 0.1 percentage point behind Clinton's 41.2%. Johnson stands at 7.7%, unrounded, while Stein is at 3.7%.\n\nIn a two-way faceoff without the other two candidates excluded, Trump and Clinton are knotted at 42%. On the unrounded data, Trump slightly edges Clinton, 42.3% to 42%.\n\nThe poll of 815 likely voters has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.6 percentage points. It had a weighted response of 291 Democrats, 235 Republicans and 271 people who called themselves either \"independents\" or \"other.\"\n\nThe latest IBD/TIPP daily tracking poll finds Clinton taking 1-point lead as Trump admits he's behind\n\nUnlike many other polls, the IBD/TIPP Poll continues to show a tightening race, as the candidates and their surrogates slug it out in public in the waning days until the Nov. 8 polling date.\n\nIn the latest Real Clear Politics average of recent polls, Clinton stands at 45.0% to Trump's 39.4%, a 5.6% advantage in the four-way contest. In a head-to-head matchup, Clinton takes 47.9% to Trump's 42.0%, a 5.9% difference.\n\nAmong major polls, only Rasmussen, L.A. Times/USC, Reuters/Ipsos and IBD/TIPP Poll consistently show it close. Most other polls show a gap of 4 points or more, with some as high as 12 points in recent polling.\n\nWith the race tightening and time running out, Trump on Saturday delivered a symbolic speech at Gettysburg, where he unveiled a sweeping, mostly conservative agenda for his first 100 days — one of the few attempts by the candidate to put forward an actual plan for governing.\n\nLoading the player...\n\nPromising to \"drain the swamp\" in the nation's capital and \"replace it with a new government by and for the people,\" Trump vowed to initiate a series of reforms including congressional term limits, a hiring freeze on federal workers (excepting military, safety and health workers) and a major regulatory change: \"For every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated.\"\n\n\"It's a contract between Donald J. Trump and the American voter, and it begins with bringing honesty, accountability and change to Washington, D.C.,\" Trump said during his Gettysburg speech.\n\nMeanwhile, he also vowed to \"totally renegotiate Nafta,\" and to take the U.S. out of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, which hasn't yet been approved by Senate.\n\nAlso in the first 100 days, he promised, among other things, to \"label China a currency manipulator\" as well as end \"billions in payments\" to U.N. climate change programs.\n\nHe pledged to begin looking for someone to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. This follows the third and final debate, in which Trump promised to fill Scalia's spot — and any others that open up — with conservative jurists who \"will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted, and I believe that's very, very important.\"\n\nWith President Obama now actively on the hustings campaigning for Hillary Clinton, Trump threw a dart his way, saying he would \"cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama.\"\n\nThat was only the beginning: Trump said he'll unveil, in lightening succession, a \"Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act,\" an \"American Infrastructure Act,\" a \"Restoring Community Safety Act,\" an \"End the Offshoring Act,\" and, for good measure, a \"Repeal and Replace ObamaCare Act.\"\n\nAnd, finally, he promised to deport criminal illegal immigrants such as \"drug dealers, gang heads, killers,\" while temporarily halting immigration from areas where terrorism is common. And, he says, he'll build the wall through the \"End Illegal Immigration Act.\".\n\nHillary Clinton has already laid out an extensive agenda of tax hikes, higher government spending and increased regulation as a way to break the U.S. out of its growth slump. Convinced by the plethora of polls showing her with a big and perhaps insurmountable lead, she seems to be coasting to the finish line.\n\nBut even her closest advisors warn she has a problem connecting with the voters, perhaps in part due to ongoing revelations of unethical and possibly illegal behavior with her home-brew email server, her failures during her tenure as secretary of state, and concerns over the improperly cozy ties between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department.\n\n\"Honest and trustworthy has become our most talked about metric because it's not great,\" Clinton's communications director Jennifer Palmieri told ABC/News.\n\nShe appeared over the weekend at rallies in heavily Democratic parts of Pennsylvania, another sign that Clinton thinks the race has been won. She again lambasted Trump for saying he might not respect the outcome of the election if it appears fraudulent.\n\n\"Make no mistake about this, my friends: he is threatening our democracy,\" she said.\n\nA recent Washington Post/ABC News poll shows that just 36% of voters call Clinton honest and trustworthy, even though 60% said they believe she is qualified to be president.\n\nStill, Hillary continues to have strong support from union members (54% for Clinton, 25% for Trump), single women (50% to 30%) and Blacks and Hispanics (68% to 13%).\n\nMeanwhile, some of Trump's strongest support comes from white men (56% for Trump, 27% for Hillary), rural dwellers (57% to 23%), independents (41% to 32%), and, perhaps surprisingly, among non-investors (46% to 33%).\n\nRELATED:\n\nOnce Again, Critics Of The IBD/TIPP Poll Get Their Facts Wrong\n\nTrump's Contract With Voters — Is It Too Late To Make A Difference?\n\nWhat Explains The Wide Range Of Poll Results Between IBD/TIPP And Others?\n\nCould Trump Pull A Brexit-Style Surprise In November?\n\nIBD/TIPP Presidential Election Tracking Poll: Latest Results\n\nIBD/TIPP Tracking Poll: The Most Accurate Presidential Poll In America",
  "latent_23283": "This week I stood up in the European Parliament in Strasbourg and spoke about an ‘inconvenient truth’. It was a speech that most in the chamber simply did not want to hear. To howls of derision, I told the European Parliament that what we have now on the continent is not a refugee crisis, as the media continues to tell us, but an economic migrant one.\n\nIn my opinion, we need to be honest about the problem we are facing and call it what it is. Now is not the time for politically correct language. The liberal Left, in their desire to please all of the people all of the time, are helping no one and solving nothing. These are issues that need addressing head on.\n\nThe current economic migrant crisis continues to drag on and won’t be going away any time soon. This is simply because the European response to the mass movement of people from Africa and the Middle East has been so contradictory and confusing that many are still flooding into Europe in their droves.\n\nThe UKIP stance on immigration is well documented. At the 2015 General Election my party stood on a platform of allowing skilled migration and putting an end to mass, unskilled, uncontrolled immigration. The Labour and the Conservative parties respectively have more often than not been far too afraid to even mention the issue for fear of enraging the liberal left and the apologists who continue to do down our great country.\n\nHowever, since the elections in May, it seems that the topic of immigration is all these nay-sayers can talk about. This week we had Home Secretary Theresa May pledging a crackdown on asylum seekers and immigration. Empty words when you consider the latest net migration figures stand at a record 330,000 in the year to March 2015.\n\nMeanwhile only last week, Labour leadership loser and political flip-flopper Andy Burnham blamed EU migration for ‘widening inequality’ and a ‘race-to-the-bottom’ with regard to workers’ wages. Either Burnham has had an epiphany, or he has been wilfully lying to the British people when he talked about mass immigration being of great benefit in the past. In fact, his party leader, Comrade Corbyn, believes in a Britain without borders, free from any nuclear deterrent, and seemingly free from any sense of national identity.\n\nThe current economic migration crisis continues unabated and we are still being told that Britain isn’t doing enough. In a previous article, I highlighted that we already do more than our fair share in accepting asylum seekers. However, regardless of what we are being told by the media and politicians, the majority of these people are not genuine asylum seekers from war-torn Syria, they are opportunistic economic migrants who see the prospect of work and benefits in rich northern EU member states worth risking their lives for.\n\nAccording to Eurostat (the EU’s own statistical gathering body), between April and June this year the EU counted in some 213,000 so-called refugees, yet only 44,000 actually came from Syria. Eighty per cent came from elsewhere with 27,000 coming from Afghanistan and nearly 18,000 coming from Albania, a country hoping to join the EU in the not too distant future.\n\nThese men – and they are predominantly men – from Albania, are simply attempting to jump the queue under the guise of being a Syrian refugee. Many are travelling on fake Syrian passports, of course. Last month Dutch journalist Harald Doornbos revealed that he was able to buy a genuine-looking Syrian passport for as little as $825 (about £540) in Turkey and have it ready within forty hours. In fact, the German government has said that a third of ‘Syrians’ reaching Germany are in possession of forged Syrian passports and ID cards.\n\nI do wonder where all the women and children are, as virtually all of these migrants seem to be young, healthy men. Only last week the charity Human Relief Foundation reported from the so-called ‘Jungle’ migrant camp in Calais (pictured above) that between 95-97 per cent are men.\n\nSo where are the women and children? Back at home in Syria sheltering from bombs and ISIS? If that is the case, then how very gallant and brave of these young men of fighting age to abandon their families in Syria.\n\nAmerican video journalist Bilal Abdul Kareem recently interviewed women in refugee camps in Syria and the general feeling amongst them was that their men had abandoned them. However, on the whole, figures suggest only a small minority of these men making their way across Europe are actually from Syria.\n\nOn top of this we also have the security issue. Worryingly, ISIS claim that as many as four thousand Islamist fanatics have covertly smuggled themselves into Europe posing as refugees. In addition, this week it was also announced that the FBI and authorities in Moldova are fighting hard to prevent radioactive materials from falling into the hands of ISIS terrorists. Imagine what carnage they could cause if they had access to caesium and other dangerous and radioactive chemicals. It is clear ISIS view the chaos in Europe as an opportunity.\n\nFinally, if we have learned anything this week it is that EU leaders have decided how to finally resolve this never ending migration crisis.\n\nOn their visit to the European Parliament, French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have called for… wait for it… even more European integration.\n\nMy question is: do we really need ‘more Europe’? Indeed, I suggest it is the EU that has facilitated much of this crisis.\n\nWith the Schengen agreement in tatters and opposition to proposed EU asylum quotas led by Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, who has claimed that 95 per cent of refugees are in fact economic migrants, I am beginning to wonder whether by 2017 there will actually still be a functional and working EU from which we can withdraw.",
  "latent_23449": "SALT LAKE CITY — Mormonism begins with a simple story of heavenly manifestations.\n\nA 19th-century farm boy in upstate New York prays in a thicket of trees and sees God and Jesus. The boy next uses spiritual powers to unearth ancient writings, which he translates into English with the help of Old Testament aids. He founds a faith as a “restoration” of early Christianity, adds more scriptures to the biblical canon, introduces unique doctrines and creates a community of believers.\n\nThese tales of Joseph Smith’s founding of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have been repeated across the globe by generations of LDS faithful, as well as Mormon missionaries, eager to convert others to what they believe.\n\nTrouble is, the real history is much more nuanced, complicated, even contradictory.\n\nIn one “First Vision” account, Smith said he saw one godly being, not two. He peered into a hat, which held “seer stones,” to produce the sacred scripture. He secretly married dozens of women and lied to his first wife, Emma, about it.\n\nNow, prompted by the rise of social media, the availability of LDS documents, groundbreaking scholarship, widespread Internet sharing of little-known aspects of the faith’s past and a disturbing exodus of the formerly faithful, Mormonism is in the midst of a landmark effort to integrate new details about its founding — without losing the power of a simple narrative.\n\nCan it add layers of what some see as controversial information without scaring away new converts or longtime members whose devotion is built on the account as they’ve known it all their lives?\n\nMany historians insist such a shift is not only possible but also essential.\n\n“People may be comforted in the short run by platitudes, but I don’t think that leads to growth or to effective action,” says Harvard University historian and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Laurel Thatcher Ulrich. “The answer isn’t to replace simplistic stories with footnoted essays. It is to tell better, more complete, stories, stories that are true, that touch issues people really care about.”\n\nOthers worry that something might be lost in the recalibrating.\n\n“No religion I know of would want to turn its founding stories into history, at least as history is understood today in a scientific sense,” says Kathleen Flake, who heads up Mormon studies at the University of Virginia. “Faith is not about fact; nor about fiction, for that matter. It’s certainly not a question of sophistication, at all, but of religious sense.”\n\nCan 21st-century followers continue to grasp the magical and miraculous in a rational era? Can the church appeal to intellectuals while retaining members more at home with the supernatural?\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes it can — and is taking steps to do so, ever so gingerly.\n\nTackling tough topics\n\nIn December 2013, the LDS Church posted on its website an essay titled “Race and the Priesthood.”\n\nThe piece probed the prohibition on black men from being ordained to the denomination’s all-male priesthood, how it developed, the folk teachings surrounding it and what it took — a divine decree — to eliminate the ban in 1978.\n\nIt began under Brigham Young, the second LDS president, who was influenced by common racial beliefs of the time, the article says. The policy did not exist during the tenure of Smith, who opposed slavery and personally ordained several African-Americans.\n\nIn other words, the ban stemmed more from earthly racism than heavenly revelation — a major change from how most Mormons saw it.\n\nThe LDS Church has posted other carefully crafted essays, addressing thorny questions such as “Are Mormons Christians?” ‘’Do Latter-day Saints believe they will become gods?” ‘’What was the nature and extent of polygamy from Smith’s era through its formal end and beyond?” ‘’How did the Book of Mormon and the Book of Abraham come to be?”\n\nThe point was to bring the best scholarly insights to the knotty, complex questions of the faith’s history and theology, providing a place for members who discover vexing information on the Internet to get authoritative, yet faith-based answers.\n\nUnfortunately, the essays’ rollout, notes University of Utah historian Paul Reeve, “was spotty.”\n\nThe pieces were not signed by LDS leaders, not prominently displayed online nor sent to bishops to be read over the pulpit to Mormon congregations.\n\nAt a recent panel discussion at LDS Church-owned Brigham Young University, about a third of the audience of around 80 students had neither read nor heard of the race essay, says Reeve, author of the just-released “Religion of a Different Color: Race and the Mormon Struggle for Whiteness.”\n\n“Others, both professors and students, told of stories whereby they drew upon the essay in church meetings and were met by resistance from fellow Mormons who said the essays were not official and merely (church) Public Affairs pieces.”\n\nSuch an approach — “make the information available, but not too available” — is “not tenable,” Reeve said. “It now needs to be integrated into the curriculum at the local level ... included in (LDS) seminary, institute, Sunday school (youth and adult), Primary and BYU Religion Department curriculums.”\n\nIt doesn’t have to be a wholesale rewriting of history, Reeve said, “to acknowledge new information.”\n\nTelling the Mormon story the way it always has is no longer an option, Reeve argues. “The rising generation craves a more complicated narrative. Their lives are complicated; they are dealing with real struggles and real sins and a whitewashed version of the past with pioneers who only sang as they walked and walked and walked gives them nothing to identify with and sometimes even feels alienating. We can do better. We must do better.”\n\nThe LDS Church does plan to fuse the essays’ information into its curriculum, says spokesman Eric Hawkins. “These materials represent the very best of research on church history and doctrine, and they will, over time, be incorporated into church curriculum, publications and, where appropriate, visitors centers.”\n\nHawkins declined to offer further details about when and how such an integration would happen or to grant interviews with historians and educators working within the bureaucracy.\n\nMormon scholars working independently, however, have no such reluctance. They view this as a crucial and urgent task, and worry that if the church fails to do it, a steady stream of members may continue to slip away.\n\nAdding layers\n\nTerryl Givens, co-author of “The Crucible of Doubt” and “The God Who Weeps,” tells of a Mormon missionary who came across Richard Bushman’s “Rough Stone Rolling” during his years of proselytizing.\n\nBushman’s acclaimed biography is an “unstintingly honest account of the life of Joseph Smith,” Givens says, yet the missionary called it “the greatest faith builder I ever read.”\n\n“I thought, ‘If God could work with a vessel that imperfect to bring about the restoration,’ ” the young man told Givens, “maybe he could use me, too.”\n\nNo one is advocating reading a 700-plus-page biography to LDS high-schoolers, Givens said, but church instruction should draw on the “best history available . familiar and accessible.”\n\nIt could start by including controversial elements into missionary discussions and member lessons “in a matter-of-fact way,” explains Adam Miller, philosophy professor at Collin College in McKinney, Texas.\n\nLDS General Conference talks “could be devoted to covering the same subjects as the essays,” Miller says. “Coming from apostles at General Conference, who would bat an eye? And who wouldn’t love the fresh material?”\n\nMiller, author of “Letters to a Young Mormon,” would like to see LDS visitor centers address the topic of the church’s practice of polygamy, which the faith abandoned in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThat would “put a human face on (polygamy), de-sensationalize it, and clearly frame the whole thing as a part of the Mormon commitment to the eternal family,” Miller says. “People will respond positively to the candor and complexity. If I were investigating the church, candor and complexity are exactly what I would be looking for.”\n\nBushman, emeritus professor of history at Columbia, believes Mormon faith would be enhanced rather than scandalized by past episodes brought to light in the essays.\n\nFor example, Emma Smith’s account of her husband using “seer stones in a hat” to translate the religion’s signature scripture, the Book of Mormon, is “one of the most powerful testimonies of the book that we have,” Bushman said. “The information about the seer stone in the hat is integrated into this testimony. It only makes the translation story more concrete and real.”\n\nSamuel Brown, an LDS physician and researcher in Salt Lake City, sees value in recognizing Smith’s embrace of physical items.\n\n“God revealed ancient scripture to Joseph Smith through his encounters with sacred objects, using Smith’s human mouth and mind to reveal that scripture,” said Brown, author of “First Principles and Ordinances: The Fourth Article of Faith in Light of the Temple.” ‘’For the Book of Mormon, it was the (gold) plates and interpreter stones; for the Book of Abraham, it was a funeral papyrus.”\n\nRevelation and scripture, he said, “are the marks left in our mortal world by encounters between God and human beings.”\n\nMultiple audiences\n\nBelievers of every stripe filter scripture and historical events through the prism of their time, culture and maturity.\n\n“An 8-year-old,” Brown said, “doesn’t need the same story that an adult convert in Congo needs, who doesn’t need the same story that a recovering addict needs, who doesn’t need the same story that a middle-aged professor needs.”\n\nSome Mormons need to hear and tell stories about “exceptionally godly individuals . to make God real in their lives,” he said. “Many of us aren’t built that way. Many of us feel more disappointment, perceive more acutely human failings, feel more skeptical about claims to human godliness. . Such stories don’t seem real to those listeners, they seem misleading or made up.”\n\nThus, trying to force “a rewrite of those stories to suit some of us is like forcing everyone else to go off their (high) blood-pressure medications because we have low blood pressure,” the physician said. “It’s much better to work toward a complementary system in which people with high blood pressure get pills to drop the blood pressure and those with low blood pressure have an exercise regimen instead.”\n\nAdopting such a multifaceted approach, Brown said, “will take substantial culture change, with commitment on all sides.”\n\nBushman argues that adding new and sometimes-troubling information is less unsettling for children and converts.\n\n“They are learning lots of marvelous things. A few more are not hard to take,” Bushman said. “The real problem is for the people who were taught in the old way not to get anxious.”\n\nAfter coming across disconcerting facts regarding LDS history or preaching, some Mormons have left the fold not because of the information itself, but because they never were told about it. They feel betrayed.\n\nOthers who were at ease in the faith — comfortable with, and comforted by, the stories as they were always taught them — were shaken by the essays.\n\nThen there are the vast numbers of Mormons spread across the map.\n\n“’Church history’ in any level of detail is quite elusive for members outside of the United States,” writes Melissa Inouye, who teaches Asian history at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. “Especially in translation, American names, places and historical contexts are difficult to remember.”\n\nThat leads to “heavy oversimplification of the few historical figures whose names can be remembered,” Inouye said, and they are seen as “nearly perfect.”\n\nSuch excessive veneration, she said, is neither helpful nor true.\n\n“Even in small, episodic doses, ‘messy’ history is so interesting because it involves real people and real problems, with which everyone can identify,” Inouye said. “What we see when we learn all of our history is, as in the scriptures, a narrative of God’s dealings with real people as they make mistakes and try again.”\n\n(Peggy Fletcher Stack writes for The Salt Lake Tribune)\n\nCopyright: For copyright information, please check with the distributor of this item, Religion News Service LLC.",
  "latent_23526": "Editor’s note: Tadhg Kelly is a games industry consultant, freelance designer and the creator of leading design blog What Games Are. You can follow him on Twitter here.\n\nThe question I’m always asking of any invention in the games-tech space is “can I see it being used every day?”. Or is it slight, a novelty or built on shaky assumptions of use patterns? Though early enthusiasm for such inventions tends toward “yes”, much of the time the true answer is “no”. Of course sometimes I’m right, sometimes wrong. Wrongness often (depressingly) arrives dressed in the uniforms of causes. Something HAS to work to solve a big problem I perceive therefore therefore therefore… This is less reasoning than buying a marketing story, but reason eventually prevails.\n\nI could never, for example, see Kinect fomenting long term change in the gaming market. Though Microsoft sold a lot of Kinects by following the Wii wave, the devices were too flaky. I have similar doubts about the real appeal of the smart watch for apps and games, and also about virtual reality (a la Oculus Rift). VR is impressive tech, but nobody’s even close to explaining how it’s supposed to be a business.\n\nReal change often comes slowly and – such as new platforms, new ways to play and so on – looks rather ordinary. Facebook’s platform, for example, seemed incidental at first. We game developers were mostly nonplussed that it could ever be a thing because it was so trivial. But it rocked our world. The numbers started to roll in and we started to pay attention in a hurry. Twas ever thus.\n\nSo it’s with that in mind that I want to go out on a limb and say I think Microsoft is onto something with the HoloLens. I’m referring to a technology that the company showed at its Windows 10 event earlier this week. It seems to be an augmented reality system capable of projecting faux-holograms to an eyepiece you wear. The net effect is the wearer “sees” a hologram in space all around him, and to back this up Microsoft’s presentation showed high concept uses like a designer working on an application on a monitor, but with a projected 3D model appearing to the side. That kind of thing.\n\nThe HoloLens is not the first device to enter the facespace. That conversation has been occupied for a while by Oculus at the power end and Google Glass at the convenience end. In essence HoloLens is trying to blend the two, forming a high definition augmented reality system within a constrained space. Of course this all sounds enthusiastic and pretty hokey, and the reality of such a device would likely be more ordinary. (I don’t for example, really see office workers walking around wearing bulky headsets just to be on Skype calls.) But I do think it’s more interesting than it initially appears, especially for gaming. It can solve a perennial UI problem.\n\nIn many games the screen area is cluttered by a HUD, that is the numbers that show you how much health your character has left, or experience points or levels. Those numbers are an essential aspect of a game’s feedback system, but they bring a visual noise with them. In some cases they hem in the world of the game and make it less impactful. For games that are trying to be immersive or story-driven, for example, experience point counters dinging away at the top of the screen can be distracting. Conversely UI elements also need to be constrained so that they don’t interfere with the main game too much. So games often have muddled UI/world compromises that never feel quite right.\n\nIn other words they’re like this:\n\nNow with the HoloLens idea (as explained) the everyday use of the system is not to create over-elaborate holograms doing funky stuff whose utility is likely nil after the first day playing it. Rather it’s simple: It lets a game designer push all those awkward UI elements out of the main screen. Like so:\n\nIts seems trivial, but think about it. How many action, roleplaying, storytelling and other games would be improved by having 30% more screen area dedicated to the game world? And how cool would it be to have lots of numbers floating in mid-space to the sides of the game rather than be hemmed in by constraints of the game world? Plenty. And that would be of great interest to many players such as Call of Duty fans and the like. A solid segment of them would buy that peripheral if it worked.\n\nSo what’s the downside? Well to be honest, it’s Microsoft’s tendency to get lost in Microsoft-world. Here’s an example: A couple of years ago I faulted Microsoft’s original vision of the Xbox One as being far too grandiose and trying to solve big problems that no real-world person had. One example was the TV enhancement features of the console, a massively complicated system that amounted to little more than a slightly faster menu for your Comcast box. Though the company has come on a ways from those heady heights, it still tends to get a bit swooped up in what technology might do, to the point that it forgets what it should probably do.\n\nAnother example: I was recently given an Xbox One for Christmas (no Kinect) and it’s a powerful gaming machine. It plays Grand Theft Auto V, Geometry Wars 3, Alien Isolation and a bunch of other games just great. I’m not wild about the joypad (something about the positioning of the central buttons feels slightly off) but it works well enough. Its big problem, on the other hand, is the user interface for accessing games, movies and other content. It’s a complete mess with a variety of use-patterns that make sort-of sense within their different sections yet adhere to no discernible overall logic.\n\nMicrosoft often gets itself wrapped up in these kinds of problems, creating many of them in one release and then clawing back from the brink in the next. Windows 10, for example, does not look like a shining beacon on a hill. It’s good in reflection only of how Windows 8 was terrible, and even at that the company seems determined to jam as much cross-ecosystem widgets in as it possibly can. So the issue is whether Microsoft can make HoloLens real, or will it get lost in fantasy.\n\nMy big hope for HoloLens is that it’ll come out as a coherent product that works with Xboxes and PCs to make cool UIs for games. That’s it’s “every day” use. My big fear is that it becomes another Surface. Not the modern one, the old interactive-table which was a neat idea that never found its way into the light of day. My fear is that HoloLens becomes another Kinect 2, so mangled by ambitions that nobody in the company can make a simple case for why it exists. My fear is that Microsoft gets too all-encompassing with HoloLens, tying too many bells and whistles to it and losing its simple appeal.\n\nAll I want to do is play games that do cool things to make UI work better. Microsoft please just sell me that.",
  "latent_23700": "On Monday, Loretta Lynch, the U.S. Attorney General, and Pat McCrory, the governor of North Carolina, announced that they would be suing each another over the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, a new law requiring that North Carolinians use only the public bathrooms that correspond to the “biological sex” listed on their birth certificates. In Texas, a parallel conflict began brewing between the retailer Target, which has announced an open-bathroom policy for transgender employees, and the state’s attorney general, Ken Paxton. (Paxton has demanded, in a letter to Target’s C.E.O., that the company provide the full text of its “safety policies regarding the protection of women and children from those who would use the cover of Target's restroom policy for nefarious purposes.”) And in Chicago, a legal battle is being waged over which high-school locker room a transgender student ought to use. Yesterday, the Obama Administration issued a directive telling all public schools to allow students to use bathrooms or locker rooms matching their gender identities. Across the country, in other words, controversy is following transgender people who step into sex-segregated spaces.\n\nThis is familiar territory for Sheila Cavanagh, a professor of gender-and-sexuality studies at York University, in Toronto. Almost ten years ago, Cavanagh was teaching a graduate seminar on gender and sexuality. She’d assigned Freud’s “Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality,” but her students kept talking about bathrooms. “I thought they were so off-topic,” Cavanagh recalls. “Then I thought, Maybe I’m the one who’s off-topic.” Cavanagh began to think about the many stories she’d heard from queer and transgender friends about being harassed for going to the “wrong” bathroom; in 2010, she published a book based on interviews with one hundred L.B.T.Q.I. bathroom-goers, called “Queering Bathrooms: Gender, Sexuality, and the Hygienic Imagination.” I spoke to Cavanagh by phone earlier this week, hoping that she could explain why and how bathrooms have become a civil-rights flash point.\n\nAll of a sudden, non-trans people are talking about transgender people using gendered bathrooms. But I assume that transgender people have been talking about this for a long time.\n\nRight—it’s an old issue. People who are transgender or gender-variant, or who are perceived to be gender non-conforming, have always had difficulties in gendered bathrooms. And, if you think historically, you realize that we’ve always used bathrooms to segregate people. Up until the sixties, you had racially segregated bathrooms in the United States. We’ve only recently begun to build accessible bathrooms designed for people with mobility issues. So we’ve always used bathrooms to enforce social boundaries.\n\nHow does not having access to a bathroom—or not feeling welcome in the bathroom you want to use—affect a person's life?\n\nIf you can’t use the bathroom, it’s harder to go to school, to go to work, to buy groceries, to do things that many of us who are cisgender take for granted. It’s a real issue. I have discovered that a lot of people who are transgender don’t drink enough water over the course of the day. Because of the obstacles they face, they’ll go to great lengths to avoid using public bathrooms.\n\nMany of those who want to regulate bathroom access for transgender people cite safety concerns. They say that bathrooms are places where people are vulnerable—especially children.\n\nIn my research, I haven’t uncovered a single example of a trans person physically or sexually assaulting or harassing anyone in a bathroom. I have, however, uncovered many examples of cisgender people, both male and female, harassing or assaulting those who are transgender. A lot of the trans people I interviewed told me that, when they used the women’s bathroom, it wouldn’t be uncommon for non-trans women to yell at them or hit them with their purses. What gets socially coded as fear is often just masked transphobia—people know that it’s less acceptable to be transphobic than it is to say, “I worry about the safety of my daughter.”\n\nOpponents of transgender access often claim that they’re worried about people who_ _pretend to be transgender. For example, Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, has written about “those who would use the cover of Target's restroom policy for nefarious purposes.” They seem to be imagining a Peeping Tom scenario, in which the perpetrator is a cisgender man who, when confronted, claims to be transgender.\n\nI think that’s a far-fetched fear not based on actual evidence. I haven’t encountered any examples in my research of a sexual predator dressing as a woman, or in feminine clothing, to prey upon a non-trans woman in a restroom or a gymnasium. Most feminist studies on violence against women have shown that the safest spaces are actually gender-inclusive spaces that are open-concept and well-lit, with more than one door so that people can enter and exit in at least two ways.\n\nWhat is it about the bathroom? Why is it here—as opposed to, say, on a sports field—that controversy erupts?\n\nRecently, I read a fascinating article by an American historian who did research on what happened in the early twentieth century when doctors discovered that there were high rates of gonorrhea among young girls. The obvious cause of gonorrhea was childhood sexual abuse and incest. But, for a long time, doctors were too afraid to accuse white, middle-class fathers of acting “inappropriately” toward their daughters. Instead, they said that many of these cases of gonorrhea must be the result of these girls using public toilets. So it often seems as though the bathroom holds our anxieties and contains the taboos we can’t acknowledge in other public spaces. Bathrooms are also one of the last officially gender-segregated spaces in Canada and the United States—and, because of that, they give those of us who are cisgender an opportunity to question and interrogate the gender identities of others in a way that’s more difficult to do in gender-inclusive spaces. In other words, the gender signs on the doors give people license to police the gender identities of others in ways that are overtly transphobic.\n\nMany people who want to restrict bathroom access seem to feel that the very concept of gender is, in itself, under assault—that we are heading for a post-gender or genderless world.\n\nMost people who are trans are not trying to undermine gender, or to do away with it. Transgender people do, however, challenge bi-gender culture, which assumes that there are only two ways of being gendered—you’re either masculine or feminine, and if you’re born female you’ll grow up to be feminine and vice versa.\n\nOur bathroom regime is imperfect in many other ways: according to Harvey Molotch, a sociologist at N.Y.U. who’s written extensively about bathrooms, a truly equitable allocation of bathroom space would result in women’s bathrooms being two or perhaps even three times as big as men’s. So let’s imagine that we could start from scratch and create a bathroom utopia. What would it look like?\n\nI suspect that bathrooms in the West will always be changing and adapting to our ideas about bodies. I don’t think we’ll ever settle on a “perfect” bathroom. Personally, though, I love bathrooms that play gently and creatively with gender in ways that prompt us to think outside narrow and prescriptive gender dichotomies. In Montreal, there’s a place called the Whisky Café which has, in the “women’s room,” a standing female urinal. On the wall beside the urinal there are instructions for use. The invitation to stand can be liberating.\n\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity.",

  "latent_23788": "By Lesley Wroughton\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and Venezuela have embarked on their most extensive dialogue in years in an attempt to improve their acrimonious relations, according to a senior U.S. administration official.\n\nThe quiet diplomacy, the extent of which has not been previously reported, is a sign that U.S. detente with Communist Cuba may be helping to reshape another troubled Latin American relationship. The official, who has direct knowledge of the high-level talks, cautioned that the process is at an early stage.\n\nThe effort by Latin America's most ardently anti-Washington government and major U.S. oil supplier to improve relations comes as President Nicolas Maduro struggles with a decaying state-led economy that has been left more isolated by close ally Cuba's warming U.S. ties.\n\nMaduro made the first move in March - around three months after Washington and Havana announced on Dec. 17 they were seeking to restore diplomatic ties - by requesting a \"direct channel of communication\" with U.S. President Barack Obama and the State Department, said the official. Cuba and the United States announced on Wednesday they had agreed to restore ties.\n\n\"He realized that if we can talk to the Cubans, we can talk to him,\" the official told Reuters, adding: \"We approached it very carefully because we had seen this before, but there was also U.S. concern that the relationship was reaching such a dangerous point that it risked breaking completely.\"\n\nVenezuela's Foreign Ministry, presidency and national assembly did not respond to requests by Reuters for comment on the dialogue with Washington.\n\nVenezuelan officials say they are seeking to repair relations, which hit a nadir in March when Venezuela's socialist government ordered the United States to slash its embassy staff in Caracas and Washington imposed sanctions on top Venezuelan officials.\n\nThe two foes have toned down their confrontational rhetoric in recent weeks.\n\nIn a further sign of the improving atmosphere, Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is in Venezuela this week to meet both opposition and senior government figures as part of a fact-finding mission.\n\nTWO-TRACK APPROACH\n\nThe dialogue has developed into a two-track effort to separate areas of disagreement, such as Venezuela's clamp-down on domestic political opposition, from those of shared interest including peace talks in Colombia and elections in Haiti, the U.S. official said.\n\nRelations between the two countries have waxed and waned for over a decade, with periods of squabbling and diplomatic expulsions often followed by short-lived periods of conciliatory words.\n\nVenezuela's powerful parliamentary chief Diosdado Cabello has been involved in the talks even though he is a controversial figure, the official said. U.S. media in May reported that U.S. prosecutors were investigating Cabello for possible drug trafficking and money laundering. He denies the allegations.\n\nDuring a June 14 meeting in Haiti, U.S. officials pressed Cabello to set a date for parliamentary elections this year and to release political prisoners, including jailed opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, the U.S. official said.\n\nWashington made clear that if Lopez died from his hunger strike, which was partly in demand for an election date, it would signal the end of the dialogue.\n\nThe official said Cabello did not commit to setting an election date during the meeting. But a week later Venezuela's election authority, which had seemed to be stalling on a date for polls widely expected to be won by the opposition, announced they would be held on Dec. 6. Lopez ended his protest shortly thereafter, but remains in jail.\n\n\"We were very focused on keeping (Lopez) alive, and that meant engaging with the Venezuelans and telling them that Lopez's death would end our rapprochement efforts,\" the official said.\n\nThe official, who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak publicly on the subject, said it was important to engage Cabello because he is seen as a rival for power with Maduro, although the two deny it.\n\n\"The two most apparent power centers in the Venezuelan government are Maduro and Cabello,\" the U.S. official said. \"We knew we had to connect Cabello and Maduro in some way. Even though they insist they aren't, they are competitors.\"",

  "latent_24472": "BEIRUT -- Russian President Vladimir Putin caught nearly everyone by surprise with his Syria drawdown announcement. Little wonder: the Syria-led coalition forces had momentum behind them; they were on a roll, gaining ground sometimes even without a fight. Pat Lang, a former U.S. defense intelligence officer, noted that the so-called Islamic State appears to be \"collapsing in Syria and Iraq. They are starving to death as the money runs out, lost to R+6 and U.S. air action against oil exports through Turkey. At the same time, equipment and men are not coming down the reciprocal transport route from Turkey.\"\n\nAt this point, with the wind strongly behind him, President Putin calls a drawdown. It is not as if all has been settled militarily. Aleppo remains in limbo: partially encircled by jihadist forces, who themselves are surrounded by coalition forces led by the Syrian government and cut off from their supply lines. The fertile part of Syria that lies to the west of a line drawn from Aleppo in the north to Daraa in the south is yet to be secured. Eastern Syria, mostly desert, which is militarily of less strategic significance, remains largely in the hands of ISIS. And Turkey continues to nibble away at Syrian sovereignty, lobbing artillery shells over the border.\n\nWhy did Russia begin a drawdown now, with so much still to be accomplished? What might it mean for the political future of Syria?\n\nA pilot is greeted after returning from Syria at a Russian air base on March 16. (AP Photo)\n\nFirstly, this is a drawdown but also not a drawdown -- depending how you look at it. Those Russian airplanes that were designated to remain in Syria (and are not a part of the drawdown) are still actively supporting coalition forces on the ground, attacking insurgents who are not included in the ceasefire (principally Jabhat al-Nusra and ISIS). As one Russian military journalist told Radio Free Europe, \"The fleet remains; antiaircraft systems remain; the tanks remain; all the marines remain; the helicopters remain; some of the aircraft will remain. Only some of the aircraft and their service personnel are being taken out. And they can come back, of course, in the space of three or four hours.\"\n\nIn fact, the drawdown reportedly seems to have coincided with a planned rotation of aircraft and materiel -- necessary for maintenance after an intensive period of sorties. So call Putin's drawdown a rotation of forces if you prefer, a shift in tempo deliberately used to metastasize politics, to shock politics off the rails and onto new paths. It seems the Russian president may have succeeded in this: Secretary of State John Kerry is due in Moscow to meet Putin shortly.\n\nActually, it may turn out that Putin's aim was never to kick-start negotiations between the different Syrian parties, but instead to corner Washington -- to force the Obama administration into genuine cooperation with Russia -- rather than have it standing on the sidelines, chanting the refrain of a Russia predicted to fall flat on its face in a quagmire. That said, catalyzing a Syrian political process in one form or another is surely a subsidiary objective. Putin, from the outset, has said that the Russian military intervention had limited aims and was designed to \"create conditions for a political compromise.\"\n\n'And they can come back, of course, in the space of three or four hours.'\n\nPutin's drawdown -- or rotation -- undoubtedly galvanized the political framework in various ways. It puts pressure both on Damascus and on those opposition groups participating in the Geneva talks -- lest all the Russian aircraft are, for some reason, forced to return. More than anything, it puts the onus on the U.S. to stop its allies (Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar) from weaponizing and financing their proxies in this war. But can the U.S. impose this on its allies? Turkey is particularly problematic, as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan possibly needs the Syrian conflict to keep his hold on power.\n\nIn short, one tangible effect of the drawdown may be that the political negotiations are kicked upstairs, from the (disempowered) participants in Geneva to the external actors who sponsor and finance them.\n\nThis is not the first time that Putin has used a military drawback in order to try to galvanize a deadlocked political scene. Recall that in the lead up to the Minsk accords concerning Ukraine, Russia had temporarily turned off the military supply spigot to the Donbas militias in order to concentrate militia minds and perhaps to stop their military ambitions from running ahead of themselves.\n\nA Syrian solder stands near a car covered with photos of Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad. (AP Photo/Pavel Golovkin)\n\nThe common thread running through both the Ukraine and Syria conflicts has been the Russian leadership's overriding concern to deflect any Western or NATO dynamic toward confrontation with Russia. One of Putin's main priorities in launching his war on terrorism has precisely been to tease out some peer-to-peer cooperation with the U.S. as a prelude to resetting the relationship between both powers.\n\nThe Syria drawdown positions Russia well politically as a serious state in search of a political resolution. It may soften European will to maintain sanctions against Russia. And it may also help better position Russia for whomever succeeds Obama in the White House: an America that perceives itself humiliated in Syria by Russia and its allies' military prowess is less likely to participate in any reset, and more likely to do the reverse.\n\nAside from the question of whether the U.S. will respond, a question is left unanswered: What is it that Putin expects from Assad? In Ukraine, Russia sought loose federalism. But that seems inappropriate for Syria. So-called minorities have never been victims in Syria -- far from it. The Kurds were never treated as they were -- and still are -- in Turkey. Nor were Sunnis ostracized. They comprise the majority of the Syrian army today and have always been preeminent in the business world. Furthermore, Syria wasn't sectarian -- until recently when the creep of various forms of Wahhabism effectively sectarianized politics. Syria, after all, does have an identity. It is a proud and ancient nation.\n\nSyria, after all, does have an identity. It is a proud and ancient nation.\n\nWould Russia wish to see a weakened, loosely bound central government? Probably not. The war against radical jihadism is unlikely to be won through any accord reached in Geneva; it will endure. And Iran, Russia's ally, would certainly wish to see a strong Syria emerge in the end. Perhaps the U.S. would also see some merit in a strong Syria at a time when state structures throughout the Middle East are eroding and giving way to widespread human insecurity. But how to achieve it?\n\nRussia has said repeatedly that it must be the Syrian people who decide for themselves what government they want. This is Iranian policy too. But Putin cannot count on the Saudi-supported Syrian opposition arriving at an agreement with Assad in Geneva -- though he might hope this transpires. It is more likely he is relying on a Plan B.\n\nOne aspect of the recent cessation of hostilities that has escaped much attention is how local ceasefires during this period of quiet have been brokered by Russian army officers -- usually quite senior officers. Their efforts have been met with striking successes. More than 40 such ceasefires have been secured. Perhaps, if the Geneva process fails, we shall see a bottom-up process take over instead.\n\nA lineup of Russian troops is held before withdrawal at Hemeimeem air base in Syria on March 15. (Vadim Grishankin/Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP)\n\nOn the basis of these agreements, some of which have been negotiated by the United Nations and others by the Syrian government, local elections will eventually be held. Then regional. Then parliamentary. The constitution will be revised. And finally, presidential elections will be held under international supervision. In short, Syrians -- both at home and in exile -- would ultimately decide on their governance.\n\nBut for this outcome to be viable, trust between Russia and America is essential. It must be built. These are the only real political choices now that regime change has been removed from the agenda: a global agreement reached at Geneva or a bottom-up process conducted by the Syrians themselves (accompanied by continued war against the radical jihadists). Putin's surprise drawdown announcement seems intended to expose precisely whether there is indeed any trust available to find a path through to an eventual solution.\n\nA lot rides on the outcome. This is not just about Syria. It will serve to shape the global order, one way or another.\n\nAlso on WorldPost:",
  "latent_24504": "TAMPA, Fla. -- It's only April, but it might as well be Christmas for Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston, who couldn't stop smiling when he returned to One Buc Place this week for the start of the team's offseason program and the beginning of the all-important Year 3 of his development as a franchise quarterback.\n\n\"Getting an early Christmas present in DeSean Jackson in March, it was amazing,\" Winston gushed about the Bucs' top free-agent signing. \"The guy's like a Bentley with a Ferrari engine. You know what I'm saying? The guy can fly, but he's a cruiser, man. He's a cruiser. I can't really explain how excited I am about him right now because I'll probably go over my time, but I am excited to have DeSean Jackson as a Buccaneer.\"\n\nAnd then there's Mike Evans, whom the franchise extended a fifth-year option to Monday, and whom general manager Jason Licht said the team hoped to make a \"Buc for life.\" A generous new contract will be on the way for Evans soon, and deservedly so, after three straight 1,000-yard seasons. Of the franchise-record 28 touchdowns Winston threw last year, 12 were caught by Evans, and of the 345 passes Winston threw, Evans was on the receiving end of 96.\n\nJameis Winston said his goal simply is to get better every year. \"As long as I'm improving, the whole team is getting better,\" he said. Jonathan Dyer/USA Today Sports\n\n\"As long as I'm around here, you know I want Mike Evans here,\" Winston said. \"That's definitely a big thing for Mike. He's a great asset to this team. He's probably one of our most valuable players, so I'm excited for him. Definitely him and DeSean Jackson on the same team is going to be amazing.\"\n\nOf course, those new weapons won't work unless Winston does. Jackson can't take the top off a defense if Winston is overthrowing him downfield, putting too much heat on his fastball. Evans can't continue winning those 50-50 jump balls if Winston isn't putting his passes in a spot where only Evans can grab them. That's why Winston recently assembled those two, along with Derel Walker, Freddie Martino, Josh Huff and Bernard Reedy, for a series of workouts down in Houston.\n\nIt's also why he sought the help of trainer Tim Grover again this year. Grover, who trained Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, helped Winston transform his physique and his stamina last offseason with grueling workouts, along with an overhaul of his diet. The two also work on mental conditioning.\n\n\"He makes sure you hit everything,\" Winston said of Grover. \"He not only works on your core, not only works on your lower body -- he really works on your central nervous system. [He's] got me actually making decisions when I'm working exercises, so I'm doing a lot of great things.\"\n\nWinston made significant strides outside the pocket last year, where his completion percentage rose from 55.1 to 61.5. He went from throwing five touchdown passes outside the pocket in 2015 to 13 in 2016, tied with Aaron Rodgers for most by any quarterback since at least 2009, according to ESPN Stats & Information.\n\nHe was able to show more of the athletic ability that made him an exceptional dual-sport athlete at Florida State and allowed him to find Evans on some improbable plays, like the one against the Chicago Bears where he narrowly dodged a safety, eluding defenders for 11 seconds before hitting Evans downfield for a back-breaking 39-yard catch.\n\nBut he acknowledged that he has to cut down on turnovers -- both interceptions and fumbles -- something he struggled with at times in college, despite finishing with a brilliant 26-1 record.\n\nIn college, he was aided by a blue-chip roster that, in most cases, far exceeded the talent level of the opposition. If Winston threw an interception, the defense could force a three-and-out, get the ball back and Winston would get another shot, or they could run the ball down an opponent's throat. It's a far more level playing field in the NFL, with a much smaller margin for error.\n\n\"They've got to stop, but that comes with improvement,\" Winston said of the turnovers. \"So many [factors] create a turnover, so you can't really hit a specific thing because there are a lot of situations that we may encounter here and there. But the main thing is to limit them and stop hurting ourselves.\"\n\nIf Winston is going to make a play outside the pocket, rolling out on a bootleg or by scrambling, he has to demonstrate better awareness of where the pressure is, or the ball will get knocked loose by an opportunistic defender. His 10 fumbles this season tied him with Sam Bradford for third most among quarterbacks, and his six lost fumbles tied with Blake Bortles for the most in the league.\n\nHe also has worked a lot on his drops, where he takes a snap from the center and drops back to pass. It's important for a quarterback to nail down his footwork to create a strong throwing platform, and to help with the timing of his release and the trajectory of his throws.\n\n\"My goal is to get better every year, and as long as I'm getting better every year, I'm improving,\" Winston said. \"As long as I'm improving, the whole team is getting better. Scratching the surface -- I just want to do my job. I want to win football games and I want to be playing for the Bucs for a long time.\"",

  "latent_24836": "Gregory Shamus/Getty LeBron James and Kyrie Irving attempted to carry the Cleveland Cavaliers across the finish line, but ultimately fell short against the Golden State Warriors on Monday, losing 129-120 to lose the championship.\n\nOutmatched by the Warriors, James and Irving nonetheless put on an offensive spectacle for the second year in a row, scoring 67 combined points in Game 5 after scoring 71 combined points in Game 4 and 77 combined points in Game 3.\n\nAfter Game 5, James said he could accept the Finals loss because he knows he gave it his all. It seems fair to assume the same of Irving, who was dazzling offensively at times.\n\nAfter Game 5, Irving spoke at length at how James' work effort inspires him and how he hopes to maintain their relationship for years to come (via Sports Illustrated's Ben Golliver).\n\n\"Man, that guy is — I think that some people would say he's on the toe of — like he's on the line of greatness. But that guy is way over. Man, he's freaking awesome. As a student of the game, it would be a disservice to myself if I didn't try to learn as much as possible while I'm playing with this guy. Every single day demanding more out of himself, demanding more out of us, the true testament of a consummate professional. And understanding how things work, not only just in the game, but off the court, things that matter, just taking care of your body, understanding the magnitude of what the goal is at hand and what steps it takes in order to achieve that goal.\n\n\"You can't skip any steps. And that was one thing that I came to understand, because as a young player you want everything to happen right now. And 'Bron's been in this league for a while now, and he's seen every which way from on the court, to off the court, to dealing with some of you guys, to dealing with the whole world of just choosing a side. Whether you want to believe him or not, he's still coming.\n\n\"And that's the type of guy that I want to be with every single time I'm going to war, because I know what to expect, and you stand your ground, too, with a leader like that. You don't want to take a step back. You move to the front line with a guy like that, and you want to bring your game up to another level.\n\n\"That's what I'm going to continue to do, because I know that if we continue to be with one another and keep utilizing one another, man, the sky's the limit.\"\n\nIrving added another thought about what James accomplished, at age 32, in his seventh straight Finals, even in a losing effort.\n\n\"He left it all out there on the floor, and to average a triple-double in the freaking Finals, man — add that to the LeBron long list that everyone keeps forgetting.\"\n\nIt's unclear what the Cavs' future holds. There are already murmurs of James' dedication to the team. They have few means of drastically improving this offseason, and some think they need to drastically improve to contend with the Warriors.\n\nOne thing that seems certain, however, is the James-Irving duo is one that should be kept together for a long time.",

  "latent_24911": "Share Email 13 Shares\n\nBRATTLEBORO — The Vermont Judiciary wants to put the brakes on an alimony overhaul effort led by a Brattleboro businessman.\n\nIn a new report, the state Supreme Court’s Family Division Oversight Committee recommends adoption of new guidelines aimed at providing more “predictability and consistency” in the alimony process.\n\nGet all of VTDigger's daily news. You'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox.\n\nBut the committee also argues against adopting any mandatory regulations that might curb the ability of judges to consider unique factors in each alimony dispute.\n\nGuidelines that are too “rigid,” the committee’s Jan. 13 report says, “would be more likely to lead to unjust outcomes than no guidelines at all.”\n\nRick Fleming, president of Vermont Alimony Reform, said he’s disappointed in the committee’s conclusions and believes the report falls far short of a thorough review of the state’s alimony statute.\n\n“We are grateful that the Legislature has begun the discussion, and we’re hopeful that both the Senate and the House Judiciary committees hold hearings that will go beyond the scope of what was addressed in the report,” Fleming said Friday.\n\nThe dispute highlights two very different alimony reform efforts happening simultaneously in Vermont.\n\nOn one hand, the court’s Family Division Oversight Committee has been discussing alimony guidelines since 2008, issuing drafts in 2012 and again late last year. The committee seeks to buttress existing guidelines for attorneys and judges while not imposing hard-and-fast rules.\n\nVTDigger is underwritten by:\n\nOn the other hand, Vermont Alimony Reform is a relatively new group that wants an overhaul of the state’s alimony law. The statute is outdated and puts an unfair long-term burden on payers, reform advocates argue.\n\nVermont Alimony Reform took its case directly to legislators in 2016, using personal stories of men and women who are alimony payers and feel they’ve been wronged by the system.\n\nFleming has been candid about his own experiences, telling officials he’s been saddled with monthly alimony payments of more than $2,300 even as he was forced to sell his oil business amid an economic downturn. In 2013, the state Supreme Court ruled against Fleming in his efforts to lower his payments.\n\nThe reform group wants a variety of changes including replacing indefinite alimony with terms based on the length of a marriage; providing allowances for payers who want to retire; and terminating a payer’s obligations when a recipient remarries.\n\nModeling their efforts on alimony changes enacted in 2011 in Massachusetts, Vermont Alimony Reform members asked for creation of a task force to examine the issue. The idea, Fleming said, is that the task force would be “all-inclusive of all of the parties that are affected by spousal maintenance and alimony,” including payers.\n\nA few months into the 2016 legislative session, the task force idea gained traction in the Senate.\n\nBut by the end of the last session, legislation instead called for the Supreme Court’s Family Division Oversight Committee – made up of attorneys, judges and court staff – to produce an alimony reform report by Jan. 15.\n\nThat report says the Judicial branch has two main interests in the alimony reform debate.\n\nThe first is “having clear statutory language from the Legislature, which will enable judges to apply the alimony statute in a manner that is consistent from judge to judge and case to case.”\n\nAt the same time, however, the committee says its other priority is “maintaining a level of discretion in issuing alimony awards, as currently exists in the alimony statute … in order to address the unique facts and circumstances of individual families.”\n\nThe importance of judicial discretion is a theme that runs throughout the committee’s report.\n\nFor instance, the committee says it sought input on alimony reform from the family law section of the Vermont Bar Association. While attorneys offered various solutions, “virtually everyone … argued for allowing judges to retain the discretion they currently have,” the report says.\n\nSo the committee recommends preserving a statutory list of factors that must be considered in alimony cases. Those include age and health; length of marriage; each party’s “reasonable needs”; time and expenses for employment training; inflation; assets owned by each party; and the standard of living established during a marriage.\n\nAlso, the committee recommends that the Legislature should add more specific alimony guidelines focused on two factors: the length of a marriage and the difference between each party’s income. Those guidelines are arranged in a grid along with suggested durations for alimony payments, creating “a predictable range of outcomes,” documents say.\n\nFor Fleming, those outcomes are not nearly predictable enough.\n\nHe pointed to wide ranges of possible alimony awards within each category in the committee’s proposed guidelines. That doesn’t ensure consistency from case to case, Fleming argued.\n\n“We were looking for a defined set of guidelines that would clarify this for the judges,” he said.\n\nFleming also said the committee didn’t address key Vermont Alimony Reform concerns such as a payer’s retirement or change in financial circumstances and a receiver’s remarriage or cohabitation.\n\nFleming said his organization wanted “a good, open discussion about alimony reform, which really hasn’t happened since probably the late ’50s. (But) that didn’t happen.”\n\nThe Supreme Court committee’s report, written by Chief Superior Judge Brian Grearson, rebuts that argument in part by considering a number of alimony circumstances “where guidelines alone would not produce a fair result.”\n\nFurthermore, while the committee reviewed materials submitted by Vermont Alimony Reform, Grearson said the reform organization “speaks only from the payers’ perspective.”\n\n“There has been no voice from the recipients’ perspective, which may include those who received alimony and believed the award was fair, or those who received an award they believed was unfair, or those who were ordered to pay alimony and believed it was fair,” Grearson wrote.\n\nThe report can be viewed here:\n\nReport.to.Legislature.Spousal.Supp.Maint.guidelines.jan2017 (1)",

In order to set a Guinness World Record for the largest gathering of people dressed as Kahlo, participants of all genders, ages and races needed to carefully mimic the artist’s signature look: a knee-length dress (no slits), at least three flowers in their hair, a pink or red rebozo (shawl) around their shoulders, and, yes, a unibrow proudly displayed. Originally, the museum expected to attract around 250 eager fans, but Kahlo mania proved stronger than organizers thought. Over 1,000 Fridas helped the DMA along in its efforts.\n\n“More than 5,000 people turned out to celebrate Frida Kahlo’s 110th birthday” during Frida Fest, the museum told HuffPost in a statement, noting that just over 1,000 qualified for the world record attempt. Among them was a 13-year-old named Sofia Valadez who recounted her connection to Kahlo to Dallas News.\n\nI’ve recently looked up what Frida does and seen her self-portraits, and she’s so true to herself and proud of herself and it’s an inspiration. She’s such a strong, independent woman. And I like her eyebrows.\n\nThe DMA partnered with the Latino Center for Leadership Development for the event, and will submit evidence of their triumphant Frida feat this week. The museum expects the review process will take up to 12 weeks’ time. In the meantime, we’ve secured some of the so-called evidence of the record below.

  "latent_25216": "WASHINGTON -- Your parent is sick and aging. He needs a nursing home. And you've found what looks like a good one.\n\nBut as he is admitted, he is asked to sign a binding agreement stating that if he's ever harmed or believes he was mistreated, he won't sue. Instead, he'll go to binding arbitration and accept the outcome. He promises not to go to court -- and the nursing home asks him to sign that promise before it even gives him a bed.\n\nThis, say critics of the nursing home industry, is a standard practice that President Donald Trump not only wants to maintain but seeks to codify in a new federal rule. The Trump administration not only wants to reverse major parts of a rule signed in 2016 by President Barack Obama that would have banned arbitration agreements as part of the admission process. It also wants to make the rights of nursing homes clear in a federal rule.\n\nThe proposal has flown largely under the radar until now, a result of other issues and news crowding out the public's attention.\n\n\"This is the health care story that nobody talks about,\" said Remington Gregg, an attorney who works on civil rights and similar issues at Public Citizen.\n\nThe nursing home industry, in agreement with Trump, says it only wants what's best for seniors. That includes knowing that if a resident has a complaint, he or she can resolve it without the cost or bother of a court case, and without appeals that can drag on for years.\n\n\"The arbitration system can often help consumers get more rapid resolution to their concerns rather than pursuing the often time-consuming and costly court system,\" said a statement from the American Health Care Association, a national trade group that has taken the lead in this fight.\n\nCritics including an Ohioan named Linda Freier don't buy it, especially given the circumstances of when an arbitration agreement is presented -- right when someone needs a nursing home to admit him. The fact that the arbitration is binding, with extremely limited rights to appeal, only adds to the anger.\n\n\"This proposed regulation is an evil idea,\" Freier, whose hometown was not listed, said in electronic correspondence recently to the Centers for Medicaid and Medicaid Services, or CMS. \"How can you consider making captive victims out of the elderly? It's criminal and immoral to remove an aggrieved victim's right to justice in a court of law.\"\n\nAgreed U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat: \"Any family who has been through the transition of admitting a loved one into a nursing home will tell you it's a difficult time in the best of circumstances. Forcing those families to sign away their rights is not only wrong, it's dangerous.\"\n\nHere's how things got to this stage, and where they might go next.\n\nThe problem was building:\n\nBusinesses have long preferred arbitration over court trials. Their push to expand the practice grew with the help of appellate court decisions over the last three decades in employment and consumer contracts. When fairness or the right to a lawsuit were challenged, the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1980s ruled in favor of arbitration, noting that Congress in 1925 passed the Federal Arbitration Act to promote arbitration as an alternative to court trials.\n\nThe Obama White House and its appointees started pushing back, saying consumers had lost too many rights. Just this year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a rule to let people file or join group lawsuits when they think credit card companies or banks have ripped them off. This was a direct move to circumvent bank and credit card practices requiring customers to agree to arbitration and forego class actions.\n\nRepublicans in Congress are now trying to pass a law to overturn the bureau's rule.\n\nIn 2015, the same year the CFPB's director, Richard Cordray, started publicly raising his concerns about arbitration, CMS and some members of Congress wondered if a similar rule was needed for nursing homes. Thirty-four U.S. senators, including Ohio's Brown, wrote to CMS to say it should side with seniors rather than nursing homes.\n\n\"The decision to admit yourself or a loved one to a long-term care facility can be difficult,\" said the senators' letter. They said the pressure to make an on-the-spot decision about complex legal rights -- amid a confusing, paperwork-intensive admissions process and worries about health care, finances and family -- was unfair.\n\nMany other people agreed. When CMS put the question out for public feedback, it got 9,803 comments back.\n\nThe rule comes out:\n\nCMS issued its rule last Sept. 28 as part of a broader set of protections for nursing home residents. It barred any facility that took federal money from using pre-dispute binding arbitration agreements. Since the overwhelming majority of nursing home patients are on Medicare as well as Medicaid -- government programs for seniors and low-income Americans, especially those whose nursing home costs sap their savings -- the rule would apply to nearly every nursing home resident.\n\nThe rule was to take effect Nov. 28. AARP applauded it, calling it a win for consumers.\n\n\"Nursing home residents and their families will now have access to the courts to address misconduct such as neglect, sexual assault, and wrongful death,\" AARP executive vice president Nancy LeaMond said at the time.\n\nBut the nursing home industry, led by the American Health Care Association, quickly went to court. Filing in U.S. District Court in Mississippi along with several Mississippi nursing homes, the association said the Federal Arbitration Act clearly favored arbitration as a means to resolve disputes, and that CMS lacked the authority to impose its rule.\n\nU.S. District Judge Michael P. Mills agreed, issuing a preliminary injunction against the rule on Nov. 7. Mills said he understood the government's worries. He even mentioned in his ruling that he was well aware from his judicial experience that a nursing home patient's competency and state of mind can cloud decision-making. But he said he had to rule on the basis of established law, so he blocked the Obama rule.\n\nThis was one day before the presidential election that saw Trump, a Republican, win the White House.\n\nCMS calls a time-out, then a halt:\n\nStill reporting to Obama and led by an Obama appointee, CMS soon appealed the judge's ruling to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThen Trump took office.\n\nHis administration first asked for time to consider how it should proceed. Then in June, it officially had the appeal dropped. That meant the last legal action -- the judge's order that allowed nursing homes to keep requiring residents to sign arbitration agreements -- was the law of the land. But proposing to end any ambiguity, within days CMS -- now with a Trump-appointed director, Seema Verma -- issued a proposal to clarify the Obama rule.\n\nThe top point, from the CMS announcement: \"The prohibition on pre-dispute binding arbitration agreements is removed.\"\n\nA question of coercion:\n\nThis is not simply a matter of which method is best for resolving disputes over patient safety, accidents or complaints. It's about an imbalance of power, advocates for seniors say.\n\nThey use a word that makes nursing home executives cringe: coercion.\n\nArbitration agreements are typically presented when a new resident enters a nursing home. There is an implication: Agree to this, or find some other place that will care for you.\n\nThe agreements, said Joanne Doroshow, executive director at New York University's Center for Justice and Democracy, \"are coercive.\"\n\nOr as a commenter from Ohio wrote in a message to CMS in June, without providing a name, \"This proposal is just WRONG!!! No one should ever be forced to give up their rights unless they have committed and been convicted of a crime! This is just WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!!!!\"\n\nThe nursing home industry says critics have it all wrong.\n\nArbitration agreements are \"fairly standard,\" conceded Peter Van Runkle, executive director of the Ohio Health Care Association, a trade group representing nursing homes. But he said \"it's important to note that it's not a standard for admission -- that someone wouldn't be denied admission if they didn't agree to it.\"\n\nThe industry frowns on coercion, he said, and it's \"not very common.\"\n\nCritics counter that the coercion may not be direct but it is certainly implied, especially when the stress of the situation -- a need for care, a leave from one's home, a new setting -- can be immense.\n\nBut even if signing is completely voluntary, what does a resident get from it?\n\nA speedy and fair resolution in the event of a dispute, Van Runkle and others in the industry say.\n\n\"What you don't have is a jury,\" he said. \"You don't get to have your lottery card,\" or the chance of using a lawsuit to strike it rich.\n\nWhat happens next:\n\nAs a practical matter, this is where matters stand. It is perfectly fine for a nursing home to have a resident -- a new one or one who is renewing an old contract -- sign a binding arbitration agreement.\n\nBut this might not be the end. CMS said in a public notice on June 15 that it also wants to be sure arbitration agreements are written and explained in plain English and that the arbitration policy be posted in a place where visitors and residents can see it.\n\nCMS also said it recognizes \"that there are concerns that these agreements should be prohibited in the case of nursing home residents. Therefore, we are also soliciting comments on whether binding arbitration agreements should be prohibited.\"\n\nIn other words, there is a chance CMS could change its mind.\n\nAdvocates for the elderly and public interest groups don't expect that. They note that the Trump administration has already made itself clear -- first by dropping the court appeal, then by stating it wants a rule to codify its position. Some congressional Democrats say they share that worry.\n\nAsked about the issue, Ohio's Brown said in a statement that he recognizes the valuable work nursing homes perform. Still, he said on Wednesday, \"just yesterday an Ohioan reached out to my office because his wife had been abused in a nursing home - and we get heartbreaking calls like his all too often.\n\n\"It's CMS's job to protect Ohioans like him and his wife, and I'm doing everything I can to urge the administration to protect their rights,\" Brown said.\n\nThe period for submitting comments ends Monday, Aug. 7. As of Wednesday, there were 372 comments, most saying seniors deserved protections.\n\nCMS has not said how long it will take to review the comments and made a final decision.",
  "latent_25244": "Donald Trump Is the Peace Candidate\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for inviting me to speak here at the Democratic National Convention. Like so many of you, I came here intending to support Bernie Sanders, or maybe Hillary Clinton, or at least Michelle Obama, who gave a kick-ass speech. But also like so many of you, I have found myself asking, time and again, “Yes, Hillary, I get that it would be cool to have a female president, but how do you intend to bring about world peace?”\n\nBecause let’s face it, my fellow Americans, Hillary is not that persuasive as the peace candidate. There was that whole Iraq War vote thing, for instance, for which I forgive her, though the Iraqis may not. And there was the Libya intervention thing and the “I want to do an unspecified something more in Syria” thing. Worst of all, Clinton seems utterly determined to bait the Russian bear. She denounced Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea as “illegal,” and she even once compared Russian President Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler, which, as everyone knows, is not a nice thing to say about someone, even if he is sort of like Hitler.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, these are not the actions of a woman who wants world peace. Remember, folks, Russia’s superpower status may have slipped a little in recent decades, but Putin still controls about 8,000 nuclear weapons. Is it really a good idea to make this guy mad?\n\nThat’s why I am here in Philadelphia today to tell you that I have changed my mind. Sure, I would love to see a woman in the Oval Office one of these days, but let’s get our priorities straight. Reducing global conflict and preventing nuclear Armageddon has to take priority over giving a little something to the girls. So here’s what I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen: I’m voting for Donald Trump, peace candidate!\n\nIt’s simple. Donald Trump is the only candidate we can count on to end 70 years of dangerous tensions with Russia — the only candidate who is actively extending a hand of friendship to our longtime adversary. Where Hillary Clinton has mocked and criticized Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump has speculated that the Russian president might someday become his “new best friend.” Where Clinton once sneered that Putin “doesn’t have a soul,” Trump has compassionately noted: “It’s never been proven that he’s killed anybody.”\n\nIn fact, Trump and Putin seem poised for a relationship that’s truly special. Trump has called Putin “very bright” and praised him as a “strong leader … a powerful leader,” while Putin has described Trump as a “really brilliant and talented person, without any doubt … the absolute leader in the presidential race.” True, some people have argued that, if properly translated, Putin’s words were not quite that adulatory, but let’s not be picky! In a world so painfully full of violence and discord, it is a truly beautiful thing to see two strong, masculine men openly expressing their admiration for one another.\n\nBut it’s not just a matter of a few personal compliments: Trump has made it clear that if elected, he’ll adopt policies designed to reassure Moscow of his good intentions. Where Clinton has denounced Russia’s actions in Ukraine and suggested that NATO should serve as a counterweight to Russian territorial expansionism, Trump has dismissed NATO as “very obsolete” and suggested he might be reluctant to defend America’s allies against a Russian invasion. Where Clinton has called for tougher sanctions in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea, Trump has magnanimously declared his willingness to consider recognizing Moscow’s sovereignty over Crimea and his openness to eliminating U.S. sanctions against Russia. And where Clinton has condemned the alleged Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee’s email servers, Trump has taken the opposite tack, inviting Russia to hack into Hillary Clinton’s emails as well. True friends share secrets!\n\nImagine, my fellow Americans, a world permanently freed from the once omnipresent fear of nuclear conflict between two great superpowers. Imagine a world in which Russia and the United States stand together as friends and allies — a world in which Donald and Vladimir stand together, hand in hand. To echo Donald Trump’s moving words after the Republican National Convention, what a love-filled world that would be!\n\nWith a Trump presidency, we will finally see two great nations, once bitter enemies, co-sponsoring Miss Universe competitions together and harmoniously collaborating to destroy what’s left of Syria. Together, our two great nations can joyfully divvy up the Baltic and Central Asian states between them. Together, our two great presidents can share ideas on how to undermine the legislative and judicial branches of government — and together, they will pioneer new ways to confound the Fourth Estate and bamboozle their fearful publics.\n\nMy fellow Americans, a Hillary Clinton presidency would be a catastrophe, dangerously increasing the risk of deadly military confrontation with Russia. In a Trump presidency, however, decades of competition and distrust will give way to festive pool parties featuring lovely ladies, fierce leopards, and gleeful cries of “You’re fired!” When Trump and Putin launch the first-ever U.S.-Russian reality TV series, who will want realpolitik?\n\nLadies and gentlemen, please join me in supporting Donald Trump — the one candidate who promises peace in our time!\n\nPhoto credit: Gage Skidmore/Wikimedia Commons",

Thanks so much for joining us.\n\n18.01 Here's the story my colleague Christopher Hope has filed about those \"rumours\" Nigel Farage referred to in his speech.\n\nNigel Farage has accused his political opponents of trying to undermine his leadership by spreading rumours about his health.\n\nThe UK Independence Party leader used his key note address to the party’s spring conference to say that rumours of his demise had been “exaggerated”.\n\nMr Farage also told his cheering audience that intended to lead the party for decades to come, scotching suggestions that one of his two MPs Mark Reckless or Douglas Carswell might try to lead it.\n\nMr Farage has been criticsed for keeping a low profile for the first two months of the year while his Tory and Labour rivals have been campaigning publicly.\n\nHe told an audience in Margate: “Over the past four or five weeks there has been some speculation about my whereabouts – we are not going to play the same game as the other party leaders who are boring the great British public to death\n\n“There has been a lot of speculation about where have I been, why have not been on the television all the time. This has been led to my opponents to spread some speculation about my health that I am seriously ill and that is why I have not been seen.\n\n“I hate to disappoint my opponents but can I make it clear that rumours of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.”\n\n17.35 So what are the takeaways from Nigel Farage's brief address to conference? Apart from those weird hints about his health, it was fascinating to hear him declare that he wants to remain leader for the foreseeable. Sorry Douglas Carswell.\n\n17.29 Mr Farage has responded to today's poll suggesting more people than before believe his party is racist. He tells Vicki Young that while the media is partly to blame for the impression, some comments from members haven't helped:\n\n<noframe>Twitter: Vicki Young - Nigel Farage tells me he's \"not surprised\" more people than last year think <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23UKIP\" target=\"_blank\">#UKIP</a> is a racist party.</noframe>\n\n17.22 Here's Dan Hodge's verdict on today's events:\n\nNigel Farage has just launched Ukip’s election crusade. “Everything about our campaign is going to be positive”, he declared, to the cheers of the Ukip faithful.\n\nPeople may not like the leader of the people’s army, but you have to admire his front.\n\n“Everything about our campaign is going to be positive”.\n\nLast time he launched a campaign was the European elections. He was stood in front of a poster of a burning Union Jack.\n\nSince then Mr Farage has attacked Romanians. Told us about his discomfort at people on public transport speaking in foreign languages. Warned that 26 million Europeans were after our jobs. Blamed immigrants for congestion on the M3. Endorsed the reclassification of second generation Britons as hidden migrants. Floated - all be it briefly - a policy of enforced repatriation.\n\nBut, apparently, all that is in the past. Turning to the issue of immigration, he said the time had come for Ukip to insert “a positive note into this debate”. To underline the point he then pledged to introduce an Australian style points system for immigrants, and slash overseas aid.\n\n“Everything about our campaign is going to be positive”.\n\nAs Nigel Farage wound up, his candidates and activists broke into a slightly sinister chant of “Ukip! Ukip! Ukip!”. Only time will tell if they’d been listening.\n\n17.10 Nigel Farage sounds kind of exhausted even on Twitter:\n\n<noframe>Twitter: Nigel Farage - After my speech at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23UKIPSpring\" target=\"_blank\">#UKIPSpring</a> onto a round of interviews.

Now he will have turned attention on to what those rumours are. We will have to see if he will tell us afterwards. This speech seems unrehearsed and clunky to me - what was he doing on the plane?\n\n16.43 Michael Deacon agrees that Nigel Farage has set tongues wagging - but not about his policies:\n\nWeird. Farage speaks about \"rumours that I'm seriously ill\", then says \"rumours of my demise have been greatly exaggerated\". 1) What rumours? Most people won't have heard any such rumours (I hadn't); mentioning the rumours at all merely serves to spread them. Now people will begin to wonder whether there's some truth in them. 2) \"Rumours of my demise have been greatly exaggerated\" isn't actually a denial that he's ill; intentionally or not, it's a classic \"non-denial denial\". As I said: weird.\n\n16.42 How strange - Farage has finished already. He said he wanted to lead the party for \"every election\" and declared that Ukip was the main force against Labour \"from Birmingham to Hadrian's Wall, but his abrupt departure left rather more questions than answers.\n\n16.41 Christopher Hope isn't too impressed:\n\nNigel Farage turns to the imigration figures yesterday. A day later. He wasn't here. Looks casual and poor.\n\n16.36 Farage has just given a shout-out to The Express. He goes on:\n\nI have to tell you: I am optimistic, I am upbeat, I am bullish.\n\n16.34 Want to watch Nigel Farage yourself? It's being livestreamed here.\n\n16.26 More from Christopher Hope:\n\nNigel Farage says: \"Rumours of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.\" He asks if his supporters had seen the Survation poll giving him an 11 point lead in South Thanet. They shout: \"Yes!\" He replies: \"Good!\" Before he goes on to criticise hostile commentators in The Times newspaper. He seems very defensive.\n\n16.24 Christopher Hope is watching the speech for us:\n\nNigel Farage arrives on stage to the strains of “I’m a Believer” by the Monkees. Where has he been all day? Looks like a dereliction of duty. He opens with a bold claim: Ukip is a \"serious challenger to win four or five seats in this county alone\".\n\n16.19 And here we go. Nigel Farage is about to speak. He walks onstage to I'm a Believer by the Monkees. Cool.\n\n15.43 This is from Christopher Hope:\n\nMore trouble from the Ukip foot soldiers for the senior Ukip leadership (Nigel Farage is finally here after bizarrely staying away from his own conference for most of the day).\n\nA leaflet labelled as produced by \"Christian Soliders in Ukip\" was being handed out to members inside the Winter Gardens.\n\nIt accused the gay community of a \"recruitment drive\" in primary schools.\n\n\"The state is allowing the sexual grooming of our primary school children for same sex attraction,\" the leaflet said.\n\nKids were being \"indoctrinated\" to \"confuse theIr gender identity\" and \"think about and sing songs about same sex attraction\".\n\n\"What the LGBT (lesbian, gay bisexual and transgender community) is achieving, of course, is a recruitment drive,\" it went on. \"As such people cannot reproduce their own kind they must recruit fresh 'blood' and this is best done among children in schools, the younger the better.\n\n\"The government, through (Michael) Gove and (Nicky) Morgan, has given them carte blanche.\"\n\nA Ukip spokesman said the distributors of the leaflets had been asked to stop.\n\n\"They are an affiliated organisation, but they do not represent the party,\" he added.\n\n15.38 And more from Michael Deacon about a certain broadcaster:\n\nThanks to Ukip: The First 100 Days, the not entirely sympathetic docudrama it broadcast earlier this month, Channel 4 is not popular at Ukip conference. Immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe joked that he'd like to \"take it over\". \"Close it down! Close it down!\" shouted members of the audience (unlike Woolfe, they didn't sound as if they were joking). William Dartmouth, international trade spokesman, said Channel 4's \"values\" were \"falsehood, innuendo and smear\". (He definitely wasn't joking.)\n\nYet, while they have a lot to say about Channel 4's programme, no Ukip speaker has so far mentioned the BBC's Meet the Ukippers, the documentary shown this week that featured a Ukip councillor saying on camera that she had \"a problem with negroes\"...\n\n15.27 Clarification from Michael Deacon:\n\n<noframe>Twitter: Michael Deacon - FOREIGN AID UPDATE: Ukip man says he was referring to people in Burkina Faso being given money for a dance class. So now you know</noframe>\n\n15.24 The Telegraph Lobby team used to have competition to see who could spot the most men in red trousers at Conservative Conference. I can reveal that there have been defections to Ukip...\n\n15.21 Michael Deacon is having a hard time following the current speaker, MEP Nathan Gill:\n\n<noframe>Twitter: Michael Deacon - Ukip speaker on foreign aid: \"It's not so much teach a man to fish, as teach a man to DANCE.\" (I'll clarify this line if and when he does)</noframe>\n\n15.18 Drumroll .... Nigel Farage is in the building.\n\n15.16 MEP William Dartmouth is speaking now. He pledges that departing the European Union will not mean British businesses will be unable to play a role in EU markets.\n\n\"We would absolutely not be leaving EU markets when we exit the EU.\n\n\"When we exit the EU, we would regain our ability to negotiate our own trade agreements for ourselves. \"\n\n15.11 Christopher Hope is back:\n\nThere is some serious upset among Ukip insiders that Nigel Farage is only arriving at his spring conference at 4pm. He spoke to a half-empty hall in America on Thursday afternoon and flew in today. It meant that he lost any chance to comment on the migration statistics (an open goal provided by the ONS), and is not on the platform for most of the day at the winter gardens in Margate. Senior Ukippers are calling it a wasted opportunity – and it is not hard to agree.\n\n14.43 From Michael Deacon, the Telegraph's sketch writer\n\nJust been to a fringe event for Ukip women. It was at the equivalent conference event 18 months ago, incidentally, that Godfrey Bloom voiced his considered opinion about women and fridges. Lacking Mr Bloom, who is no longer with Ukip, this lunchtime's event sadly wasn't quite so explosive.\n\nThe subject was women on boards. Ukip women - or at least the speakers, Suzanne Evans and Janice Atkinson - are against quotas, because they're \"patronising\". Evans: \"I don't want to be a tick in an equality box!\" Atkinson: \"I don't need to drive a pink van! And neither does Nigel Farage!\" I'm sure he doesn't, but I'd pay to see it.\n\n14.10 More from Christopher Hope at the conference in Margate:\n\nMigrants coming to the UK are putting pressure on its sewerage system, the party’s immigration spokesman has said.\n\nUkip immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe stressed the party was not anti-immigration or anti-immigrant. But he argued that the number of incomers had put strain on infrastructure such as schools, hospitals and the sewerage system.\n\nThe public did not care about “colour of skin or race or creed\" because they \"believe in this country, they believe in Britain and they believe in its values\".\n\nMr Woolfe told hundreds of activists at the party’s spring conference in Margate: “What they are concerned about is that our eye has been taken off the ball for nearly a generation.\n\n\"Schools are now full, hospitals are troubled, healthcare it is very difficult to be seen in many areas of this country.\n\n\"Roads need to be built, we need to look at the way we feed ourselves because of our growing population.\n\n\"What about our water and sewage systems? All of these matter.\"\n\n13.44 Christopher Hope brings us this from Margate:\n\nThe leader of the UK Independence Party’s lesbian, gay and bisexual group has quit, accusing the party of homophobia.\n\nTom Booker, who founded Ukip’s LGBT group in 2012, accused the party of being “too keen to entertain” homophobic elements inside the party.\n\nMr Booker was also critical of Nigel Farage, the party’s leader, for his “appalling and shameful” comments about HIV sufferers, and the party’s stance on gay marriage.\n\nHe gave this statement to The Telegraph this morning:\n\nAfter careful consideration and deliberation over the last couple of months, I decided that I could no longer support UKIP nor lead the group I co-founded back in 2012 (LGBT* in UKIP).\n\nThe reasons are two-fold:\n\n1). Nigel Farage used to profess that UKIP were different to the \"LibLabCon\". Farage used to say that there were \"three social democratic parties\"; under his leadership, there are now four.\n\nUKIP's strategy for policy increasingly seems to be to ignore classical liberal principles and policies in favour of wooing Old Labour voters: policies that incur protectionist measures, an opposition to drug law reform and the infamous opposition to same-sex marriage being just a handful of examples.\n\nThis strategy is particularly noticeable recently with the row over the NHS, as UKIP plead desperately that, rather than put out a sensible plan for genuine, radical reform of the NHS, they will invest £3bn more annually into it (taken from money we currently give to the EU) and end current PFI contracts with no proposals for what will take the place of those contracts.\n\nWhile the Party painstakingly talks of an immigration policy that favours those from outside the EU as inside it, the recently published \"100 reasons to vote for UKIP\" list states: \"Migrants will only be eligible for residency after 10 years' working here\" - a clear disincentive for free movement of capital and a hindrance to free trade in a globalised world.\n\nUKIP's current stance as a reactionary 4th social democratic party and its increased popularity with sections of the electorate also seems to have harmed the very cause it was initially set up to support.\n\nAccording to Yougov, since September 2011 the gap between those who want withdrawal from the European Union and those who support staying with the EU has decreased significantly; only 3 days ago, support for staying in the EU has reached an all time high of 45%, with only 35% of those polled supporting a withdrawal. The reduction of support for EU withdrawal appears to correlate somewhat with the widespread coverage of UKIP and the increase for its support: UKIP are eroding, under Farage, any hope for an independent Britain.\n\nIt is inevitable that as parties become more popular with the public, they wish to broaden their scope to garner further electoral support. However, UKIP's policy direction ebbs further away from a principled, classical liberal stance in favour of populism (masked as \"Common Sense\"), and I therefore can no longer vouch for it.\n\n2). The party has not come to terms with the era of increasing LGBT acceptance, and seems too keen to entertain elements within itself that want Britain to go the opposite way (see, for example, the Christian Soldiers in UKIP, who recently the Party distanced itself from but made no attempt to discipline or remove those members who thought it right to publish homophobia under a UKIP banner).\n\nThere are elements within the party that feel the same way, and they must consider their response to UKIP's utter lack of progress.\n\nUKIP have not expressed any retraction on their stance on same-sex marriage, despite the fact their scaremongering about ECHR cases have not been realised (in 'Schalk and Kopf v Austria (2010)', the ECtHR clarified that the Convention puts no obligation on member states to legislate for or legally recognise same-sex marriages). And Farage's remark in October that the quality of immigrant he wants to come to the UK includes \"people who do not have HIV to be frank. That's a good start\" was appalling and shameful; it could have undone years of removing the stigma associated with those whom are HIV positive. If responsible talk saves lives, then irresponsible talk - particularly from influential figures - can surely put lives at risk.\n\nIt is obvious that there are tensions in UKIP, but people are too scared to address them, and many liberal-minded people have consequently left the party over the past few years.\n\nFinally, now is the time for other party members to consider their answer to the clear conflict between the party's present addiction to short-term political sugar rushes and a long-term principled stance that will provide a modern, electable alternative to the three main parties.\"\n\n13.15 ComRes has done a poll for ITV this afternoon showing that Ukip is the most trusted party on immigration policy, which is perhaps to be expected, and the least on the NHS, which is more of a surprise.\n\nUkip is also the party most likely to be seen as “nasty.” Worryingly for those gathered in Margate, a whopping 44 per cent of voters say they believe Ukip is racist, while 43 per cent describe it as unprofessional.\n\nOn a happier note, a quarter of the public say Mr Farage is a strong leader, the second highest rating for any leader after David Cameron. A third say Ukip is \"honest\" and 29 per cent say the party has sensible policies.\n\n12.59 More from Mr Fila:\n\n<noframe>Twitter: UKIP - .<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/UKIPedwardfila\" target=\"_blank\">@UKIPedwardfila</a>: \"As a second generation immigrant and parliamentary candidate for Stratford on Avon, I am honoured to represent UKIP\"</noframe>\n\n12.54 Now conference hears from Edward Fila, who says he is a second generation immigrant - both his parents were born in Poland. Part of the mission to show Ukip is a broadly based party, and doesn't just appeal to little Englanders.\n\nI am proud to be British and never considered myself to ever be anything different.\"\n\n12.44 Now Harjit Gill, the former Labour mayor of Gloucester, is speaking. He says:\n\nUKIP is the only party in this country that reflects the realities of modern Britain.\n\n\"We simply want a controlled immigration policy to like Australia, Canada and many other countries of this world.\"\n\n12.41 Ukippers are not so keen on Channel 4, following its docudrama The First 100 Days which featured an imaginary Ukip government. Much booing in the hall at mentions of the broadcaster and cries of \"close it down, close it down\".\n\n12.39 Suzanne Evans has given a bullish performance on the Daily Politics show, saying Nigel Farage's address to an empty hall in Washington DC will be the last time he ever faces such a thin audience.\n\n12.36 Michael Deacon is concerned about Roger Helmer's absence, pointing out no reason has been given for it. C'mon Roger - let us know you're OK.\n\n12.33 The party's first MP, Douglas Carswell, has some words for we sneerers:\n\n<noframe>Twitter: Douglas Carswell MP - They might sneer in SW1. But in Thanet, Ukip has an 11 point lead .....</noframe>\n\n12.02 The definitive souvenir list from Michael Deacon:\n\n* Ukip-branded condoms (slogan on packet: \"Don't Waste an Election\"\n\n* Actual Ukip fruitcake\n\n* Ukip necklace (£12)\n\n* Ukip fox brooch (to symbolise the \"Ukip fox\" entering the \"Westminster hen house\")\n\n* Shopping bags decorated with Nigel Farage's face\n\n* Herman Van Rompuy tea towel (or \"damp rag\")\n\n* Booklet on foreign aid, whose cover features the title \"8 Reasons for Cutting Foreign Aid\" directly above a large photo of a sad-eyed black child. (The booklet argues that cutting aid will \"benefit the third world\")\n\n11.58 Christopher Hope brings us news of another glaring absence.\n\nOh dear. Roger Helmer \"sends his apologies\" and has not come to the Ukip conference to present his speech on climate change. What a shame. Instead Paul Oakden is giving his speech. We will miss him.\n\n11.56 Mr Nuttall has promised to deliver English Votes for English Laws as a means of keeping the Union intact.\n\n11.48 Here's another video recorded by Peter Foster during Mr Farage's trip to the United States yesterday. The Ukip leader described yesterday's immigration figures as \"judgement day\" for David Cameron:\n\nUkip leader Nigel Farage says the news that net migration to the UK has risen to 298,000, well above the level of migration when David Cameron came to power in 2010, shows that the government has failed\n\n11.44 Paul Nuttall, the party's deputy leader, is now speaking. Christopher Hope reports:\n\nUkip is the \"only party with electoral representation in all four parts of the United Kingdom\", says Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall. Interesting claim which might needle the Conservative and Unionist party (the Tories).\n\n<noframe>Twitter: Isabel Hardman - To be fair, if we are at the Ukip conference to take the piss, we also do the same at the other party conferences.</noframe>\n\n11.41 There is a lot of grumbling from Ukip activists and supporters about the media's coverage of their spring conference. I'm with The Spectator's Isabel Hardman on this one:\n\n11.36 Christopher Hope has identified a teeny issue:\n\nFirst problem for Ukip at its conference in Margate. Suzanne Evans, who replaced Tim Akers as the party’s policy chief, said on January 20: \"I relish the task of presenting a sensible, radical and fully costed manifesto at our spring conference in Margate.\"\n\nBut today there is no sign of it. Instead she makes fun of the whacky manifesto proposals from the 2010 manifesto, and suggests she has finished the document full of “authentic, fresh, realistic policy ideas”. She says that party will end health tourism, axe HS2 etc. But as things stand – no sign of any detail.\n\n11.30 Peter Foster managed to get a few minutes with Mr Farage in DC. He described Jihadi John and those like him as a \"fifth column\":\n\nIn the wake of Jihadi John's identity revealed as Mohammed Emwazi, Ukip Leader Nigel Farage says it shows that there is \"fifth column in living western countries\" </iframe</p> <p> <strong>11.25 </strong>See, we do read the comments. hettygetty and ChrisH make a fair response to Michael Deacon: </p> <p> <i><img alt=\"Quote\" src=\"https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01817/quotes_1817837a.gif\" width=\"45\" height=\"40\" align=\"left\"> </i>Oh yes you hacks, especially Deacon, many of us UKIP members are at work, keeping other people in jobs, so don't expect vast numbers there during the daytime! </p> <p> \"It's actually good that there isn't huge number people at the UKIP conference.

The atmosphere in the hall that day was excited, confident, raucous.\n\nToday's, by comparison, seems quiet, almost sleepy. There are a lot of empty seats at the back of the hall and to the left of the stage. The opening speaker began by shouting, as a prompt to the audience, \"Some people in the media think we've peaked. Have we peaked?\" The audience's reply of \"No\" wasn't quite as loud and defiant as he'd expected. \"All right, let's try that again...\"\n\n10.56 Christopher Hope says:\n\nLouise Bours MEP is setting out the party’s health policy, a key battleground with Labour. Ukip will bring an end to health tourism, she says: “It is the National Health Service, not the international health service.” There is more money for dementia (more than the Conservatives). Then she says Ukip will “abolish” extortionate hospital car parking charges.\n\n10.50 Mrs Bours has also now promised that Ukip would end car parking fees at NHS hospitals and pledged to stamp out \"health tourism,\" saving the NHS £2 billion a year.\n\n10.46 Ukip believe they can snatch the issue of the NHS away from Labour - outweaponising them, perhaps? MEP Louise Bours has just made this pledge to the conference:\n\nThere must be an unwavering focus on patient care and patient outcomes. These must always come first in decision-making.\n\n\"The NHS will remain free at the point of delivery and in time of need for all British citizens and qualifying foreign nationals.\n\n\"UKIP pledges an additional £3 billion more for the NHS every year.\"\n\n10.43 From Michael Deacon:\n\nUkip's Suzanne Evans: Cameron and Miliband are \"Little Englanders\" because they \"jump at Frau Merkel's every command.\"\n\n10.37 Suzanne Evans is now on the stage and is keen to stress the message that Ukip is no longer a joke party. \"I relish the task of presenting a sensible, radical and fully costed manifesto at our spring conference in Margate,\" she says.\n\n<noframe>Twitter: Michael Deacon - Ukip's Suzanne Evans announces manifesto will not repeat 2010 pledges to make taxi drivers wear uniform and enforce smart dress at theatres</noframe>\n\n10.31 This from Christopher Hope:\n\nUkip is the party of the NHS,\" Mark Reckless MP tells the spring conference in Margate.\n\n10.28 The main reason for the seaside gathering is a bit of geeing up and motivation ahead of the General Election which is just 68 days away now. But there is also a policy announcement. Economic spokesman Patrick O'Flynn is set to say that Ukip would match the Tories' pledge to tackle the deficit by 2018. He's just told the BBC Ukip in Coalition talks would \"hold the feet to the fire of the next chancellor\" to ensure the deficit is \"wiped out\".\n\nPolls open in : : : Days Hrs Mins Secs\n\n10.22 The hall in Margate is packed. Nigel Farage will be pleased after his somewhat lonely appearance in DC last night.\n\n10.19 Hard for Mr Reckless to compete with this though:\n\n10.18 Christopher Hope checks in from Margate:\n\nMark Reckless, the former Tory MP who defected to Ukip last Autumn, gets 10 second standing ovation at the Ukip spring coP who conference in Margate. \"Some of you may remember me from my last appearance in Doncaster,\" he tells delegates. Ukip won't have to court controversy to get heard now. It is a \"major party\" he says.\n\n10.09 This is a rather witty response to David Cameron's famous taunt that Ukip was a party of fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists.\n\n10.08 And a signed Nigel Farage tea towel:\n\n10.07 Whoa, wait - there's a raffle:\n\n10.01 It's a busy old day for a Friday. Ukip must have been expecting to be able to dominate the news. Instead, Ed Miliband is in the spotlight over Labour's tuition fees plan, David Cameron is in Wales talking devolution and of course there's still the fall-out from the naming of Jihadi John.\n\n09.55 Michael Deacon has been having fun touring the souvenir stands. He's also spotted cufflinks, and Ukip necklaces for the lady in your life.\n\n<noframe>Twitter: Michael Deacon - Book on Ukip souvenir stand has cover modelled on opening credits of Dad's Army.

Or is it just the cast of a touring production of Mel Brookes' The Producers hoping for a bit of free publicity?\n\n09.32 First speaker of note is Mark Reckless, the party's second MP, who takes to the stage at 10.15. Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall is on the ice at 11.30 and Patrick O'Flynn, the party's economic spokesman is the warm-up act for Mr Farage at 16.00.\n\n09.31 It's a sunny day in Margate, and Mr Farage's mood will have been brightened even more by the news the BBC's Andrew Neil brought him last night. South Thanet is the seat he hopes to represent in Parliament after the election. Mind you, to misquote Mandy Rice-Davies, you could argue it would say that wouldn't it, given the Survation poll was funded by, er, Ukip.\n\n<noframe>Twitter: Andrew Neil - New constituency poll in South Thanet coming out showing Farage comfortably ahead.</noframe>\n\n09.30 Good morning and welcome to the UK Independence Spring Conference liveblog. The Ukippers are gathering in Margate, with a full programme of events starting at 10.00. Nigel Farage takes to the stage to deliver his keynote speech at 16.20. Watch out for red eyes - he's flying back from the USA where he was greeted with a somewhat tepid response.\n\nTelegraph Chief Political Correspondent Christopher Hope and commentator Michael Deacon are in Margate for us, and will be keeping us updated with all the action.",
  "latent_25938": "UVB-induced apoptosis is the programmed cell death of cells that become damaged by ultraviolet rays. This is notable in skin cells, to prevent melanoma. Some studies have shown that exercise accelerates this process.\n\nApoptosis is a physiological process, that promotes the active suicide of cells, resulting in an advantage, unlike necrosis which occurs from trauma. In the average human adult it is estimated that 50 to 70 billion cells die each day from apoptosis. One of the largest promoters of apoptosis is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. While UV light is essential to human life it can also cause harm by inducing cancer, immunosuppression, photoaging, inflammation, and cell death.[1]\n\nOf the various components of sunlight, ultraviolet radiation B (UVB) (290-320 nm) is considered to be the most harmful. This type of radiation acts primarily on the epidermis, and in particular the keratinocytes. Keratinocytes are known to form a barrier to provide a layer of protection within the skin against environmental hazards. Within the epidermis, in addition to the keratinocytes, there are melanocytes (melanin producing cells). These cells produce pigment that provides the keratinocytes with protection against UVB radiation. Once the keratinocytes have been damaged irreparably as a result of UVB radiation, they are marked for destruction by apoptosis to eliminate them as they are potentially mutagenic cells. Failure of the body to remove DNA damaged cells increases the risk of skin cancer.[2]\n\nOne consequence of acute UVB exposure is the occurrence of sunburn cells, keratinocytes, within the epidermis.[3][4] It has been found that when exposed to UVB radiation the DNA in an epidermis cell undergoes fragmentation, which could result in the growth of tumor cells. To prevent this the cell undergoes a morphological change into keratinocytes. These keratinocytes exhibit the capacity to release TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor - alpha)[5] that stop the growth of the tumor by promoting the death of the cell.\n\nIf keratinocyte cells have been damaged by UVB radiation, the term \"sunburn cell\" or \"SBC formation\" is used. It is thought that when keratinocytes have been damaged by UVB radiation, this triggers a series of processes, caused in part by damage to the DNA. A study indicates that it may be at the mitochondria where the various processes (ligan-dependent receptor activation and cytosolic signaling) pathways are activated by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may direct the destruction of keratinocytes through apoptosis by activating caspase. As a result of increased exposure to an oxygen-reduced environment, this promotes the development of ROS thereby linking the incidence of ROS with keratinocytes and making these cells more sensitive to UVB radiation. A study by Tobi et al., in 2002 has linked ROS with cytotoxicity, apoptosis, mutations, and carcinogenesis. Mild hypoxia (1-5%) sensitized keratinocytes to UVB-induced apoptosis, while protecting melanocytes from environmental stresses.\n\nA study by Mark Schotanus, et al., has demonstrated that in addition to potential damage to keratinocytes and melanocytes, exposure to UVB radiation may also produce a loss of potassium ions, which may then cause the activation of apoptotic pathways in lymphocytes and neuronal cells as opposed to keratinocytes and melanocytes. It has been demonstrated that incubation of lymphocytes and neuronal cells in elevated concentrations of potassium ions provides protection from apoptosis. This phenomenon was demonstrated in tears, which have higher levels of potassium ions, and bathe cells of the eye and therefore provides protection from UVB radiation. Reduction of potassium ions promotes apoptosis and the synthesis of initiator caspase-8 and the effector caspase-3.[6]\n\nA study reported in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences in 2012; 13(3), pages 2560-2675, published February 28, 2012 by Terrerence J. Piva, Catherine M. Davern, Paula M. Hall, Clay M. Winterford and Kay A.O. Ellem, that while caspase may play a role in apoptosis, it is specifically not as a result of caspase-3. It was reported in that study that the process of apoptosis includes: \"detachment from the substrate, followed by loss of specialized membrane structures such as microvilli.

Despite the simple concept of apoptosis, the sequence of events that leads to it and other conditions that attempt to counter act it can be very cumbersome.[8] Since apoptosis is a last resort alternative, it takes the initiation of multiple other genes (ING2, p53, or Ras subfamily) expressed before the cell is finally programmed for death. In addition, genes like Survivin can attempt to suppress apoptosis.[9]\n\nReferences [ edit ]",
  "latent_26113": "The Montreal Canadiens played the Boston Bruins in the 2016 NHL Winter Classic at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., on Friday. (Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)\n\nI was reading a random article last month about the goings-ons at the historic climate change conference in Paris when my eyes stumbled across what appeared to be a fish-out-of-water participant – the National Hockey League. The piece mentioned that an NHL vice president for corporate social responsibility, Omar Mitchell, presented on sports and sustainability. The NHL. Climate change. I had to call the league.\n\nI found Mitchell. He explained from Foxborough, Mass., the site of the league’s New Year’s Day Winter Classic, after giving U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy a tour of the league’s game-day set up. The NHL and the EPA. McCarthy was invited to the game by the league after the EPA awarded the league a 2015 Green Power Leadership Award for its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. Hockey. Really?\n\n[News and notes for the Capitals and the rest of the NHL]\n\nHere’s my conversation with Mitchell about the league’s position.\n\nWhat was a vice president of the National Hockey League doing in Paris last month speaking at a forum tangentially connected to the historic U.N. climate change summit?\n\nOur game, which is probably unique to most other professional sports, is so tied to the environment. We need cold weather; we need fresh water in order to play. Therefore, our game is directly impacted by climate change and fresh water scarcity. So we developed NHL Green, a mandate to promote this type of awareness across all of our organizations. Over the course of the last five years, we’ve done everything from a food recovery initiative, which was taking all the unused food that we prepare in our arenas and donating it to local food banks … to a water restoration program. All of that culminated in the release of a sustainability report in 2014, which was the first of its kind from any U.S. pro sports league. It’s important to us.\n\nThere’s a movement in the sports world that’s really prioritizing sustainability around premier events like the Olympics, like FIFA World Cup, like the Super Bowl and organizations like ours that are really putting this at the forefront. As part of the climate change conference in Paris, there were lots of different industries and organizations talking about how their organization is contributing to addressing climate concerns. Green Sports Alliance, which is a nonprofit organization based in the U.S., has been a catalyst for this movement. Green Sports Alliance is also our principal environmental adviser. They participated in this panel that was called Sustainability, Innovation and Sport. They invited people who are really championing these initiatives to come and speak so that we could share those best practices. So we were very fortunate to be offered an invite to come and speak, and that’s why we were there.\n\nWhat does the league hope to do? Reduce its carbon footprint or to get global neighbors to reduce theirs?\n\nRight now it’s an internal focus. To show what we’re doing internally can show carbon reductions. As an example, we have a partnership with Constellation Energy. Constellation is a vertically integrated energy provider. That’s a fancy term that just means they not only provide electricity and natural gas to a commercial consumer, but what they do is they actually go in and walk the arenas and say, ‘Look, if we did this and did this and changed the ice plant and optimized the building management system and did a host of other things, we can actually lower energy consumption.’ The reason that’s important is because when we did our study of our environmental impact, that’s 550,000 metric tons of carbon, we recognized that 75 percent of our carbon emissions came from electricity use. That’s typically energy consumption in NHL arenas. So if you really want to target how to reduce power environmental impact, you have to start there, reduce energy consumption in our buildings.\n\nDoes the league have any goals or benchmarks?\n\nWe did not establish goals because we’re just in the first phase of a much longer process. The first part is understanding where we are. That’s what this first sustainability report was. Understanding what our footprint is before we can understand what tangible goals we can set.\n\nWhat involvement is there of individual owners, coaches or players in this effort?\n\nA lot of the players are interested. One that comes to mind immediately is Andrew Ference. He’s a self-proclaimed eco-athlete. He really prioritizes this in his life. So he’s a big environmental champion. Our next stage is to engage more players around this issue because when we put out stuff on our social media platforms, 12 million followers on social media, that definitely gets messaging out to fans. But when you get an Andrew Ference, that’s when you get a lot more engagement. We need to educate our athletes on this issue because they grew up on frozen ponds, they get the connection between learning to play outside and environmental issues. They get it. It’s intuitive, without even being environmental. Because while we want to do this as an organization, our hope is that we can at least start the conversation with our 72 million fans. If we drive that kind of awareness, that’s when were going to get the type of impact that we’re going to get in this conversation.\n\nHave you actually seen any loss in the frozen pond environment?\n\nWe are in touch with a university in Canada [Wilfrid Laurier University] that is doing a study called RinkWatch. What they are doing is [getting] folks who play on frozen ponds to record the conditions in their local ponds and that way we can get crowd-source information. Then there’s a historical record of that and they can build a database. We hope that this type of collective action will build up that database so we can say definitively whether people are actually seeing ponds freeze later in the season or thawing early.\n\nThere was a poll done in 2011 by the Center for Responsive Politics that found NHL owners contributed more to Republican candidacies than NFL owners and far more than NBA owners. Climate change is largely seen as a Democratic concern. Is Commissioner Gary Bettman worried about alienating his base?\n\nI don’t know of the politics of our owners or their constituents. What I will say is this, though. The reason why sports are a really important vehicle for talking about climate change is because it’s so apolitical. We can talk about this message in a meaningful way because it’s about healthy communities, and healthy lifestyles and getting kids out to play outdoors. Sports is an industry that can talk about these issues in a nonpolitical way. Sports is an opportunity to bring everybody to the table whether it’s Democrats or Republicans or whoever.\n\nKevin B.

A 36-year-old kid, but a kid nonetheless. He’s entitled: It’s his candy store.\n\nBerley and his 32-year-old brother, Eric, recently bought and restored Shane’s, the oldest continuously operated candy shop in America. The Philadelphia landmark, a couple of blocks from where in 1732 Benjamin Franklin printed the first Poor Richard’s Almanack, has been turning out sweets since 1863.\n\nThe first candy men at the spot, Samuel Herring and Daniel Dengler, were primarily wholesalers. A canned-fruit broker named Edward R. Shane took the business retail in 1911, and for three generations the staff boiled, stretched and sculpted blobs of sugary goo into every imaginable shape and Technicolor hue.\n\nShane’s reputation rested largely on its buttercream eggs and Irish potatoes—triumphs of Willy Wonka-ish alchemy that were neither Irish nor potatoes, but lumps of cream cheese mixed with coconut and dusted with cinnamon. To make the “eyes” of these spuds trompe l’oeil, confectioners poked the morsels with three-pronged forks and inserted pine nuts in the holes.\n\nOriginally, Shane’s fed off the foot traffic of commuters ferried between Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey. The traffic slowed to a toddle in 1926 with the opening of the Delaware River Bridge, later renamed for Ben Franklin. World War II sugar shortages and late 20th-century urban blight also swallowed up profits. By 2010 the third-floor workshop was in disarray, the antique machinery in disrepair, the chocolate empire nearing, well...meltdown.\n\nEnter the Berleys, proprietors of the Franklin Fountain, a vintage ice-cream parlor a few doors down Market Street.

They ripped up the linoleum flooring to expose the original pine and bird’s-eye maple and repainted the woodwork in Long Gallery and Grand Staircase blue, shades nicked from the palette at Independence Hall.\n\nNowadays the shelves boast hundreds of classic and seasonal delights, about half of which are concocted in the upstairs candy lofts. A cabinet is jammed with red and green and amber “clear toys,” edible Pennsylvania German delicacies made of sugar and corn syrup that glint like carved ice. The Berleys have some 1,200 cast-iron clear toy molds, everything from steam engines to Scottish terriers.

  "latent_26282": "The most important thing that happened when Prime Minister Tony Abbott appeared on Jon Faine’s program last week wasn’t that he winked when a caller revealed she had turned to sex work to make ends meet.\n\nInstead, it was the fact that the caller, “Gloria”, asked Abbott: “What do you suggest I cut out, Mr Abbott? Food, electricity, firewood, Christmas [and] birthday presents to my grandchildren? Or should we all just die and get out of your way?”\n\nAbbott brushed her off by mentioning cutting the carbon tax, ignoring the cold truth of her question: it’s not at all hyperbole to suggest that people will die as a result of this budget, should it come to pass.\n\nIn the aftermath of “#Budget2014”, there are a number of elements it is apparent would have a devastating effect, generationally. The introduction of a $7 “co-payment” to see a GP, and the proposed six-month waiting period before young people can claim Newstart benefits, appear to be the most immediately hurtful.\n\nBut in the Coalition’s “earn or learn” vision for the future of the country, those who choose to “learn” may well find themselves locked out of higher education. Under Abbott and Christopher Pyne’s planned privatisation of universities, students’ contribution per Commonwealth-supported place will be higher than the government’s. Universities’ fees are likely to increase by about 33 per cent, in order to compensate for the predicted average 20 per cent cut in funding. And, most alarmingly, interest rates charged on HECS/HELP debts will rise dramatically, indexed to the 10-year government bond rate rather than the consumer price index.\n\nAccording to the National Tertiary Education Union, this will leave students enrolling in 2013 and beyond with debts, once study and living costs are taken into account, between $65,000 and $250,000. The time needed to repay student debts could be closer to four decades, as opposed to the current 10 years or so. It will be a considerable deterrent to higher education. It’s highly likely such a model of American-style education-induced penury won’t appeal to Australians who’d prefer to “earn”. Unfortunately, for unemployed young people – at least those between the ages of 25, the proposed new Newstart eligibility age, and 30 – the future is equally bleak.\n\nSo far, nobody in the Coalition has managed to explain precisely – beyond Joe Hockey’s “I would expect to be in a job” – what young people are supposed to do for the six months before they can claim benefits. Indeed, for a treasurer, Hockey seems surprisingly bad at basic maths.\n\nLet’s imagine that Joe is a 26-year-old University of Melbourne graduate. He lives in Brunswick East, where the median weekly rent is $358, with one other housemate. Joe suddenly finds himself unemployed when the business he works at goes into receivership. He has some modest savings that quickly dwindle when spent on rent, bills, transport and food. His parents have long since moved into a smaller unit and can’t accommodate him.\n\nLet’s say he moves to Croydon, in the outer east, where a friend has a spare room; at $95 a week, it’s cheaper than his current house. But without the Health Care Card that Newstart provides, he won’t be able to purchase a concession Myki pass. So, in order to travel between zone 2 and 1 while seeking employment, he’ll have to pay $60 a week for transport. There are still months to go before Newstart is available to him, and barely any savings left. In a word, Joe is screwed. He’d better hope he doesn’t fall ill.\n\nThe imagined job seeker isn’t necessarily a young person straight out of uni. Joe could be 29 – hence, still a “young person” – and married, with two young children and a mortgage. What if Joe is Joanne, a 27-year-old woman with a disability who has a university degree and is desperate to work but can’t find a workplace that is accessible in her wheelchair?\n\nWhat’s especially galling about these hypothetical scenarios is that they come laced with the knowledge that at about 28 per cent of the average wage, the Newstart “allowance” is a pittance.\n\nA paper co-authored by Dr Alan Morris of Sydney’s University of Technology and Dr Shaun Wilson of Macquarie University, “Struggling on the Newstart Unemployment Benefit in Australia”, found that one in four people in Sydney’s inner west who had been on Newstart for more than a year had approached people on the street for help. “Instead of spending their energy looking for a job these people are worried all the time by the very basics of survival,” Dr Morris told The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nAgain, Hockey seems to have a very loose grasp of basic household budgeting. As so many people have told him, if you can’t afford to pay the power bill, let alone internet access or a newspaper to search for job ads, or transport to get to the job-seek agency, it is very hard to look for work.\n\n“I think these changes are going to unleash terrible suffering,” Morris said of the proposed cuts to Newstart. “We are going to have more people begging in the streets.”\n\nFor older people such as “Gloria” who suffer from chronic illness, and even those who don’t, the cumulative effect of having to spend $7 here and there, plus expected increases to the cost of medication obtained through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, will mean the spectre of death, whether from starvation, cold or lack of medical treatment, will loom large.\n\nAs he launched his budget, Abbott told his Coalition colleagues, “This is a watershed moment, when a bold new government does what has to be done to set the nation on a better course.”\n\nIt appears that “what has to be done” is to fire the starter pistol that begins a race to the bottom.\n\nThis is a budget that carries with it, for hundreds of thousands of Australians, the very real likelihood of fatal consequences, as illnesses become acute and money has to be spent on either doctor’s visits or food and electricity. For others, despair, desperation and homelessness will descend. For those affected by neither extreme, yet unable to afford university fees, a grim, underqualified purgatory beckons.\n\nFull speed ahead on that better course for the nation.",
  "latent_26290": "OBJECTIVE:\n\nTwo experiments were conducted to determine if dietary supplementation with Concord grape juice could reverse the latent learning impairment normally observed in middle-aged male rats.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nBoth experiments utilized the latent cue preference (LCP) task, in which water-replete rats sample water in one compartment of a three-compartment box, and are subsequently given a compartment preference test when water-deprived to determine if they remember the compartment cue previously associated with water. In the first experiment, 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats (9, 10, 11, or 12 months old) were used to determine the age of onset of the impairment. In the second experiment, 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats (11 months old) were given daily access (10 ml/day) to 50% Concord grape juice, 50% white grape juice, or a calorically-equivalent sugar solution daily for 5 weeks prior to training.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nThe first experiment revealed that the latent learning impairment begins to manifest at 10 months of age in the male rats and is fully present at 11 months. The second experiment showed that rats that consumed the 50% Concord grape juice for 5 weeks beginning at 11 months of age showed intact latent learning in the LCP task, while rats that consumed the other two supplements showed the normal impairment on the LCP task.\n\nDISCUSSION:\n\nThese results indicate that daily supplementation with Concord grape juice was able to reverse the latent learning impairment normally seen in middle-aged male rats. This reversal is most likely due to the presence of flavonoids in Concord grape juice.",
  "latent_26371": "\"JORN\" redirects here. For other uses, see Jorn (disambiguation)\n\nThe JORN area of operation.\n\nThe Jindalee Operational Radar Network (JORN) is an over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) network that can monitor air and sea movements across 37,000 km2. It has a normal operating range of 1,000 km to 3,000 km.[1] It is used in the defence of Australia, and can also monitor maritime operations, wave heights and wind directions.\n\nJORN's main ground stations comprise a control centre, known as JCC, at RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia and two transmission stations: JOR1 near Longreach, Queensland and JOR2 near Laverton, Western Australia.[2]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nThe roots of the JORN can be traced back to post World War II experiments in the United States and a series of Australian experiments beginning in the early 1950s. From July 1970 a study was undertaken; this resulted in a proposal for a program to be carried out, in three phases, to develop an over-the-horizon-radar system.[3][4]\n\nGeebung [ edit ]\n\nPhase 1, Project Geebung, aimed to define operational requirements for an over-the-horizon-radar (OTHR), and study applicable technologies and techniques. The project carried out a series of ionospheric soundings evaluating the suitability of the ionosphere for the operation of an OTHR.[4]\n\nJindalee [ edit ]\n\nPhase 2, Project Jindalee, aimed at proving the feasibility and costing of OTHR. This second phase was carried out by the Radar Division, (later, the High Frequency Radar Division), of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO). Project Jindalee came into being during the period 1972-1974 and was divided into three stages.[4]\n\nStage 'A' commenced in April 1974. It involved the construction of a prototype radar receiver at Mount Everard, (near Alice Springs), a transmitter (at Harts Range, 160 km away) and a beacon in Derby. When completed (in October 1976) the Stage A radar ran for two years, closing in December 1978. Stage A formally ended in February 1979, having achieved its mission of proving the feasibility of OTHR.[4] The success of stage A resulted in the construction of a larger stage 'B' radar, drawing on the knowledge gained from stage A.\n\nStage 'B' commenced on 6 July 1978. The new radar was constructed next to the stage A radar. Developments during stage B included real time signal processing, custom built processors, larger antenna arrays, and higher power transmitters, which resulted in a more sensitive and capable radar.\n\nThe first data was received by stage B in the period April–May 1982,\n\nthe first ship was detected in January 1983, and\n\nan aircraft was automatically tracked in February 1984.\n\nTrials were carried out with the Royal Australian Air Force during April 1984, substantially fulfilling the mission of stage B, to demonstrate an OTHR operating in Australia. Another two years of trials were carried out before the Jindalee project officially finished in December 1985.[4]\n\nStage 'C' became the conversion of the stage B radar to an operational radar. This stage saw substantial upgrades to the stage B equipment followed by the establishment of No. 1 Radar Surveillance Unit RAAF (1RSU) and the handover of the radar to 1RSU. The aim was to provide the Australian Defence Force with operational experience of OTHR.[2]\n\nJORN [ edit ]\n\nPhase 3 [ edit ]\n\nPhase 3 of the OTHR program was the design and construction of the JORN. The decision to build the JORN was announced in October 1986. Telstra, in association with GEC-Marconi, became the prime contractor and a fixed price contract for the construction of the JORN was signed on 11 June 1991. The JORN was to be completed by 13 June 1997.[2]\n\nPhase 3 Project problems [ edit ]\n\nTelstra was responsible for software development and systems integration, areas in which it had no previous experience. GEC-Marconi was responsible for the HF Radar and related software aspects of the project, areas in which it had no previous experience.[5] Other unsuccessful tenderers for the project included experienced Australian software development and systems integration company, BHP IT, and experienced Australian defence contractor AWA Defence Industries (AWADI). Both of these companies are no longer in business.[6]\n\nBy 1996, the project was experiencing technical difficulties and cost overruns.[2][7] Telstra reported an A$609 million loss and announced that it could not guarantee a delivery date.[8]\n\nThe failed Telstra contract prompted the project to enter a fourth phase.\n\nPhase 4 [ edit ]\n\nPhase 4 involved the completion of the JORN and its subsequent maintenance using a new contractor. In February 1997 Lockheed Martin and Tenix received a contract to deliver and manage the JORN. Subsequently, during June 1997 Lockheed and Tenix formed the company RLM Group to handle the joint venture.[9] An operational radar system was delivered in April 2003, with maintenance contracted to continue until February 2007.[10]\n\nIn August 2008 Lockheed-Martin acquired Tenix Group's interest in RLM Holdings Pty Ltd.[11]\n\nPhase 5 [ edit ]\n\nAs a consequence of the duration of its construction, the JORN delivered in 2003 was designed to a specification developed in the early 1990s. During this period the Alice Springs radar had evolved significantly under the guidance of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO). In February 2004 a fifth phase of the JORN project was approved.\n\nPhase 5 aimed to upgrade the Laverton and Longreach radars to reflect over a decade of OTHR research and development. It was scheduled to run until approximately the year 2011,[10] but was completed around 2013/2014 due to skills shortage. All three stations are now similar, and use updated electronics.[12]\n\nPhase 6 [ edit ]\n\nIn March 2018 it was announced that BAE Systems Australia will undertake the $1.2 billion upgrade to Australia’s Jindalee Operational Radar Network which will take 10 years to complete.[13]\n\nProject cost [ edit ]\n\nThe JORN project (JP2025) has had 5 phases,[14] and has cost approximately A$1.8 billion.[citation needed] The ANAO Audit report of June 1996 estimated an overall project cost for Phase 3 of $1.1 billion.[15] Phase 5 costs have been estimated at $70 million.[14] Phase 6 costs expect to be $1.2 billion.[13]\n\nNetwork [ edit ]\n\nJORN consists of:\n\nDSTO uses a radar station near Alice Springs, Northern Territory (JFAS) for research and development[16] and also has its own network of vertical/oblique ionosondes for research purposes.[2][17][18] The Alice Springs radar can be patched into the JORN to provide a third active radar station.[16]\n\nEach radar station consists of a transmitter site and a receiver site, separated by a large distance to prevent the transmitter from interfering with the receiver. The four JORN transmitter and receiver sites are:\n\nthe Queensland transmitter at Longreach, [19] with 90 degree coverage ( , also on OzGeoRFMap),\n\nwith 90 degree coverage ( , also on OzGeoRFMap), the Queensland receiver at Stonehenge, [19] with 90 degree coverage ( , also on OzGeoRFMap),\n\nwith 90 degree coverage ( , also on OzGeoRFMap), the Western Australian transmitter at Leonora, [19] with 180 degree coverage ( , also on OzGeoRFMap), and\n\nwith 180 degree coverage ( , also on OzGeoRFMap), and the Western Australian receiver at Laverton, with 180 degree coverage ( , also on OzGeoRFMap).\n\nThe research and development transmitter and receiver sites are:\n\nthe Alice Springs transmitter at Harts Range, [19] [20] with 90 degree coverage ( , also on OzGeoRFMap), and\n\nwith 90 degree coverage ( , also on OzGeoRFMap), and the Alice Springs receiver at Mount Everard,[19][20] with 90 degree coverage ( , also on OzGeoRFMap).\n\nThe Alice Springs radar was the original 'Jindalee Stage B' test bed on which the design of the other two stations was based. It continues to act as a research and development testbed in addition to its operational role.\n\nThe Mount Everard receiver site contains the remains of the first, smaller, 'Jindalee Stage A' receiver. It is visible in aerial photos, behind the stage B receiver ( ). The stage A transmitter was rebuilt to become the stage B transmitter.[4]\n\nThe high frequency radio transmitter arrays at Longreach and Laverton have 28 elements, each driven by a 20-kilowatt power amplifier giving a total power of 560 kW.[2] Stage B transmitted 20 kW per amplifier.[2] The signal is bounced off the ionosphere, landing in the \"illuminated\" area of target interest. Much incident radiation is reflected forward in the original direction of travel, but a small proportion \"backscatters\" and returns along the original, reciprocal transmission path. These returns again reflect from the ionosphere, finally being received at the Longreach and Laverton stations. Signal attenuation, from transmit antenna to target and finally back to receive antenna, is substantial, and its performance in such a context marks this system as leading-edge science. The receiver stations use KEL Aerospace KFR35 series receivers.[16] JORN uses radio frequencies between 5 and 30 MHz,[21][22][23] which is far lower than most other civilian and military radars that operate in the microwave frequency band. Also, unlike most microwave radars, JORN does not use pulsed transmission, nor does it use movable antennas. Transmission is Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW), and the transmitted beam is aimed by the interaction between its \"beam-steering\" electronics and antenna characteristics in the transmit systems. Radar returns are distinguished in range by the offset between the instantaneous radiated signal frequency and the returning signal frequency. Returns are distinguished in azimuth by measuring phase offsets of individual returns incident across the kilometres-plus length of the multi-element receiving antenna array. Intensive computational work is necessary to JORN's operation, and refinement of the software suite offers the most cost-effective path for improvements.\n\nThe JORN ionosonde network is made up of vertical ionosondes, providing a real time map of the ionosphere. Each vertical incidence sounder (VIS) is a standardized Single-Receiver \"Digisonde\" Portable Sounder built by Lowell for the JORN. A new ionospheric map is generated every 225 seconds.[18] In a clockwise direction around Australia, the locations of the twelve (11 active and one test) JORN ionosondes are below.\n\nThe DSTO ionosonde network is not part of the JORN, but is used to further DSTO's research goals.[18] DSTO uses Four-Receiver Digisonde Portable Sounders (DPS-4), also built by Lowell.[2][17] During 2004 DSTO had ionosondes at the following locations.\n\nDSTO Ionosondes[17]\n\nFrom west to east, the seven JORN transponders are located at\n\nAll of the above sites (and many more that likely form part of the network) can be found precisely on the RadioFrequency Map,[25] which also lists the frequencies in use at each site.\n\nOperation and uses [ edit ]\n\nThe JORN network is operated by No. 1 Remote Sensor Unit (1RSU). Data from the JORN sites is fed to the JORN Coordination Centre at RAAF Base Edinburgh where it is passed on to other agencies and military units. Officially the system allows the Australian Defence Force to observe air and sea activity north of Australia to distances up to 4000 km.[26] This encompasses all of Java, Irian Jaya, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and may include Singapore.[27] However, in 1997, the prototype was able to detect missile launches by China[28] over 5,500 kilometres (3,400 mi) away.\n\nJORN is so sensitive it is able to track planes as small as a Cessna 172 taking off and landing in East Timor 2600 km away.[citation needed] Current research is anticipated to increase its sensitivity by a factor of ten beyond this level.[citation needed]\n\nIt is also reportedly able to detect stealth aircraft, as typically these are designed only to avoid detection by microwave radar.[8] Project DUNDEE[29] was a cooperative research project, with American missile defence research, into using JORN to detect missiles.[30] The JORN was anticipated to play a role in future Missile Defense Agency initiatives, detecting and tracking missile launches in Asia.[31]\n\nAs JORN is reliant on the interaction of signals with the ionosphere ('bouncing'), disturbances in the ionosphere adversely affect performance. The most significant factor influencing this is solar changes, which include sunrise, sunset and solar disturbances. The effectiveness of JORN is also reduced by extreme weather, including lightning and rough seas.[32]\n\nAs JORN uses the Doppler principle to detect objects, it cannot detect objects moving at a tangent to the system, or objects moving at a similar speed to their surroundings.[32]\n\nTheories regarding Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 [ edit ]\n\nIn May 2016, the JORN FAQ file / Fact Sheet was updated by the RAAF to address questions about Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. According to the update, \"JORN was not operational at the time of the aircraft's disappearance.\" The update also stated that MH370 would have been unlikely to be detected by the system due to radar range, ionospheric conditions and a \"lack of information on MH370's possible flight path towards Australia.\"[33][34]\n\nHowever, in the immediate aftermath of the March 8, 2014 disappearance, information regarding JORN's status was not released. This led to months of speculation. On March 18, 2014, sources cited by The Australian said that JORN was not tasked to look toward the Indian Ocean on the night of the disappearance of MH370 as there was no reason for it to be searching there at that time.[35] On March 20, 2014, it was reported that Malaysian Defence Minister (also Acting Transport Minister) Hishammuddin Hussein requested the US to give any information from the Pine Gap base near Alice Springs, possibly alluding to JORN as well.[36] On March 19, 2014, it was reported that an Australian Defence Department spokesman said it \"won't be providing comment\" regarding specific information on tracking MH370 by JORN.[37] However, several days prior to this, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told the Australian Parliament, \"All our defence intelligence relating to Flight 370 has been, and will continue to be, passed on to Malaysian authorities...\"[35][36]\n\nIn March 2015, before the July 2015 discovery of MH370 debris on Réunion Island, aviation technology expert Andre Milne requested information from JORN to prove or disprove that the aircraft ended up in the Indian Ocean,[38] but he received no response from the Australian government in 2015. It was made public in May 2016 that JORN was not operational at the time of the disappearance.[33]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",
  "latent_26386": "OXFORD – Religion has ever less influence in European public life, and the dominant ideology of equality is chasing religion from the public square even faster than church congregations are shrinking.\n\nOverall, there’s a good deal of truth to that picture, but it’s also too simplistic. Faith flowers in surprising corners in high public places and the secularist-egalitarian advance is frequently bogged down.\n\nAnd then there are rare moments when even the reverse seems true: when the state turns to religion for help or support, much to the disgust of humanists and rationalists.\n\nOne such moment happened at the end of last week. Concealed within an address by Britain’s new prime minister, Theresa May, announcing one of the most radical shake-ups in public education in decades, was a message to the Catholic Church in particular that the government would like to see it creating and running more taxpayer-funded schools.\n\nHer speech — setting out part of an agenda rethink aimed at the Brexit-voting white working-class — made clear that May wants Britain to be a world leader in meritocracy, where the disadvantaged can pull themselves up through intelligence and hard work. As a first step, she said, her government wanted to increase the number of good schools and allow them to select the brightest regardless of background.\n\nThat meant, she said, removing the obstacles to more publicly-funded faith schools, most of which are set up and run by the Church of England and the Catholic Church, but which also include Jewish, Muslim and Hindu schools. Currently faith schools make up a third of all mainstream schools in England.\n\nThe prime minister pointed out that these schools are both popular with parents and consistently rated as good or outstanding, yet face obstacles to their expansion. Catholic schools in particular, she said, are discouraged from expanding because of the requirement that they take at least half of their pupils from non-Catholic backgrounds.\n\nHer government, she said, will seek to lift that requirement, allowing Catholic schools to determine how many Catholic students they wish to take.\n\nWhen the British state created universal education in the 1940s, the Catholic Church — which was already a major player in education, often building schools before parishes — struck a partnership deal with the government. Under the 1944 Butler Act, Catholic schools became voluntary-aided, that is, part of the state system of education, but retained the freedom to run themselves according to their principles.\n\nThe same applied to Church of England schools, but there was a difference. While Church of England schools were open to anyone, Catholic schools were designed primarily to educate baptized Catholics.\n\nSince then, there have been many changes to the education system, but the Catholic Church-English state partnership — unique in Europe — has endured.\n\nWhere Catholic schools have more places than Catholic students to fill them, they have been happy to take non-Catholics; and because the schools have a strong ethos, community spirit, and good academic results, they have proved popular with British people generally, to the point where many Catholic school places are many times oversubscribed.\n\nThe Church, in fact, has become the main player in faith-based education, responsible for two-thirds of all the faith-based secondary schools in England — that’s over 2,000 schools educating some 800,000 students.\n\nThe Catholics can give their children a good, free education in schools imbued with Catholic values, while non-Catholic students who go there benefit from the same. The state benefits because the Church usually owns the land and buildings which would otherwise need to be publicly funded, while the Church has an outreach into the community that is popular and admired.\n\nYet their very success has made Catholic schools a political hot potato. Parents whose children are turned away because they are not Catholic accuse the schools of discriminating, while a noisy secularist lobby continually accuse the government of publicly funding religious segregation.\n\n(The charges are unfair, because on average a third of students at state-funded Catholic schools are non-Catholic, but try telling that to an indignant parent whose child has been turned away.)\n\nThe Darwinian struggle over Catholic school places means the Church is vulnerable to the accusation that it is imposing social selection under the guise of religious selection. The Church responds with statistics showing its schools are more diverse — ethnically and socially — than the average, and that Catholic parents, as taxpayers, have a right to decide to send their children to a school that reflects their ethos. But it remains politically sensitive.\n\nThe obvious solution, of course, is to build more Catholic schools to meet the demand. But when David Cameron’s Conservative government (at that time in coalition with the Liberal-democrats) in 2011 made it far easier for civil society bodies to set up so-called “free schools,” it bowed to political pressure in insisting that half of the intake of oversubscribed new faith schools should be of different faiths or none. The idea was to prevent, especially, Muslim schools becoming religious and social ghettoes.\n\nBut the cap acted as a veto on new Catholic schools, because the Church insists — with good reason — that its schools must have a majority Catholic intake (typically 70-75 per cent) in order to preserve the very ethos that makes them attractive.\n\nIf, as May intends, that cap is lifted, she knows that will mean a considerable expansion of Catholic schools. In effect, the prime minister is entrusting to the care of the Catholic Church a potentially unlimited share of publicly-funded education of the next generation of English people.\n\nFor an officially Anglican country where religious unbelief is the norm, that’s not a small thing.\n\nAnd when the historians come to write the story of European secularization in the early twenty-first century, the case of Catholic schools in England might just give them pause.",
  "latent_26461": "Memorial Day, in my view, should be a time of reflection not only on the sacrifices made for the nation in war but on whether our wars are necessary and whether they are being fought in the right way.\n\nThe Iraqi people and the parliament want the US out of Iraq, and the US public wants out, and that withdrawal should proceed as outlined in the SOFA (i.e. US out by the end of the year). The Iraqi military is such that Baghdad will likely muddle through without the Pentagon. Moreover, trying to keep US troops in a country where they are widely disliked can only cause a lot of trouble. There are no US troops in Libya and US air involvement is limited in favor of NATO- and Arab League- UN allies. It in any case is likely to be a limited engagement. The place where there are over 100,000 US troops doing war-fighting on a large scale and over many years is Afghanistan, which for some reason gets less press and less public interest than Libya.\n\nThe protests in Lashkar Gah, Helmand Province, Afghanistan, against yet another alleged killing of 14 women and children in an airstrike that went awry, reminds us that the big counter-insurgency effort in that country still has not produced social peace, still has not yielded a government capable of taking over security duties. NATO has had to issue an apology. If Afghan police and soldiers could project authority and force in local areas, air strikes would be unnecessary. And after nearly 10 years since the overthrow of the Taliban, it is legitimate to ask when and how exactly local troops can be expected to take up this slack?\n\nThe deadly Taliban suicide bombing in the north of the country, which killed the police chief, a German officer, and NATO troops, raises questions about the Karzai government’s preparedness:\n\nBut those who are skittish about a proposed US withdrawal in 2014, saying it is too soon, have to tell us when exactly it won’t be too soon. It is the Afghans’ country; when will they be willing and able to fight for it?\n\nThe US public is tired of forever wars, and the idea that massive counter-insurgency is necessary to fight al-Qaeda has been belied by the success of a small, focused counter-terrorism operation against Usama Bin Laden.\n\nOn this Memorial Day, it is time to start thinking about how to get out of Afghanistan, where the US has no vital interest, where there are no resources to speak of, where the international will to stay on the part of NATO allies is collapsing, and where the Karzai government has been erratic and corrupt. Regional powers have an interest in it not becoming terrorism central again, and the US has shown it can strike smart and on a micro-level. Hundreds of thousands of troops and decades of nation-building are the wrong way to go on this one.",
  "latent_26612": "Signup to receive a daily roundup of the top LGBT+ news stories from around the world\n\nTrump has nominated a former talk show host who linked homosexuality to paedophilia for a top role within his administration.\n\nThe Republican billionaire named Sam Clovis, the former host of radio talk show ‘Impact With Sam Clovis’, to his a role as Under Secretary of Agriculture for Research, Education, and Economics in the United States Department of Agriculture.\n\nClovis, the former national co-chair of the Trump-Pence campaign and a White House adviser, was exposed as a homophobe by CNN’s K-File today.\n\nK-File found evidence dating from 2012 to 2014 that Clovis had claimed that gay rights reforms would lead to legal paedophilia.\n\nIn one clip, he claimed: “Someone who engages in LGBT behaviour… as far as we know, LGBT behaviour is a choice they make, so we’re being asked to provide Constitutional protections for behaviour, a choice in behaviour as opposed to a primary characteristic.\n\n“There’s no equivalency there between the civil rights issue associated between those protected classes and the civil rights of someone who engages in a particular behaviour.\n\n“Follow the logic, if you engage in a particular behaviour, what also becomes protected? If we protect LGBT behaviour, what other behaviours are we going to protect? Are we going to protect paedophilia?\n\n“Are we going to protect polyamorous marriage relationships? Are we going to protect people who have fetishes? What’s the logical extension of this?\n\n“It can’t be that we’re going to protect LGBT and then we’ll pull up the ladder. That’s not going to happen, it defies logic. We’re not thinking the consequences of these decisions through.”\n\nHe added: “I think it’s a logical extension of thought. And if you cannot follow the logic then you’re denying your in denial.”\n\nIn blog posts, Clovis also claimed that business should be free to not hire gay people.\n\nHe claimed: “Businesses and their owners should be able to make decisions about who is employed if hiring people who do not behave in accordance with some deeply held religious belief system is at issue.\n\n“Just as the government should not force business owners or enterprises to provide contraceptives or morning-after pills because of religious beliefs, the government should not be in charge of hiring practices, either. Religious freedom, perhaps the most fundamental of all protected freedoms, must be free of government interference.”\n\nHe added: “What seems the most troubling about extending the definition of marriage to same-sex couples is that it will be difficult to stop with this revised definition.\n\n“Is the LGBT community wanting to stop the marriage arrangement at any two consenting adults? This is illogical. If society chooses to alter the definition of marriage, how can there be a line drawn at two adults?\n\n“What is to say that polyamorous arrangements should not be included? What about other relationships?\n\n“If that is the goal of the LGBT community leadership, then the reasons for rearranging the traditional definition is far more nefarious than just making a small segment of the population feel better.”\n\nWhen challenged about his views, a spokesperson for Clovis bizarrely told CNN: “The Supreme Court settled the issue in 2015.”\n\nPersonally we don’t remember the Supreme Court ruling on whether homosexuality leads to paedophilia, but we’ll take his word for it.\n\nDrew Anderson, Director of News and Rapid Response at GLAAD said: “Sam Clovis’ nomination further emphasizes just how President Trump is willing to do about anything possible to make his administration the most anti-LGBTQ in recent memory.\n\n“His words fly in the face of American values and should be disqualifying for any person who wishes to represent the federal government.”\n\nClovis is far from the first anti-LGBT nominee for a position in the White House.\n\nTrump’s Army Secretary nominee previously quit after senior Democrats and Republicans both voiced concern about his long record of homophobia.\n\nDonald Trump had been attempting to replace Obama’s openly gay nominee Eric Fanning with an anti-gay Tennessee Republican lawmaker, Mark Green.\n\nA number of disturbing allegations later came to light about Mr Green. He is on-the-record claiming that being transgender is a “disease”, while in an unearthed radio clip he rants about trans people before vowing to “crush” evil.\n\nMr Green also described civil rights protections for LGBT people as an example of “tyrannical government”, and encouraged Tennessee to defy the US Supreme Court and deny gay couples the right to marry.\n\nMeanwhile, many of the people in the most senior roles in the Trump cabinet also have anti-LGBT views.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions opposes civil rights protections for gay people, while HUD Secretary Ben Carson has described equal marriage as a Marxist plot.",

As part of the agreement, the U.S. and its allies agreed to reduce long-term economic sanctions on Tehran.\n\nTrump, in his U.N. address, accused Tehran of violating the spirit of the agreement intended to keep Iran's nuclear program peaceful. \"We cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program,\" he said.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani, in his remarks to the U.N.

Tillerson said Tehran may be in \"technical compliance\" of the deal, but is violating its \"expectations\" – including by supporting the Assad regime in Syria.\n\nTrump has not shared his decision about the deal with anyone else – including British Prime Minister Theresa May, who asked him directly.\n\nIf Trump chooses not to re-certify the deal, that alone may not scrap the agreement. Congress would still have 60 days to decide whether or not to reimpose sanctions.\n\nWhile Iran and the nuclear threat from North Korea have been Trump's major focuses at the United Nations, he also made time to discuss Middle East policy with Abbas and leaders from Jordan and Egypt.\n\nTrump said Wednesday he wanted to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which he repeatedly called the \"toughest deal of all.\"\n\n\"Complex subject – always been considered the toughest deal of all – peace between Israel and the Palestinians,\" Trump said.

  "latent_27554": "Preview | Recap | Notebook\n\nBulls-Jazz Preview\n\nBy ALAN FERGUSON\n\nPosted Feb 08 2011 3:50PM Carlos Boozer helped the Utah Jazz sweep the Chicago Bulls last season by scoring a combined 44 points over two games. When he faces his former team for the first time Wednesday night, Boozer will try to aid the Bulls' attempts to play better defense and avoid a season-high third consecutive defeat. Before signing with Chicago in July, Boozer played six seasons in Utah and was the Jazz's leading scorer in 2009-10 as they claimed their third Northwest Division title. Current teammate Kyle Korver also made an NBA-record 53.6 percent of his 3-point attempts last season. Under first-year coach Tom Thibodeau, the two players have been part of one of the NBA's best defensive units for Chicago, allowing 92.5 points per game. The Bulls, though, have struggled at that end of the court in the past two games. Before Friday night's 101-90 loss to Golden State, the Central Division leaders hadn't allowed more than 96 points in 13 consecutive games and were 11-2 over that stretch. Chicago (34-16) followed with a 109-103 loss to Portland on Monday night, its third of five consecutive road games. The Bulls allowed the Trail Blazers to shoot 51.5 percent and post a 40-18 advantage in free-throw attempts. \"Every aspect of the defense was missing. This is two games in a row we've put ourselves in a bad position by not guarding,\" Thibodeau said. With the defensive-minded Thibodeau's help, Chicago has held opponents under the century mark in 37 games and allowed more than 100 points in three consecutive games only once, from Dec. 1-4. The Bulls, however, gave up an average of 118.5 points last season to the Jazz (31-22), but they might have an easier time in this matchup with Boozer and Korver on their roster. Utah has also struggled for consistency, having alternated wins and losses in its last seven games. Among those losses are its first back-to-back home defeats. The Jazz haven't dropped three consecutive home games since April 7-14, 2007, and enter this game with some momentum after rallying for a 107-104 win at Sacramento on Monday night. Utah trailed by six with 6:17 remaining, but Paul Millsap scored six straight points to start a 16-7 run. Millsap finished with 18 points, while Al Jefferson had his fifth straight 20-point game with a team-best 23. \"It's not a pretty win, but at least it's a win. I'm hoping this gets us back on track,\" said point guard Deron Williams, who added 21 points in his third game back from a wrist injury. Williams averaged 24.5 points on 76.9 percent shooting (20 of 26) in last season's sweep of the Bulls and also had 23 assists. Chicago's All-Star point guard Derrick Rose, meanwhile, has averaged 23.3 points on 54.9 percent shooting in his four career games against the Jazz. Rose, averaging a career-best 24.6 points this season, scored 14 points against Golden State but bounced back with 36 versus Portland, three shy of matching his season high. The Bulls haven't dropped three straight since a season-high, 10-game slide from Feb. 27-March 19, 2010, but might have trouble avoiding that feat as they've lost 11 of 14 at EnergySolutions Arena.\n\nCopyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

When it counted most, two other former Jazz players came up big for the Chicago Bulls in Wednesday night's 91-86 victory over Utah. \"It felt good to hit a big shot,\" said Kyle Korver, who hit a 3-pointer with 2:17 remaining to give the Bulls an 87-83 lead. Bulls teammate Ronnie Brewer, who was drafted by Utah in 2006, stole the ball from Jazz point guard Deron Willliams with 7.9 seconds left and sank a pair of free throws to seal the victory. Boozer also had a steal late, but overall had a rough time in his return to Utah. He had a number of his shots blocked and finished with 14 points and six rebounds. \"It was a little bit of everything,\" Boozer said of the nasty reception he received. \"I'm just happy we won. We had two losses in a row. It was a grind-out game that we didn't have a good rhythm for but we just kept fighting, playing hard. Sometimes when you keep grinding, things go your way a little bit.\" Derrick Rose scored 29 points for Chicago. He also had seven assists and three rebounds, and a steal with 1:05 remaining that gave Chicago control of the game. \"He's been playing like that the whole season,\" Boozer said of Rose. \"It's why we keep chanting his name for MVP because he's been phenomenal all year.\" Al Jefferson led the Jazz with 28 points, while Paul Millsap added 20 points and 14 rebounds. \"We were there,\" Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. \"We just couldn't close the door.\" Sloan kept reporters waiting more than half an hour after the game as he met with his assistants and general manager Kevin O'Connor. And the Jazz announced that Thursday's practice had been abruptly canceled. After a 15-5 start, the Jazz are now 31-23 and have dropped three straight at home. Asked if it was time for a shake-up, Sloan hedged. \"I don't think there's any great need for panic,\" he said, before adding that his general manager is always evaluating players and moves the team can make. \"We're not looking to trade anybody. We're looking to make our team hopefully better on the floor.\" It didn't help that three former Jazz players came back to haunt Utah. Boozer was a two-time Western Conference All-Star in Utah, but there were always questions about team chemistry with him in Salt Lake. He made it be known he wanted out, and eventually signed as a free agent with Chicago after last season. His first game back in Utah elicited the most media attention surrounding the Jazz since the NBA playoffs. He was booed during introductions and every time he touched the ball. He also got a rude welcome from Millsap, who blocked his first shot, knocked the ball out of his hands twice in the first four minutes and got Boozer to dribble it off his own foot. Boozer had just six points at halftime on 3-of-9 shooting. Millsap, meanwhile, was within one rebound of a double-double by halftime with a team-high 13 points. The Jazz won the rebounding battle 48-41 and outshot the Bulls, but Utah also was only 11 of 21 from the free throw line while the Bulls made 20 of 26. \"When you're down, making a comeback, you have to have almost a perfect finish and we had some good things happen to us but we also had some things we'd like to have back,\" Sloan said. Notes: Jazz reserve C Mehmet Okur will miss at least three weeks because of a chronic disc problem in his lower back. ... Jazz reserve C Francisco Elson did not play Wednesday because of a inflammation in his left knee. ... The Jazz bench was outscored 25-5. ... University of Utah football coach Kyle Whittingham was in the stands Wednesday. ... The Bulls entered the game as one of only four NBA teams that had not lost more than two in a row this season.\n\nCopyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

  "latent_27648": "There comes a time when a person looks in the mirror and says, “I’m ready to make a change.” These changes usually involve significant sacrifices. Losing weight? Cut the food. Refocusing on your career? Everything else is secondary. Trying to save money? Don’t buy as much.\n\nBut what if that change didn’t involve much sacrifice? What if, at the end of the day, that change was a big one that bettered you without sapping you of all strength, social standing, or financial security?\n\nYou’d do it in a heartbeat, right?\n\nWell then, Mr. Theodore Lerner, owner of the Washington Nationals and literally (yes, literally) the richest person in all of baseball, I say to you: make that change right goddamn now.\n\nTed Lerner has an asset on his hands. That asset is Bryce Harper. Bryce Harper is the best player in baseball. He might be the best player in the history of baseball for all we know. He is worth a lot of money. A lot. Titanic amounts of money. The type of money that would make A-Rod look like a little league benchwarmer. Innumerable amounts of cash with figures never before seen.\n\nWell, not innumerable. Let’s start at $500 million. Yes, start. It’s going to be higher than that, heck, it could and probably will hit $600 million. So far, in lockstep with most of his prior personnel decisions, Ted has shown no indication that he’s willing to pay that money.\n\nLook, investing $500 million in anything is a risky proposition. I do double takes when deciding whether or not I should renew my monthly $9.99 subscription to Spotify. It’s human nature to look half a billion dollars in the face and wonder what the hell you’re considering.\n\nBut you know what? No one gives a shit, Ted. Because your $6.5 billion legacy will be forever defined by whether or not you gave a generational talent enough money to make his mark on a franchise that has existed for barely 10 years and needs a face. You are so rich that investing $500 million would leave you with fucking $6 billion. Except that’s not even true at all, because the Nationals make you copious amounts of money every season and I’m sure your investments are doing quite well; in fact, I know that your real estate empire just keeps growing and growing because my freaking neighborhood is being overrun with construction sites plastered floor to ceiling with your name. So even though you’re out half a billion bucks, my non-business degree tells me that you’ll still be making bank, not to mention all the free publicity and fan support that Harper’s new contract would buy.\n\nRefusing to invest would have consequences. The chance of winning a World Series anytime soon would fly out the window. A universal fan exodus would take a Jaws-sized bite out of your franchise’s value. Losing the most talented and polarizing player in the world would cast a long shadow over the national spotlight you currently enjoy on a daily basis. Neglecting to sign Harper could COST you. And the longer you wait, the more expensive he becomes. In the end, it could become a needlessly pricey proposition.\n\nSpeaking of the end, I really hate to bring this up, but you’re 90 years old. I know you want to preserve your financial legacy far beyond your living days, but come on. dude. You didn’t buy this team purely on an investment basis. You also bought it because you love baseball. Because you want to win a championship. And if you want to see that trophy held high before the end of your days, pay Bryce Harper a gazillion dollars. Who cares what it takes.\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_27651": "Terry Paxton Bradshaw (born September 2, 1948) is a former American football quarterback who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL). Since 1994, he has been a TV sports analyst and co-host of Fox NFL Sunday. Bradshaw is also an actor, having participated in many television shows and films, most notably starring in the movie Failure to Launch. He played for 14 seasons with Pittsburgh, won four Super Bowl titles in a six-year period (1974, 1975, 1978, and 1979), becoming the first quarterback to win three and four Super Bowls, and led the Steelers to eight AFC Central championships. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989, his first year of eligibility. Bradshaw was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1996.\n\nA tough competitor, Bradshaw is known for having one of the most powerful arms in NFL history. He also called his own plays throughout his football career.[1] His physical skills and on-the-field leadership played a major role in the Pittsburgh Steelers' history. During his career, he passed for more than 300 yards in a game only seven times, but three of those performances came in the postseason, and two of those in Super Bowls. He played very well in the Super Bowl, and in four career Super Bowl appearances, he passed for 932 yards and 9 touchdowns, both Super Bowl records at the time of his retirement. In 19 post-season games, he completed 261 passes for 3,833 yards.\n\nEarly years [ edit ]\n\nBradshaw was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. His father, William Marvin \"Bill\" Bradshaw (1927–2014), a native of Sparta, Tennessee, and the son of John and Margie Bradshaw, was a veteran of the United States Navy, a former vice president of manufacturing of the Riley Beaird Company in Shreveport, and a Southern Baptist layman.[2] Terry's mother, Novis (née Gay; born 1929),[3][4] was one of five children of Clifford and Lula Gay of Red River Parish, Louisiana.[5] He has an older brother, Gary, and a younger brother, Craig.\n\nThe work ethic was particularly strong in the Bradshaw household. Bradshaw spent his early childhood in Camanche, Iowa, where he set forth the goal to play professional football.[6] When he was a teenager, Bradshaw returned with his family, including his brothers, to Shreveport.[7] There, he attended Woodlawn High School, played under assistant coach A. L. Williams, and led the Knights to the 1965 AAA High School Championship game. His team then lost to the Sulphur Golden Tornadoes 12–9. While at Woodlawn, he set a national record for throwing the javelin 245 feet (74.68 m).[8] His exploits earned him a spot in the Sports Illustrated feature Faces In The Crowd. Bradshaw's successor as Woodlawn's starting quarterback was another future NFL standout, Joe Ferguson of the Buffalo Bills. Bradshaw's Steelers would defeat Ferguson's Bills in a 1974 divisional playoff game.\n\nBradshaw in 1967\n\nCollege career [ edit ]\n\nBradshaw decided to attend Louisiana Tech University in Ruston. He has much affinity for his alma mater. He is a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He was active in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and spoke before many athletic banquets and other gatherings.[9] Initially, he was second on the depth chart at quarterback behind Phil \"Roxie\" Robertson, who would later become famous as the inventor of the Duck Commander duck call and television personality on the A&E program Duck Dynasty.[10][11]\n\nWhen he arrived at Tech in 1966, Bradshaw caused a media frenzy on account of his reputation of being a football sensation from nearby Shreveport.[12][13] Robertson was a year ahead of Bradshaw, and was the starter for two seasons in 1966 and 1967, and chose not to play in 1968.[14] As Robertson put it: \"I'm going for the ducks, you [Terry] can go for the bucks.\"[15]\n\nIn 1969, Bradshaw was considered by most professional scouts to be the most outstanding college football player in the nation. As a junior, he amassed 2,890 total yards, ranking No. 1 in the NCAA, and led his team to a 9–2 record and a 33–13 win over Akron in the Rice Bowl. In his senior season, he gained 2,314 yards, ranking third in the NCAA, and led his team to an 8–2 record. His decrease in production was mainly because his team played only 10 games that year, and he was taken out of several games in the second half because his team had built up a huge lead.\n\nBradshaw graduated owning virtually all Louisiana Tech passing records at the time. In 1984, he was inducted into the inaugural class of the Louisiana Tech sports hall of fame.[16] Four years later, he was inducted into the state of Louisiana's sports hall of fame.[17]\n\nNFL career [ edit ]\n\nPittsburgh Steelers [ edit ]\n\nIn the 1970 NFL Draft, Bradshaw was the first overall player selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Steelers drew the first pick in the draft after winning a coin flip tiebreaker with the Chicago Bears due to both teams having identical 1–13 records in 1969.[18] In either case, Bradshaw was hailed at the time as the consensus No. 1 pick.\n\nBradshaw became a starter in his second season after splitting time with Terry Hanratty in his rookie campaign. During his first few seasons, the 6'3\", 215-pound quarterback was erratic, threw many interceptions (he threw 210 interceptions over the course of his career) and was widely ridiculed by the media for his rural roots and perceived lack of intelligence.[7][19]\n\nBradshaw (12) handing the ball to Franco Harris in Super Bowl XIV\n\nIt took Bradshaw several seasons to adjust to the NFL, but he eventually led the Pittsburgh Steelers to eight AFC Central championships and four Super Bowl titles. The Pittsburgh Steelers featured the \"Steel Curtain\" defense and a powerful running attack led by Franco Harris and Rocky Bleier, but Bradshaw's strong arm gave them the threat of the deep pass, helping to loosen opposing defenses. In 1972, he threw the \"Immaculate Reception\" pass to Franco Harris to beat the Raiders in the AFC Divisional playoffs, which is among the most famous plays in NFL history.\n\nBradshaw temporarily lost the starting job to Joe Gilliam in 1974, but he took over again during the regular season. In the 1974 AFC Championship Game against the Oakland Raiders, his fourth-quarter touchdown pass to Lynn Swann proved to be the winning score in a 24–13 victory. In the Steelers' 16–6 Super Bowl IX victory over the Minnesota Vikings that followed, Bradshaw completed 9 of 14 passes and his fourth-quarter touchdown pass put the game out of reach and helped take the Steelers to their first Super Bowl victory.\n\nIn Super Bowl X following the 1975 season, Bradshaw threw for 209 yards, most of them to Lynn Swann, as the Steelers beat the Dallas Cowboys, 21–17. His 64-yard touchdown pass to Swann (that traveled roughly 70 yards in the air)—which was released a split-second before defensive tackle Larry Cole flattened him causing a serious concussion—late in the fourth quarter is considered by some to be one of the greatest passes in NFL history.\n\nNeck and wrist injuries in 1976 forced Bradshaw to miss four games. He was sharp in a 40–14 victory over the Baltimore Colts, completing 14 of 18 passes for 264 yards and three touchdowns, but the Steelers' hopes of a three-peat ended when both of their 1,000-yard rushers (Franco Harris and Rocky Bleier) were injured in the win over the Colts, and the Steelers subsequently lost to the Oakland Raiders in the AFC Championship game, 24-7. Jack Lambert asserted that that 1976 Steelers team was the best team that he ever played on, including the 4 Super Bowl teams of which he was a part.\n\nBradshaw had his finest season in 1978 when he was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player by the Associated Press after a season in which he completed 207 of 368 passes for 2,915 yards and a league-leading 28 touchdown passes. He was also named All-Pro and All-AFC that year, despite throwing 20 interceptions.\n\nBefore Super Bowl XIII, a Steelers-Cowboys rematch, Cowboys linebacker Thomas \"Hollywood\" Henderson famously ridiculed Bradshaw by saying, \"He couldn't spell 'Cat' if you spotted him the 'c' and the 'a'.\"[20] Bradshaw got his revenge by winning the Most Valuable Player award, completing 17 of 30 passes for a then-record 318 yards and four touchdowns in a 35–31 win. Bradshaw has in later years made light of the ridicule with quips such as \"it's football, not rocket science.\"\n\nBradshaw won his second straight Super Bowl MVP award in 1979 in Super Bowl XIV. He passed for 309 yards and two touchdowns in a 31–19 win over the Los Angeles Rams. Early in the 4th quarter, with Pittsburgh down 19–17, Bradshaw again turned to the long pass to help engineer a victory: a 73-yard touchdown to John Stallworth. Bradshaw shared Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year award that season with fellow Pittsburgh star Willie Stargell, whose Pirates won the 1979 World Series.\n\nBradshaw playing with the Steelers in 1982\n\nAfter two seasons of missing the playoffs, Bradshaw played through pain—he needed a cortisone shot before every game because of an elbow injury sustained during training camp—in a strike-shortened 1982 NFL season. He still managed to tie for the most touchdown passes in the league with 17. In a 31–28 playoff loss to the San Diego Chargers, Bradshaw's last postseason game, he completed 28-of-39 passes for 325 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions.\n\nAfter undergoing off-season elbow surgery, Bradshaw was idle for the first 14 games of the 1983 NFL season. Then on December 10, 1983, against the New York Jets, he felt a pop in his elbow while throwing his final pass, a 10-yard touchdown to Calvin Sweeney in the second quarter of the Steelers' 34–7 win. Bradshaw later left the game and never played again. The two touchdowns Bradshaw threw in what would be the final NFL game played at Shea Stadium (and the last NFL game in New York City to date) allowed him to finish his career with two more touchdowns (212) than interceptions (210) for his career.\n\nHis retirement came as a surprise to some,[21] and in hindsight unplanned on the Steelers part.[22] Before Bradshaw's elbow problems came about, the team chose to pass up Pitt quarterback Dan Marino in the 1983 NFL Draft as an heir successor to Bradshaw due in part to head coach Chuck Noll wanting to rebuild on defense and, according to Bill Hillgrove, the Rooney family not wanting Marino to face a lot of pressure in his hometown and needing to experience life outside of Oakland where Marino grew up and where Pitt is located.[22] The player the Steelers drafted instead (Gabriel Rivera) only played six games before becoming a quadriplegic following a drunk driving accident, and Marino's subsequent success with the Miami Dolphins prompted Art Rooney to remind his sons daily until his death that the team \"should've drafted Marino.\"[22] The decision also set the franchise back at quarterback: while the team would eventually return to being a Super Bowl contender after their rebuilding period during the mid-1980s, the team wouldn't have a consistent quarterback until Ben Roethlisberger arrived in 2004.\n\nAlthough the Steelers have not officially retired Bradshaw's number 12, they have not reissued it since his retirement and it is understood that no Steeler will ever wear it again.\n\nIn July 1997, Bradshaw served as the presenter when Mike Webster, his center on the Steelers' Super Bowl XIII and XIV title teams, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2006, despite the Steelers being one of the teams playing in the game, Bradshaw did not attend a pregame celebration for past Super Bowl MVP's during Super Bowl XL in Detroit, Michigan. According to reports, Bradshaw (along with three time MVP and close friend Joe Montana) requested a US$100,000 guarantee for his appearance in the Super Bowl MVP Parade, and associated appearances. The NFL could not guarantee that they would make that much and refused. A representative for Bradshaw has since denied this report. After an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (February 6, 2006) Bradshaw stated that the reason why he did not attend the MVP parade was that he was spending time with family, that he hates the crowds and the Super Bowl media circus, and also that the only way he would attend a Super Bowl is when Fox is broadcasting the game (it was ABC who broadcast Super Bowl XL), though Bradshaw attended several press conferences in Detroit days earlier. Bradshaw also stated that money was not an issue.\n\nIn April 2006, Bradshaw donated his four Super Bowl rings, College Football Hall of Fame ring, Pro Football Hall of Fame ring, Hall of Fame bust, four miniature replica Super Bowl trophies, and a helmet and jersey from one of his Super Bowl victories to his alma mater, Louisiana Tech.\n\nOn November 5, 2007, during a nationally televised Monday Night Football game, Bradshaw joined former teammates including Franco Harris and Joe Greene to accept their position on the Pittsburgh Steelers 75th Anniversary All-Time Team.\n\nBroadcasting career [ edit ]\n\nBradshaw retired from football on July 24, 1984,[21] and quickly signed a television contract with CBS to become an NFL game analyst in 1984, where he and play-by-play announcer Verne Lundquist had the top rated programs. Prior to his full-time work for them, he served as a guest commentator for CBS Sports' NFC postseason broadcasts from 1980–82.\n\nBradshaw was promoted into television studio analyst for The NFL Today in 1990 (which he hosted with Greg Gumbel through the 1993 season), and Fox NFL Sunday, where he normally acts as a comic foil to his co-hosts. On Fox NFL Sunday he hosts two semi-regular features, Ten Yards with TB, where he fires random questions at an NFL pro, and The Terry Awards, an annual comedic award show about the NFL season. As a cross-promotional stunt, he also hosted two consecutive Digi-Bowl specials in 2001 and 2002 on Fox Kids, providing commentary from the NFL on Fox studio in-between episodes of Digimon: Digital Monsters; the 2002 special was the final one as the Fox Kids block ended the same year. He appeared on the first broadcast of NASCAR on FOX where he took a ride with Dale Earnhardt at Daytona International Speedway the night before Earnhardt was killed in a last lap crash in the Daytona 500. Bradshaw also waved the green flag at the start of the race.\n\nBradshaw has the reputation of being the \"ol' redneck\", but, in co-host and former NFL coach Jimmy Johnson's words, the act is a \"schtick.\"[23] According to Johnson, Bradshaw deflects such criticism by stating that \"he's so dumb that he has to have somebody else fly his private plane.\"[23]\n\nBradshaw has also garnered the reputation for criticizing players and teams.[24] Following Super Bowl XLVI he was confronted by Ann Mara, wife of the late Wellington Mara, and \"heckled\" for not picking the Giants to win on Fox NFL Sunday.[24]\n\nBusiness career [ edit ]\n\nDuring the early part of his career with the Steelers, Bradshaw was a used car salesman during the off-season to supplement his income, as this was still during the days when most NFL players didn't make enough money to focus solely on football.[25][26]\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Bradshaw sold peanut butter with his name and image on the label. Commercials were run on television in the Shreveport market.\n\nBradshaw has also written or co-written five books and recorded six albums of country/western and gospel music. His cover of \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" hit Top 20 on Billboard's country chart (and No. 91 on the Hot 100) in 1976; two other tunes (\"The Last Word In Lonesome Is Me\" and \"Until You\") also made the country charts.[27]\n\nIn 2001, Bradshaw entered the world of NASCAR by joining with HighLine Performance Group racing team to form FitzBradshaw Racing. He also is the spokesman for Jani-King international, Inc. Bradshaw ended his ownership in 2006.[28]\n\nAmong U.S. consumers, Bradshaw remains one of pro football's most popular retired players. As of September 2007, Bradshaw was the top-ranked former pro football player in the Davie-Brown Index (DBI), which surveys consumers to determine a celebrity's appeal and trust levels.[29]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nBradshaw has been married four times. He was first married to Melissa Babish (Miss Teenage America, 1969)[30] from 1972–73; to ice skater JoJo Starbuck from 1976–83; and to family attorney Charla Hopkins, who is the mother of his two daughters, Rachel and Erin, from 1983-99.[citation needed] Erin Bradshaw shows champion paint and quarter horses and is an honors graduate of the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas. Rachel Bradshaw is a graduate of Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, and appeared in Nashville (2007), a reality TV series about young musicians trying to make it in Nashville, and is the widow of former Tennessee Titans kicker Rob Bironas. The first three of Bradshaw's marriages have all ended in divorce, a subject he ridicules frequently on his NFL pre-game show. Bradshaw was married for the fourth time, on July 8, 2014, to Tammy, his girlfriend of 15 years.[citation needed]\n\nBradshaw in 1979\n\nAfter his NFL career ended, Bradshaw disclosed that he had frequently experienced anxiety attacks after games. The problem worsened in the late 1990s after his third divorce, when he said he \"could not bounce back\" as he had after the previous divorces or after a bad game. In addition to anxiety attacks, his symptoms included weight loss, frequent crying, and sleeplessness. He was diagnosed with clinical depression. Since then he has taken Paxil regularly. He chose to speak out about his depression to overcome the stigma associated with it and to urge others to seek help.[31]\n\nBradshaw's anxieties about appearing in public, away from the controlled environment of a television studio, led to an unintentional estrangement from the Steelers. When team founder and owner Art Rooney died in 1988, Bradshaw did not attend his funeral. A year later, during his Hall of Fame induction speech, Bradshaw made a point of saluting his late boss and friend, pointing to the sky and saying, \"Art Rooney ... boy, I tell you, I loved that man.\"[citation needed]\n\nStill, Bradshaw never returned to Three Rivers Stadium for a Steelers game. When the last regular season game was played there on December 16, 2000, Bradshaw was with the Fox NFL Sunday crew, doing their pre-game show aboard the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman, while Fox covered the game live. Bradshaw expressed regret that he could not be there, but would later say privately that he did not feel he could face the crowds. It would not be until September 2002, when fellow Hall of Fame teammate and longtime friend Mike Webster died, that Bradshaw finally returned to Pittsburgh to attend his friend's funeral.[citation needed]\n\nIn October 2002, Bradshaw returned to the Steelers sideline for the first time in twenty years for a Monday night game between the Steelers and the Indianapolis Colts. In 2003, when the Steelers played the 1,000th game in franchise history, Fox covered the game at Heinz Field, and Bradshaw returned to cover the game. In addition to appearing to take his position on the Steelers All-Time Team in 2007 as part of the team's 75th anniversary festivities, he also was on the sideline for the 2007 home opener, where the Steelers earned their 500th regular season win.[citation needed]\n\nPolitically, Bradshaw is a long-time supporter of the Republican Party.[32] In 2012, he went on record on Fox News as supporting the candidacy of Newt Gingrich for the Republican presidential nomination.[33] In the same interview, he also labeled linebacker Terrell Suggs \"an idiot\" for making comments critical of Denver quarterback Tim Tebow's public remarks about his Christian faith, saying Suggs \"better be careful; if I were him I'd be on my hands and knees tonight asking for forgiveness because that's totally unacceptable.\"[33]\n\nRelationship with Chuck Noll [ edit ]\n\nWhile Bradshaw never had any issues with the Rooney family, he had a complicated relationship with Steelers head coach Chuck Noll. Noll and Bradshaw had an uneasy relationship during his playing days, with Bradshaw stating that he felt that Noll was too hard on him and never liked him, though the two made peace (at least publicly) before Noll's death in 2014.[34]\n\nIn an interview with NFL Films in 2016 for an episode of A Football Life about Noll, Bradshaw felt that the two had too much of a culture clash with their personalities. Bradshaw also stated that Noll belittled him constantly and wanted positive reinforcement instead of \"being grabbed at\".[35] In the same episode, however, former teammates Lynn Swann & Jack Ham and former Steelers PR director Joe Gordon felt that the animosity was a one-way street, with Ham adding that Bradshaw was the only player treated differently by Noll and that Bradshaw was constantly coddled while it was \"the hell with us\" with the rest of the team.[35]\n\nIn archival interview, Noll described his relationship with Bradshaw as \"professional\" and that his personality needed to conform with the team, adding that \"it worked, even if Bradshaw didn't like it.\"[35] Nonetheless, Bradshaw chose not to attend Noll's funeral despite being in Pittsburgh at the time.[36]\n\nTelevision and film career [ edit ]\n\nBradshaw has appeared in numerous television commercials. The most recent was the series of \"live-ads\" for Tide detergent along with his Fox Sports co-host Curt Menefee, where Bradshaw shows up with a shirt stain on what appeared to be live TV from the Fox broadcast booth at Super Bowl LI and then washes it with Tide at the house of Jeffrey Tambor. The teasers leading up to the Super Bowl showed Tambor initially taking his shirts to Rob Gronkowski's dry cleaners only to see the sleeves get ripped out. Near the end of the Super Bowl, Menefee spills coffee on his shirt but Tambor who is watching on TV refuses to help out.[37][38]\n\nBradshaw has had cameo appearances in many shows as himself, including Brotherly Love, Everybody Loves Raymond, Married... with Children, Modern Family, The Larry Sanders Show and The League. He also appeared on Malcolm in the Middle with Howie Long as the trashy coach of a women's ice hockey team. He hosted a short-lived television series in 1997 called Home Team with Terry Bradshaw.\n\nIn addition to his television work, Bradshaw has appeared in several movies, including a part in the 1978 film Hooper which starred Burt Reynolds, Jan-Michael Vincent, and Sally Field, and 1981's appearance in The Cannonball Run. In 1980, he had a cameo in Smokey and the Bandit II which starred Burt Reynolds, Jerry Reed, and Sally Field. He made a guest appearance in The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. in 1994, playing Colonel Forrest March, a rogue U.S. Army officer who gave orders to his squad (played by NFL members Ken Norton, Jr., Carl Banks, and Jim Harbaugh) in a huddle using football diagrams.\n\nBradshaw appeared on Jeff Foxworthy's short-lived sitcom, The Jeff Foxworthy Show as a motivational speaker for people needing to change their lives. Bill Engvall's character is affected by Bradshaw's rantings about witchcraft and voodoo in his pre-game warm-ups.\n\nOn October 11, 2001, Bradshaw received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the first and only NFL player (as of May 31, 2008) to do so.[39][40]\n\nIn 2006, Bradshaw returned to the silver screen in the motion picture Failure to Launch. He and Kathy Bates played the parents of Matthew McConaughey's character. In one notable scene he appeared nude, a move which Jay Leno spent an entire segment mocking during an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. He mentioned on May 23, 2008, on The Tonight Show that he has been a guest 37 times, and that 34 of them were on a Friday, which happens to be the lowest watched night of television. He pleasantly joked with Jay about being a 'filler' guest. He made a similar reference in an appearance on March 15, 2010, stating he was asked to guest because of a cancellation. Jay stated that at least he was not appearing on Friday, which hosts the more well-known celebrity guests. As of December 28, 2012, Bradshaw has made 50 appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\n\nHe is also a devout Christian and wrote the book Terry Bradshaw: Man of Steel with broadcaster Dave Diles.[41] Since 2010, Bradshaw has been hosting television shows produced by United States Media Television.\n\nIn 2016, Bradshaw had a leading role in the NBC alternative comedy series Better Late Than Never, where he travels around the world with other American celebrities, which include William Shatner, Henry Winkler, George Foreman, and Jeff Dye. In 2017, he had a supporting role in the comedy film Father Figures.[42]\n\nOn January 16, 2019, he was revealed on the third episode of The Masked Singer to be The Deer.\n\nNFL career stats [ edit ]\n\nLegend Won the Super Bowl Super Bowl MVP AP NFL MVP NFL record Bold Career high\n\nKey to abbreviations\n\nGP = Games played Att = Passes attempted Com = Passes completed Pct = Completion percentage Yds = Yards TD = Touchdowns Int = Interceptions Long = Longest pass play of season QB Rating = Passer rating W/L record = Won/Loss record\n\nNCAA collegiate career stats Louisiana Tech Bulldogs Season Passing Rushing Comp Att Yards Pct.

  "latent_27666": "A Forum Research poll of five interesting races for Toronto City Council shows veteran politician Giorgio Mammoliti remains in a close battle. Mammoliti, who has represented Ward 7, York West, on council since 2000, is locked in a virtual tie with challenger Nick DiNizio.\n\nCouncillor Giorgio Mammoliti appears to be in a serious fight to hold onto his council seat, according to the results of a Forum Research poll. ( STEVE RUSSELL / TORONTO STAR FILE PHOTO ) Media-shy Mike Ford, nephew to Rob and Doug Ford, seems to be running strong on name recognition in Etobicoke despite his youth and lack of a job history. ( Facebook )\n\nThe interactive voice response poll conducted Sept. 6-9 of 214 residents showed the controversial councillor had the support of 37 per cent of voters, while 33 per cent backed DiNizio. The results were in line with a July 23 poll of 191 residents that showed Mammoliti’s support at 29 per cent versus 27 per cent for DiNizio. Forum cautioned that the sample size is small. The margin of error in the latest survey is plus or minus 7 percentage points.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nThe pollster found that while 85 per cent of residents know of Mammoliti, his approval rating stands at only 50 per cent. Mammoliti was recently found to have violated council’s rules on accepting gifts and benefits connected with the performance of his duties. City council voted 37-2 in July to deny Mammoliti his salary for three months — about $26,000 — after a fundraiser netted $80,000. The salary hit is the most severe penalty council has ever imposed as a result of an investigation by the integrity commissioner, and it is the maximum sanction at the city’s disposal under a provincial law that has been criticized as inadequate. Mammoliti maintains he did nothing wrong.\n\nIntegrity commissioner Janet Leiper found he took $31,000 from lobbyists or clients of lobbyists who joined his relatives at the $500-a-plate fundraiser in Woodbridge in May 2013. Forum also looked at four other races among the 44 council seats up for grabs in the Oct. 27 election.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nMike Ford, a nephew of Mayor Rob Ford and Councillor Doug Ford, is leading in his attempt to ensure a Ford continues to represent Ward 2, Etobicoke North. The Rexdale ward is now held by Doug Ford, who isn’t running for re-election, and was previously Rob Ford’s turf before he was elected mayor in 2010. Forum said Michael Ford, with 50 per cent support, leads Andray Domise, who enjoys the backing of 30 per cent of the voters. (That result is based on a poll of 396 residents, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5 points.) In Ward 30, Toronto-Danforth, incumbent Paula Fletcher enjoys a solid lead, with 56 per cent of 407 voters polled backing her, compared with 18 per cent for Liz West and 13 per cent for Jane Farrow. Forum found Fletcher is very well known and has a relatively high approval rating at 68 per cent among the 407 residents polled; the margin of error is 5 points. Meanwhile, the pollster says Mary-Margaret McMahon has a “lock” on the Ward 32, Beaches-East York ward she has held since 2010. McMahon’s support is solid at 60 per cent. The poll sampled 546 residents, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 points. Former councillor Sandra Bussin is attempting a comeback in Ward 32, but the poll has her well behind McMahon at 21 per cent. Bussin is well known but suffers from a low 33 per cent approval rating. Voters in the downtown seat previously held by Adam Vaughan are backing Joe Cressy, who earlier this year was the NDP candidate in the federal by-election won by Vaughan for the Liberals. Cressy’s decision to enter the municipal race is paying off, with Forum finding he has 47 per cent support while other candidates are stuck in single digits. Forum polled 292 residents; the margin of error is 6 points.",
  "latent_27696": "Moments before I sit down with Jurassic World star Bryce Dallas Howard, she sweeps through the doorway and flags down a studio rep, production notes in hand, with a last-minute change to her character’s description in the film’s marketing materials.\n\n“Can we not say she is ‘careerist?’” she asks with an open, friendly smile, more gentle mandate than request.\n\nHoward later explained to me that she’d only just read through Universal Pictures’ synopsis describing her character, the power skirt-sporting Jurassic World executive who’s about to have the worst day ever at work.\n\n“It’s about awareness and mindfulness and pointing things out, and making changes depending on your own sphere of influence,” said Howard, folding her legs beneath her inside a trailer on the Universal Studios lot. “It was a little thing that was brought to my attention, and I brought it to [the studio’s], and there will be no pushback because everyone is onboard. A perfect example is this film. In an action film, for a character to have this kind of an arc regardless of gender is pretty unique and ballsy.”\n\nGender-swap Jurassic World’s leads and that might be entirely true. But because the film’s lead is an emotionally frosty woman who trades her job for a boyfriend and two kids to care for by the end of the film, the line between feminist/anti-feminist gets murkier than a muddy dinosaur footprint.\n\nIn charge of the day-to-day operations of the massive Costa Rican island theme park where 20,000 tourists a day fork over big bucks to ogle prehistoric dinosaurs, Howard’s Claire is the park’s high-strung boss lady. She’s good at her job, and executes it while sporting flawless power bangs, 3.5-inch nude heels, and a monochrome skirt-blouse-and-blazer combo.\n\nAlas, she’s also fixated on metrics over actual human or animal life. She’s too frigid to date jerks like the ex-military dino trainer who once tried to take her out (Chris Pratt). Glued to her smart phone, she’s too busy worrying about guest retention and the considerable new security issues with a top-secret new dino to spend time with her visiting nephews. Is it not reasonable, then, to call Claire a “driven careerist?”\n\n“There can be ways that words are used that aren’t helpful, and it’s about changing the conversation,” Howard argued, pointing to last year’s “Ban Bossy” campaign. Backed prominently by Lean In founder Sheryl Sandberg and a handful of high profile female celebrities, the effort aimed to erase the word “bossy” from the cultural lexicon because of its potential negative impact on young girls.\n\n“Using the word ‘bossy’ for girls can be quite harmful,” Howard said. “What is that saying, that being focused, being assertive, being the boss has a negative attribute? And I have heard that term associated more with women than with men. ‘He’s so bossy’—you don’t hear that. It’s a very subtle thing.”\n\nHoward had input into Claire’s defining elements because she signed on so early, the project didn’t yet have a script. Director Colin Trevorrow had only made one feature, which sent diehard Jurassic Park fans into enough of a panic. But he was anointed by none other than Steven Spielberg, who reportedly granted Trevorrow final cut. He co-wrote Jurassic World with his Safety Not Guaranteed partner Derek Connolly and, Howard says, put her worries at ease with his rundown of Claire’s story.\n\n“In her quest for profit she has disconnected from her own humanity and her own family, and this is a journey for her to reconnect with her humanity, for her actions to be in alignment with her values, and to reclaim her strength,” Howard said. “I also like the idea that she’s a C-level executive—she is the boss—and that’s not necessarily her most empowered self. Her most empowered self is at the end of the film.”\n\nMany will boil Claire down to a simple ice queen bossypants who’s forgone relationships and family to climb to the top, just as Guardians of the Galaxy’s Chris Pratt uncharacteristically plays an acerbic loner who’s chosen to live in relative isolation with Velociraptors instead of humans. They’re both written as people who need people, who only learn to open up and reach out when dinosaurs start running amok. Claire’s nephews don’t help much, since they highlight her childlessness and, at one point, tell her they feel much safer under the protection of her “boyfriend.\"\n\nHoward prefers to see her Claire as “a character who is flawed and layered and goes on a journey and is a different human being in the beginning than the end. That’s not a gender thing, that’s just storytelling.”\n\nAs Jurassic World has weathered some negative reviews, so too has Claire stumbled into the sights of detractors who see her as a regressive kind of action heroine—not the successor to Ellen Ripley or Sarah Connor that director Trevorrow might have hoped. Critics point aggressively to Claire’s single most defining sartorial attribute, one that Trevorrow says Howard insisted upon keeping as they hammered out the character: Her shoes.\n\nGinger Rogers earned legend status for matching Fred Astaire step for step, “backwards and in high heels.” Eighty years of cultural progress later, she wouldn’t need to wear them anymore, certainly not on a jaunt through the jungle. And yet Howard spends the entirety of Jurassic World in her power heels, a running joke so curious the movie feels the need to explain why in a moment of self-aware exposition.\n\nPratt’s Owen has led Claire out into the dinosaur-infested park in search of her nephews, and mocks the impractical outfit she’s still wearing. She ties her blouse around her waist and keeps the heels on—not that Jurassic World has stockpiles of women’s running shoes conveniently nestled around the park like flashlights, or dino prods, or spare car parts. She chooses to keep her heels. (Trevorrow even pays cheeky homage to them in a slow motion close-up shot.)\n\nAnd that, Howard argues, is precisely what Claire would have done.\n\n“For me, the heels were a metaphor,” she said. “First of all, I just believe that she’s one of those women who say they walk so much better in heels. I’m absolutely not one of those women. Beyoncé, for example! But I thought she’s definitely that person.” (Side note: Bey might reject the word ‘bossy,’ but she did postulate that a diva is a female version of a hustler. And she probably could outrun a T. rex in a pair of stilettos.)\n\nHoward says she saw strength in Claire’s footwear choices. “The thing that would have been considered the biggest handicap for her ultimately ends up being her strength. And that’s those heels. I really liked that.”\n\nThe winds of outrage have been chasing Jurassic World ever since Joss Whedon infamously slammed a clip featuring the Claire and Owen characters as “70s-era sexist” months before release. Coming from the guy who stuck Black Widow in a corner, that was saying something.\n\n“When I was coming of age, I remembered reading and studying the initial ideas within the feminist movement. There was this idea with my parents’ generation that in order to find equality, a woman would need to behave like a man,” said Howard, who has two young children, has directed 12 of her own short films, and is gearing up to shoot her next project.\n\n“That seems to be from a historical perspective, a necessary step or shift in perception, a paradigm shift,” she continued. “But I think where we are now, for me, it’s about embracing my femininity as my greatest strength, and a God-given strength.”\n\n“Sometimes people are like, ‘Do you want to play strong women?’ I don’t have to play strong women in order to feel like a strong woman myself, but I do feel it’s important to play characters that are complex and interesting and believable.”\n\nJust give them full lives and a few more footwear options, Hollywood. And don’t call them careerists.",

  "latent_27730": "Bruised & battered Rand Paul not giving up on Obamacare fight\n\nRecovering from his injuries but still hard at work, Senator Rand Paul, R-Ky., is fighting to ensure that the Senate version of the GOP’s tax reform bill, at the least, will provide much-needed relief to the millions of Americans suffering from the Obamacare health law.\n\nSen. Paul announced on Twitter:\n\nToday I am announcing my intention to amend the Senate tax bill to repeal the individual mandate and provide bigger tax cuts for middle income taxpayers. The mandate repeal is a promise we all made and we should keep. It also allows an additional $300 billion+ in tax cuts. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) November 14, 2017\n\nMy amendment will fix a problem in the Senate bill where many taxpayers would see a tax increase because of the loss of state and local deductions. I will introduce a similar deduction as the House plan, making the tax reform plan more fair for everyone. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) November 14, 2017\n\nThis will help ensure House acceptance of the Senate plan as leaders there have stated they will not accept a plan with no state and local deductibility. Repeal the mandate fix problems with Senate bill through more tax cuts for all and help ensure House and Senate plans agree. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) November 14, 2017\n\nUsing tax reform as a means to repeal the individual health insurance mandate (arguably the most controversial part of Obamacare) is an idea President Trump has floated himself.\n\nI am proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.} We’re getting close! Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2017\n\nThe amendment needs to be voted on, but one thing’s for sure: The bruised and battered Rand Paul is still not giving up on the Obamacare and tax-reform fight.\n\nAnd it’s far past time for Senate Republicans to go on record with their position on this critical, unconstitutional component of Obamacare.\n\nWant to keep up with what’s going on in Washington without the liberal media slant, establishment spin, and politician-ese?\n\nSign up to get CRTV’s Capitol Hill Brief in your inbox every evening!

This is where an app such as Tenreads becomes relevant. Their idea is to curate the 10 best write-ups of the day, from a wide range of websites, and present them in one app. The stories are categorized into entertainment, sports, technology, for example. It is a mix of news, analysis and features, with occasional, in-depth write-ups.\n\nAudiobooks are actually a great way for people who don’t always find the time to sit and read.\n\nReado\n\nFree\n\nAndroid, iOS, Web (Reado.com/)\n\nThis is not exactly an app where one subscription gets you access to a library of books. Reado is more of a store where you can buy audiobooks. A cursory glance through the available titles shows that the cost ranges from ₹ 99, ₹ 199 and ₹ 299 to ₹ 1,299. For example, Ashlee Vance’s book on Elon Musk, narrated by Fred Sanders—duration 803 minutes— costs ₹ 199. Jay Sekulow’s Unholy Alliance is priced at ₹ 1,299.

  "latent_28028": "Some of you have heard of an Everyday Carry Bag or an EDC bag. Many already have one (or components of it) without realizing that you do. I prefer to call it a Get Home Bag, or GHB, because, regardless of the situation, your objective is to get yourself home. That’s where your family and supplies are located. It is probably your rally point for the family. Obviously, the distance between where you are (probably your workplace) and home has a significant impact on your bag.\n\nThis is still true. Before we cover the BoB we first need to cover the GHB so there is no overlap of contents. In my previous article, “ 3 Steps for Basic Disaster Preparedness: For Normal People Too ”, I wrote that if you are unable to store basic emergency supplies then you must have a bugout bag (BoB).This is still true.Before we cover the BoB we first need to cover the GHB so there is no overlap of contents.\n\nMy Get Home Bag\n\nThis is a picture of my bag. It is very simple because I work only six miles from home; a fifteen-minute drive or a 1.5-hour walk. Here are the contents: a backpack, checkbook, pen and pencil, multi-tool, flashlight, a larger knife, some snacks just in case, bottle of water, medications, a scarf (shemagh is my preference), a pair of socks, a high visibility runners vest in case I must walk at night, sunglasses, my cell phone and charger, and a hat. I wear the hat cell phone, and sunglasses so they don’t go in the bag. Seasonal items will be added and removed as necessary. Most of this stuff at your favorite dollar or overstock store pretty cheaply.\n\nThat’s easy for you to say, Ritch, but I work 40 miles from my home! Sure. You have a long way to go, but you still must get home, don’t you? Even if you can drive all the way, you should still have some stuff with you. Some roads may be closed or it may be necessary to shelter overnight in a church or gymnasium. This bag is about giving you options when disaster impedes your normal “on the way home” routine.\n\nHere are some of the optional/seasonal items that sometimes make it into my bag: Kindle/tablet, hoodie, gloves, notepad, small first-aid kit, winter cap, Holy Bible, stuff for cleaning my glasses, extra glasses, and personal hygiene items.\n\nOther items you might consider include subway/bus tokens, cash, a list of important phone numbers, personal protection equipment, self-defense equipment, whistle, and walking/running shoes or hiking boots. If you are away from home and it is imperative to return there before anything else, then you need this bag. If you can abandon your home, then you still must go somewhere. If that is a plausible scenario, then consider also keeping your bugout bag in your car or truck. A bugout bag will be the topic of my next article. Take care, y’all, and God bless.\n\n: Richard Davis is a retired veteran with a degree in Emergency Management on a mission to encourage people and communities to be prepared for emergencies by demonstrating low cost and low effort ways to stay safe.

  "latent_28166": "Digital Ocean offers Virtual Private Servers (VPS) for a very low monthly fee. Recently I set up a server with them and I am quite satisfied. If you want to have a place where you can experiment with building and running web applications, this can be a perfect starting point. In this article I'll explain how to set up a Perl Dancer based web site on a Digital Ocean droplet.\n\nSign up to Digital Ocean and create a server\n\nFirst you need to visit Digital Ocean (This is an affiliate link, I'll earn some credits if you use this link to sign up.), provide your credit card information. Once you are in you need to create a server instance. They call these Droplets. There is a big green button to Create droplets.\n\nYou need to supply the Droplet hostname which can be any word. You can pick foo or web1 or whatever you like. I picked s12 for this server. This is the internal name.\n\nThen you need to select the size. I go with the smallest: 512 Mb / 1 CPU / 20 Gb SSD disk / 1 TB transfer that costs $5 / month. I have not tried this yet, but if I understand correctly, I could create and destroy servers for much shorter periods and pay by the hour. This could be a lot of fun playing with setup.\n\nThe third thing to select is the region. Unless there is some really important reason to pick a specific data-center, you can go with any of those. I picked Amsterdam 1.\n\nIn the Select Image section, we need to select the Linux distribution we'll be using. You can pick your favorite one. I'll use Ubuntu 13.04 x64 for this article. This is the latest 64bit release of Ubuntu.\n\nAt the bottom you can then click on the big green button that says Create Droplet.\n\nThey will start building the server which takes about 60 seconds and send you an e-mail containing the IP address and the password of root. This is not the most secure process, but we'll change the password very soon so I don't think this is a big issue.\n\nIf you are worried they also allow you to provide a public key before you create the droplet and then they will install that key instead of sending you a password.\n\nBasic configuration of the server\n\nIn the e-mail you will see instructions how to ssh to the server. If you are a command line user, you can use the ssh root@1.2.3.4 command, with the IP address of your server.\n\nIf you run Windows, you will need to install an SSH client. I'd recommend installing putty. You just need to download the putty.exe file and you can double-click on it as it is. There is no need for any further \"installation\". Once the initial window of Putty has opened, there is a field for Host Name (or IP address) and a radio selector where you need to select SSH. Then press Open. This will get you to a window asking for Username:. There you type in root and press ENTER. It will then ask you for Password: and you type in the password you got in the e-mail.\n\nThe first thing we need to do is to change the password. So type in passwd and press ENTER. It will ask for a password and then it will ask you to repeat it. Please give a long password that you can remember. Something like The secret of a secure server is probably a good password. If you also add some numbers and some strange characters, it will become even stronger.\n\nroot@s12:~# passwd Enter new UNIX password: Retype new UNIX password: passwd: password updated successfully root@s12:~#\n\nOnce we set the new password we need to update the packages on the system. A Linux distribution consists of thousands of separate packages. Most Linux distributions constantly release fixes to these package and it is very likely that the droplet we created used an earlier set of these packages. So we should update and upgrade those packages:\n\naptitude update will download the most recent list of packages and their version numbers. This is usually done automatically, but we don't want to wait for that now.\n\nroot@s12:~# aptitude update Get: 1 http://archive.ubuntu.com raring Release.gpg [933 B] Get: 2 http://archive.ubuntu.com raring-updates Release.gpg [933 B] ...\n\naptitude safe-upgrade will first list the packages that need to be upgraded and ask: Do you want to continue? [Y/n/?]. If we press ENTER it will download these packages and install them on the system.\n\nroot@s12:~# aptitude safe-upgrade Resolving dependencies... The following NEW packages will be installed: linux-image-3.8.0-31-generic{a} The following packages will be upgraded: apt apt-transport-https apt-utils apt-xapian-index bind9-host command-not-found language-selector-common libapt-inst1.5 libapt-pkg4.12 libasn1-8-heimdal libbind9-90 libheimbase1-heimdal libheimntlm0-heimdal libhx509-5-heimdal libisc92 libisccc90 libpython2.7-stdlib libpython3.3-minimal libpython3.3-stdlib libroken18-heimdal linux-image-virtual login lsb-base lsb-release openssl passwd plymouth python3.3-minimal rsyslog tzdata ubuntu-release-upgrader-core update-manager-core 74 packages upgraded, 1 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded. Need to get 51.9 MB of archives. After unpacking 35.2 MB will be used. Do you want to continue? [Y/n/?]\n\nIf it asks questions about keeping the current version of various configuration files, you can usually just press ENTER. At this point this does not really matter.\n\nOnce the upgrade has finished it is recommended to reboot the system. Type in reboot. As the machine restarts this will disconnect you and you will need to connect to it via ssh (putty) again, after some time. (Maybe 30 sec?). Remember, you have changed the password!\n\nInstalling packages\n\nAs I mentioned every Linux distribution, and so Ubuntu too, comes with a lot of packages. Some of them are installed by default. Others need to be installed manually. Usually the way to install a package is to type aptitude install package-name. We will need a few of them so we type:\n\nroot@s12:~# aptitude install nginx\n\nIn some cases it will install the package right away, in other cases it might list what other packages need to be installed for the selected one to work (e.g. the dependencies on nginx) and it will ask you: Do you want to continue? [Y/n/?]. Just press ENTER.\n\nWe have just installed the nginx web server. We still need to start it for the first time. Type:\n\nroot@s12:~# service nginx start\n\nNow you can open your browser and browse to the IP address of the server. Don't forget to add http:// in front of the IP address as some of the browsers will not add it automatically. So if your IP address is 1.2.3.4 then type in the address bar of your server: http://1.2.3.4/ You will see Welcome to nginx! or some similar message.\n\nWe will need a few more packages, so let's install those as well:\n\nroot@s12:~# aptitude install make gcc htop vim\n\nIn order to have a better security model we are going to run Starman our \"application server\" as a separate user we call starman. (We could have called it foobar, or any other name.) In order to create the user we run:\n\nroot@s12:~# adduser --gecos '' --disabled-password starman\n\nIt will create the user starman and the only way to to access it will be via the user root. You can now switch to the starman user by typing:\n\nroot@s12:~# su - starman\n\nPlease note how the prompt changes from root@s12:~# to starman@s12:~$.\n\nTo return to the root user, just exit from the current user:\n\nstarman@s12:~$ exit\n\nBrewing Perl\n\nIf you run perl -v you will see the server already has perl installed. It is usually referred to as system perl. As we are going to install all kinds of modules from CPAN some of those might interfere with modules used by the system. So the usual recommendation is to build a separate perl installation and use that for the application. That's what we are going to do. We will use Perlbrew for this to make the operation smooth.\n\nLet's switch to the starman user and then follow the instructions on the Perlbrew web site and run:\n\nroot@s12:~# su - starman starman@s12:~$ \\curl -L http://install.perlbrew.pl | bash\n\nThis will install Perlbrew.\n\n(BTW, if you wondering about the backslash prefix, it ensures that no local alias will interfere with the command. See here)\n\nThen we need to add source ~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc to our start-up script which is the .bashrc file:\n\nstarman@s12:~$ echo \"source ~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\nWe do this so every time we login to the machine it will be already configured. At this point you can either logout (exit) and login again, or you can load the updated version of .bashrc using:\n\nstarman@s12:~$ source ~/.bashrc\n\nNow that perlbrew has been installed we can use it to install another version of Perl:\n\nstarman@s12:~$ perlbrew available\n\nThis will list the versions of Perl available from CPAN. As of the time of this writing this was the list:\n\nperl-5.19.4 perl-5.18.1 perl-5.16.3 perl-5.14.4 perl-5.12.5 perl-5.10.1 perl-5.8.9 perl-5.6.2 perl5.005_04 perl5.004_05 perl5.003_07\n\n5.19.4 is a development release (19, the second part of the version number is an odd number) and the most recent stable release is 5.18.1. So we'll install that version:\n\nstarman@s12:~$ perlbrew install perl-5.18.1\n\nThis will download the source of perl, compile it and test it. This can take quite some time. 10-20 minutes or even more. So this might be a good time to stretch a bit.\n\nOnce perl was built we can first list all the installed versions of perl:\n\nstarman@s12:~$ perlbrew list perl-5.18.1\n\nand we can switch to it using the following command:\n\nstarman@s12:~$ perlbrew switch perl-5.18.1\n\nIf we run perl -v, we'll see it already report 5.18.1 We can also try which perl and it will report /home/starman/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.1/bin/perl.\n\nInstalling Perl Modules from CPAN\n\nIt is not enough to compile our own version of Perl we also need to install a few modules. For this we need a configured CPAN client. The traditional one is called cpan, but we are going to use the newer and slicker cpan minus, also known as cpanm. Perlbrew has its own command to install cpan minus:\n\nstarman@s12:~$ perlbrew install-cpanm\n\nOnce that's install we can install the required modules:\n\nstarman@s12:~$ cpanm Dancer2 Starman Daemon::Control\n\nCreating a simple Dancer application\n\nThe command\n\nstarman@s12:~$ dancer2 -a Demo\n\nwill create a subdirectory called Demo and inside a skeleton of an application, called Demo. You can of course use any name as the name of your application, but it is usually recommended to start with a capital letter and then use lower case letters in the name.\n\nWe can change directory into the Demo directory and launch the web site with a development server on port 3000:\n\nstarman@s12:~$ cd Demo starman@s12:~$ perl bin/app.pl >> Dancer2 v0.10 server 29587 listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000\n\nWhile it says 0.0.0.0 as the IP address, you can actually use your own IP address. So if your IP address was 1.2.3.4 then browse to http://1.2.3.4:3000 and you will see the default page of Dancer.\n\nYou can go on and further improve the application by following the Getting started with Perl Dancer screencast, but for now we'll focus on configuring the server.\n\nSo let's stop the development server by pressing Ctrl-C on the console.\n\nConfiguring Starman\n\nAs user starman create /home/starman/starman_daemon.pl containing the following code:\n\nexamples/starman_daemon.pl\n\n#!/home/starman/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.1/bin/perl use warnings; use strict; use Daemon::Control; use Cwd qw(abs_path); Daemon::Control->new( { name => \"Starman\", lsb_start => '$syslog $remote_fs', lsb_stop => '$syslog', lsb_sdesc => 'Starman Short', lsb_desc => 'Starman controls the web sites.', path => abs_path($0), program => '/home/starman/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.1/bin/starman', program_args => [ '--workers', '3', '/home/starman/Demo/bin/app.pl' ], user => 'starman', group => 'starman', pid_file => '/tmp/starman.pid', stderr_file => '/tmp/starman.err', stdout_file => '/tmp/starman.out', fork => 2, } )->run;\n\nset the executable bit using\n\nstarman@s12:~$ chmod +x /home/starman/starman_daemon.pl\n\nThen leave the starman user using exit and as user root create a symbolic link to the newly created file and then start the Starman service:\n\nroot@s12:~# ln -s /home/starman/starman_daemon.pl /etc/init.d/starman root@s12:~# service starman start\n\nIn order to make sure Starman will start when the system boot we should add it to the boot scrips along with nginx. This is done by creating some more symbolic links.\n\nThis will list all the rc-directories where Nginx is listed. We should add the same set of links to Starman\n\nroot@s12:~# find /etc/ | grep rc| grep nginx | xargs ls -l\n\nThese commands will create the symbolic links:\n\nroot@s12:~# ln -s ../init.d/starman /etc/rc0.d/K20starman root@s12:~# ln -s ../init.d/starman /etc/rc1.d/K20starman root@s12:~# ln -s ../init.d/starman /etc/rc2.d/S20starman root@s12:~# ln -s ../init.d/starman /etc/rc3.d/S20starman root@s12:~# ln -s ../init.d/starman /etc/rc4.d/S20starman root@s12:~# ln -s ../init.d/starman /etc/rc5.d/S20starman root@s12:~# ln -s ../init.d/starman /etc/rc6.d/K20starman\n\nOnce you launched starman you can access the web application on the same hostname but on port 5000:\n\nhttp://1.2.3.4:5000\n\nConfigure nginx as a proxy\n\nAs user starman create the file /home/starman/nginx-demo.conf with the following content:\n\nexamples/nginx-demo.conf\n\nserver { location / { proxy_set_header Host $http_host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $http_host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_pass http://localhost:5000; } }\n\nThen exit from the user, and as root remove the default configuration file, create a symbolic link to from the nginx configuration directory to the nginx-demo.conf file. Restart nginx.\n\nroot@s12:~# rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default root@s12:~# ln -s /home/starman/nginx-demo.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ root@s12:~# service nginx restart\n\nNow you can visit http://1.2.3.4 replacing this with the IP address of your machine.\n\nConnecting a domain name\n\nIf you already have a domain name registered, then you only need to configure it to make sure both www.domain.com and domain.com resolves to the IP address of your machine.\n\nIf you don't yet have one, you can register a domain name and then configure it.\n\nNo further changes are required to your configuration for this.\n\nFurther development\n\nAs you continue developing your application you will notice that the changes you make to files are not automatically reflected on the web site. This is normal. After all we just set up the deployment environment for your application.\n\nIf you want the new code to take effect, you'll need to restart Starman. As root run:\n\nroot@s12:~# service starman restart\n\nEnjoy the development!",

  "latent_28265": "Millions of Americans are not entitled to government health insurance subsidies under Obamacare because of the way the law is written, a divided three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday.\n\nBut the force of the legal victory was undercut just hours later when another appeals court in Richmond sided with the Obama administration on the subsidy question, setting up an almost certain extended legal battle that could soon reach the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a decision that could blow a massive hole in President Obama’s signature domestic achievement, the court held that people living in states that relied on the federal government to set up their insurance market exchanges cannot offer the subsidies considered critical to making coverage affordable.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the administration used an IRS rule to stretch the meaning of the Affordable Care Act, which said financial aid to to low- and middle-income people should only flow to exchanges “established by the State.” If that means only state-run exchanges, it would cut off subsidies to two-thirds of the nation.\n\nThe 2-1 decision from a three-judge panel effectively invalidated the IRS rule that ensured subsidies flowed to every state, and the deciding judges seemed to realize the potential impact of the ruling.\n\n“We reach this conclusion, frankly, with reluctance,” Judge Thomas B. Griffith said in his opinion for the court. “At least until states that wish to can set up Exchanges, our ruling will likely have significant consequences both for the millions of individuals receiving tax credits through federal Exchanges and for health insurance markets more broadly.”\n\nSEE ALSO: EDITORIAL: Obamacare in intensive care\n\nHours later, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the administration’s interpretation of where subsidies may flow, creating a split in the circuits. The judges in Richmond reasoned that Obamacare’s language was ambiguous and that the IRS rule was “a permissible exercise of the agency’s discretion.”\n\nYet the D.C. Circuit is widely viewed as the second-most powerful court in the land, and their edict will likely overshadow the Fourth Circuit for now.\n\nThe Obama administration is sure to appeal the D.C. circuit’s decision because the subsidies are a huge draw for Obamacare customers. Without that selling point, the reforms would effectively collapse under the weight of premiums that are no longer affordable.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said the ruling will have no immediate impact on consumers’ ability to receive tax credits right now, and the administration is “confident” about the appeal that the Justice Department will be making.\n\n“While this ruling is interesting to legal theorists, it has no practical impact,” Mr. Earnest said.\n\nBut Republicans wasted no time in cheering the blow to the White House, which comes on top of a Supreme Court victory in the Hobby Lobby case that allowed closely held corporations to ignore Obamacare’s contraception mandate.\n\n“For the second time in a month, the courts have ruled against the president’s unilateral actions regarding Obamacare,” Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, said. “The president has demonstrated he believes he has the power to make his own laws. That’s not the way our system of government was designed to work.”\n\nUnder the court’s ruling, only the 14 states and the District that have taken on the responsibility for their exchanges would be able to dole out premium tax credits to their residents.\n\nOther states, most with Republican governors or state legislatures, refused to set up the exchanges, forcing the federal government to step in for them.\n\nTo redress the potentially fatal blow to its signature law, the administration will likely seek an “en banc” hearing on the case by all the judges in the D.C. Circuit. That may be more likely to go their way, as Republicans have accused Democrats of packing the court.\n\nCourt rules allow any active member of the appeals court to vote for an en banc hearing, according to I. Glenn Cohen, a professor at Harvard Law School.\n\n“There is nothing in the rules that say that people who were confirmed after the decision was taken up but before it was issued do not get to sit, so I imagine it means the now-Democrat stacked group will vote for en banc rehearing,” he said.\n\nIf Tuesday’s decision is upheld in the long run, about 5 million Americans who used the federal exchange will see their health costs soar because they no longer have subsidies to bring down their premiums, according to Avalere Health, a Washington-based consultancy.\n\n“The responsibility for that lies squarely on the shoulders of the president,” Michael Cannon, director of health policy at the libertarian Cato Institute, told The Washington Times in a recent interview.\n\nMr. Cannon, a chief architect of the legal theory behind the Halbig case and an opponent of Obamacare, said he told “everyone who would listen” not to set up a state-run exchange because the subsidies could not legally flow to those states.\n\nThe complaining individuals and entities in Monday’s case were from states that opted not to set up their own health exchanges. To buttress their argument, they said the subsidies produced a ripple effect in which they were no longer insulated from the law’s twice-delayed employer mandate, a rule that requires companies with 50 or more full-time employees to offer health coverage or pay fines.\n\nThe rule is triggered once an employee takes advantage of government subsidies on an Obamacare health exchange. Without any subsidies, the plaintiffs reasoned, they would not have to worry about the employer mandate.\n\nThe Obama administration argued that Congress always intended the Health and Human Services Department to “stand in the shoes” of states that decided not to run their own marketplaces. That’s what it did during the law’s first enrollment period, setting up HealthCare.gov to serve the three dozen states that deferred to the federal government.\n\nMr. Earnest said there are four Obamacare legal challenges working their way through federal courts, and two district courts have ruled in favor of the administration.\n\n“There is decidedly mixed legal opinion about this,” Mr. Earnest said. “For those keeping score, we’re still ahead, two-to-one.”\n\n• Dave Boyer contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

  "latent_28479": "This blog is based on a talk Charlie Beckett gave at the 2015 British Science Festival in Bradford.\n\nAs journalism and society changes emotion is becoming a much more important dynamic in how news is produced and consumed. I would argue that this is redefining the classic idea of journalistic objectivity, indeed, it is reshaping the idea of news itself. That matters because journalism has an increasingly significant role in our lives as information, data and social media become more ubiquitous and more influential. At the moment journalists are exploring this as a professional phenomenon and citizens are seeing it as something that is personal – but I will suggest that to understand this better we need to think about the science around the relationship between emotions and understanding and behaviour.\n\nI should say two things before I start.\n\nFirstly, I am very much at the beginning of this line of research so today I am posing questions rather than giving answers.\n\nSecondly, I define ‘emotion’ rather broadly – other terms might be subjectivity, personalisation, sentiment, or affective communications.\n\nHere’s the context as I see it.\n\nWe are drowning in a sea of stories about our world. There is a daily flood of news through the new channels of the Internet combined with the traditional media that is bigger than ever before despite the business model crisis for some parts of the industry. News consumers have more access, more easily to more journalism than ever before.\n\nThat means that the news is everywhere, all the time. And it’s a different kind of news – it is networked.\n\nAs I charted in my first book SuperMedia, journalism is now interactive, inter-connected, participatory, more open, more global, multi-platform, multi-linear, a stream of data, analysis and comment. That can be wonderful. It gives the journalist extraordinary creative and communicative power. Since the 7/7 London bombings and those shaky pictures of people walking through the smoke-filled underground tunnels it is difficult to imagine any major event or issue being covered without the input of social media or digital devices. It can expand the citizen’s choice, information, engagement and understanding but it can also be confusing, distorting and even upsetting.\n\nThis is something I explored in a radio documentary I presented earlier this year Good News Is No News and I also wrote about it in The Guardian. I have never had such an animated public response to anything I have done in my life as I got to that programme. It touched a nerve among journalists and the public. Through interviews with a range of news-makers from Buzzfeed to the Daily Mail the programme showed how the old idea of ‘hard news’ that shocks, frightens, disturbs and alarms can leave the audience feeling alienated, disempowered, helpless and, worst of all, apathetic, insensitive and even hostile to learning about our world.\n\nI argued in that programme that journalism must not lose its competitive, critical, independent edge. It must tell people things we don’t always want to hear. But it should also find better ways to give context and promote understanding so that we pay attention to and engage with the news: if you like more ‘constructive journalism’. If news is going to work for you as citizens then we have to find better ways to create, deliver and consume journalism that is more relevant, reliable and responsive to the audience. There are many clever technological fixes that can help with this – the BBC has just relaunched its main website giving the consumer the option of customising the content to suit your interests. It will give local news for where you are from – and if you don’t want celebrity gossip, then you can turn that off. But there is much more that journalists must do to change their craft to help people cope with the increased volume and variety of sources now just a click away – and often thrust in front of you without your permission. I think understanding the new role of emotion in journalism is critical to this.\n\nThere are three factors currently driving journalists towards using emotion as a tool.\n\nThe first is economic. Competition has never been more intense. The Internet means that your rivals are everywhere and endless. Distraction away from news is more immediate and accessible to your audience than ever before. As advertising revenues plunge journalists have to fight harder than ever for every eyeball or ear. Tugging at your heart strings is a tried and tested way to get your attention.\n\nSecondly, it is about the technology. We have clear evidence that using emotional cues helps to get your attention and to prolong your engagement. So a story with a visual stimulus gets more traffic. Text written in conversational language tends to increase responsiveness. And there are legions of other tricks that sites like Upworthy have perfected – the so-called curiosity gap for example in a headline – “What Happened When Jeremy Corbyn and Harry Styles Met? Increasingly, journalism is now distributed not by transmitters or newsagents but by social media. Getting people to share your content is vital and emotion is critical to making that happen.\n\nThirdly, it’s about a better understanding of behavioural science and even neurology. We know from politics that people respond to emotion not ideas or facts – so when we do political journalism we now talk about ‘optics’ instead of ‘facts’. Marketing journalism is no different. We need to understand what makes people tick before we try to sell them news. Understanding how people relate to the news on a personal level is vital to anyone trying to get them to connect to their journalism. Sometimes people will have practical or professional reasons for finding news relevant, but increasingly it is an emotional response, too. Luckily for journalists we now have the technology and the data to measure that process.\n\nLet’s now see what’s changed about media that makes emotion more central.\n\nFirst of all media is now mobile. As this graph shows our devices are always with us. Smartphones especially are set to become effectively universal and their usage is increasing all the time. They are rapidly becoming the primary platform, not just an option.\n\nOur physical relationship to news is changing because of this technology – Rodin’s Thinker has become Steve Job’s Swiper. The device is always on – always to hand – but also part of your personal and public networks. You can customise it with apps for example to get what you want when you want it as well as share and create content yourself.\n\nAs humans we love to do this and as it becomes more intimate we become more attached. You might characterise this as digital dependency.\n\nAs this chart shows, despite the cost and the dangers of addiction, people are generally positive about this new relationship with the mobile technology – Smartphone users say they can’t live without their devices – but they also find them liberating and help them to connect better to information and other people.\n\nAnd I think that it’s important to stress the intimacy of this technology – compared to the consumption of news when sitting on the sofa or reading on the train. These devices are where people now turn to on waking.\n\nA study found that 35 percent of people thought about their smartphone first thing in the morning, followed by 17 percent who thought about coffee, and 13 percent who thought about their toothbrushes. Only 10 percent thought about their significant other.\n\nThis means that journalism has to work in this world where it is blended into people’s digital mobile lives alongside kittens, shopping, sport, music and pornography. It’s now part of people’s personal mediated lives.\n\nAs I said. Journalists are responding to this in a professional way. And that isn’t always very sophisticated. Arianna Huffington has seen the statistics that indicate that people are more likely to share content that has an uplifting element – look at the Facebook statistics on their ‘Good News’ section of the Huffington Post. But it doesn’t necessarily produce journalism of the most incisive or informative nature.\n\nBut it can also be a way to get people to engage with stories that are disturbing and frightening.\n\nThis photograph of a Greek sailor who helped refugees whose boat had sunk off a holiday beach got massive traffic and engagement because it showed a narrative about an heroic and instinctively compassionate and brave response to a tragic situation. It helped that he is very hunky and the picture very dramatic – but it helped frame the issue in a way that literally demonstrated how people could help.\n\nThis use of emotion can have some unexpected outcomes. Humour has never had a place in traditional hard news – but even with disaster stories such as the hurricane that hit Sandy people cope with tragedy partly through humour – it is also a big factor in sharing of political news.\n\nWhen Sandy hit people responded with gallows humour – with someone even setting up an account for the hurricane itself – it’s not journalism as such – but it was a way for people to engage with the story and so became part of the media narrative.\n\nSo we can see that there are functional reasons for sharing material – but it is a myth that people consume news mainly because it is useful, informative, or entertaining – or even that we want to know stuff so we can change the world. I think the primary reason – certainly for news sharing in the social media space is personal – we are acting in an emotionally charged way in communication with our community or the wider networks.\n\nAs Alfred Hermida explains in his new book on social media sharing, “Tell Everyone”, humans like to talk about themselves to others – it is good for us and it helps build communities. As news becomes part of social media so it becomes part of that process.\n\nBut what about the journalist? What does all this emotionally driven sharing and liking lead to? In a sense this a familiar debate within the profession.\n\nThis is a clip from the US mini-series The Newsroom.\n\n“I don’t want to feel sorry for any of them, I want facts”\n\nSo how does this change the newsroom culture and especially that classic idea of objectivity?\n\nThis graphic shows how traditional mainstream journalists try to be objective about the news that they produce. Despite what most people think, journalists are human. They are often especially curious and aware of narratives that are interesting and engaging. They respond as humans. But to make the journalism they must objectify the process. This is partly because of the practical pressures on their work: deadlines, limited resources, the need to turn complex real events into formulaic, understandable, accessible, consumerable items of news media. Then after work they either go home to kick the cat or down the pub to chat over the days’ events and coverage. Mostly though they are on a kind of auto-pilot.\n\nBut with networked news where events are often being reported and discussed on social media – and their own journalism is subject to comment and sharing – they share this process with the public, live, as they are working. And as emotion becomes a more significant factor in that process for both the news-maker and the news-consumer or sharer, so, I would suggest, there will an interesting feed-back loop into the professional culture that may impact in its turn on how the news is produced in the future.\n\nI think that this is already happening. My former colleague Jon Snow has always been a passionate journalist – he famously teared up live on screen while covering the Haiti earthquake. But in this video – not broadcast on C4News TV but put up on their website – he made a strong political statement about the suffering in Gaza last year. But I thought it was interesting because while he was making a political point in general, it was couched in emotional terms – a plea to convert empathy into some kind of action – action that was partly about people using media to make a point. For many people he crossed a line – especially for a broadcaster that is subject to regulation that insists on a kind of objectivity.\n\nInterestingly, not all of his mainstream media rivals criticised him – Sky News’ editor thought he might even have been able to broadcast it, albeit with some signposting to signal that it was outside of normal coverage.\n\nI think it is interesting that Ryley is recognising a journalist’s right to sensitivity.\n\nBut do we want to undermine objectivity?\n\nThe value of objective journalism is the idea that journalism can attempt to give an account that is balanced, fact-based and that gives a fair summary not just of what has happened but the context around it without the distortion of the journalist’s own feelings.\n\nOf course, anyone who thinks about this for a few minutes realises that this can only be an aspiration. All journalists are human and have different factors that shape their worldview and their understanding of particular circumstances. It’s all relatively relative. By selecting a story for reporting you have made a choice. The facts that you omit as well as those you include are selective. Even the most emotionless narrative has subjectivity. Simply by putting two sides to an issue does not mean you have reported it accurately.\n\nYet we seem to be witnessing the potential death of that kind of objectivity – or the aspiration towards that unreachable ideal that has so conditioned much of what we think of as news reporting.\n\nI want to stress that there’s nothing new about the idea of emotion in news journalism. American journalism invented the idea of the ‘yellow press’. Sensational journalism that sought to stir your fear, wonder and excitement about what is happening in the world. Making a drama of a crisis has always been part of mass media. The theatre of news is as old as broadcast journalism. News as a spectacle has always been one of its dramatic forms. If news does not get your attention, if you do not find it interesting, amusing, frightening or uplifting than you are less likely to take notice.\n\nBut like so much in modern media – that has all become much faster, more complex and more unstable. The narrative is no longer in the control of the journalist and emotions now threaten to run riot.\n\nBut here’s one of the dangers – the filter bubble – the echo chamber – the danger that we end up only responding to emotional triggers that please us – that we only want to hear views that support our views and confirm our prejudices.\n\nThis network graph details the landscape of Twitter handles responding to the UNWRA school bombing.\n\nThe things people were saying were not necessarily untrue or unfactual but they were framed in very different ways – the emotional response was very bifurcated.\n\nThe following tag cloud represents co-occurence of hashtags on Insragram posts. The larger a tag, the more times it appeared. The tighter-connected two tags are, the more times they appeared together.\n\nThe point of this is not to show that people disagree about Gaza. We knew that. The problem is that social media algorithms combined with the emotional dynamic in sharing and interaction will tend to reinforce that divisiveness. These networks are programmed – just as humans seem to be programmed – to follow the flow of our prejudices – like tends to connect with like because we prefer that to communication that challenges.\n\nAs Data Scientist Gilad Lotan writes:\n\n“The better we get at modeling user preferences, the more accurately we construct recommendation engines that fully capture user attention. In a way, we are building personalized propaganda engines that feed users content which makes them feel good and throws away the uncomfortable bits.”\n\nWhat interests me – and I think I should admit it worries me too – is that this shift to self-affirmation seems to be a factor in the current drift towards a rampant relativism. Increasingly, this social media driven dialogue is more about affirming one’s own perspective rather than seeking new viewpoints or counter-arguments. Healthy liberal democracy and society depends on the idea of a diverse public sphere with agonistic dialogue between different viewpoints. Objectivity is important to that process because even where we disagree we need to have a structure based on evidence and reason as well as emotion. Yet, everywhere from the coverage of Ukraine to the contest for the Labour Party leadership we can see how social media is challenging that and replacing it with a series of ideological self-referential bubbles. This is paralleled in mainstream media with the growth in partisan press – either subsidised propaganda machines like RT or CCTV or the ‘views news’ of Fox News or the Guardian.\n\nI don’t blame social media or journalism for this. I think it is a product of much bigger social and political forces at work in our post-ideological age. In many ways it is to be welcomed if people resist received wisdom and imposed frameworks and have a choice of more divergent perspectives.\n\nBut as journalism reinvents itself I think that it is important that it looks at this powerful mix of emotion and relativism and asks how best an aspiration to objectivity might be fostered in this environment.\n\nIt certainly isn’t by insisting that the authorities know best – let alone the journalistic authorities.\n\nI also don’t want to panic. Funnily enough objectivity is making a comeback.\n\nLook at the boom in data journalism based on facts.\n\nLook at new visual narrative makers like Vice. Yes, they feature personable young reporters telling you what’s happening out there in an informal style. But by avoiding the usual formula they are getting out of the way and allow the public to see stories more directly.\n\nGo read Buzzfeed. It’s famous for its cats but look at their burgeoning news content. Yes, they use lots of pictures and often they are quite witty. But the actual reporting is remarkably straight.\n\nSo along with the emotion people want more facts and reliable narratives – this is not a contradiction.\n\nThis is what I call networked journalism. At its heart is the human factor because the audience is now part of the process. There is no going back. But if everything is subjective then nothing is false and nothing is true. Subjective journalism is fine as long as it is overt and if it is not always affirmative journalism. Journalism is supposed to challenge cognitive biases not reinforce them. It must also be self-critical and self-reflexive as well as being critical of others.\n\nFor me the key principle in this – for the citizen as well as the journalist- is transparency.\n\nTransparency is the new objectivity. And how that works is the subject for a whole new lecture.\n\nAnd what about the science?\n\nWe need to know much more about the role of emotion and the consequences:\n\nthe ontology of data,\n\nthe political economy of identity when privacy goes public\n\nthe sociology of influence when power is redistributed emotionally.\n\nAt the moment journalists don’t understand how the technology works in this context. We don’t know the detail of algorithms created by the digital intermediaries that drive search and sharing. Perhaps science – and not just computer science – can also help to build algorithms that encourage serendipity, that foster media literacy and even protect us from emotional harm? We need more evidence-based analysis of what Zizi Papcharissi calls ‘affective publics’. What motivates attention and agency related to media?\n\nAt the moment we have what Andrew Chadwick called a ‘hybrid media’ system blended between linear legacy journalism and the new socialised, networked news media. There is much more change to come. But the trend is clear: towards more mobile, personalised and emotionally-driven news media. And the challenge for the networked journalist is also clear: how best to sustain the ethical, social and economic value of journalism in this new emotionally networked environment.\n\n@CharlieBeckett",
  "latent_28492": "Research has shown that people who sleep 5 hours or less per day are bound to have shorter memories than their mates who get 8 hours of sleep. The dangers of engaging in poor sleeping habits as studies have proven, are heart disease, stroke, dementia, Type 2 diabetes, depression, etc.\n\nHowever, you should be more interested in quality sleep rather than the quantity of sleep you get. More studies have shown us that how you feel during your waking hours often depends on how well you have slept.\n\nThe way to become adept at this is through conditioning. You will routinely get your body and brain accustomed to sleep by creating good sleeping habits and the idyllic surrounding that is conducive for quality sleep.\n\nHere are four tips that will definitely help you to sleep better:\n\n1. Use Separate Beds If Your Partner Snores, the Space Is Small, or Your Lifestyle Differs\n\nAre you aware that lots of sleep distortions reported yearly are caused by spouses? This, if not taken care of might affect your physical and mental well-being, including your productivity at your workplace. Worse still, at an extreme it could even make you loathe your partner.\n\nHowever, you have the option of separating your bedroom (or bed, in the case of a large room) from your partner's in case of conflicting bedtime schedules or lifestyle choices. Better still you can look out for any snoring treatment. Otherwise it may rub off on one person's health.\n\nFor example, in a relationship where a partner is an early bird who likes to sleep on time while the other partner is nocturnal in nature and they use same bedroom, the latter's life would affect the former's sleep.\n\nIn the case of snoring, earmuffs or white noise machines should come handy. If the space on the bed is too small you might also want to consider getting a bigger bed as this will greatly enhance your ability to sleep.\n\nIf the space is too small spouses' body will overheat and not everybody likes being warm in bed. Also in that circumstance, chances that when you or your partner toss and turn, you'd hit each other are high which will eventually rob both of you of deep sleep.\n\nThis means that it may be necessary to get a bigger bed which doesn't stop spouses from remaining cozy in each other's arms when they want to.\n\nHowever, a new study has shown that 82 per cent of couples reported to have enjoyed their sleep actually shared a bed. So you might want to think twice before leaving your partner's bed. Medical practitioners have said snoring could be a result of some medical disorders. Perhaps, a doctor's diagnosis and your empathy is what your snoring partner needs. Analyze your situation and make the right decision.\n\n2. Establish A Regular Bedtime And Sleep Routine\n\nThe logic to this is that our body is trained to follow routines and day-by-day procedures. What you keep doing is what the body gets accustomed to.\n\nHence, routines such as having a warm bath or listening to some soulful music whenever you intend to sleep every night are keys. Also, have a specified time you sleep every day. Eat light and easily-digested food before bed. Ensure your bedroom is dark and quiet. You might also want to consider getting a sleeping mask and a pair of earmuffs.\n\nMore so, psychologists have prescribed wearing a particular pajamas before bedtime. Your brain gets used to this and know its sleep time whenever you're in your custom dress.\n\n3. Try Taking A Nap At Work\n\nYes, you read correctly. An accomplished scientist and author, Sara Mednick of the University of California has actually posited that if you \"want to get some sleep and boost job performance by 34 percent then you should try taking a 26-minute nap.\"\n\nEven while at work it should not be too difficult to find time for a 26-minute 'power' nap, especially when you consider the health benefits and productivity you'd have afterwards.\n\n4. Get Plenty Of Exercise, and Reduce Night-Time Activities\n\nEngage in 40-60 minutes of moderate exercise every day, if possible. Let your exercise be early in the day, not afternoon or evening. Many experts have suggested yoga to help relax the muscles and mind during bedtime.\n\nMassages are also good for those who can afford massage parlors or maids. Meanwhile, technology has made available, automatic massage machines which require no 3rd party help to use.\n\nWhen possible, schedule your most tedious tasks to hold early in the day and the less challenging activities later. This helps you unwind and relax at the end of your day in order to get a pleasant night sleep.",

Robert Byrd of West Virginia. Inouye was a senator for all but three of Hawaii's 53 years as a state and had served as its first House member before that.\n\nSenators of both parties took to the chamber floor Monday to mourn his death, and President Barack Obama described Inouye as \"a true American hero.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED 2011: Sen.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the Inouye family.\"\n\nVice President Joe Biden, who served alongside Inouye in the Senate, recalled his \"moral bravery\" in the body. \"He was one of the most honorable men I ever met in my life, and one of the best friends you could hope for. He was honest, and fiercely loyal, and I trusted him absolutely.\"\n\nFellow Hawaiian Daniel Akaka choked up as he said, \"It is very difficult for me to rise today with a heavy heart to bid aloha, aloha to my good friend, colleague and brother.\n\n\"Tomorrow will be the first day since Hawaii became a state in 1959 that Dan Inouye will not be representing us in Congress. Every child born in Hawaii will learn of Dan Inouye, a man who changed the islands forever.\"\n\nInouye enlisted in the U.S. Army shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In World War II, Inouye lost an arm charging machine gun nests in San Terenzo, Italy, earning him the Medal of Honor.\n\nHe was of Japanese heritage and served in an Army unit made up of Japanese-Americans. His battalion was the most decorated unit of the war. Meanwhile, stateside, many Japanese-Americans were held during the war by the government in internment camps based on their race.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Arizona, remembered his late colleague as a \"unique, brave legislator\" and as a fellow veteran who was injured in war.\n\nInouye's unit was in \"many of the most gruesome and difficult bloodlettings of the entire conflict,\" McCain said. \"In fierce combat, Dan Inouye was gravely wounded on the battlefield. He was brought home ... as we all know, (he) lost his arm.\"\n\nWhat happened after that battlefield injury would lead to a long-standing friendship: Inouye was hospitalized alongside the second lieutenant who would also become a U.S. senator, Bob Dole.\n\n\"Danny and I saw service in World War II where he lost an arm and where I had other difficulties,\" Dole said in a statement. \" When we left the hospital, we eventually became United States senators and he was always telling his friends that I talked him into it. I don't recall it, but if Danny said it was true, that was good enough for me.\"\n\nDole said his friend reached out to all, regardless of the party.\n\n\"Never once do I recall his being critical of another colleague -- Republican or Democrat,\" he said.\n\nInouye served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Commerce Committee, and was the first chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nAs head of the Appropriations Committee, he defended the practice of earmarking funds for pet projects and brought millions to his home state.\n\nHe gained national notoriety as a member of the Senate panel investigating the Watergate scandal in the 1970s.\n\nAt the time of his death, Inouye was president pro tempore of the Senate and had held that position since the death of West Virginia's Robert Byrd in 2010. In that position, Inouye was third in the line of succession to the U.S. presidency, behind Vice President Biden and House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nLate Monday, the Senate approved a resolution giving Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid the authority to swear in Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, now the chamber's most senior Democrat, as the new Senate president pro tempore.\n\nReid said in remembrance of Inouye, \"If there was ever a patriot, Dan Inouye was that patriot.\" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell described him as someone who \"rarely called attention to himself but who lived a remarkable American life filled with dignity and grace of the true hero that he was.\"\n\nInouye graduated from the University of Hawaii and the George Washington University School of Law.\n\nAsked recently how he would want to be remembered, the senator said: \"I represented the people of Hawaii and this nation honestly and to the best of my ability. I think I did OK,\" according to his office.\n\nHis last word was \"Aloha,\" it said.",

  "latent_28711": "Check out the updated Legacy Cube list.\n\nLegacy Cube events run from April 6, 10:00 a.m., until April 15, 10:00 a.m. Pacific (UTC -7)! Check out the full event details below.\n\nHello everyone! I’m beyond excited to be the designer of the Legacy Cube. With the help of Adam Prosak, our goal is to make changes to keep our Magic Online cubes fresh and exciting. For the most recent update, our plan was to a) remove cards that have not been performing well, b) remove cards that are generally disliked by players, and c) fix any color imbalances.\n\nFirst let’s talk about color imbalances. Red was the most-played and best-performing color in previous iterations of the Legacy Cube. To fix that, we cut some of red’s most powerful and unfair cards and tried to increase the amount of things that the color can do. While red is still popular, it is no longer the best-performing color. That title belongs to blue. In an attempt to evenly balance this cube, I wanted to remove the blue cards that were the most oppressive and the strongest in order to even things out a bit. Vedalken Shackles got the axe as it not only is the most-played blue card, it’s also hard to remove and completely shuts down certain strategies. This may be the most controversial cut from the cube, but overall I feel that it’s for the better.\n\nOne of the reasons blue is so strong is that all of its removal is in the form of cheap, efficient counters. Counterspell, Mana Leak, Condescend, Remand, Essence Scatter, and plenty of others contribute to this factor, and having access to such a high number of desirable two-mana counterspells definitely draws players into the color. It seems that every deck that plays blue has the same game-plan: counter everything in sight. We wanted blue to do a wider variety of things overall, so a few of these strong counters got cut in favor of cards that will help diversify blue.\n\nHistorically, the worst-performing color in the cube was black. The last cube design team did a great job of improving black by figuring out what black did best and playing that up. In the past there were many black themes that were tried but didn’t really work. Many of you may remember the failed experiment that was the Vampire theme. While I’m glad it was tried, I’m also glad that the cube design team quickly realized that it was not the way to go with black. The next theme that was tried was mono-black devotion, and that theme worked out tremendously. Playing mostly black mana symbols in your deck is something that black handles very well, and honestly black devotion is my favorite deck to draft in the cube. Casting and reanimating Gray Merchant of Asphodel is pretty fun and if you’ve never done that in the Legacy Cube, I highly recommend it!\n\nWith the great success of black came the major depreciation of green. Green has been the worst-performing color in the current incarnation of the Legacy Cube. In my experience, green has always been a very under-drafted color in not only the Legacy Cube, but in most other cubes I’ve seen. Green is always a huge challenge in cubes. It has stronger creatures than spells but in general spells are stronger and more desirable to play than creatures—so players tend to pick spells over creatures, and thus green is underplayed.\n\nSo how did I attempt to improve green? I looked at the strengths of green and tried to focus on those. Green’s strength lies in its mana ramp. Birds of Paradise, Llanowar Elves, Farseek, and Rampant Growth are some of the best mana-ramp spells in the game, and while green tends to be a slow color, having efficient mana ramp definitely levels the playing field.\n\nIn the Legacy Cube, other colors have gotten efficient mana ramp in the form of artifacts. Sometimes this mana ramp is even stronger than green's mana ramp! For example, Basalt Monolith allows you to ramp from three mana to six, and that is better than the acceleration you have access to in green. Chrome Mox and Mox Diamond accelerate you to two mana on turn one and three mana on turn two for free. This is an even better rate than Birds of Paradise and Llanowar Elves!\n\nIf I'm able to play Consecrated Sphinx on turn four with the help of Worn Powerstone or Basalt Monolith, I have very little incentive to draft green cards to begin with. Mana artifacts give me access to very similar mana acceleration and I get to play with more powerful cards.\n\nThe solution? Cut the colorless mana acceleration. This allows green to do what it does best without competing with the other colors.\n\nThe best example I have of this is a card that isn't even in the Legacy Cube, but it illustrates my point fantastically. Joraga Treespeaker is commonly referred to as \"the green Sol Ring,\"\" arguably the best mana artifact ever. If I were given a choice between Joraga Treespeaker and Sol Ring in a pack, I'd take the Sol Ring 100% of the time. Sol Ring actually makes Joraga Treespeaker look like a joke, yet ramping is one of green's biggest strengths! Furthermore, when I have a card as strong as Sol Ring in my card pool, I have very little incentive to draft green mana ramp when I have better mana ramp to begin with!\n\nIn the end, almost all of the mana rocks got the axe.\n\nThe final major change to the Legacy Cube was the removal of a theme that wasn't working. Black reanimator strategies are one of the more popular strategies in the cube, but they are really only successful when paired with blue. In the last update to the Legacy Cube, reanimator had a strong presence in green in the form of Wild Mongrel, Lotleth Troll, and Llanowar Mentor. Unfortunately, this strategy was among the least successful and least desirable to draft in the entire cube. Furthermore, these cards aren't really flexible; you have to play a graveyard strategy if you draft these cards.\n\nOne of the themes that has proven to be successful and in my opinion is a lot of fun is a sacrifice or Aristocrats-style deck. This theme is present in the cube, but not to such a point that it is obvious to players. I added cards to the cube to play the theme up. You'll see sacrifice effects such as High Market and Goblin Bombardment, as well as some fun sacrifice rewards such as Zulaport Cutthroat and Blood Artist. I look forward to seeing how this theme plays out.\n\nThat's all I have for today. I hope you enjoy the changes, and any feedback is welcome through my twitter account.

  "latent_28716": "Soon enough, the hungry strivers metamorphose into hot properties who, after a frenzied wallow in fame, face assorted truths, along with career-defining forks in the road. For Eazy, that includes bonding with the group’s manager, Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti, wearing a vanilla mop), an avuncular weasel who becomes every white hustler who has ever skimmed the top off black talent. For a while, the curious, underexplored relationship between Eazy and Heller threatens to overwhelm the movie, partly because Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Giamatti consistently out-act the rest of the performers. But then Ice Cube sniffs around, calls foul and exits the group, becoming a hit-making singularity whose arguments with his old cronies play out in his music and sometimes in real fist-to-jaw action.\n\nMuch of this is good, glib fun; sometimes it’s just glib, partly because Mr. Gray isn’t above recycling visual clichés, like the livin’-large bacchanals and their pinwheeling female buttocks. The partying is as bland as that in any all-purpose music video and feels more like another script signpost (and audience-pandering) than a serious attempt to get out what it means to be young, black, gifted, fabulously wealthy and much desired. Mr. Gray does far better when the story edges into heavier, more dappled realms, as in a terrific scene in which Heller is threatened by a thug who melts in and out of the night, and another jittery sequence in which the police harass Dre and the rest because, it’s suggested, they’re young black men. Crucially, the cop crew is more diverse than N.W.A.\n\nAs that police diversity implies, there is far more to the N.W.A. story — and how its rise signified for a people, the popular culture and the country at a particular Reagan-era flash point — than good times, bad times and throwing expletives at the law, as it did in a notorious song. “Straight Outta Compton” is being released 50 years after the Watts riots and in the midst of a national focus on black victims of police shootings. The movie acknowledges the larger agonizing picture, but mostly it celebrates a crew of Horatio Algers of another color who become crossover kings turned establishment titans. To that expedient end, contradictions bristle rather than explode in a movie that speaks to fighting the power (to borrow a message from another music legend) that it also embraces. It’s another story of ultimate outsiders turned ultimate insiders, which makes it as blissfully American as apple pie, low riders and gangster rap itself.\n\n“Straight Outta Compton” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

  "latent_28956": "VANCOUVER —Vladislav Namestnikov is one of the Lightning's most versatile forwards.\n\nThe natural center plays both wing positions. He fits from the top line to the fourth. He has been used on both special teams. Namestnikov, 24, however, is not known as a fighter.\n\n\"But he fights pretty well,\" wing Alex Killorn quipped.\n\nNamestnikov picked the right spot to scrap Wednesday. Teammates credit his first-period bout as the spark in a 6-3 win over the Flames.\n\nTampa Bay had lost seven of eight entering the game and trailed 1-0 three minutes in. This season, that's a situation in which it has typically crumbled. Instead, Namestnikov rumbled with center Sam Bennett in front of a riled-up Tampa Bay bench. The Lightning scored the next five goals.\n\n\"The way things are going for us, maybe it was a message from Vladdy that we're not going to get pushed around,\" center Brian Boyle said.\n\nSaid wing Jonathan Drouin: \"It got us going.\"\n\nBoyle scored two goals to give the Lightning the lead for good. Killorn added two, and defensemen Andrej Sustr and Braydon Coburn each picked up his first of the season. Goalie Ben Bishop came through, including making a huge save on Bennett in the third to preserve a two-goal lead.\n\nFor a team that has looked mentally fragile in recent weeks, the result was significant. It was just the fifth time in 19 games the Lightning won after allowing the first goal, and the first since Nov. 5.\n\n\"At the beginning of the year, they'd score a goal and we were not too worried,\" Killorn said. \"But as the season progressed, (in) a couple of those games, we couldn't come back. It seemed like once they scored a goal, we didn't have any energy. We were flat. … (Wednesday) to win the game and come back was huge.\"\n\nAfter the Namestnikov fight, the Lightning got back to its strengths. It skated. It was aggressive. It had a shoot-first mentality. It got traffic in front of goalie Chad Johnson, screens part of three of the six goals.\n\n\"We've got a funny team like that,\" coach Jon Cooper said. \"If we start getting engaged, we're on pucks, we're into it. When we're skating … especially with some of the guys on our team, we can be troublesome for other teams.\"\n\nTampa Bay had earned just three points in the past three weeks, slipping to seven points out of the second wild card spot in the Eastern Conference. The win pulled it to within three points of Boston for third in the Atlantic Division entering Thursday.\n\nIt won't get easier. Steven Stamkos (knee surgery) is gone until about mid March. Leading scorer Nikita Kucherov missed Wednesday's game with a lower-body injury, and his status was uncertain for tonight's game in Vancouver. Wing Ondrej Palat left in the second period Wednesday with an undisclosed injury, leading to the callup of Erik Condra from AHL Syracuse. Ryan Callahan (lower body) has missed the past seven games.\n\nSo Tampa Bay will need contributions from everybody — like an unlikely fight from Namestnikov, the fifth of his career.\n\n\"It was just in the moment,\" he said. \"I'm glad that it gave the team some momentum.\"\n\nWednesday's game\n\nLightning 2 2 2 6 Flames 1 0 2 3\n\nFirst—1, CGY, Brouwer 7 (Monahan, Brodie), 3:06 (pp). 2, TB, Boyle 5 (Hedman, Johnson), 10:04 (pp). 3, TB, Boyle 6 (Filppula, Hedman), 13:42.

  "latent_29041": "I was 7 years old when I first heard of Crown Heights.\n\nAt the time, growing up in Los Angeles, my entire world felt Jewish. There were Hollywood Jews who worked in the industry like my parents, Russian Jews down the block from our West Hollywood home and Hasidic Jews on Fairfax. Sure, there were non-Jews, but in LA, everyone felt kinda Jewish.\n\nThat changed in August of 1991.\n\nDriving with my mother in the car as the radio played, she suddenly pulled over, visibly upset. Someone on the radio had said something: Jews, she told me, were being attacked in Brooklyn. For the first time in my young life I suddenly felt vulnerable as a Jew. There were riots — and we were the targets.\n\nFor the past 10 years, I have lived on the corner of President and Utica. Where steel and concrete once collided, tragically killing Gavin Cato, and leading to the murder of Yankel Rosenbaum, violence, destruction and fear, there is little today that remains the same about the neighborhood. Communication between neighbors, if not perfect, is better; crime is down, and the neighborhood, suddenly hip, is on the rise.\n\nWhat hasn’t changed is the constant inability of the media to understand this neighborhood and the people who live here.\n\nIn 1991, The New York Times and other outlets framed the complex and nuanced web of identities in the neighborhood as reflective of national questions of race. Instead of seeing the conflict as one hinged on the intersectionality of religion, crime, government resources and an undercurrent of anti-Semitism, Crown Heights was simply black vs. white.\n\nDespite accounts on the ground to the contrary — both by journalists and in the Girgenti report, the state’s definitive fact-finding report on the riots — the need to fit the story into its preconceived parameters became paramount. Suddenly the members of the Jewish community, besieged by rioters, were somehow equal partners in the violence on the street.\n\nThe echoes of this failure to do journalistic justice reverberate to this day. This week, in covering the 25th anniversary of the riots, the New York Daily News reported, without any basis in reality, that “roving gangs of Jewish and black youth started attacking each other and random pedestrians” during riots — as if somehow cowering Jews along President Street had left their homes under a rain of bricks and bullets to walk out and do battle on Brooklyn’s streets.\n\nIn truth, though, the failure to understand Crown Heights, at least Jewish Crown Heights, goes far beyond the riots.\n\nToday Crown Heights has been designated as “ground zero for gentrification.” As young white people double-fisting Whole Foods bags and NPR totes have moved to the neighborhood, rapid development has followed in their path.\n\nWhere burnt-out tenements and bodegas once stood, there are now posh flats, artisanal taco stands and cold-brew coffee shops. With the changes have come rising rent prices and demographic upheaval. Suddenly a community of working- and middle-class families, both Jewish and black, find themselves no longer able to afford housing in the neighborhood they call home.\n\nThe displacement of the African-American and Caribbean-American communities of Crown Heights has been covered at length — in Times, The Wall Street Journal, on WNYC and beyond. Displacement is a horrible thing, and people of color facing institutional racism can be particularly vulnerable.\n\nThat said, the gentrification of Crown Heights is something that impacts the entirety of the neighborhood. Among my peers — Hasidic Millenials — the affordable housing crisis has become the single most discussed and most troubling issue. People are looking to East Flatbush and Brownsville if they even consider staying in Brooklyn all together. A friend told me, near tears, of his painful realization that, stuck in a tiny one-bedroom apartment, he would never be able to live in the neighborhood that his parents, grandparents and numerous cousins call home. It was simply impossible to find the funds to stay. He moved to Pittsburgh a few months ago.\n\nYet this displacement has been completely ignored in the media. Not once has the Jewish community been mentioned in the discussion. And why should they? The story has already been framed: Hipsters move in, black people are displaced — and the eternal Jew stands in the middle. Yes, there are Hasidic Jews, almost entirely not from Crown Heights, who are active in real-estate development. But even in their respective neighborhoods they make up only a tiny sliver of the community. Yet somehow Hasidic Jews of all types — teachers, scribes, plumbers, online merchants and small business owners of all backgrounds — have been relegated to only one role: the trope of the Hasidic landlord.\n\nHasidim are cast into the anti-Semitic stereotypes of old when it comes to Brooklyn. They are the alien force that preys upon the innocent, ever present but always foreign.\n\nThese issues are not new: One of the chief misconceptions among the black communities of Crown Heights was the belief that the Jewish community controlled all the resources and owned all the property — even though analyses of data then show conclusively that, by and large, the Jews of Crown Heights were no better off than their black and Caribbean neighbors.\n\nWhen Al Sharpton referred to the community of Crown Heights as diamond merchants, the dangerous implications of the slur were clear to all.\n\nToday, depicting the entire community as active in the displacement of others, and not as victims of the same displacement, is dangerous. We can only hope that this time around the narrative changes sooner.\n\nWe recently moved to a block where it seems we are the first Jewish family living there in many years. The first week we were there, a neighbor came to tell us about a block party they were organizing. They had purchased kosher food, so that we could take part as well. I thanked him.\n\n“Listen,” my neighbor told me. “Right now, with everything going on in the neighborhood, all the changes… If we don’t stick together, no one else will stick together for us.”\n\nMordechai Lightstone is a rabbi, a director of digital communications, and the creator of exceptional experiences for Jews in tech and digital media.

  "latent_29714": "Just 5 ingredients, a blender, and a few minutes is all it takes to create this most decadent, silky, rich Vegan Date Caramel Sauce, perfect for dipping or drizzling!\n\nI am still questioning whether this super simple recipe justifies it’s own whole post and video. But hey, we’re here, it’s rich and dreamy, let’s do this.\n\nI am a big fan of the classic date caramel. For dipping, for coating, for frosting–it’s awesome. But one thing it is not awesome for is drizzling. Frankly it has no drizzle game, it just plops. And unattractively I might add.\n\nI started experimenting in hopes of finding a more silky, less plopping prone date caramel sauce to use as part of another recipe, but after posting this photo on Instagram a drizzle-worthy caramel sauce recipe seemed to be in high demand. So I tweaked and tested multiple batches yesterday until I found an ingredient mix that had the exact consistency I was after. I should note this is not the same sauce as in that photo, that was a date-less nut butter situation. But I for one like this fruit-filled version much better!\n\nI didn’t even consider all that pesky stove-top candy thermometer business, so it had to be a no-cook blender recipe. A lot of no-cook caramel sauces are made up of a liquid sweetener + nut butter + coconut oil. For my liquid sweetener I chose coconut nectar because it is really sticky. Brown rice syrup would work too. Maple syrup is a bit thinner than you want for this recipe. I know it might seem weird to add a sweetener to already sweet dates, but that viscosity is essential for a smooth pour-able texture. The dates are the thickener here instead of nut butter, plus they add extra caramel flavor. The coconut oil I replaced with coconut milk. While still high fat, at least it’s not pure fat. You can try it with a lower fat plant milk, but it’s not going to have the same texture.\n\nBlend it all up with a little bit of sea salt and vanilla bean powder (because yum), and you have a silky sweet vegan date caramel sauce. This sauce is by no means the healthiest caramel sauce around, good old 2-ingredient date caramel claims that title. But it is quite a topping treat on ice cream, brownies, oatmeal, spoons, almost anything!\n\nSilky Sweet Vegan Date Caramel Sauce ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ 5 from 8 reviews Prep Time: Prep Time: 5 minutes\n\nTotal Time: Total Time: 5 minutes\n\nYield: Yield: 1 .5 cups Print Pin Ingredients 1 cup pitted Medjool dates\n\n1/2 cup coconut nectar or brown rice syrup\n\n1/2 cup full fat coconut milk\n\n1/4 tsp vanilla bean powder (or 1 tsp vanilla extract)\n\nPinch of salt Instructions Combine all the ingredients in a high speed blender.

  "latent_29964": "In most Hollywood horror franchises we know that the villains – take your Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, or your rakish Freddy Krueger – always come back. No matter what painful death or injury felled them in the previous romp, an endless string of potential victims means room for one more film. Make that 17 more.\n\nThe neoconservative war doctrine of aggressive military force and self-serving regime change did not die after the failed wars of Iraq and Afghanistan, which proponents pushed with an enthusiasm not equaled since the world tilted on its axis and Freddy met Jason in an epic hack-off. No, the neocons went nearly dormant (there is a Bram Stoker trope here, somewhere), reduced really, to sniping at Obama, but more or less biding their time until the next opportunity to manipulate global affairs in the Middle East.\n\nThat time, it seems, has come. We’re seeing subtle signs already this week as President Obama takes the country one step closer to air strikes against Bashar Assad’s military assets. We know one thing: neither the administration or military seem particularly interested in pursuing regime change or nation building (their “punitive strike” strategy of course is a topic for another post). However, with Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham as neocon spear points — push, push, pushing for military force, now! — neoconservative voices, old and new, are starting to hint that “to do it right,” we might be in Syria for a long time afterwards, helping the “new” government find its way.\n\nTake for instance, Elizabeth O’Bagy.\n\nNever heard of her? She is clearly a protégé of the Kagan Clan, representing Kimberly Kagan’s Institute for the Study of War. Kim Kagan, who is married to Fred Kagan (brother of Robert Kagan), is no doubt happy to put someone besides a Kagan to front her think tank, which frankly, is now aligned with the demise of Gens. David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal, who turned to her and Fred as “consultants” in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Over the last several years, she’s written “The Surge: A Military History,” and numerous magazine articles and op-eds as panegyrics to General Petraeus and “his generals” and their now-discredited COIN pop-doctrine.\n\nSo sending out the signal for another regime change must be done carefully and with none of the old baggage. O’Bagy has a Ph.D but this appears to be her first job. She says she has traveled extensively with the rebel groups in Syria to essentially prove that there are moderates out there who the U.S can work with. But her recent appearances on FOX and other venues come across as bullet-point briefings with very little color. The bottom line for O’Bagy: the rebel groups can be parsed. We need not worry about the “extremists,” she insists, they are are outnumbered by the “more moderate groups” who will welcome American assistance (echoes of the Iraqi National Congress?).\n\nAnd then for the capstone — “there needs to be more than just punitive measures” she charged on FOX Monday night. “These moderate forces .. could quickly be taken over by the ideology of these extremist groups,” if we don’t do more than just strike, she added. O’Bagy doesn’t say “regime change” is necessary, but she certainly suggests it.\n\nThis is fascinating because this is the second time, at least, that O’Bagy has been given over 5 minutes of coveted Special Report time on FOX to describe events in Syria, even though there is a city filled with more experienced foreign policy and military analysts and journalists outside [Note: Special Report gets about 1.9 million viewers each night]. She’s spreading the word at different think tank discussions in Washington, too, like here and here.\n\nWhile O’Bagy appears to be a gentle enough scout for what will no doubt turn into a full-blown message-control and lobbying campaign, there are more strident neoconservative foot soldiers in the ranks. Like Charles Krauthammer, who all but dared Obama to take out Assad on Special Report tonight. Like former George W speechwriter Michael Gerson, who in Tuesday’s Washington Post laid it all on the line:\n\nThe best-case scenario is probably this: a negotiated outcome in which Assad departs and other regime elements agree to form an interim government with the non-extremist members of the opposition. The new government would then need to engage in a multi-year power struggle (aided by the United States) with the jihadists. But this approach would require convincing the regime it can’t win militarily. Which would probably only happen after a Kosovo-style, Western air campaign.\n\nWow. If I close my eyes and listen to this read out loud and replace “Assad” with “Saddam,” I can almost make out the contours of our failed war in Iraq. If I close my eyes long enough I may see Freddy Krueger, which to tell you the truth is a less scary prospect. Sorry Freddy, maybe it’s time to find another day job after all.\n\nUPDATE: We cannot forget the notoriously neoconservative Washington Post editorial page, which on Tuesday warned that seeing “moderate forces prevail … can’t be achieved with one or two volleys of cruise missiles.” Here’s more:\n\nThe United States can’t dictate the outcome in Syria, and it would be foolish to send ground troops in an effort to do so. But by combining military measures with training, weapons supplies and diplomacy, it could exercise considerable influence. The military measures could include destroying forces involved in chemical weapons use and elements of the Syrian air force that have been used to target civilians, as well as helping to carve out a safe zone for rebels and the civilian populations they are seeking to protect. Such military action should be seen as one component of a policy that finally recognizes a U.S. interest in helping to shape Syria’s future.\n\nUPDATE II : The old gang, back together: The Weekly Standard publishes fatuous letter to the president offering assistance with Syria. Supposedly it includes signatories from “all over the ideological spectrum,” but that is a joke. Not when you are talking Bill Kristol, Elliot Abrams, Cliff May, Joe Lieberman, Robert Kagan, Martin Peretz, Karl Rove, Dan Senor …. you get the point. And not a true realist or anti-interventionist in sight. Not surprising, though, when you see the bottom line :",

In a interview on Skai TV Sunday, Mr. Kammenos said: “There is no way Cavusoglu can step onto a Greek island. If they want to they can see.

  "latent_30108": "Google’s new London office, scheduled to open in 2016, will have an open-air swimming pool, an indoor football pitch, a climbing wall and a roof garden from which to watch trains glide out of Kings Cross station towards Cambridge or Hogwarts. Googlers can cycle right into the building and to the cycle store room, which is equipped with showers and lockers. Somewhere in the interstices, there will also be desks to work on.\n\nINK/Allford Hall Monaghan Morris It’s rarely this lovely in London, but the view of St Pancras is spectacular any time of year.\n\nThe 1-million-sq-ft (93,000 sq m) office will sit on 2.4 acres (1 hectare) of land between Kings Cross and St Pancras stations. When the deal was announced in January, it was one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions in Britain. Reuters reports Google will spend £650 million ($1.05 billion) to buy and develop the site, with an eventual worth of £1 billion.\n\nRob Parrish/Allford Hall Monaghan Morris The 2.4 acre site sits between Kings Cross station (top), St Pancras Station (bottom) and Central Saint Martins art school (left).\n\nSo why is Google splashing the cash on this much space? The cynical answer is because it can: Google needs to do something with all those billions of dollars it has earned outside the US because it can’t bring them home without a whopper of a tax bill. The more philosophical answer is that the nature of work is changing—at least for those companies that can afford it.\n\nINK/Allford Hall Monaghan Morris It wouldn’t be a tech company’s office without cushions carelessly scattered about the place.\n\nConventional wisdom has it that technology has made offices leaner. Manual labour has been eliminated, paper files have been replaced by digital ones, and people can work remotely. Yet that is precisely why Google needs as much space as it does—the swimming pool, the football pitch and the free lunches are meant to entice workers into the office, to keep them there, to eliminate reasons for staying away. Tech companies take as much space as old economy firms—they just use it differently.\n\nINK/Allford Hall Monaghan Morris Googlers can cycle right into the building to the 20,000-sq-ft bike shed.\n\n“The idea is that the people who are in the building—not the tenant but the actual staff—need to be attracted to the building. They need to like the community of the building,” says Simon Allford of Allford Hall Monaghan Morris, the London architects building Google’s HQ.\n\nINK/Allford Hall Monaghan Morris Parts of the office, such as the promenade running through the building, will be open to the public.\n\nThat’s also why Google chose to put its building at Kings Cross. Central Saint Martins, an art school, is just over the canal. The Francis Crick Institute, a biomedical research center, is coming there in 2015. The British Library, home to one of the world’s largest collections of knowledge, is up the road. And Googlers with a decent pair of binoculars should be able to read tomorrow’s news being typed out at the Guardian’s offices on the other side of Kings Cross. When complete, the neighbourhood will have one of the highest concentrations of brilliant, creative people in London.\n\nINK/Allford Hall Monaghan Morris The canal is all that separates Google from 3,500 art students.\n\n“The point is if there’s 3,500 students, they [Googlers] might form a relationship with Central Saint Martins,” says Allford. ”You come to a city to meet people who aren’t like you, who are different and have different ways of seeing the world. The street life is incredibly important for why you live in a city. Taking that idea of life into the building and social space and what Google call positive friction. You want people to get to their desk and do work, you want them to get around, but you don’t want them to miss each other.”\n\nINK/Allford Hall Monaghan Morris The plan is to make an office so nice you never want to leave.\n\nIt is also plugged into larger networks. From Kings Cross, Googlers can get to Cambridge, home to Britain’s tech hardware sector and chipmakers such as ARM—or Microsoft Research, which is just outside Cambridge station—in 45 minutes. From St Pancras station, on the other side of Google’s HQ, they can take the Eurostar to Brussels (capital of the European Union and useful for lobbying eurocrats) or to Paris (Eurodisney!) in just two hours.\n\nINK/Allford Hall Monaghan Morris Googlers could conceivably commute to work from bucolic Cambridge—or Paris.\n\nThe building will remain inherently flexible, says Allford. “We’ve talked with Google about theatre, stage set, and props: The building is the theatre. It lasts 100 years. The stage set is the auditorium. It lasts 20 years and is a building within the building. The props are—the little meeting rooms, the furniture, all this, which ideally you could reconfigure overnight.” The idea is to have a dynamic, flexible space defined by the people who occupy it, not the other way around.\n\nAllford Hall Monaghan Morris The building stretches 330 metres (1,082 ft) from end to end—as long as the Shard is tall.\n\nIt can hold 4,500 employees, more than twice the total number of Googlers in London. The building will be ready in 2016. Until then, London-based Googlers will continue to be split between two offices at Victoria and one off Charing Cross road.",
  "latent_30166": "With dreams come nightmares… but where do nightmares come from? That’s the question writer, Nathan Edmondson, and artist, Konstantin Novosadov, set out to answer in the third installment of their Image Comics series, “The Dream Merchant”. Having reached the halfway point in the narrative, Edmondson slowly builds upon previously established plot developments, without offering anything significantly new to the story.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Nathan Edmondson\n\nART BY: Konstantin Novosadov\n\nPUBLISHER: Image Comics\n\nPRICE: $3.50\n\nRELEASE: July 24, 2013\n\nMore of a character piece than a plot-driven story, Issue #3 of “The Dream Merchant” focuses on Winslow’s reluctance to deal with his role in the war the ‘regulators’ are waging against humanity. As a weak protagonist, the last two installments had yet to prove his believability as a potential saviour of mankind, but Edmondson develops his character in a way that attempts to rectify that. Through vigorous training provided by the Merchant, to help Winslow control and conquer his dream-states, part 3 follows his journey towards enlightenment and acceptance. Finally, by the end of the issue, readers will get to see Winslow take initiative in the fight to save his world.\n\nIn comparison to the previous issues, Edmondson steers away from the heavily dense philosophical material, and delivers just enough buildup to prepare readers for the rising action of the imminent invasion. Issue #3 definitely has that ‘calm before the storm’ vibe going on, and the story will only pick up from here.\n\nThe artwork by Novosadov is as consistent and visually expressive as ever; particularly impressive where the story calls for eccentric depictions of sleep states and illustrations of the regulators. It’s still very easy to distinguish between dreams vs. reality on paper, as his colour scheme of pinks and blues effectively allows for differentiation. What’s most interesting about his art in issue #3, is that he confirms that the regulators are corporal beings, as demonstrated through a panel showcasing one of them being physically hit by a truck.\n\nWinslow, Anne, and the Merchant of Dreams will continue to gear up for the regulators’ invasion in the next issue, but their activities have caught the attention of local police and Homeland Security. It’s evident that Edmondson’s building up to something bigger than what readers previously anticipated. Hopefully, he delivers.\n\n3/5 Skulls\n\nReviewed by – ShadowJayd",
  "latent_30294": "Nine men and women from around Australia give voice to what it's really like to live as a Muslim. Aisha Novakovich, 32, community advocate, law student and mother of two tells of her journey to radicalism and back. Beau Donelly reports.\n\nAs a teenager, I had a laminated photo of Osama Bin Laden in my bedroom. A friend once saw the photo and demanded to know why I had it. I told her he was my hero and that I wanted to be one of his wives; that the media was manipulating his image because he was challenging US hegemony.\n\nFrom the age of 14, I wore the niqab - the full face veil - with gloves. My mother hated it and said I was becoming a fanatic. For me, it became a marker of difference in the face of discrimination. At university I was determined to learn the political systems in the West in order to subvert and challenge them from within. I believed we needed a caliphate. Eventually, I started to flirt with ways I could leave Australia to join the fight against foreign oppressors. Given different circumstances and times, I might have joined a terrorist organisation when I was younger.\n\n1984: As a one-year-old\n\nI have lived in Australia since I was six weeks old. My Yugoslav father was Greek Orthodox. My mother, an Indonesian, is Muslim. As the eldest of four children to migrant parents, I was keenly aware of my family’s constant state of poverty. But when my father died when I was a child, our poverty became desperate and entrenched. My mother was only 27 and she spoke very little English. We lived in Coober Pedy, an isolated mining town in South Australia.\n\n1986: Aisha at age three\n\nAs far as Muslim identities went, I had a loose affiliation to Islam and very little contact with the Muslim community. My mother wasn’t a conservative Muslim: she didn’t wear hijab or care if we ate halal food (although she was strict about us not eating pork). But after my father’s death, my uncle influenced her to implement a more “Islamic lifestyle”.\n\nOur names were changed to sound more “Muslim”. I was Nancy one day, Aisha the next. We started going to Sunday school at the local mosque and learned how to pray and read the Koran. I mixed with Muslim kids from different racial and cultural backgrounds who I found different to the kids at my public school. I had always thought of myself as an Aussie girl with Aussie friends at an Aussie school. The world I lived in was very much part of mainstream Australia and that’s where I felt a strong sense of belonging.\n\nI was bitterly disappointed when I was sent to an Islamic high school. The facilities were run down and staff were unprofessional. The kids were unwelcoming, unlike the non-Muslim students I had grown up with. I felt like I’d been catapulted into an environment that stifled creative expression and contained pockets of deep puritanical ideology.\n\n2001: Aisha in a go-kart\n\nI came across some strange ideas. Some kids would talk about the Iraqi Shi'a students as if they carried a contagious virus. I learned that there were better ways of wearing a hijab; a bigger scarf signified greater purity of soul. For a girl, marrying young was desirable and being an obedient wife and mother were markers of nobility. I wondered if my outgoing personality could fit into the idealised version of a docile and demure Muslim woman.\n\n2002: Aisha receiving the inaugural Minister’s Multicultural Ambassadors Youth Award\n\nIn university and as a young woman, I became an admirer of the work of ideologues and writers such as Sayyid Qutb, Hassan al-Banna and Abdullah Azzam. I even applauded Hizb ut-Tahrir, a group that Tony Abbott tried to ban for preaching extremist ideology. I became obnoxious in my religious judgement and was openly anti-democratic. I wanted to fight our foreign oppressors. My first husband physically abused me within six months of being married. I was pregnant at the time. The abuse continued for four years. My first marriage wore away my political ideologies. Domestic violence shattered my idealisation of the Muslim family model, where a protective husband with his obedient wife create a safe and loving family home for their children.\n\n2003: After giving birth\n\nMy husband eventually divorced me after getting permission from a sheikh to end the marriage on flimsy grounds. During those dark days, I considered leaving Islam. I questioned a religion that seemed to favour men. The arrival of my children was also a reality check. My dreams of going overseas to fight for justice seemed fanciful. The saving grace for me was my support network of family and friends who noticed when my behaviour changed. They loved me unconditionally and challenged me and my beliefs. I also benefited from the mentorship of several community leaders who helped break down the walls of isolation. The final thing that allowed me to rebuild my life was returning to university.\n\n2006: In Canberra, with former PM Bob Hawke\n\nI believe young Muslims in Australia are left uninspired and vulnerable to the prey of ISIS vultures. It is vital that we have frank conversations about why terrorist groups are so alluring. To acknowledge they are seductive is not to admit defeat; it opens up a new space where we can really start to really get it.\n\nAisha with her new husband, Andre De Barr, after their wedding in 2015.",

  "latent_30606": "If you grew up gay in an era before Netflix, you probably remember watching your first low-budget, straight-to-DVD (or straight-to-VHS!) LGBT romance movie. These movies had none of the critical fanfare of your Brokebacks or even the cult following that propelled the likes of But I’m a Cheerleader and Bound to the forefront of our queer entertainment-starved collective consciousness. You only stumbled on them because they were the only single-copy rental resting on the new release wall at your local Blockbuster Video. And if you were anything like me, you would devour them discreetly while the rest of the family was asleep.\n\nMany of these movies flew under the cineplex radar because of their subject matter, but more than anything else, their typically questionable quality never made them must-sees for anyone but young gay teens with no other options. Most of them aped the same tortured themes that mainstream movies were interested in exploring with gay characters. Namely: Coming out, the inner turmoil that comes from coming out, coming out and getting AIDS, or getting brutalized just after you’ve come out. But thankfully, a few more lighthearted films made it through without dwelling too seriously on any of these subjects. Movies like The Broken Hearts Club, Trick, and Mambo Italiano—while not good, exactly—stick out in my mind as romcoms that felt honest and gay and, most importantly, fun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the advent of crowdfunding and the increased accessibility of filmmaking technology, the barrier to entry to producing a movie has been lowered considerably. And thanks to streaming services like Netflix, seeing these movies outside of your local arthouse or LGBT film festival is finally a possibility. This is a doubled-edged sword for queer folk today. Accessibility is almost always a good thing, but without even the most basic obstacles to making a movie—like, a budget—what was once a pretty sparse playing field is now riddled with unwatchable softcore indie disasters.\n\nSurveying the selection of 58 movies categorized as LGBT Romances currently available to stream on Netflix, the options can seem overwhelming. You’ve probably already been burnt by one (or more) of these movies before and don’t feel like sifting through the muck to find a gem. That’s where I come in. Masochist that I am, I decided to watch all 58 movies and rank them below. My method is hardly scientific—wildly, I picked the movies I liked best. I’m not a critic, but if there’s one thing I know, it’s a good romance.\n\nWhile you'll find many of these rankings to be maddeningly arbitrary, the one concrete criterion in my little grading rubric is that the movie must depict something resembling a romance. If it doesn’t, that’s a little like forgetting to put your name on your test and automatically failing—although it's admittedly Netflix's fault for falling asleep at the genre categorization wheel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo let’s begin:\n\n58. Ambrosia (2012)\n\nNetflix Synopsis: A beautiful fashion designer’s excitement in landing a dream job is complicated when her lesbian boss takes more than a professional interest in her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are a handful of movies on this list that I’ve ranked low purely because they seem grossly miscategorized as romances. That’s true of Ambrosia, but it’s also just a truly bad movie. What begins as a prototypical “wife in bad marriage finds comfort in a local lesbian” story instead turns into a limp, poorly written, acted and shot “wife is continually harassed in a bathroom by a predatory lesbian” story. The whole thing reads more like a faith-based film rather than anything resembling a compelling lesbian romance.\n\n57. All Yours (2014)\n\nA tattooed Argentine cad. A pudgy baker. Their flirty cashier co-worker. As love triangles go, this one is a bit odd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis description doesn’t come right out and say this is a romcom, but leading with genre keywords like “love triangle,” “flirty,” and “pudgy” definitely oversells both the rom and com aspects of this movie. It’s a finely crafted piece of filmmaking, but takes such a bleak view of what it means to be gay (any man-on-man affection in this movie made me feel so desperately sad about being gay in general that I had to remind myself my life isn’t a dour European indie) that it’s hard to recommend All Yours for anything beyond the hard Argentinian dick on full display in the cold open.\n\n56. The Country Teacher (2008)\n\nAfter breaking off a relationship with another man, a teacher takes a job in a small Czech village, where he develops a close friendship with a widow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother curiously categorized “romance.” This movie does feature two graphic cow-birthing scenes and one instance of child rape, but there really isn’t much romance to be found. Listen, I know this is a highbrow movie I’m supposed to admire, and I fully admit I’m probably not enough of a cinephile to appreciate its technical prowess, but if you’re just looking to watch two dudes fall in love in the Czech countryside, this isn’t the film for you.\n\n55. Wasp (2015)\n\nOIiver and James take a romantic getaway to the south of France. But alluring Caroline upsets their tenuous bliss when she sets her sights on Oliver.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGod bless gay men and our propensity for getaways, a framing device for our movies that will live on forever. This one, though, is a dull little chamber piece that seems to think it has more interesting things to say about the nature of sexuality than it actually does. The actors do a serviceable job and the location is pretty enough to look at, but I’m a bit bored with movies whose premises could be completely unraveled by the presence of one character who accepts and understands the existence of bisexuality.\n\n54. Beginners (2011)\n\nWhen his elderly, dying father tells him he’s gay, a shy artist grapples with the news… and his own love life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA sort of joyless, capital-Q quirky film. Christopher Plummer does some fine work here as the titular beginner, but the movie never spends a whole lot of time exploring his inner life. That’s not to say this is a bad movie, but it sits where it does on this list because you came to this little corner of Netflix to see a gay romance—not to see Ewan McGregor fall in love with Melanie Laurent.\n\n53. Sand Dollars (2014)\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a beautiful seaside resort, their romance has flourished. But nothing lasts forever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the handful of movies I had to kick to the bottom of this list because of my own arbitrary grading scale, this one was the most difficult. I really liked this movie—it’s beautifully written and acted. But it’s not a romance. It’s the story of a desperate, manipulative Dominican woman trying to maintain her years-long seduction of a much older French woman. And thinking about some innocent gay in a mood to see a romance and watching this sad little tale instead bummed me out too much. So as much as I liked you, Sand Dollars, here you are at #54. At least you didn’t have any child molestation.\n\n52. Ragtag (2006)\n\nWhen childhood friends reunite, their bond has become even stronger—although the paths they’ve taken with their lives present a challenge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn’t completely without merit, but the Canadian public-access production values and some truly bonkers choices on the part of the director and writer make Ragtag tough to get through. There are definitely some glimmers of an interesting story here, but with all its handicaps, the success really rests in the hands of the two stars and their chemistry. They weren’t quite strong enough to carry this thing across the finish line.\n\n51. Happy End (2014)\n\nTwo women embark on a wild adventure to deliver the ashes of their friend to her final resting place, against the wishes of the family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’m happy to report that, having completed this project, “lesbian road trip” is now one of my all-time favorite genres of films, but this isn’t a shining example. When I first started watching the many LGBT romance movies of international origin of Netflix, I wondered if I would be able to differentiate good and bad acting through a language barrier, which, in retrospect, was a devastatingly idiotic thing to think. As it turns out, acting is just acting, and the acting in this movie is bad! Acting aside, there is a scene that so grossly misunderstands how marijuana edibles are made that I almost turned Happy End off right then and there.\n\n50. Is it Just Me? (2010)\n\nSuccessful writer Blaine is intimidated by the overt sexuality of guys. But all that changes when he meets the man of his dreams online—or does it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, it really doesn’t. There isn’t really much of a change in any of these characters from start to finish, which is particularly upsetting for Blaine (Nicholas Downs), who inadvertently catfishes a hot guy he meets in a chatroom (in 2010, imagine!). Blaine is a deeply unlikable character. He’s so judgmental and sanctimonious about his standards of sexual purity that watching this movie is a bit like spending 90 minutes chatting with one of countless gay men who truly believe they are the only gay person who isn’t “really into the scene.” Even if you do not hook up, nothing about the stale acting or dull plotting of this movie will appeal to you.\n\n49. Loving Annabelle (2006)\n\nAn esteemed young poetry teacher at a Catholic boarding school risks everything when she engages in a feverish affair with a female student.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a brisk 75 minutes, this film has the distinction of making its relatively short running time feel like an interminable PBS miniseries. Trapped in the curious place between glossy lesbian softcore and Lifetime Movie of the Week, Loving Annabelle has a hard time figuring out exactly what it wants to be or what it wants to say. There are a few moments of fun Hogwarts vibes at the boarding school that will make you wish Annabelle would spend more time with her weird, wide-eyed, socially deficient, possum-keeping roommate and less time trying to awkwardly seduce her teacher.\n\n48. The Seminarian (2006)\n\nCloseted Ryan questions his faith as he struggles with his relationship with a male student and his theological thesis on “The Divine Gift of Love.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI struggled with where to put this one on the list. On one hand, this movie suffers from the same acting, pacing, writing and visual issues that plague most of the worst entries on here. But on the other hand, the acting, pacing, writing and visuals are all so mesmerizingly bad that it’s almost fun to watch. Virtually none of the interactions in this movie play out like any human behavior I’ve ever seen (at one point the protagonist answers the door fully nude for no discernible reason), which gives the whole thing a The Room-like sheen to its badness.\n\n47. Bloomington (2010)\n\nEx-child actor Jackie goes to college and falls for an engaging female professor who has a reputation for breaking the hearts of other women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you loved the mommy issues-tinged forbidden romance of Loving Annabelle but hated the statutory rape, Bloomington might be for you. This film is much more competently made, but still, the stars feel like they were ripped from The Face on the Milk Carton or some similar made-for-TV dreck. They can’t quite muster up the Sapphic chemistry necessary to make any of this believable.\n\n46. Stud Life (2012)\n\nWedding photographers by day, black butch lesbian JJ and her white gay best friend Seb navigate London’s queer street life, looking for love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe description seems to provide an interesting premise to start with, and JJ (much more so than her “white gay best friend” Seb) is charismatic as hell. But nothing else about this movie seems to click. Stud Life has a lot to say about a scattershot collection of topics (race, butch/femme binaries, and sex work among them), but it never really gets around to completing a thought. To make matters even worse, a minor subplot involves JJ emerging as a budding YouTube personality, which may either horrify or delight you.\n\n45. Elena Undone (2010)\n\nOne is gay, the other straight. These women aren’t supposed to love each other, but fate keeps bringing them together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPat, inoffensive lesbian schlock. This movie, at least, has a somewhat serviceable romance at its center, and isn’t afraid to give us some nice, glossy lesbian sex scenes in the meantime. The whole thing has the comforting look and feel of a Shania Twain music video, but underserves the intrinsic conflict of its premise (Elena seems a little too eager to get “undone”). Watching a pastor’s wife fall for a lesbian agoraphobic is not without its charms, though. A “love guru” character used as a framing device is the most embarrassing thing about Elena Undone, but also brings about one of its most affecting, romantic scenes, between a former nun and the woman she fell in love with.\n\n44. A Perfect Ending (2012)\n\nAfter confessing an unusual secret, a repressed wife—prompted by her friends—decides to explore her sexuality with a high-priced call girl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpoiler alert, guys—the unusual secret is she can’t cum. There we have it. Thankfully, in the nearly 120 minutes of this film (making this almost unbelievably long, by the standards of the genre), she cums plenty. This movie has a skeevy Cinemax undertone that makes you feel like you’re watching it late at night at an eighth-grade sleepover, yet it also reaches for a bizarre overwrought quality that’s frequently hilarious. Case in point: A scene in which Morgan Fairchild plays a madame who weeps over a bunch of Barbie dolls she keeps as representations of her various prostitutes. It’s so bananas that you almost don’t believe it’s happening in the middle of a sexual awakening/cancer (oh, did I mention the repressed wife also has cancer?) movie.\n\n43. Eating Out: All You Can Eat (2009)\n\nA hopeful romantic is tired of life’s little appetizers. With a gal pal’s help, he’s going after a hunky dessert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Eating Out series has become emblematic of the kind of softcore, campy gay films that often end up on Netflix, and it’s no wonder why. These movies contain many of the same qualities that make the later entries on this list fun to watch, and a whole lot of the qualities that make the preceding movies so hard to watch. In this, the third installment (all but the second of the five Eating Out movies are currently available to stream), the protagonist from the first two films has just perished tragically in a car crash while giving road head, and is promptly replaced by his sex-negative cousin Casey. The choice to reboot the series with a new cast in the same universe is a bizarre one, as I’m not sure your average Eating Out fan is clamoring for more coherent continuity, but God bless them regardless. With an overly convoluted plot involving (another) instance of catfishing, various inexplicable Roman Holiday references, and the series’ trademark sexual orientation comedy of errors, this one is by far the least watchable of the five.\n\n42. Eating Out (2005)\n\nCaleb pretends to be gay to attract Gwen, who relates better to gay men than to straight ones. But the plan soon backfires in this comedy of errors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first feature-length film from writer/director Q. Allan Brocka (who wrote and/or directed five of the movies on this list) feels slightly more ambitious and much more spirited than its eventual sequels. That said, Brocka’s attempt to inject quirky banter (which today would probably conjure up comparisons to Diablo Cody) into the script—characters say “I gotta Jetta” and “Bye… Sexual!” as though normal humans are always looking for more and more complicated ways to say goodbye—ends up feeling clumsy and bizarre. But what Brocka does get is sex, and that shows in one of the best threeway phone sex scenes ever committed to film.\n\n41. Eating Out: The Open Weekend (2011)\n\nHis boyfriend’s craving a trip to the love buffet. A little eye candy is just the thing to inspire jealousy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe final entry in the five-film series limps to a conclusion in a mostly competent way. Apparently unable to find a new twist on the “someone is lying about their sexual orientation” throughline of the previous movies, the boys from the rebooted cast end up at a Palm Springs resort and grapple with the idea of monogamy (or, more accurately, non-monogamy). The movie gestures at saying some compelling things about the nature of gay relationships, but ultimately, at this stage in the series, you’re so uninvested in most of the carryovers from the previous movies, it’s hard to really care.\n\n40. Eating Out: Drama Camp (2011)\n\nShirtless guys, secret love triangles and a steamy Shakespeare play. They’re in for one hot summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the four Eating Out movies, this one has the least to say about anything, and it’s all the better for it. Rather than attempting to explore the nature of sexuality, promiscuity, or monogamy, it embraces the intrinsic absurdity of its premise and sends a bunch of adult gay men to drama camp. Why a bunch of adults would want to go to a drama camp is a question that’s never answered, but the plot barrels full steam ahead without waiting for you to ask in the first place. It’s the most fun outing of the series, with Drew Droege elevating every scene he’s in. Drama Camp even has a trans storyline that is surprisingly well handled.\n\n39. Room in Rome (2010)\n\nTwo women meet and experience sensual and emotional fulfillment during a steamy encounter in a hotel room where they share secrets as well as sex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know, it’s entirely possible that these two women are brilliant actors in their native tongues, but they were forced to speak English in this movie, and it’s a bit like watching a pornier version of Before Sunrise starring two Melania Trumps. If that sounds like your bag, then honestly God bless you and keep you.\n\n38. Love and Other Catastrophes (1996)\n\nTheir love lives are falling to pieces. That doesn’t leave them much time to worry about graduating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA queer, Australian spiritual cousin to Reality Bites, but with far less to say. The lesbian romance that supposedly makes it eligible for this section has a lot of promise, but is frequently pushed aside in favor of what feels like the A-plot for most of the movie—watching some lesbian try to gather the signatures required to switch her major, which is exactly as compelling to watch as it sounds.\n\n37. Of Girls and Horses (2014)\n\nTroubled teenager Alex is taken in by a gentle riding instructor and finds herself connecting with both the horses and an aristocratic new arrival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you ever wanted to watch a surly German teenager learn to take care of horses for 40 minutes, this movie is for you. While the movie is beautifully shot and well acted, the pacing is glacial and the coming-of-age romance between the two teens (thank God it’s between the teens) is a bit dull.\n\n36. The Perfect Wedding (2012)\n\nWhile spending Christmas with his parents, recovering alcoholic Paul falls for a handsome houseguest who’s pretending to be in love with Paul’s ex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn premise alone, this is the first movie that really scratches that romcom itch. Unfortunately, The Perfect Wedding turns out to be a head-spinning mess. With so many elements—Christmas, a wedding, a dad with Alzheimer's, a pretend relationship, and alcoholism—all mixed into one movie, you’d need the charisma of a dozen Kate Hudsons and one or two Matthew McConaugheys for any of it to seem cogent. (And, to be clear, there are exactly zero Kate Hudsons and zero Matthew McConaugheys in this movie.)\n\n35. Heterosexual Jill (2013)\n\nJill will do anything to prove that she’s no longer a lesbian, including forcing her ex-girlfriend to go on a date with her to show her disinterest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the script is almost impenetrably confusing—to the point that you’re constantly left with the impression that you must have missed a large chunk of the movie—the cast is so winning that they almost make up for it. While most of these movies star shiny, forgettable femmes, this movie’s greatest asset is its star, Michelle Ehlen, an authentically butch lesbian. Ehlen’s comedic timing and presence make me wish she had popped up in many more of these films.\n\n34. Longhorns (2011)\n\nCurious about the gay fantasies he’s been having, a Texas frat boy sets his sights on hooking up with an openly gay man on campus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA clichéd and inoffensive coming-out tale set on a Texas college campus in the early '80s. A sort of porn-with-a-plot but without the porn. What it does have in spades is plenty of under-the-covers mutual masturbation scenes, several flaccid dick shots, and a sweet (if slightly flat) romance at its heart.\n\n33. Tru Love (2013)\n\nUnwilling to trust, Tru passes through a series of lesbian affairs. Yet her outlook shifts when she meets a friend’s mother, and sparks begin to fly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, immediate points deducted for the title, that’s for sure. Not quite a love story, this movie nevertheless manages to take an interesting look at a woman who begins to come into her own late in life with the help of her daughter’s lesbian friend. The story itself has a few bizarre elements to keep you paying attention (you bet your ass Alice talks to the ghost of her dead husband), but the cast is either very bland or—in the case of Kate Trotter’s Alice—in another movie entirely.\n\n32. Bear City (2010)\n\nAs he comes to grips with his attraction to big, hairy men, cute cub Tyler struggles to figure out his place within the tight-knit bear community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s unfortunate that someone without a chiseled body couldn’t just casually appear in any movie aimed at gay men, but such is the world we’ve created for ourselves, I guess! Instead, they have to pop up in movies like this, which doesn’t just feature bears, but operates as a sort of primer for someone who’s never heard of such a thing. While I’m sure those (probably straight) people are out there, and maybe they’ll appreciate Bear City’s borderline educational tone, I would have preferred a movie that trusted its audience not be shocked at the sight of regular-looking dudes on their television screen. While the main romance here is a snoozefest, a promising side plot involving a long-term couple hitting a bumpy patch is probably what this movie should have been about in the first place.\n\n31. The Summer of Sangaile (2015)\n\nTwo teenage girls, one with a dream of becoming an aerobatic pilot, become infatuated with each other and begin a love affair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother beautifully shot, dour entry from Europe, this one starring two American Apparel models: one sad (with vertigo), the other quirky (with bows). While an altogether watchable film, The Summer of Sangaile suffers from a lack of structure and a fairly cavalier attitude towards self-harm. Feel like cutting yourself? Let your girlfriend cure you through the power of fashion!\n\n30. Bare (2015)\n\nA free-spirited female drifter leads melancholy Sarah away from small-town boredom toward an enticing world of drugs and danger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA drab, lesbian Garden State. The plot mechanics really hinge on the believability of the chemistry between Dianna Agron and Paz de la Huerta, and as you may have already guessed, they were on pretty different pages throughout. Everything is pretty: The setting is pretty, the script is pretty, Agron is pretty, but that’s about it.\n\n29. Boy Culture (2006)\n\nA male prostitute maintains a stoic approach to sex and love until a regular customer tempts him to reconsider by sharing a meaningful story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis movie feels very 2006, if that means anything to you at all. Q. Allan Brocka of the Eating Out series co-wrote this adaptation of the eponymous novel by Matthew Rettenmund, and working with an existing story seems to have given Brocka a helpful narrative structure that his Eating Out movies so sorely lacked. Derek Magyar as our central sanctimonious sex worker does his best Ian Somerhalder circa Rules of Attraction here, but the shtick wears pretty thin early on, and its ending is fairly contrived.\n\n28. All About E (2015)\n\nA successful DJ hits the road with some ill-gotten cash and ends up taking refuge with the girlfriend she thought she’d lost forever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA perfectly serviceable road trip movie, if a slightly boring one. The chemistry between the two female leads is mercifully believable and their love scenes seem authentic without feeling gratuitously pornographic, which comes as an honest-to-God blessing when you’ve already seen 17 lesbian romances clearly intended to be enjoyed by 13-year-old boys.\n\n27. I’ve Heard the Mermaids Singing (1987)\n\nIn an upstate art gallery, Polly hangs a piece of art she mistakenly credits to her boss, Gabrielle, but it was actually created by Gabrielle’s lover.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conflict as presented in this description doesn’t seem exactly like something you could build a movie around—and, in fact, it’s not. While you could argue that it certainly drives the plot (such as it is) of this film, the real reason to watch is Sheila McCarthy’s Polly, who is so left-of-center and fun to watch that she makes the shapelessness of the rest of the movie tolerable. You must stay all the way through the closing credits and treat yourself to a truly bonkers ending.\n\n26. Reform School Girl (1994)\n\nWhen juvenile delinquent Vince gets in trouble with the cops, loyal gal-pal Donna takes the fall and ends up in a training center for troubled ladies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat looks and sounds like a pretty lurid Cinemax softcore situation turns out to be a fun, quirky softcore situation. At the training center, Donna finds her place on the track and field team (?) coached by a former Olympian. That setup certainly could have made for a fine inspirational Disney sports film, were it not for the brief lesbian sex scene and shots of hairless vaginas interspersed throughout. Reform School Girl is mostly enjoyable and features a hilarious “where are they now” credit sequence (this movie is 100% fiction, so go figure) that posits happy endings for nearly everyone, including many of the movie’s villains.\n\n25. Anatomy of a Love Seen (2014)\n\nThey had chemistry on screen. They had chemistry off screen. But once it’s gone, it’s gone, wherever they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a movie pretty explicitly about sex—specifically, the filming of a softcore lesbian sex scene—there’s a surprising amount of life to Anatomy of a Love Seen. The two leads here seem almost too good for the genre, creating a tangible sense of history between these two women. Unfortunately, what begins as a quiet little slice-of-life movie goes off the rails a bit at the end, undoing the steady build of the first half.\n\n24. Another Gay Movie (2006)\n\nFour gay high schoolers all want to lose their virginity—and they’ll paint the town lavender to do so in this gay parody of the teen comedy genres.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt first glance, this movie may have a lot of cosmetic similarities to the Eating Out series, which was also vaguely referencing the “teen comedy genre.” But Another Gay Movie has a much better handle on satire, a more developed point of view, a stronger cast, and higher production values than its spiritual cousin. If you want to watch a campy gross-out gay comedy, this is the one I would suggest.\n\n23. Rent (2005)\n\nBased on Puccini’s opera “La Boheme,” this musical follows a group of scrappy bohemians who face true love, drug addiction and AIDS in New York City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHonestly, if you’re interested in the “Lesbian and Gay” section of Netflix and have not yet watched this movie, that feels like a deliberate choice on your part and I’m not sure I can say anything here that would change your mind. Controversially, I like this movie for what it is—even though the musical itself doesn’t really have much to say to contemporary audiences, or at least not as much as I thought it would when I was still making “La Vie Bohème” lyrics my AIM away message.\n\n22. Liz in September (2014)\n\nOne’s escaping a broken marriage. The other’s broken by illness. Theirs was an affair in paradise—and none too soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease ignore the 100% nonsense last sentence of that Netflix synopsis and watch a well-made lesbian love story that gives off that twinkly, Nicholas Sparks, beach-read sort of vibe that many people look for in their romances.\n\n21. The Skinny (2012)\n\nA year after college graduation, a pact reunites four gay men and a lesbian friend in New York City for a fateful Gay Pride weekend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy this point in our little countdown, you may have noticed just how oppressively white the casts of most of these movies seem. Trust me, it’s exhausting—which is why this movie is such a nice breath of fresh air. Unlike Bear City, this is not a movie explicitly about being black and gay. It’s just a movie that happens to feature an all-black cast, and lets these characters exist like real, human people of color are wont to do. But a pedestrian, at times preachy script bogs down an otherwise winning cast. While there are definitely weak links here, Jussie Smollett (Empire) and Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman (unREAL) are standouts.\n\n20. Boy Meets Girl (2014)\n\nRicky, a transgender barista in rural Kentucky, finds unexpected love with sweet Francesca while Ricky’s best pal Robby may feel more than friendship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, unlike many stories told about trans people, this movie is not overly and exclusively concerned with Ricky’s turmoil over being trans. Although it depicts transphobia, the movie somehow manages to maintain a rather light, romantic energy. It sometimes comes off as clunkily pedantic—and the ending is rather saccharine—but as a whole, this movie is a sweet, likable romance.\n\n19. Eisenstein in Guanajuato (2015)\n\nIn 1931, famed soviet director Sergei Eisenstein’s trip to make a film about Mexico’s history becomes a journey of personal and creative awakening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart documentary, part arthouse acid trip, this is definitely a movie that seems very impressed with itself. That’s not to say it’s not good. In between a few fascinating historical tidbits, there are plenty of moments that are as amusing as they are ultimately exhausting, the more Elmer Bäck stays on screen. The dude is pushing it with the quirk. Though its whizbang, directionless momentum may not appeal to everyone, I recommend at least one viewing, if for nothing else than the sight of a fully erect penis and one of the most graphic sex scenes of any movie I’ve ever seen.\n\n18. The Blue Hour (2015)\n\nA homosexual boy who’s being bullied at school and harried at home finds some solace in an affair with another local boy, but things take a dark turn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only horror/psychological thriller/romance hybrid of the bunch, this is one weird little movie. As happens with most movies trying to spin a lot of stylistic plates, one of those plates ends up crashing to the ground: In this case, that’s the romance, which feels undeveloped. What starts out as a sentimental coming-of-age flick makes good on its promise of a dark turn. You may want to give it a second watch to make sure you’ve put together all the pieces of this peculiar fever dream.\n\n17. Gerontophilia (2013)\n\nAfter a teenage boy realizes that he’s attracted to much older men, he begins working at a nursing home and finds romance with an elderly actor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA surprisingly subdued entry from visionary pervert Bruce LaBruce. He never treats this titillating subject matter as a comedic premise, but isn’t exactly able to make the movie into anything bigger than “Hey, this kid is into old people.” Gerontophilia ends up a fairly traditional romance, which isn’t wholly a bad thing.\n\n16. Reaching for the Moon (2013)\n\nWhen American poet Elizabeth Bishop makes an inspiring visit to Rio, she finds herself blossoming under the attention of an old friend’s lover.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn Oscar bait-y tale based on the life of Elizabeth Bishop, Reaching for the Moon is a perfectly serviceable movie that is more interested in rendering the drama of the latter years of Bishop’s tumultuous relationship with architect Lota de Macedo Soares without spending any time laying a solid foundation for the romance between them. If nothing else, this movie will send you into an internet k-hole researching both of these insanely impressive women.\n\n15. In the Grayscale (2015)\n\nAs an architect, he knows what he wants. But in love and desire he’s a man of two different worlds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA visual love letter to the city of Santiago, the capital of Chile, this is yet another “married gay not sure if he’s gay” story, which is a tired trope, and would constitute less of a conflict if bisexuality was acknowledged as a possibility in any of these movies. The gay relationship is sweet and convincing, but the beats here are familiar to anyone who’s ever seen a movie of this kind. All that aside, though, In the Grayscale does have the distinction of having one of the best, and to my eyes most realistic, gay sex scene of any movie on this list.\n\n14. August (2011)\n\nWhen Troy returns to Los Angeles after many years in Barcelona, he finds that his ex-boyfriend has begun dating a handsome South American immigrant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA pleasant little vehicle for Murray Bartlett, who was one of the more interesting presences on HBO’s Looking. Bartlett, magnetic though he is, was given the least to do on that show (his main personality trait seemed to be “restaurant”), but is ably showcased here by writer/director Eldar Rapaport. While not exactly a thrill ride, this movie perfectly captures the very recognizable horrors of never getting over your ex, wanting someone who’s in a relationship, and your boyfriend’s ex coming to town all in one movie, along with tackling the very real and scary epidemic of gay men dating men who look just like them.\n\n13. North Sea Texas (2011)\n\nA teen boy living in a small town on the Belgian coast finds his ordinary life take an unexpected turn when a handsome traveler blows through town.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile I understand how difficult summing movies up in just a few sentences must be for whomever Netflix employs to write these synopses, that description makes very little sense, as there are few unexpected turns in this story. A gorgeous, shorter version of Boyhood (but gay), this movie’s romance, such as it is, is less of a two-sided affair and more a reflection of the desperate kind of love you feel for someone as you’re coming of age and first becoming aware of your feelings.\n\n12. The Comedian (2012)\n\nA struggling comedian has an affair with a handsome artist but soon realizes his new relationship threatens his friendship with his female flatmate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking quite a few cues from Andrew Bujalski and Joe Swanberg, Israeli director Tom Shkolnik manages to create an engrossing little flick, which is (finally!) the only no-nonsense depiction of bisexuality on this list. If mumblecore is not your thing, this movie is not for you, but if you enjoy somewhat aimless kitchen sink realism as much as I do, you’ll find in The Comedian both the best meet cute on this list and a depiction of casual homophobia on a public bus that will stay with you for days.\n\n11. Pit Stop (2013)\n\nTwo working-class gay men in a small Texas town experience love and loss as they search for meaning and romance in their sometimes isolated lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPleasantly surprised to learn that “working class” in this case is not code for “closeted gay men tortured by their sexuality.” I mean, almost everyone in this movie is sad, to be sure, but they’re not sad because they’re gay, which is some real progress in this genre. The movie makes the curious choice of keeping its two protagonists separated for a lion's share of the movie (until they meet via a recognizably awkward, yet electric scene that perfectly captures what an internet hookup actually looks like), but somehow this understated, economical approach to storytelling makes the abrupt ending feel rich in possibility.\n\n10. Mosquita y Mari (2012)\n\nNeighbors but by no means friends, high schoolers Yolanda and Mari discover a bond and an attraction when they’re made study partners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA very straightforward and beautiful coming-of-age tale. The isolation that both of these girls feel is as palpable as the sense of relief they feel when they’re together. This isn’t some lurid, Lolita-via-Thirteen bullshit, either. This is a textured, unromantic look at life as a a teenager today, with all the anxiety and excitement that comes with it. Though the attraction that these girls have for one another (both platonic and otherwise) is never fully explained, it’s as recognizable as their desperate race to opposite ends of the couch when Yolanda’s parents arrive home.\n\n9. Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow (2013)\n\nA married man has a gay reawakening, while his sexy sister— conflicted about her impending marriage—dumps her wimpy fiancé at a grocery store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interesting flip from the traditional structure of these movies, the question here is not whether Weichung will come out, but will he come out again, as he’s already lived a pretty full gay life before he decided to settle down with a woman. Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow is scored like a lush Doris Day picture and the fantasies of the characters are delightfully rendered. It’s hard not to find this movie (and the endearing interactions between Wei Chung and his flight attendant suitor) anything but infectiously happy, even as it deftly handles the inherent drama in Weichung’s situation.\n\n8. That’s Not Us (2015)\n\nA late-summer weekend gathering at the beach turns into a relationship quasi-workshop for three couples whose unspoken tensions rise to the surface.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother improvisational slice-of-life Swansbergian drama, this one exploring the tensions between three couples (one gay, one lesbian and the other straight, how quaint!). While the style is definitely not for everyone—it can feel entirely without stakes, especially when you’re forced to spend time with the insufferable hetero couple—That’s Not Us is grounded in a way that allows you to really engage with and relate to the emotional struggles faced by each of these couples.\n\n7. Weekend (2011)\n\nThis frank drama centers on the relationship between two gay men who contemplate turning a passionate one-night stand into something more meaningful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA true spiritual successor to Linklater’s Before Sunrise series (this time, with no Melania pornbots in sight). While the intimacy of the movie apparently reads as boring to many a Netflix user, it’s that same invasive closeness that makes watching these two flawed men connect so sharp and captivating. While many straight reviewers very quickly fell over themselves to write that this movie was “more than just a gay romance,” this movie is very much intrinsically—impossibly—gay in ways that may not be recognizable to someone who hasn’t spent a weekend falling hopelessly in love with a person who views their sexuality wildly differently from how you view your own.\n\n6. Big Eden (2000)\n\nHenry Hart returns to Big Eden and winds up confronting his unrequited passion for his high school best friend and his feelings about being gay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis movie, more than any other on this list, nails the feel of an old-school, turn-of-the-millennium romcom. At first glance, you’d think this movie about a successful New York artist returning to his small town would see him battling homophobia, but Big Eden depicts a kind of post-everything utopia that could only exist in the ‘90s. Nearly everyone in this rural town is not only accepting of the gay triangle brewing in their midst, but actively invested in it. As in any classic romcom, the outcome of this love triangle is clear from the start, but each relationship is as exquisitely detailed as it would be in a Nora Ephron film.\n\n5. The Duke of Burgundy (2014)\n\nA butterfly expert and her housekeeper are in an intimate master-and-slave relationship but their elaborate romance is about to take a turn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHonestly, even if this movie were shit, it would hold a very special place in my heart for that description alone. Luckily, this movie was great—a fascinating look at the day-to-day life of a kinky couple with a finely tuned sense of humor (the phrase “human toilet” made me spit all over my computer), stunning visuals, and a romance with real depth. Writer/director Peter Strickland has such an amazing handle on repetition that several identical scenes feel fresh each time they return. Bonus: Not a single man appears in this movie, if you’re really looking for an escape from the patriarchy.\n\n4. Angels of Sex (2012)\n\nA surprising love triangle forms when Bruno sets his eyes on Rai—especially since Bruno thought he was already in love with his girlfriend, Carla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA fairly traditional story of coming out and sexual awakening spins out into something decidedly less predictable. Every time I thought I knew which way this movie would go, it would sidestep the clichéd beats of the genre. Angels of Sex managed to say something interesting about sexuality and non-monogamy without feeling like a message movie. While the thinking and feeling among us may view some of the twists and turns in this film as wildly unbelievable, the three leads manage to create such a vivid sense of intimacy that you can’t help but think all three really are going to make it.\n\n3. Boys (2014)\n\nWhile training for an important sporting event, teen athletes Sieger and Marc strike up a friendship that soon develops into something more passionate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike its protagonist, Boys is sweet and quiet. And though it’s tackling familiar ground, it’s picturesque and poignant in its depiction of a first love. The movie evokes the intoxication you feel from those few hours you spend in isolation with another human, so perfectly in sync without ever having to say a word, and the look of contentment in your eyes after a perfect first kiss.\n\n2. The Way He Looks (2014)\n\nA new classmate transforms the daily life of a blind teenager who longs for independence and disrupts his relationship with his best friend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith its clean YA plotting, keen observations, and measured pacing, this movie feels like a finely crafted John Green adaptation. Like much of Green’s best work, this movie perfectly captures what it’s like to be a high school student. I’m almost embarrassed to admit that I cried real, happy tears during this movie, and it’s one of the few on this list that I’m excited to watch again.\n\n1. Cloudburst (2011)\n\nA lesbian couple escapes from their nursing home and heads to Canada to get married. Along the way, they pick up a young male hitchhiker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs this a controversial choice for #1? I don’t think so. No other movie I watched in the many hours I spent watching gay romances was as finely crafted as this one—not to mention that it stars two amazing and criminally underused actresses (Brenda Fricker turns in a particularly brilliant performance) and features brilliant visuals. Not that I should have to sell you too hard on this movie—it’s fucking Olympia Dukakis and the pigeon lady from Home Alone 2 fleeing to Canada so they can marry and never be separated. If you’re looking for an honest-to-God romance in a sea of (mostly) shitty movies, this is the one you’ll want to land on first.\n\nJoel Kim Booster is a Brooklyn-based comedian and writer who has appeared on LOGO, MTV and Comedy Central. His writing credits include BILLY ON THE STREET and the Comedy Central pilot PROBLEMATIC. Joel's writing has appeared in The Toast, Decider, Paper, among others.

  "latent_30847": "NEW YORK (AP) - U.S. airlines collected $3.4 billion in bag fees last year. The 24 percent increase from 2009 shows how the airlines are increasingly reliant on charging for once-free services to make money.\n\nThe fees - typically $50 round-trip for the first piece of checked luggage - are one of the few bright spots for an industry that is caught between rising fuel costs and customers who expect rock-bottom airfares.\n\n\"If it weren't for the fees, the airlines would most likely be losing money,\" said Jim Corridore, airline analyst with Standard & Poor's.\n\nThat's little comfort to fliers who've felt nickel-and-dimed by the airlines over the past three years as fees have proliferated. And as they face higher airfares and packed planes for travel this summer.\n\n\"I feel like I am constantly being hit by little things by the airlines,\" said Lauren DiMarco, a stay-at-home mother from Wenham, Mass. \"We're already paying so much money.\"\n\nDelta generated the most revenue from bag fees - $952 million - followed by the combined United and Continental at nearly $655 million. American collected $580 million and US Airways $513 million.\n\nAirlines aggressively raised ticket prices early in the year. But those increases couldn't keep up with the price of jet fuel, now 37 percent costlier than last year. Some more recent attempts at fare increases have failed because passengers have shown resistance to higher fares.\n\nSo instead, the airlines focus on fees.\n\n\"Unfortunately, for the airlines when they try to roll $50 into the ticket prices, people stop buying tickets,\" said Rick Seaney CEO of FareCompare.com.\n\n(AP) Christian Noriega of Hayward Calif., takes his checked bags to security drop off at the...\n\nFull Image\n\nEarlier this month, Delta and United raised fees to check a second bag to Europe. Delta also added a fee for second bags checked to Latin America and ended its $2 discount for paying fees in advance online.\n\nAmerican Airlines introduced fees for the first checked bag in 2008 as the price of oil skyrocketed. The other airlines, except JetBlue and Southwest, have since followed and progressively increased those charges.\n\nMany fliers are still unaware of the fees or understand how much they have to pay until they arrive at the airport ticket counter.\n\n\"They find out very quickly when they are asked to pull out their credit card,\" Seaney said.\n\nThe airlines aren't alone in charging fees that irk customers. For instance, banks charge customers to use out-of-network ATMs and levy fees for insufficient balances. But there is something especially irritating about paying a fee just before you board a plane for your long-awaited vacation. For something that used to be free.\n\n(AP) Bags are seen on a luggage carousel in the Philadelphia International Airport Monday, June 13,...\n\nFull Image\n\nBuoyed by the success with bag fees, the airlines are charging for all sorts of extras.\n\nThey are now selling passengers the option to board early, get more leg room and to earn extra frequent flier miles. There are also fees for oversized bags, changing tickets, making a reservation over the phone and - on some airlines - reserving a seat in advance.\n\nFees for changing reservations or placing them via phone alone generated $2.3 billion for the airlines in 2010, down 3 percent from the year before. The Department of Transportation expects to release more information about fees at a later date.\n\nFor families looking to book a vacation, the fees can add up. That $98 round-trip fare on a discount airline like Spirit isn't such a deal when you tack on $45 each way for a carry-on plus $20 to get an assigned seat and $3 for a bottle of water.\n\n\"It makes it very difficult for comparison shopping\" said Anne Banas, executive editor of travel advice site SmarterTravel.com.\n\nNew rules from the Department of Transportation will require airlines, starting Aug. 23, to \"prominently disclose all potential fees\" on their website prior to a ticket purchase. In the meantime, fliers just need to do their research before heading to the airport.\n\nHenry Harteveldt, an airline analyst with Forrester Research, said airlines have done a poor job of explaining the fees to customers. Despite the bad publicity, if given the chance to do it all over again, Harteveldt said the airlines certainly would. He expects more charges in the future. A checked-bag fee based on distance flown is one possibility. Or fees could be cheaper if a ticket is purchased months in advance but much more expensive if paid on the day of travel.\n\n---\n\nScott Mayerowitz can be reached at http://twitter.com/GlobeTrotScott",

  "latent_31246": "The recent Census data highlights a stark difference between the stock market and what families are facing across the United States. Households are struggling to keep ahead while the standard of living slowly erodes with the juggernaut that is the banking tide. There will be repercussions for what the Fed has done in terms of bailing out the banks. One longer term problem is the decline in household incomes. Adjusting for inflation, American families are making what they did in 1989. How long ago was this? The most popular shows on TV were The Cosby Show and Roseanne. In other words, this was a generation ago. The standard of living continues to decline for many but for others the bailouts are working out magnificently like rubbing on a central bank genie lamp. The Fed is going for broke here but only a small portion of our population is really coming out ahead.\n\nBack to the Future\n\nWhile the market went bananas on the Fed’s non-taper announcement, household incomes continued on down a very familiar and gloomy path:\n\nThis is not a positive trend if the chart above were not so apparent. Contrary to the stock market and the booming real estate market being driven by investors, household incomes continue to fall. Since the recession hit, many organizations have boosted their bottom lines by cutting wages and benefits.\n\nOne of the dramatic pieces of data recently released is the amount of income going to the top 10 percent of income earners:\n\nSource: vMother Jones\n\nBack in 1928, the top 10 percent of income earners took in 49.3 percent of all incomes. Of course a little thing known as the Great Depression rampaged through the nation only a year later. Today this income inequality is even more evident than it was nearly 100 years ago. The problem with this is that most Americans are trying to get by on the crumbs of what is falling from the uber-wealthy. For example, over 47 million Americans are getting by on food stamps. This is an incredibly high number of our population (around 1 out of 6 people in a time when the stock market is at an all-time high). Even the CEO of Panera Bread is trying to live on a food stamp budget:\n\n“(USA Today) Panera Bread CEO Ron Shaich is very hungry. “I can’t stop thinking about food,” he wrote on his LinkedIn blog yesterday. That’s because he was on day 4 of a week-long challenge to eat on just $4.50 per day. He’s doing it to raise awareness of how people on food stamps live: That’s how much a person on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program receives, Shaich explains.”\n\nOne of the problems with the mythology of the stock market is that somehow, a high stock market will reflect a booming economy. Today with the casino-like transformation of banking, you can have banks making billion dollar bets on people failing and this will turn a healthy profit. You have trillions of dollars in derivatives being traded in black boxes. None of this of course translates to a real world benefit and each piece of income data seems to reflect that.\n\nWhere the gains are flowing\n\nMany people are one paycheck away from being broke. Millions are already broke. The median amount saved for retirement by those 25 to 34 is zero dollars. Actually, they are in a more dire position since many carry a negative net worth with tens of thousands of dollars of student debt.\n\nMost of the gains have flowed to a small portion of our population:\n\nWhile most are scratching to get by, the top 5 percent have done spectacularly since 1970. There will no doubt be income inequality in any market based system but these kinds of gains are unprecedented. Especially when you consider that banks are being bailed out for essentially causing the first financial crisis! Where else can you implode the economy, get away with legalized bank robbery, and make away with generous bonuses? This can only occur in a system where most of Congress is in the millionaire ranks and does the bidding for these interests.\n\nPeople seem to be going broke and as long as the next shiny device is working, all is well. Well not all is well on the income front as many families continue to slowly go broke.\n\nIf you enjoyed this post click here to subscribe to a complete feed and stay up to date with today’s challenging market!",

Donald Trump Jr., not surprisingly, did not.\n\nThe president's eldest son, whose Twitter feed can at times be as inflammatory as his father's, was a one-man rapid-response team as the fired FBI director testified before a Senate panel Thursday. He delivered denunciations with the same force that made him an effective, if controversial, campaign surrogate and could signal his own political ambitions.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. tweeted more than 80 times Thursday, defending his father and attacking Comey. Trump Jr.'s Twitter barrage was all the more striking when compared to his father's silence, which the president broke with a Friday morning tweet accusing Comey of lying under oath.\n\nTrump Jr. declined to comment Friday about his tweets, leaving unanswered questions as to whether they were urged by the White House , which outsourced its Comey response to the Republican National Committee and the president's personal lawyer.\n\nTrump Jr. has certainly been willing to go on the attack for his father before.\n\nHe crisscrossed the United States during last year's election, doing hundreds of interviews on Fox News and local conservative outlets. He attacked \"Crooked Hillary,\" his father's derogatory nickname for opponent Hillary Clinton , and delivered a well-received speech at the Republican National Convention.\n\nThat moment sparked speculation about his political future. But while Trump Jr. told The Associated Press this spring that he would not, as had been rumored, be a candidate for governor of New York, he left the door open for a political run down the road.\n\n\"Maybe someday,\" Trump said then. \"It's not something I'm doing now. But you never know, it's fascinating stuff.\"\n\nHe's done a number of Republican campaign events since then, including fundraisers in Texas and Indiana and campaigning for a congressional candidate in Montana. But Trump Jr., who along with his brother Eric is running their father's former company, has said he does not discuss the details of politics or their business with the president.\n\nHe outpaced the national Republican Party with his Twitter defense Thursday. In particular, he seized on Comey's assertion that he interpreted the president's statement that he \"hoped\" the FBI would drop its probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn as an instruction.\n\n\"Knowing my father for 39 years when he 'orders or tells' you to do something there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means,\" Trump Jr. wrote.\n\nHe also pointed to Comey's revelation that he had asked a friend to pass along to the press memos he had written documenting his interactions with Trump.\n\n\"Did I miss something or did Comey just say he asked a friend to leak information to the press?\" asked Trump Jr. \"Is this a joke?\"\n\nIt was not the first time his tweets have drawn attention.\n\nDuring the final months of the campaign, he posted a tweet featuring a bowl of Skittles with a warning: \"If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you, would you take a handful?\" The tweet went on: \"That's our Syrian refugee problem.\"\n\nThe photo, a popular image on the extreme right, quickly drew condemnation and was denounced by the candy company.\n\nA few days later, Trump Jr. linked to a news article posted on the conservative news site Breitbart that suggested Muslim men are a menace to Western women and posted a doctored image of himself, his father and several prominent Trump allies next to Pepe the Frog, a cartoon character whose image has been used by white supremacists.\n\nThis week, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump announced that their company is launching a new hotel chain inspired by their travels with their father's campaign. The Trump Organization is calling the new mid-market chain \"American Idea\" and said it will start with three hotels in Mississippi.\n\n———\n\nFollow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire",

  "latent_31894": "To be all-American these days is a luxury proposition. A pair of domestic-made 501 Levi's? Those cost a cool 178 bucks. In cowboy terms, that's a boondoggle.\n\nMike Catherwood, 33, admits as much. The co-host on the radio advice show \"Loveline\" has been trying to buy only American-made products as part of a year-long experiment chronicled on his Domestic Journey blog.\n\n\"It’s definitely more expensive [to buy American-made products],\" Catherwood said, speaking from his Cadillac while stuck in traffic on the way to the airport in Los Angeles. Since he started the experiment last January, his aim has been to draw more attention to American-made goodness.\n\nBut instead his experiment underscores the new truth about American-made products: The only people who can afford to buy them are the richest ones. \"I am capable of it,\" he acknowledged, \"but I don’t think it’s feasible for everyone to do this.\"\n\nDuring an election year, buying all-American takes on new significance as each candidate tries to peg the other as less patriotic using the cars they drive, the foods they eat and their positions on outsourcing.\n\nBut for all the noise about which candidate is the biggest American consumer, another message gets lost: Most Americans can only afford to buy imported goods. The average American household had a median income of barely $50,000 in 2011, according to the latest Census figures released last week. That's just enough to shop at stores like Walmart and Old Navy, emporiums of cheap imported goods.\n\nTake the classic \"Born in the USA\" outfit: blue jeans, white T-shirt, work boots. The three items, all USA-made, cost $421: domestic-made Levi's 501s ($178), American Apparel white T-shirt ($18) and classic Red Wing work boots ($225). The same outfit with imported goods is far cheaper: Brahma-brand work boots from Walmart ($33), a white Hanes T-shirt ($6) and Gap classic blue jeans ($60) add up to cost less than $100.\n\n\"People are fearful that trade is harmful and they only see that its costing us jobs,\" said Jason Taylor, an economic historian at Central Michigan University. \"But these lower prices keep the cost of living down for every American, but it's especially relevant for the lower and middle-class.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Made in USA label has undergone a different kind of evolution. If it has traditionally been a symbol of Main Street pride, increasingly it's being used as a chic status symbol for upscale retailers like J.Crew and Gilt Groupe, which have created special marketing around American-made goods, the New York Times reported.\n\nAdd to that, dozens of boutique manufacturers and regional designers who use more specific labeling, like \"Made in Brooklyn\" to create additional caché. These products might feel good, like buying organic lettuce from the green market, but they are niche products. For small-scale manufacturers of clothing, furniture and food, American-made labels have quaint appeal on par with the food industry's subculture of locavorism.\n\n\"You can get [economic] utility from where [goods] are coming from,\" said Taylor. \"You can get a warm glow from buying local produce and you believe you are helping a local farmer. It's almost like a new charity.\"\n\nFor a product to qualify for the Made in USA label, all or virtually all of the product has to be made in the United States, according to the Federal Trade Commission. However with globalized trade, the distinction can get murky. American cotton might be used in shirts made overseas; Japanese cars are assembled in the United States.\n\nCatherwood, who doles out relationship advice on the radio, said that some things are impossible to buy like electronics or even gag gifts for a friend's bachelorette party like sex toys. (\"That market needs a good American company to make domestic goods!\")\n\nHe had not investigated American-made condoms. And, as it turns out, the last American condom manufacturer closed down in 2009 after tough price competition from Chinese.\n\nAs the radio host reaches the final few months of his experiment, Catherwood said he will continue to focus on buying American goods in the future but has gotten more comfortable with the unavoidable grey zone of sort-of American, where some parts might come from other countries.",

  "latent_32021": "Unresponsiveness of an application’s user interface is an issue every computer user has to deal with regularly. It may happen with system tools, with third party software or, sometimes, with your own applications.\n\nThere are two main reasons for such behavior. First is a programming error - when an infinite loop or dead lock is introduced because of developer’s mistake. Well known software development practices, such as Test Driven Development and code reviews help to eliminate these type of errors.\n\nSecond common reason of UI unresponsiveness is using the UI thread for performing long operations. For example, the following code demonstrates image downloading in button click handler:\n\nOn developers’ PC or event in test environment, this method may work as expected – quickly downloading and displaying image. However, when deployed to the real customers, the ButtonClick method may block the UI for seconds to download the image using a slow or limited Internet connection.\n\nAn improved version of ButtonClick may use tasks and task continuations to offload potentially long operations off the main thread. But it can also introduce another type of problem. Now the developer needs to think about synchronization with the main thread and in real-world application, when downloaded data may trigger other network requests, the method will require a cascade of tasks and continuations, making code hard to read.\n\nC# 5: async and await\n\nAsync and await keywords in C# are intended to help with offloading long IO operations off the UI thread. This next example demonstrates the same ButtonClick method but now it uses the new async model:\n\nThe changes are pretty small but now the download operation is executed asynchronously, without blocking UI. Even better, it is implemented without sacrificing code readability and can be extended by adding more async calls using the same linear style.\n\nThe async keyword tells the compiler that the new async functionality will be used in the method. I will talk a bit about implementation details in my next post, but for now, it is enough to understand that compiler transforms async methods in some sort of state machine.\n\nThe await keyword ensures that nothing happens before the called asynchronous method is finished. Both keywords - async and await - always work together. await without async is not allowed.\n\nThe new async model is not limited to .NET framework functions. Developers can create their own async methods for use in application or include in reusable libraries.\n\nThe method GetStringAsync above demonstrates another part of the compiler’s magic: the string result is seamlessly wrapped in the task to allow function awaiting. The result is unwrapped and assigned to the local variable by using await.\n\nWindows 8 and async\n\nWhile the use of the async and await for WinForms, WPF, and console applications is optional, Windows 8 Runtime APIs (WinRT) is fully asynchronous. All operations that potentially may work longer than 50 milliseconds are implemented as async functions. It includes networking, file system access, sensor APIs, and other IO-bound operations. It is almost impossible to create any functional Windows 8 application without using one or another async call and it is very important to understand how the new async model works and how to use it properly.\n\nGetting started with async\n\nIf you are a Windows 8 developer, there is a great chance you are already encountered the async functionality, but desktop developers may not be aware of how to apply it. .NET 4.5 introduced multiple new methods designed to use async and await. You can recognize them by the async suffix in the name and return type of Task or Task<T>. For example WebClient provides DownloadDataTaskAsync() method in addition to DownloadData().\n\nIf your applications are not yet migrated to.NET 4.5, you still can use the async functionality with help of Async for .NET 4 NuGet package that brings some of async functionality to the previous version of the framework.",
  "latent_32343": "10 years ago this month, to great fanfare, Seattle’s modern streetcar line opened, a 1.3-mile route between Westlake and South Lake Union.\n\nThough it seems insignificant now, cast your mind back to 2007. The Seattle Monorail Project died just two years earlier, after costing the city $125M. A month before the streetcar opening, the Roads and Transit measure to expand light rail had just been defeated. Many people were openly questioning whether rail-based transit had a future in Seattle (Not coincidentally, 2007 is the year STB was founded). Thousands of people crowded into Westlake square to see our shiny new toy. I was working in the neighborhood at the time and recall the insane crowds on opening day.\n\nThe Seattle Streetcar system has had its ups and downs over the years. 10 years seems like a good time to look back at the system, and forward as the Center City Connector moves forward.\n\nAfter ripping up the last of the city’s streetcars in the 1941, Seattle’s modern streetcar system kicked off with the South Lake Union line (setting aside the historic waterfront line). Half the funding was provided by local billionaire Paul Allen, who waned the line as an amenity to kickstart development in what was then the sleepy warehouse district known as South Lake Union.\n\nSince then, mayors and Council members have had varying degrees of enthusiasm for streetcars. The streetcar system has taken on a totemic quality that made it about more than just a transit mode choice: if you were for it, it means you were for real estate development and “placemaking.” To be against it was to be for spending money on More Important Things. As with many things in this town, it became a question of What Do We Want to Be When We Grow Up?\n\nSLU or Bust\n\nStreetcar fever began in 2003 under the Nickels administration, and picked up steam under Mayor McGinn. The $45M SLU line would spur development, or so the theory went, and Paul Allen’s Vulcan Real Estate would pick up half the tab in the form of a special local improvement district (LID) imposed on (mostly) Vulcan-owned properties along the route.\n\nThe 1.3-mile mixed-traffic line featured 15-minute headways and I recall (though can’t find the source) a local writer quip that it had a cost per mile more expensive than jet travel.\n\nIn 2008, a year after the line opened, we were writing about how to fix it. It ultimately got better with exclusive ROW in 2015, although increased service on the 40 and C buses made people less inclined to use the streetcar when buses were readily available and just as fast.\n\nSound Transit and First Hill\n\nAt the same time, on almost a completely separate path, Seattle had to figure out what to do with $150M in mitigation money that Sound Transit was providing in exchange for not building a First Hill station. The First Hill Streetcar was the result.\n\nVarious alignments were discussed, and the final route was approved in 2010 (we were skeptical of the final routing). There was also a multi-year delay as the custom battery and regenerative braking technology was worked out.\n\nThe Aloha extension on Capitol Hill is currently on hold following lukewarm enthusiasm from the surrounding neighborhood. Today, the FHSC plods along, serving 3,000 daily riders. The city is doing work to speed it up a bit on Broadway, but the route remains slow and circuitous, jockeying for signal priority against higher-ridership E-W bus routes.\n\nBig Dreams\n\nIn 2008, just a year after the SLU line opened, the council passed a massive, unfunded streetcar expansion plan, with lines running to UW, Ballard, the CD and Queen Anne.\n\nThese were heady days for the national streetcar revival movement, which was questioned by many transit advocates but hard to ignore: American downtowns were booming, and the Obama-era Department of Transportation pressing their considerable fingers on the scales by shipping barrels of money to any city that raised its hand and asked for a streetcar.\n\nThe recession and a mayoral transition slowed things down, but Mayor McGinn’s 2011 Transit Master Plan envisioned potential lines to Ballard and the University District as well as Belltown and Uptown.\n\nAt the same time, the mayor and city council put a 10-year $60 Vehicle License Fee on the 2011 ballot. It would have provided capital funding for transit improvements, although council tried to insert a proviso preventing any money from going to streetcars. It ended up being moot, as the VLF failed at the polls that year. Streetcar expansion talk went on hold as the recession dragged on.\n\nThe Future: Center City Connector\n\nWith two separate streetcar lines serving different parts of downtown, conversation naturally turned to how we might connect them. In 2019 the Center City Connector will open, doing just that. The CCC will run on 1st avenue, though the 2011 TMP studied a 4th/5th couplet. The federal government will pick up just under half of the $166M cost.\n\nThe CCC Could have followed in the footsteps of the other lines and run in mixed traffic with low headways. To their credit, the city opted for 5-minute headways, center platforms and exclusive lanes. It means that, of all the streetcars built in America over the last decade, the CCC will be the highest performing as transit.\n\nWhile no one would ride the full system from end to end (it wouldn’t be possible, even if you wanted to), certain segments will find an audience. The straight-ish section from SLU to the ID via Pike Market and Pioneer Square serves a diverse set of residential, business, and leisure destinations. With trains every five minutes at peak on the main trunk of the route, and dedicated right-of-way, it ought to be reasonably popular. Estimates are around 25,000 riders per day, which might be optimistic.\n\nOnce the CCC is finished, it’s hard to imagine another line getting built. Light rail’s future is more certain, reducing the need for quick fixes. Local streetcar skepticism has increased, and the feds have more or less turned off the cash spigot. The deadly interplay between streetcar tracks and cyclists is problematic as well.\n\nThere’s a strong argument that streetcars are a waste of money and we ought to, in Bruce’s words, focus on keeping the buses moving while we built out grade-separated subways. In that view, it’s probably best to stop spending money on streetcars and just fight for the best ST3 alignments and exclusive bus right-of-way (ROW).\n\nBut streetcars seem to have a mystical ability to secure federal grant funding and exclusive ROW that would be otherwise unavailable to buses. To wit, the Center City Connector will have exclusive right-of-way for 25,000 riders from day one, while 3rd Avenue, which has been carrying 100,000+ bus riders every day for many years, has only partial bus priority. Politics is weird sometimes.\n\nThe best case for streetcars is that they create the political space to take right of way for transit, albeit at a high cost. Such a high cost, in fact, that paying for them generally requires supplemental funds from outside the city’s budget (i.e. the feds, Sound Transit, Paul Allen). They are like the Christmas gift that you would never buy yourself, but that’s just useful enough that you don’t it return to the store. Merry Christmas and Happy Anniversary, Seattle Streetcar!",
  "latent_32717": "Some heavy hitters from the business world have climbed aboard the effort to build high-speed rail in Texas, a project that just a few months ago was threatened by opposition in the state Legislature.\n\nFort Worth fund manager John Kleinheinz, Dallas developer Jack Matthews and Houston entrepreneur Drayton McLane Jr. head the list of new investors who have agreed to chip in a collective $75 million to build the proposed Dallas-to-Houston bullet train system.\n\nTwo of those three men — Kleinheinz and Matthews — will serve on a board of directors for Texas Central Partners, a company formed to oversee the development of the proposed Texas Central Railway project. The company is Texas-based but has a partnership with Central Japan Railway to share bullet train technology in use on the Toyko-to-Osaka line.\n\nAnother related but independent company, Texas Central High-Speed Railway, is a promotional entity and is also overseeing the environmental and regulatory process for the project.\n\nSign Up and Save Get six months of free digital access to the Star-Telegram\n\n“This is a really big day,” said Fort Worth resident Tom Schieffer, a former diplomat and Texas Rangers baseball club president who is a senior adviser to the high-speed rail project.\n\nSchieffer said the project, which others have estimated could cost more than $10 billion, is still on track to open to the public possibly as early as 2021, although no actual start date has been announced. A federal environmental review of the project is underway and must be completed before construction can begin.\n\nThe rail line would provide travelers an alternative to flying between Texas’s two largest metropolitan areas. The trains would travel at speeds of roughly 220 mph, making it possible for riders to get to and from Dallas and Houston in roughly 90 minutes at a fare comparable to the price of an advanced-purchase airline ticket.\n\nA station would be built in downtown Dallas. Future connections to Arlington’s entertainment district and downtown Fort Worth are also being studied.\n\n“I think the fact that we’ve been able to go to the marketplace and raise $75 million to get high-speed rail going is extraordinary,” Schieffer told the Star-Telegram in a phone interview Wednesday. “For me it’s proof in the pudding that we can raise the capital needed to do this with a private company. If we can get this train built in Texas and financed privately, I think it is going to be transformational not only to the state but the country.”\n\nEfforts to stop the project\n\nThe moves come after Texas Central Railway survived numerous efforts during the legislative session earlier this year to slam the brakes on high-speed rail. Grass-roots groups mainly representing residents in rural areas between Houston and Dallas have sprung up in opposition to the plan, saying high-speed rail would cut through their pristine lands with little or no economic benefit — and those groups are continuing to speak out in public settings.\n\nBut efforts to pass laws banning high-speed rail fell short during the regular legislative session that ended June 1, clearing the way for investors to feel comfortable putting their dollars into the project, Schieffer said.\n\n“I don’t think anybody wanted to invest in a project that couldn’t be done,” he said.\n\n“The strong growth of our state’s economy and population requires significant infrastructure investments and I believe Texas Central will pay dividends for the state of Texas, its citizens and its environment for decades to come,” Kleinheinz said in a statement.\n\nMcLane, a former grocery supply and logistics businessman who for years owned the Houston Astros baseball club, added: “In Texas, we work hard, and we dream big. The Texas Central high-speed rail project connecting Dallas and Houston is transformational to Texas, and ranks as one of the most visionary solutions to future transportation challenges our state faces. I am honored to be part of this organization that is an opportunity of a lifetime and am confident Texas Central’s executive team, led by Tim Keith, has the right skills to turn this vision into a reality.”\n\nMatthews is Canadian-born but known for many area developments, including the new Omni Dallas Hotel in downtown Dallas, which is within walking distance of that city’s proposed high-speed rail station.\n\nTexas Central Partners also announced Wednesday that Tim Keith of Dallas is its new chief executive officer. He will be responsible for the finance, development, construction and operation of the rail line, according to the company’s news release.\n\nKeith has more than two decades of experience in real estate and infrastructure projects, including his role as global chief executive officer of RREEF/Deutsche Bank Infrastructure Investments.\n\nElected officials from North Texas were pleased with Wednesday’s announcement about new funding for the high-speed rail project.\n\n“Today’s news that investors from Fort Worth and across the state have joined the effort to connect North Texas to Houston by high-speed rail means that this bold vision is getting closer to reality each day,” Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price said in an email. “I have been to Japan and witnessed firsthand the comfort and sophistication of high-speed rail and look forward to the day when Texans have the opportunity to travel conveniently and safely between our state’s wonderful cities.”\n\nArlington Mayor Jeff Williams added: “As a member of the Commission for High-Speed Rail: Dallas/Fort Worth, I have been following the Texas Central project very closely. Today’s announcement is clearly an important one for Arlington, the North Texas Region and the entire state, as it demonstrates that high-speed rail is one important step closer to becoming a reality in Texas.”"
